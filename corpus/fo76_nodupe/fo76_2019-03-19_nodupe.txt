Would be nice if the game had a postmaster type thing like from destiny to where lost items would show up there 
---
---
---
No, quite old actually
---
I guess it'll be like : you can bring your character but you wont crush low level because of scaling like in ESO pvp (It's been said in a bethesda french stream but not sure if it'll stay like they say)
---
Death Blooms Event for flower seed
---
I’m pretty much every Fallout game I play as a sniper character.
---
TSE is still good, but no where near as good as melee
---
yea same thing happened to me it's random reward
---
Or drills
---
nice. got my Arms plan from Savage Divine 
---
On my main character I built a warehouse and put all the crafting stuff behind my powered gate so it looked a few beds and water purifiers, nothing special. I made it look bland but when people would hit the button my Manta Man lair would open up. 
---
Where do you get chameleon armor??
---
BECAUSE WHAT IS THE POINT OF THEM BEING THREE STAR IF THEY DON'T DROP THREE STAR LEGENDARIES THAT'S LIKE OPENING AN EXOTIC ENGRAM AND GETTING A FUCKING BLUE
---
They make for a really cool and cooky story too
---
70 is not to far to turn it around. My first character I didn't really start looking at builds until I was in my 90's.  Just come up with a play style you are looking for, hop on a character planner and design away (or look at some pre-made guides).  Then use his guide to start grabbing levels. With just a few of the key damage perks you'll be surprised how fast you can level and as a bonus you'll already have a bunch of perks to get you started. Don't worry too much about correcting SPECIAL points until you have a good number of damage perks. Also, don't get three ranks of damage perks right off. Just get the three individual levels (normal, expert, master) that will be a quick 30% damage bump for 3 cards vs 60% for 9 cards.  You can get the final 6 cards as you near the end of your build.
---
No it just said “decorate your camp with items from your stash” I don’t see it on their roadmap image for wild Appalachia but it was in the inside the vault article about it so it’s a 50/50 chance we will get it and it not get pushed out. As far as I can tell I bet there will be problems with it but they have had what now 5 months to get it right. I expect people to be able to steal your stuff somehow same with the vendors. Vendors are what I’m really wanting because you can put your camp in the map for everyone to see so they know there’s a vendor there. 
---
Yes, and it's pretty damn powerful.  Nothing like dropping a Protection only to realize at the last second that it was Legendary, and now you're going to die.
---

---
I can't say that it always happens, though.  Sometimes it doesn't.  Other times, I see that Legendaries-that-aren't-Legendary bug where they don't explode, but also fail to drop any Legendary weapon at all.
---
From a treasure map?
---
It's alright, appreciate the help though!
---
Tesla Rifle!
---
yup
---
Someone moved their cheese
---
Found it https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps
---
They need some funky wallpaper designs. 
---
Ugh please. I would give anything to have my plants inside. I literally built floors around them in the past but I can't do that in my current camp. While we are on the subject, let us excavate. I want a basement but good luck finding a pre built hole for your foundation
---
Lv110 on pc, lv155 on xbox, and lv52 in real life ;)
---
Yeah, they have been. I think they might’ve messed around with the timescale of the game for fermenting, which would explain things spoiling and your hunger/thirst going down faster. 
---
I want a video from northwest corner to southeast corner!
---
I've had cool players do that, but generally helping me with these doesn't start by killing me and my team mate then following us around the map and purposely blocking objectives.
---
I hadnt even noticed that, but ill pay attention to it now. Thanks.
---
You act like 3-star legends are so much tougher or more special.  The Stars mean nothing, 3-star loot is rare. Oh well.
---
Looks like I am going treasure hunting!!! 
---
Yeah i got a couple its just that i dont have the vintage tick blood beer 
---
Can’t forget a Raider arm that grants you the ability to breathe underwater and yes, it was 3 star
---
It’s the mystery of it. You never know. 
---
super rare drop though, so save a whole bunch of them and start digging. happy hunting!
---
Sounds like you were permanently banned for going into the dev room?
---
Yeah it’s pretty sad, tbh I had no idea you could take animals??
---
I wouldn’t even second guess the Aliens for touching down on earth after the shit show that went down. Also I’m down for expanding the map, so that’s a yes from me dawg 
---
Yeah I’ve been in two nukes this weekend at Whitesprings and there was barely anything at the club house 
---
"Yes I cheated, because I can. No, you cannot punish me because I also played Morrowind and New Vegas."
---
Entering the dev room is not even an in game glitch. You need  to actively use cheat engines to do it. The changes made to your game files could well affect the rest of the server. So your account needs to be isolated.
---
correction, 5~ months, *thats so much better*
---
It could be 1 month and my point would have still been completely valid
---
Are you sure it didn’t just re-alphabetize due to adding (Known) to the front of it?  If they were listed as Recipe: and you used it they all would “disappear” but not really.  They just reorganize.  
---
Today I received the recipe for Oak Holler Lager... needs Thistle...
---
welp
---
Go to Garrahan Mining Headquarters on the bottom of the map.  There's a quest in there to get it.
---
do you need all 10 to get good rewards? i dont quite understand how the work because the few locations i know i had correct had nothing... not even containers.
---
sounds like its only doubling your damage. from what I can tell watoga robots have like 400 or so hp
---
I mean it makes sense. If you think about the series getting fans way back in 97... fun times in this game. 
---
Looks lovely, mate
---
Is the extra carry capacity with excavator armour just because the Calibrated Shocks are easier to get?
---
It's really hard to dedicate as much time as we have, when theres not even things to kill. That's the point of the game. Cant fight things and get loot if theres nothing to fight. 
---
I get that the playerbase may have bern acquiring loot faster than intended... but the majority of people, just wanna get on and play...and its getting really hard to enjoy 
---
Do stupid shit, get punished respectively. 
---
If 3 star mobs drop 3 star legendaries, they should significantly increase the difficulty of 3 star mobs.
---
*whispers*  ....... It's free real estate
---
[removed]
---
Yeah try sneaking against the SBQ
---
Nope. They are gone my dude. 
---
I totally got Small Letters Set while defending Sunshine food factory that a teammate owned. crazy random it appears
---
I thought of myself as an older player.  But I have been pleased to see more than seventy+ mentioned on these pages.  Gives me hope that I will still have the acuity and dexterity necessary to play once I am retired.  
---
Hey man, if I ever find you or you see me in the forest, can we become friends?
---
The kind we've been begging for!
---
thistle is easy it's in savage divide
---
Thanks! You're a legend! (get it get it har har)
---
Ok it would make sense if the camp shelves behave like bobblehead stands, if they simply had a way to display an item placed in them.  That would prevent theft and would allow items to be displayed in a controlled manner.  
---
As for the rest .. yeah.  Share your concerns.  It would be nice if there was a way to choose whether to advertise your camp on the map (50 atoms a week advertising charge? ;) because some campers would prefer to keep their location secret, whereas if there's no way to advertise, omg the space around whitesprings is going to be even more crowded.
---
ok, I only ever found 1 and I took some time to look a little further but had no luck.
---
Dude gamer here. Also an adult. The only time I have a problem gaming with the opposite sex is when I feel like they are trying to use it to thier advantage. More than once I've run into someone that is turning on the effected girl gamer voice in area and more often than not are being followed by a bunch of hapless dudes following her around offering up ammo / gear etc.  That being said I have a couple of cool cat gamer chicks in my friends list that just like to get shit done.
---
Glad you've found the community accepting and more importantly NOT toxic!
---
Sounds like you need a contract bounty hunter 
---
Watoga has four potential power armour spawns just outside also
---
Learn from your mistake.... Keep pacifist mode on at all times
---
There's a bunch up by wavy willards
---
Thank you
---
Just saying, It’s happened to me and my teammates “What, it used them all!”   A short time later “oh, new name, duh.”
---
You’d just fly in circles though.
---
Geez yeah. I was at an event yesterday and I got this 3* legendary super mutant down to one last hit for the other person doing the event and all I got was a drill. Not even a legendary drill. I haven’t been getting good legendaries at all (not like I even got good ones in the first place but an anti armor 50 cal is pretty sweet) 
---
ah ok, thank you very much! there is something else i wanted it for too, a drug i think.
---
I wouldn't know because I can't login to see the ticket, that's part of the issue. No official notification was given.
---
Yup, don't need to be a bank per se, just need a special "Shared Stash" box with say perhaps only 100 stash limit, but the items in that particular box is shared between all characters on the account. Would be easy and another 100 items space shared between all characters would not be much.
---
I have a heap of maps and haven't collected any yet. Hopefully I get some BoS plans out of it! 🤞
---
They just reset 20 minutes ago.  Did you check Nuka crypt?   May need some more time. 
---
Yes I cheated, because I could. Yes, I have been punished. Playing Morrowind and New Vegas was added because I have been a paying customer for many years who should at least be told what is going on with my account. The issue is I can't even log in to find out. Again, they could remove Fallout 76 from my account or delete the characters if they wanted to and be 100% justified - I'm not disputing that.
---
they might have engaged him
---
Gonna need a bigger turret budget
---
Thanks for the tip though.
---
Don't be afraid to shoot back! The damage mechanic that evens out the levels isn't too terrible and you might even kill him! Folks get too intimidated by high level folks but there isn't as much difference as you might think.
---
Still could be better, could have had +40% power attack damage instead. 
---
I am holding out for the day that Blackbird returns. I don't like my chances.. 
---
They did. I was trying to clean up my stuff at the Billingsley workshop and one ran up with a sledgehammer, started to claimed the workshop then 1 shot me, hasnt been fun
---
But then you'd just go back and cheat again.
---
Holy crap... what if killing the boss had a chance to drop the plans for alien turrets????
---
I have Ultracite, and most of x-01.
---
Excavator armour now has +200 carry weight now I have managed to make shockies for both legs.
---
Why would I want PA that doesn't let me carry more than 50 more than my deep pocketed normal armour? (Which gets removed when I climb in)
---
This is awesome! Love it
---
There's already a response to bans.....
---
"Hahhahahahaababbaaba…..... Enjoy"
---
Yours truly
---
Me.
---
One guy was 73 
---
You didnt know that you went into the dev room? Did your character take a stroll inside it while you were offline? 
---
It’s my custom ini. I made the not so well known potato.ini file. I’m not using it, but apparently it’s existence displeases my scopes and sights. 
---
Totally agreed.  You using pipe?  Yeah.  Why? Cos I know how VATS works.. wanna see? ;)
---
I use the X01 quantum painted power armor because it proves I can follow instructions on YouTube and know how to server hop.
---
I bet the Vim paint job will be in one of the tnt domes. I’m excited for that 
---
Ill take it still, that's about on par with my tse handmade that has 102 damage.
---
Concentrated Fire.
---
if there is one weapon that should be in the Fallout arsenal it's the Whitney Wolverine  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Blm6-H\_j84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Blm6-H_j84)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Or, I could choose not to? I wanted to see the dev room, it's not the worst thing I could have done. Removing Fallout 76 from my account is preferable to not being able to access my entire Bethesda account. Even then, if this is the system for people who get banned, I hope you never get false positived.
---
Very interesting I’m sure it took a long time to line up that bridge location
---
I mean, I killed the scorch beast queen and all I got was a 3* board.... not even a good one... and a lab coat. So I got a lab coat from the queen? That's something I guess. 
---
We'd really need a lot of emotes to properly communicate. I don't think we are getting. The system is what it is. If you can't communicate your thoughts in few second, just don't.
---
&gt; I just want to be able to tell you to go help someone else without having to turn my mic on and wake up the rest of my household.
---
You can also "roleplay" not having one. Im sure if you ignore someone they will eventually pick it up. If someone wants to give you stuff and you want to ignore it, you can give them .38 ammo. Im sure it helps.
---
&gt;I'm low level because I don't feel the need to power-grind up to the high levels where apparently content runs out.
---
I don't think it does. Im at level 171 and I've yet to go join or fully explore Enclaive. On my level ~37 I've been there a bit. One of the things Im going to do, when I join with my main, is to farm them all. On my low level I'm not been even able to try. I've been keeping the fire breather final test on bay. I got maybe half or little below half of map markers explored. I've done nothing to the Mistress of Mystery questline. Over level 150 I finally got the excavator armor but I haven't yet went to mine with it. Which is what it's great at. I wish they'd fix the weight glitch on it to be less compelled to use it.
---
At current rate Bethesda is pushing out new side quests and events about the same rate as I'm completing them. I guess it comes to no huge surprise I've been close, but not yet quite there, at the new quest start. The attend frat party or whatever it is.
---
People rush through all the quests. It goes fast if done that way, and gives you very little. Then go to farm legendaries or SBQ and probably find it repeative and boring eventually. 
---
It's true, you have to be able to enjoy just exploring, to ignore the quests. Im not saying anyone can do that. But I think prior Fallouts have been good practice. The maps are pretty large.
---
Yeah...it showed an empty suit on the hud
---
Heavy Weps + Stabilized Perk = preference for power armor.  Beyond that yeah, don't see the point.
---
Flowers, plants, etc are all individual. So that's not possible. 
---
That's true, but the main quest directs players towards the top of the world quite early on, which causes the majority of the low-level encounters with high level enemies I believe. If a player follows the main quest closely without deviating too far to follow side quests, they spend very little time in the Ash Heap and potentially never go towards Grafton at all. It's pretty easy to wander up the mountain at level 15 and encounter SM warlords.
---
It's not a huge problem, I agree. But improvements could be made in certain areas. Maybe the game could be a little more clear that you should probably level up and get stronger before moving on from the fire department. 
---
Ive tested it personally with a bolt action pipe, not sure about others but dont see why not
---
If you're on PS4, I have one I'll sell you for 300 caps. 
---
Slap damaged him in the back.  You either misinterpreted or misrepresented..
---
Usually means someone else has generated a new key in the meantime
---
Did you even read the full post? Yeah, I freely admit to going in the dev room. Being banned would be fine - problem is I have no idea what is going on because they haven't said anything. You get a ticket, you can't check the ticket if you can't log in.
---
And they should be a 3 star challenge too. 
---
Hey man if you are on pc i can come kill both for ya
---
My CAMP is 4x5, entirely concrete foundations, and mole rats spawn inside the building all the time.
---
I've tried both and settled on the Lever Action as the best balance between power and speed.   I actually prefer a Quad lever action because with Adrenal, you do enough damage to take out most anything regardless, and 20 rounds in a lever action is more valuable than 5 rounds with yet more damage.
---
I feel ya, I don’t need this many scribe uniforms.
---
You seem to be mistaken and think you are owed something because of your past loyalty. 
---
You cheated and got gotten. 
---
Do something and something happens. That’s how life works.
---
workshops can be rough.  You COULD still destroy them at a low level but it would require a lot of appropriate gear. (probably a bloodied handmade or something and assasins/sentinal gear to be safe)   
---
Anyway I would avoid pvp unless you're geared up to do so.  If someone contests your workshop just let em have it.   Clear out the harvester inventories frequently (fast traveling back to an owned workshop is free) and bank your junk.  
---
I have the opposite problem, actually. I'm a [heavy weapons/power armor dude](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f373e86&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s22ic4ip2ih2id2s72ls2lt2a04pe2cu2sg2eh2e12e60&amp;w=e00es2c52ik0e82at1lm2iq2p90p80pa0&amp;n=Hevy%20Waponz), and once I figured out an efficient acid farming route (it involves killing TONS of Snallygasters and Grafton Monsters), I now have ammo literally coming out of my ass. Since the patch, my guns are no longer made of paper. I am drowning in junk. My stash is capped. I'm trying to burn through fusion cores, but I keep finding them faster than I can deplete them. I accidentally stumbled into a nuke zone without protection and got the Healing Factor mutation, so now I got all these stimpacks I'm not using, and vendors don't have enough caps to buy up my supply.
---
Somebody please help.
---
Saw this shady looking camp, decided to pose next to it. No clue what sitting down does.
---
There are players that MAY have been banned despite their innocence. Collateral damage in a ban wave...maybe. They might feel aggrieved and frustrated at the lack of communication regarding temporary bans.
---
But that’s not you...you did something very deliberate, and Bethesda has decided that they don’t want people who do that to be anywhere near their games. That is their prerogative and a decision that was not taken likely, I’m sure. 
---
Now you want them to go out of their way to communicate individually to people who have shown a blatant disregard for the rules? They don’t owe you anything other than what they’ve already said: Bans will be in force at least until the developers are confident that cheating/duping methods are dealt with.
---
You are barking up the wrong tree if you’re looking for sympathy.
---
Maybe next time you’ll think twice.
---
I know that for a while there was a problem with picking up stacks of missiles and grenades off of enemies where anything over three (or something like that) would add ghost weight to your character that you couldn't get rid of. I don't know if they ever fixed it.
---
Silo Bravo Code Piece P-5
---
Chances are they didn't, they wanted to engage in pvp with someone and gang up on them. At level 27, you were a perfect target for people like them.  
---
What do I think I'm owed? A response? Yeah. My Fallout 76 back? Not necessarily. My characters? I would expect them all to be deleted.
---
Maybe someone has extra tequila? I know I've been making extra Nukashine as I almost always have quantum bottles. 
---
You know what you did and why you got banned. What is the response for?
---
Why didn’t you just sit down on the chair?
---
Yup 
---
https://youtu.be/U2TD3Yz62XM
---
Agreed. Not everyone wants to power level and it does take commitment. But with new stuff around the corner there's been a number of posts from people asking how to level up fast.
---
I started a new character almost completely fresh a month ago and didn't buy a good gun till level 80. Mostly leveled up with explosives simply because I didn't have a decent weapon. Once we get player trading, making a newer character is going to be much less tedious.
---
Don't forget sealed glass jars.  When scrapping the sealed jars themselves, they only give glass.  But when you find the small, or large glass jar lids, the lids give aluminum.   Some of the scrapping things in 76 still don't make a lot of sense.
---
Don't forget flip lighters.  Flip lighters give 1x oil, 1x steel, 1x spring.  Gold plated flip lighters give 1x oil, 1x steel, and 1x gold, but no spring.  Where the hell did the spring go?
---
It chew through hordes of low level enemies, the arching can sometimes pull you into unwanted pvp though. 
---
Silo Charlie Code Piece G-5
---
Why do you think they owe you a response? Did you not agree to abide by their TOS when you installed the game?
---
For NPC enemies, the visual sneak effect isn’t the thing that they “see”. Chameleon gives a 20% buff to your “stealth rating”. That’s per piece. 
---
So does agility though, so playing a sneak sniper it usually pays massive dividends to just go all in with a low health build, stack up on Unyielding equipment, and get a significant stealth bonus from having 15 extra agility.
---
The extra strength for carry weight, AP from the agility, and crit gain from the luck is all awesome, especially if you go in for a VATS build. Extra intelligence means leveling faster too, and the bonus charisma will help with your buying and selling. 
---
Cheating/duping is dealt with at this point, in better ways than I would have even thought possible given previous response times. My concern is exactly what is being banned. It isn't Fallout 76, it is your entire Bethesda account.
---
Me too! I’m on PC and located up the hill from the Whitesprings golf clubhouse. Drop by, use the workbenches, take a nap or play some musical instruments. The neon Filthy Casuals and Welcome Home signs will guide you in. 
---
What they say about workshops is true, in my experience though, I haven't been killed outside of a workshop. I think I have had one contested only once and I let it fail. I never got killed by another player for it. I take a workshop pretty much any time I play and once I have gathered resources 2 or 3 times I really don't care if someone else takes it.
---
Im having the same problem, the only quest that worked for me a couple of weeks ago was Idle explosives, now i cant trigger any of them. 
---
There is a challenge in the game titled “kill an alien”
---
It has pretty much always taken a second to render. What’s changed is it doesn’t START to render until you exit your Pip-Boy. 
---
All these kids haven’t learned that their actions have actual consequences yet. 
---
For sniping I’ve got unyielding sentinel with a chameleon sentinel piece.  Usually try to avoid any type of close-quarters combat so it ideal.
---
Uninstall, download Fallout 4. Have fun. 
---
Gimme ya down doots. 
---
There are not containers - it is a treasure - you have to dig at a mound on the ground. You don't need a shovel. 
---
Before that we were playing Wasteland on the Apple IIe.
---
My T51 complete set has better stats then any X01 or prototype that I have come by yet 
---
Most dailies are still bugged, in my 400 hours of gameplay, I probably did "Queen of the Hunt" only once or twice.
---
Glad to see I'm not the only one, hopefully they address this soon. 
---
💯 agree with above. Chameleon is a must it seems, maybe a fast hand to hand, or a strong medium speed?
---
Thank you. This is all I ask for. People like to hate and be assholes because they can. I mostly ignore/block them and keep trying to make the game better for others. Frankly I'm flattered that these people hate me so much that they feel the need to complain on every post I make. 
---
Yeah im just past 600 hours myself it's a shame it's bugged. 
---
No, it’s just another thread where someone thinks differently.  😁
---
lols sorry that was a joke what I was meaning was I carry everything I need + loot then when my friend in his x-01 armor is over encumbered he hands it off to me I was making the joke I had enough free space after looting I could carry a 2nd players worth of loot and just joked about me stuffing his entire character in my backpack (inventory) 
---
This is literally all I want for this game. The main reason I keep running out of storage in my stash is because it's 90% clothes.
---
Silo Alpha Cod Piece K-8
---
It doesn't. Only excavator armor does and you need a full set. 
---
Sounds like a YOUR ps4 problem. That is definitely not the standard practice. 
---
Just a little bit but not even close to what it took with my previous camp http://imgur.com/gallery/wHuFbWd
---
I have plague  walker if interested , offer ? 
---
And the vault number would be vault....pause for suspense..... 51! *twilight theme plays*
---
I dozed off as I was going through here and did this. I panicked. 
---
I like how you know what all the factions represent without needing a codex. It's not just through members saying things, you can see what they were doing. Responders were waiting for the Vault to open, Brotherhood of Steel were running their missions out of Fort Defiance, etc. Certain other games could learn a thing or two from this.
---
Because I paid $60 for a game. Because I paid for a product. Because products come with customer support. You act like you read the ToS. Go ahead and lie to me right now and tell me you read the ToS in it's entirety. Yeah you don't need to read a ToS to know right/wrong, but that's not even the point. The point is that the current system for banned players is about the quality of the initial games release: working, but not great. [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) is a new DRM platform that needs these tools to handle this, even runescape had a proper system to handle bans. I wouldn't even need to waste their time if they would let me access my original ticket. I would prefer not to have had to waste their time at all.
---
Only the ingame one where you can send team and friend invites. No messaging of any kind.
---
This is from the same person as "Deathclaw Maze" this creator is amazing
---
Yeah such a shame, getting the event outfits for the region wouldnt be so much of a damn chore if all the dailies were dailies
---
Whatcha want for it? 
---
We don’t know that. No one outside of BGS can know how much they’ve uncovered and what they’re working on...but that’s not the point, is it?
---
Like I said, looks to me like they’ve decided they don’t want you as a player of ANY of their games, at least for now anyway.
---
If I owned a chain of grocery stores, and someone was known to have shoplifted items from one of them, should I not be entitled to ban this person from all of my stores?
---
Well the frame adds strength, but you wouldn't notice it if you had other gear on that also adds str (because it would replace it)  - However, power armor in general has the modifcation for legs called calibrated shocks.  Those would at +50 to carry weight each leg. Also excavator armor adds 100 carry weight, I think you have to wear the full set though. 
---
I'm under the impression that it increases your carry weight up to strength 10. So if your strength is higher than that, it won't raise your carry weight. But I could be wrong. 
---
Oh yeah. I stumbled into a Liberator Horde event in the Ash Heap earlier. The boss buzzed at me, I put a bullet through its soulless communist chassis, we both died.
---
Then later I ran into *another* legendary liberator. Having learned my lesson, I kept a safe distance when I blew it away. Problem was, the explosion literally blew it away, as in it sailed off into the distance like Team Rocket, never to be seen again. Atom knows what juicy legendary drop it had for me.

I think it was called Punturing Mod for Pole Hook. I found it earlier today at the BOS vendor inside Morgantown. 
---
I can make whatever you want for 200 caps a piece
---
Yeah. I'm not sure whether it's caused by chain-staggering the queen in the air, or because it can't find a landing spot near the player it focused. Either way, moving a bit and leaving it alone seems to fix it.
---
Before patch 6 you could easily kill a queen stuck in hover mode, but now it's a waste of ammo.

Seems like the banning system is doing ok. You cheated —-&gt; got banned. Looks fine to me.
---
Leg mods allow+50 per leg.
---
I believe it's calibrated shocks
---
Is this really necessary considering the expanded budget? You should have plenty of room to create a 3x3 or more grid of foundations, leaving at least one center square exposed to dirt; that let's you effectively wall off your plants and small purifiers in a building you can lock. Heck, you could even create a locked room within your main building if you wanted to be accommodating to people in need of workbenches / sleep / instruments.
---
11 and if you already have strength at that or higher it does nothing.
---
Wait nevermind youre on ps4. My mistake
---
Idk saw this shit in the new section and felt like trolling a bit. I'm sorry that you guys like paying $60 for games that are worse than f2p games lmao. 
---
In the mean time, i'll try to find some myself. Maybe after a nuke...
---
Lmaooo
---
I like the flag I have on my wall
---
Shoplifting would actually be stealing from them. What do you think I got in the dev room? Nothing of monetary value. They did not just decide they don't want me playing any of their games, this would more than likely be the result of poor design.
---
If your determined to obtain it yourself, there are lists in the enclave of which plants become which color (can also find online). Find an area that has those plants and nuke it.
---
Option 2: Server hop looking for nuke zones.
---
What?
---
Looks awesome, this should be a new creature in the wasteland. A two-headed snake which blends with the environment, 10 meters long. Skin slightly less durable than a Scorchbeast. When killed it drops a flare gun and some crossbow ammo
---
I've seen something similar on XBO. It will look like I have one option highlighted (say, "Promote to Team Leader"), but when I select it, it really selects the option under it (say, "Block for Session"). It's one reason I always ignore unsolicited requests to team up. If I don't know the person, I assume they only accidentally invited me instead of whoever appeared on the menu above me.
---
I heard that the Fleetwood monster completes that. If you look inside its helmet there is a zetan in there. 
---
That's more a glitch than 'someone stealing the plants' which we know isn't possible.  Had you planted them in some way to get around game limitations?  Like the way people have planted crops on camp fires?
---
I believe they have stated they are looking into it. Dont remember where I saw it, but it's one of the things they are looking at.
---
Yeah  but that’s unlikely since there are many different craft-able beer
---
Try a database rebuild. 
---
Why a flare gun and crossbow ammo...?
---
I seen youtuber do vids on rug, foundation, and campfire bugs. Why would they fix a bug that allowed us to make cool camps without adding stuff to be those features. Dam wish I made something cool before they fixed it.
---
I don't trust randoms enough to not find it and take it. My camp is pretty close to Watoga. It's by the substation just north of it. Good for a junk extractor and Deathclaw farming.
---
I have nothing to add. Bethesda.... you know what to do.
---
I noticed this too and meant to post it because I haven’t seen it around here. 
---
I started fresh about a month ago. I made my build before I started and had the intent to only use explosives and shotguns. The only things I got from other players for leveling was Grenade recipes, Excavator Armor, shielded underarmor and mutation serums. I believe shotguns are without question the best way to level up. Close range headshots usually kill anything while leveling up. Plus most of the enemies you kill at lower levels are scorched and mole miners you get tons of shotguns for mod scrapping. Great entry level weapon.
---
I did all of the Responders quest line in The Forest and The Ash Heap at early levels. They send you to a good amount of areas that are great for early levels. This and events around these regions got me to level 20 pretty quickly. Plus I primarily tried to farm materials to craft grenades while doing the early levels.
---
I mostly gained my experience in large bursts. I could spend a few hours farming quests and materials for grenades and aid. Then spend an hour using all of the things I crafted/collected to farm Whitesprings. The actual Whitesprings part could easily get 5-10 levels depending on how many grenades/aid you get. While the farming/crafting part would often be only a couple levels.
---
This always happens in every game. I wish there was a way that songs would only play again when every other song has as well. I can’t tell you how many times Johnny guitar plays in NV for me. It’s seems to cycle between big iron and that one only
---
So.... Did you do it? 
---
With all due respect, you’re kidding yourself.
---
If I were you, I’d take my medicine and go play something else.
---
The latest patch added a Nuka Quantom paint job at the end of a very complicated set of steps. It’s also basically unique pr server instance, so it kind of sucks to try and get right now
---
What happens when I access my ticket? I wouldn't know because I can't. The issue isn't about me getting banned. I obviously know what I did. It's the scope of what is being banned. Why would my actions in 76 affect my ability to play other games? If I buy an offline game on their store, I would have lost access. Imagine if Steam did this. You misbehave in one game, maybe get flagged and banned for something as dumb as harassment, but you don't just get banned from 1 game, you lost access to your entire library.
---
Alpha - P 8
---
Weekly reset I would assume. 
---
Given how easy it is to make caps they likely have brewing as a cap sink. I bet we will see more cap sinks in the future.
---
I honestly would stick to a higher level character. It is much much easier to respec at higher levels than to start fresh. The power level of low level characters is remarkably terrible. Even with basic perks at level 50+ it's still easier than a new character.
---
no i have 3\* bloodied power fist with 40% faster swing speed and +1 str
---
The highest star item I got from anything was the scorch beast queen and it was a nocturnal assassins fucking rolling pin...
---
OP is just talking about chassis increase. As in no armor or mods. 
---
Confused to be a black paint coming for it in the Atom Shop. Not sure when but im gonna snatch it up as soon as it drops. 
---
X01 is far from a pvp build to be fair
---
It's just a joke because Scorchbeasts are tedious to kill yet the rewards they drop are often useless
---
Sorry, stand-alone keypad?
---
Nukacrypt doesn't have any of the nuke codes up for the week, so you're going to have a hard time finding a nuke zone right now, let alone one with violet flux. If "pure" means stable, I have some I can give you. Let me know if you're interested.
---
So, Chameleon over Unyielding?
---
Again, it’s prob in the ToS. I didn’t read it because I don’t cheat so I would have no reason to. They probably want to keep known cheaters away from their other games too. And now that they have their own launcher they can do it. It’s their prerogative, just like deciding to cheat was yours.
---
Nuka is only plan you can get otherwise they’re in the atom store 
---
That’s what I was wearing. Not him I’m the level 115 he was only level 70 or something 
---
Same here. Seems like every day when I load the game for the first time I have to adjust the volume back to normal. It'll be good the rest of the day but then the next day it's back to 0 volume when I load back in.
---
I would’ve really liked to see the plots over the bulldozer feature that clears objects when I place things. Maybe in a future update.
---
Ive seen this before but with other items. It seems like they get darker, or even turn black when its night time. 
---
At least you got a 3-star legendary, I got a 1-star fire axe from the queen today. 
---
Get the awareness perk to see what his defence is....then probably blast him with a radiation gun/grenades
---
Lay some radiation mines, lure him over them and shoot them and he will die 100%
---
Thanks a bunch, this sub has got my back 
---
I play a sneak sniper. I got the [Perfect Storm](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Perfect_Storm) after lvl 50 and have it upgraded with most of the mods for my close quarters weapon. It does pretty well. If the smg cant handle it, I switch to a fully modded lever rifle with my rifleman perks and crouch to get the 2.5X bonus. 
---
This is me as well. I've been bugged this way for at least a month, I keep trying but stuck exactly the same way, the crap thing is that i need the bloom for another quest now...
---
I am playing something else. I don't even care about Fallout 76 at this point. This is about how 1 game affects your entire Bethesda account. [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) is a brand new store for a longtime gaming company, this is something that will come up more often. People here are seem fixated on trolling me, but I'm sure I'm not the only one.
---
Man. This was the perfect example of the way the game was intended to and should be played.
---
This is what would happen in a waste land. Someone annoys you, you provoke them, it turns into a gun fight.
---
Both players consented, that's like the perfect situation.
---
Atleast to me, this is amazing and very roleplay like. Love it. 
---
Ouch... just ouch... I just dont understand why they would make it so unprofitable to do the things we are there to do... the legendary lootpool was already so random and hard to get much of anything end game useful, that I just dont get it. 
---
It's not the game to have us trying to min max and tailor gear and weapons for each individual encounter. 
---
Biv's Nuka cola door from nukashine speakeasy
---
I cannot wait for this game to come out and play it in it's finished state. Do stimpacks heal damage or do they need to patch that in after updating the atom shop again this week?
---
It's still in your atomic shop list (as "owned") but it doesn't show in the photomode. I'm pretty sure they just forgot to add it to the photomode for the wild appalachia patch.
---
I guess I could try. Any idea where to start? Or just google it?
---
thanks!
---
I'm an Aussie PC gamer! My Bethesda ID is the same as my Reddit username. I definitely recommend trying your mic :) I met quite a few friendly players that way.
---
From what other games? Fallout Shelter? lol. I'm not even talking about playing their other games as much as I am just being able to login to their website to check my ticket status, use the forums, respond to people who have messaged me, whatever. You know, things you don't cheat with?
---
I get the point your trying to make that a lot missed. Do I have a permanent ban? Yes? Ok life goes on. But we don’t know. 
---
What gets me is the full account suspension and not just 76. That means if your like me and have say pending orders from the store you can’t see them and know what might might be going on with your actual bank account. Or if you want to buy merch you can’t log in to do so. 
---
I killed a 3 star goul, got a drill.
---
You mean you don't like killing 3* things that are level 64 or 81 and getting a 1* wood auto stim left arm lv25?
---
Cool. I appreciate it. I’ve just seen some people walking around with these black looking X-01 PA paint jobs and they’re sick. Just didn’t know if I could find one too. 
---
You're the reason people tell everyone not to claim workshops. Scum and scumlord are right. If you're going to contest, just do it, don't bail and repeat to farm caps. Its a bad as duping - possible, but obviously not intended. 
---
Oh no it's the pool from the Sims again.
---
The slapping was an invitation to fight, I'm sure OP wouldn't have continued shooting if the dude kept running. Stop seeing griefing everywhere.
---
Just an honest question about unyielding and it’s popularity. For a rifleman +3 special is pretty negligible except for a little more AP and a little better VATS accuracy. Plus some carry weight. The trade of is that you MUST have low hp all the time. 
---
Arguably +3 perception isn’t gonna make a huge accuracy change if I already have 15, right?
---
So Why is that so popular above all other possible legendary mods?
---
There are alien enemies in games files
---
The new nuka quest isn’t that hard, the hardest thing about it is the very end when you have the dome key and there’s no plans. 
---
You might get lucky but plan on server hopping a few times and you’ll get it! 
---
I am level 102 and still haven’t launched a nuke.
---
If I never finish the story I never finish the game right? I can play it forever right ? What the fuck else do I play? Anthem? Division 2? Fuck no. 
---
So, is it better than the best rifles?
---
It is pretty weak though, you can get almost as much as my x01 just from stacking 15 agility and picking up the END perk as well, all which doesnt break(not that PA has durbility problems) 
---
I still use PA because its "fun" but yeah it sucks.
---
Yesterday a three star glowing ghoul dropped a (wait for it) ... commemorative coffee cup.
---
I think its called the switch keypad or something its essentially the small switch pylon with a keypad on it
---
I have a switch blade lv50 with +40% speed bonus, vampire, +1 str.  
---
It was my first 3\* weapon when I was lv42 on my first character.  
---
Needless to say that my character is invincible in PA. I should add that it turned down the game a little to me since, well, everything dies in one/two shot with all the good perks and almost always full life. Even scorch beast die easily in a single landing and.even deathclaws lv90+ are a joke.
---
Yo what's the name of it, I want 300x melee damage if they fix that
---
Maybe so but they're cordless!
---
Loot from legendarys and event rewards are notoriously weak. Just lvlup perks is all that you can do for fun in fo76
---
The flatwood monster is a zetan. You can see it through the mask. Is that what you are talking about? 
---
OHHH my bad! I thought the post said that you were selling the actual serum. Are you selling the serums by chance, or do you just have the recipe?
---
For some reason the flames paint job was on an xo1 in an e3 trailer but isn’t in the game
---
It says “don’t step on snek” and has a funny looking snake on it 
---
Cool. I’ll start now. That sounds awesome! Thanks!
---
What system are you on? Iv been thinking of trying to start up a transfer service on my nights off for people. Hard part now is gaining karma and trying to gain the trust that I won’t steal from people. There would always be a risk but a lot less than dropping stuff and logging out. 
---
Leave me alone I have disorders go make fun of someone elses mistakes
---
Upcoming "limited time" atomic shop super features!
---
Huuuuuuuuh. Under power components?
---
yes unfortunately this has been like this for a while now  i have 2 different pieces that have that as a 3rd 
---
What platform? I got the t60 bos knight paint plans earlier today on PS4. 
---
Having a hard time completing tick blood tequila since I need flux.  Can I get a new quest after a day or am I stuck until I complete it?
---
I understand that.
---
But I was replying to you, directly.
---
That way there isn't lurker confusion.
---
Cause saying only the excavator can increase weight even confused me.
---
Thxxx
---
Well, sounds the same as +6 STR from Whisky, but for ballistic users.
---
It could bring all weapons to the same level, wich is what people have been asking for since day 1 :)
---
I reported this during the beta with a video and everything. These bottles must be hard to work with because they've been messed up since nuka world in fo4. Especially during the colter fight, I couldnt even see the arena because there were like 10 giant bottles stretching across the arena, clearly sized wrong.
---
I'm sure it's all random rolls as to how legendary items are created, but I find an amazing amount of pure crap before something useful.
---
Ps4
---
Wood wouldn't be terrible if you could mod/craft it. It's nest looking but totally unusable
---
I think it would "encourage" more attention... intended or not, it can appear to be ungrateful. Why not just pack up and leave server? That sends a clear message... 
---
I had this a Monogah Power Plant. I stepped out, and I was black, too. 
---
I beleave the plan that it's in is called advanced power connectors, but don't hold me to that I'm not good at remembering words.
---
Has anyone from Bethesda commented on this? Are they looking to fix it? 
---
Didn’t even have to read the bottom text to completely agree 
---
40+ here
---
YES! I'm up at Seneca and the uneven ground makes for ganky looking(floating) crop set ups. Bring back the squares! 👍
---
Alpha K 8
---
Its ridiculous this is down voted. Yes, we want interior walls but a brick wall inside can look really good too.
---
Isn't it the best PA though?
---
I just got the game hearing how it’s improved so I figured I’d give it a shot. It has booted me from the server twice now before I can even get out of the vault, have to remake my character all over again. I guess I’ll try rebuilding my database again and try again tomorrow. 
---
Just experimentation. I planted some melons at that industrial farm and then messed around, building a wooden structure, and then a few minutes later I noticed the melons were already ripe. I then did a little experiment with Green Thumb, continuously harvesting and planting melons. Within 20 minutes I had something like 50 melon plants there! 
---
The ones that AREN’T constantly hating on a game they don’t even own are pretty cool and nice. I wish all communities were like this. 
---
i didnt downvote
---
Nah, super easy to 1 shot someone in PA, best is full assassin sentinal, thats about 90% damage resistance, 92 with lone wanderer and 96 with serendipity
---
Noice!
---
Yep. I live in a lovely single family ranch with detached garage now. I’ve paid for my multi level hubris.
---
Genius. Seriously. I guess I better start saving my atoms...👍
---
I think it's something like this, yes. The fertility of the soil there, I guess! 
---
Other than Chameleon, Vanguard + Sentinel/Cavalier is actually more suited for a rifleman than an Unyielding + Sentinel armor although the former is incredibly rare to find. For bloodied builds, the latter is more suitable, that or Bolstering since radiation counts as health loss. Unyielding/Bolstering is generally more suited because it's more of an all purpose, you are going to get hit, no matter what, combine it with the right perks and you're incredibly hard to bring down when you're at less than 20%
---
Unless I'm missing something here, that's normal: all guns degrade when you shoot something with them, VATS or no. You might be confused because the Dragon is pretty flimsy - it's just normal for it to break down pretty quick.
---
I mean stuff like "Alien/Zetan Star Admiral", haven't checked it myself but extracting files right now.
---
This is true also love it when you kill the scorch beast queen end game boss btw and get a 2* reward 
---
You can also do this in the tops of some of the bigger buildings in watoga
---
Boy are you in luck in the update files there is atom shop stuff for a Black excavator skin
---
I made a four story tower once. Never again, 15 hours gone. It was only 3 by 3. 
---
I'd like them to add mannequins and can think of a few uses besides displaying outfits
---
Woah... I really hope that pans out.
---
I ended up switching over to the classical music station. I heard the freaking Mr. Sandman song 4 times tonight. 
---
They didn't care so much about their factory, but how many times do they have to tell you to STAY OFF THEIR LAWN!  Kids today 😁

"Get a Rope!" Too bad we don't have horses... bind them, put on the horse, toss the rope over the tree branch and tie it off, slap the horse on ass, and watch 'em swing. I feel a good western coming on.
---
I found one earlier today in Grafton, I don't recall if it was the vendor at the train station or the vendor in the building just as you enter Grafton town.
---
Most definitely!
---
The best around!
---
First wave in the beginning of January here. No appeal, no response. Still suspended. 
---
im not sure if it's something they know about or not hopefully so
---
What? I meant your comment was. I'm agreeing with you.
---
Oh yeah, I knew it rocked for melee bloodied builds especially. But it seemed like bit of a stretch to say it’s the best for a rifleman. 
---
This would be pretty cool... as long as they could be destroyed mid-air
---
Sorry, forget to add I run a bloodied build with adrenal reaction, nerd rage, etc.  so I’m goin to be at a low health level anyways.  My be lever does 636 damage, be Gauss is at 958, and be dragon is 1540.
---
Also, it’s +3 per piece of armor, so it’s really +12 in all the stat categories.  So I’m at 20 strength, 24 perception, 3 endurance, 18 charisma, 24 intelligence, 32 agility, and 27 luck.  
---
Be careful you can harmlessly unlock a safe or something and because it's apart of a workshop you get wanted.
---
I want my chainsaw! 
---
I am an A-10 warthog 
---
I did not, I planted them normal on flat open ground. My husband played the same day and his crops are all missing too. Must have been a glitch with the new dlc maybe.
---
I'll just place them behind every door
---
The dragon is normally like that. High dmg higher use on durability. 
---
What system you on?  If XBox I'll trade or buy.
---
We didnt get scared away by youtubers. Older folks are smart enough to find out for ourselves.
---
Lake Eloise in the south for sure
---
Dropping now let’s gooooo
---
When I was a low level leveling was much faster but I just did the main quests and that helped alot.
---
I don't understand! What kind of mad man.... How are we supposed to know what happens now? What are the chances we find that again? God damn it!!!!!! You Sir/ma'am are a monster. Is that just your camp? I mean even if it is WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS!  
---
I already done did learned it :)
---
Whats knight worth i just got that 
---
Junkies rolling pin one*
---
You got that paint from technical docs?
---
On xbox but thank you
---
Steeluminum 
---
God forbid that a company tries something new
---
Lvl 58, just turned 59. Love the game and I run with a great bunch of younger people.
---
Maybe u/Ladydevann or other com managers here can help us report this?
---
I've checked them both about a dozen times. I thought plans were static now. Thank you though I'll keep looking. 
---
Yea
---
It's pretty sad that Bethesda went with magic weapons in FO4 and F76. It really is Skyrim with guns.
---
What would happen if you couldn’t remove a wall and a friend destroyed it for you? I guess the game uses a placeholder wall for that space in case you chose to repair it, huh?
---
I'd pay some caps.  I have turned in 100 or so technical docs no luck.  Game I'd is FunsterMunster.
---
I see them a lot at the pleasant valley vendors
---
God forbid they stick to said new thing and make it 10x better than at launch 
---
It is a weekly reset. They reset on me mid silo, now I'm collecting them posting the fragments here to get on decrypted 
---
Xbox. That sucks that your on ps4 and you go that.
---
Yes! I have had so many issues with Overwatch's voice chat that I now refuse to use it unless I am playing with friends, or there is another woman in the chat. It is such a shame, I love meeting and talking to people. Fallout 76 has been a welcome change.
---
I turned in one today and was like whag the hell is this 
---
Yes, taking out 6 frames and placing them to find the right one can be a pain. The same issue when I am using Excavator and BOS T-60. I keep the Excavator with me just in case I get a good score of legendary weapons. However, when both are in my inventory, I need to place both of them to find the right one. This usually happens when I have to craft something.
---
Someone had suggested being able to rename things. I think it could lead to things showing up at Vendors with inappropriate names (unless they are erased on sale).  It would be nice to see the PA Frame (if completely the same armor) indicate it Power Armor Chassis (T-60).
---
You should be able to get a good 500-1k shells a run if it isnt pre looted. 
---
I understand that the 50 Cal is underpowered to make the game fair, but that's illogical and just dumb. How is a hunting rifle better than a mounted machinegun?
---
My fix is usually to put a weapons workbench right next to the power armor station, and slip a toolbox in to the cubby under the workbench. Looks like a functioning shop with tools and milling equipment that way. 
---
I do love that sub!
---
I like thinking of Fallout 76 as single player Fallout where you can occasionally run into and play with other people fwiw
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
Yeah
---
Considering the douchiness of your post I would like to take this opportunity to ask you to NOT POST HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT A DISCUSSION, OKAY?!?
---
Idunno. I just do my plastic runs, events, and help others defend their workshops. 
---
I have no need for workshops myself, so pacifist helps me defend theirs without hitting their stuff. 
---
They tried and failed. Let's move on and not make this mistake again.
---
Huh... so you’re saying I can use Verti-Bots with actual players on them as target practice? Cool! 
---
Well by itself, im not wrong. 
---
Just Google em, they're posted every week
---
They're making strides in improving the game, give them time
---
Oh bot are you late to the party man. The complaining was so last month! Got to r/anthem if you wanna complain.
---
When I was a low level getting building supplys was a pain so I'd do that.
---
Enjoy waiting i guess 
---
Why would you want a bloodied melee weapon though? Legit question since the last thing you want when you’re up close is a sliver of health. Makes more sense with a sniper rifle.
---
Since it’s basically worthless I’ll give you 10 caps
---
Is it a server disconnect or a blue screen to dashboard? You might also want to check your internet connection and/or wires. I've noticed that this game demands a very stable internet connection. 
---
This must be why I saw a Brahmin on a roof earlier.
---
Ah- that is very sneaky.
---
It would be dank to add pouches to PA similar to what we did in FO4 in the Automaton DLC with the bots. 
---
There's usually a typewriter, fan, and microscope in the flatwoods church. I snag them every time I'm on my vendor run, most people don't pick them up for some reason.
---
I'll do as I please. Got it?
---
[https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved)
---
It's not alot, but it's steady and easy
---
It’s not bailing, it’s initiating combat. Usually you don’t have to do this, because the person willingly fights back. Surprisingly, the pacifist is the extreme minority.
---
Yup still couldn't move the stair or anything being supported by it. You pretty much have to scrap the camp and try again.
---
Oooo and there can be another expansion where you travel to a mothership.  I know they did that in FO3, but this time instead of fighting Zetans, you're teaming up with them (or the ship's AI or something) to defeat Scorched Zetans before they figure out how to fly the ship to spread the Scorched disease to new planets.
---
Being apart of the younger group, I personally enjoy playing with more mature adults that the idiots in my age group. Met some pretty chill dudes.
---
Are they adding NPCs? Is the player count climbing? It's a failed experiment and should not be repeated.
---
You guys they literally just refreshed ... wouldn’t be asking 
---
I'll what ever I want. It's my right to speak my piece just like yours.
---
How do I upvote you more?
---
I personally believe NPCs are the weakest part of fallout 3 and 4
---
Sadly I have a feeling if they did add them itll be Atom shop exclusive.
---
I can only hope though. 
---
I was collecting armor, pimping it out, and trying to give it away. People would just leave it. I think they thought it was duped or something. My house is outside Watoga so getting PA is easy and PA mods are plentiful if you know where to look. I even pimped out lvl 15 Raider PA and left them at Flatwoods, and the train stations. 
---
Damn, that's awful. You wouldn't tolerate his disgusting behaviour so he destroyed your stuff?! This is exactly why women are hesitant to stand up for ourselves - because creeps retaliate! I am really sorry that happened to you. I am glad your friends have your back, and I hope the rest of your encounters with strangers have been a lot more pleasant. 
---
Have you ever heard of No Man's Sky? 
---
I mean I guess, but base defense isn’t the point of the post. It’s how to cap.
---
Our they just want to wait until the game is not as rough, and then sell planters in the atom store
---
got me all excited that they finally added in all of those mounted animal heads :-p
---
I run a few pieces of regeneration, chameleon, and the effect that boost when not moving. 
---
With all the rifle based perks maxed and the sneaks that follow. You can 1 shot mobs when needed and some. 
---
Granted I’m not pvp based either. I’d rather something to offer a challenge while being useful and not hold my hand every time I get in trouble. 
---
I’m level 50 trying to finish this quest, I would love some help if you’re up to it! 
---
Another failed experiment. I play Elite Dangerous.
---
Upper floors or foundations?
---
They do drop at your feet it just takes longer for it to drop now 
---
No it has more per standard. It has unlisted extra when you have all parts. And it has glitch where you have that extra as twice, than supposed. It's only effective when you start your game in it, as long as you are in it.
---
On vendor I've seen same time T-60 and excavator calibrated shock mods. Brought both, later got someone to mod the other excavator leg, and now trying to sell the T-60. Also brought a second T-60 shocks.
---
I've had excavator about a month now, sadly I've used it a lot too, because of that carry thing. Only now one leg has become red. It seems super durable. I can't see T-60 having any advantage besides jetpack or stealth field. Even though I used T-60 less, I had to repair it far more often. It's fairly cheap, but so is excavator.
---
And all PA is really strong outside of PVP.
---
Upper floors.
---
No way, José! I wasn't falling for it. No good can come from a glitched chair being advertised that prominently!
---
You just made my day.
---
I suspect we will see these fairly soon. 
---
Your lvl does not matter past lvl 50 - 55. Your wearing pve armor probably with a pve build too. You flag yourself for pvp then, You try for revenge after you get one shot and their pvp build is the problem? 
---
And my defense against that is to allow you to take it and make you pay the absolute max caps for the workshop and not get a pvp reward.
---
Not my CAMP. Sorry for being such a scaredy cat. 
---
I actually had a similar instance on Xbox. I was just starting out and was struggling getting ammo. A 68 year old gamer noticed I was running from mobs being fully out of ammo. We talked for a bit after he saved me, gave me ammo, and then walked with me all the way from the early locations to the ammo Depot. It was nice. I feel like older gamers are a demographic often forgotten. They’re generally patient, friendly, and full of charity. I definitely appreciate them as I grow older. Im oh 24 now, but I’ll be there one day. Maybe I can do the same lol. 
---
This dupe glitch was patched sadly, just wanted to comment just incase you didnt see :)
---
I feel your pain friend, I've literally never had any of the mire daily quests repeat for me. I've also experienced each of the specific quest issues you've had. one time Beckley just stood at the first hive after I killed the honeybeast till time ran out. I finally got so sick of dealing with it that I just bought the outfit, but pretty disappointing as repeatable quests is pretty much all I have left at this point. 
---
I don't mind the atom shop unless it is refurbished items from Fallout 4. I don't want to pay money for items I had in a previous installment.
---
I will say the same, never 40 or 50+ near vault 76. I am level 180. 
---
Any luck? Wiki said it was by the concession stands but I haven't found it anywhere.
---
you can farm the wendigo at the end of wendigo cave by using a jetpack or marsupial to jump to the ledge at the beginning of the cavern to skip down to the bottom.
---
The dialogue form fo4 still haunts me to this day.
---
Are they attached to a ladder? And what is the ladder attached to?
---
The full armor set gives +100 by default, +2x shocks (2*50) gives a total of 200 extra capacity.
---
You say 'lock' I hear 'target'
---
I'll keep that in mind.
---
That's right! You should be sorry. 
---
Naw I probably wouldn't have done it. ;) 
---
No one knows what that is...
---
Sometimes the game glitches and shows the legendary animation for one of your existing items when you get a new one. The Nukashine mission doesn't reward legendaries (or not that I've seen across a few characters). That's probably what happened to you and why you don't have two in your inventory.
---
At least pipe and pipe bolt lock. I don't remember if you can make pipe revolver rifle.
---
Waiting and ready, need any help?
---
Which silo and what was the code??
---
Oh I agree- my whole camp is one giant shop; (The Powerhouse^TM)
---
I just want that to make it look more badass. 
---
Yes multiple, another floor
---
Yeah, people are devious.

Nope I don’t revenge people. I got one shot and respawed nearby cause I wanted to get int the whitesping bunker. He tracked me down and killed me over and over 
---
Ah idk I just took one over where I had to clear out the enemies, and nothing was built from anyone before. Pretty fresh server as I got the VTU outfit on it also. I powered the machine up and never touched the terminal, and after a hour it only had stacked up 8 Blamco Mac and cheese, nothing else.
---
Wrong, we need a middle finger emote. 
---
Blue screen with a message that the program is corrupted.  Says to delete the program, then put the disc back in. This is what it's done EVERY TIME it crashes with each update.
---
I'm sure there's some truth to that.  An ability to keep things in perspective.
---
It's still better than the turd that Bethesda dropped on us. I'm ready for my refund. I gave them time and the damn thing is still broken and poor quality.
---
Yep turning off pacifist mode is a pain in the ass :) Once that's off though, a locked door is a couple of seconds to defeat.
---
That's right! You should be sorry! 
---
I'm just fucking with you, I wouldn't have done it. 
---
You can plant into a camp fire, it doesn’t look pretty but I see plenty of people do it.
---
Okay.......
---
Sit in the chair!
---
So you're saying this triple A game will be playable if we wait another 20 months?
---
I would honestly prefer just seeing more contextualized loot pools. If I kill a legendary super mutant I want a legendary super mutant item. 
---
I won’t believe that shit until I see it. Never claim a workshop if there isn’t a person there, there’s no fun in that.
---
I feel so much compassion for you right now.  Not really.
---
Welcome to the club. 
---
Well, besides Sentinel, I don't think there are many armors that can really make a difference when there are weapons that can basically one-shot.
---
I was wondering if Bethesda was gonna let us use mannequins to hang clothing and armor.
---
It's being planned. It's been seen in datamines
---
Winter 2018 called. It want it’s salt back. 
---
Yeah I have had troubles with OW chat too (on PC). I've had a man call me an "e-girl slut" because I defended another player he was bullying. I also had underage boys (roughly 11-13 years old, judging by the pitch of their voice) saying really vulgar things to me all game until I eventually blocked them. It was really unnerving, hearing young boys speak that way to me.
---
I have had really positive experiences too, but I definitely don't recommend your daughter using voice chat.
---
Fix your grammar.
---
So I had a look around the Arktos Pharma building today and scoured the grounds as well. I'm not seeing any means of entering a tunnel of any sort. Thinking maybe since  Gauley Mine is so close that may be the key.
---
### 
---
Yes, power armour you still get 1 shot but a good set you can survive like 50k damage or so
---
makes sense... I was excited but confused how they'd that that specific version of the gun given I know its not the same mod that were on it when I received it.
---
A well-placed turret or two should dissuade all but the most obnoxious of pirates...unless the takeaway here is more along the lines of " if I see a lock, it's artillery time"; in which case the conversation shifts to dealing with asshole griefers, of which I've personally encountered very few.
---
Yeah, it has been happening a lot to me lately.
---
Are you the scorchbeast queen in disguise?
---
Seriously though, how did that happen? Was someone targeting you, or just random chance?
---
What kind of ladders? The single, or the 2 x 1(with the built in mesh floor)
---
The travesty is that a 1* even a 3* mostly sells for less than a regular assault rifle to a vendor.
---
Yes please!! I just tell people it's Mythical Razor Grain and it adds hovering perk when you eat it.
---
How did you get it to 3k damage? 
---
Oh not a bug bug, just an oversight.
---
I don't know; I have two characters, one with Guerrilla build and full Assassins and the other with T-60, and I haven't noticed much of a difference, really.
---
Minecraft armor stands &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Fallout 76 mannequins

Ah dadlife gaming hours I feel your pain friend. 
---
Atom cat’s paint job?
---
Assassin sentinal? Just assassin doesnt do tonnes
---
Man, I never sneak in this game.  I know I should, it just never occurs to me and I've never really been a sneaker in games.  But I will try to start sneaking now, cuz I really would like to conserve ammo/weapon durability more.
---
And then everybody clapped
---
What do you drop for noobs? I usually do a 10mm, some ammo, a few diluted radaway and a stimpack or 2. I want to be generous but don't want to spoil the noobs. 
---
You can still kill senintels by staggering them in VATs. Sentinel Assasin armor has all been duped into oblivion. I've seen sets goes for 45k+.
---
I put together a combat shotgun / rifle build for stealth crits.  When I kill hundreds of 3-star glowing groovy ghoulies, I get everything but shotguns or rifles.  Way, waaaay too many cryolators.  Hundreds of pieces of 1-star armour.  1-star Exterminators.  1-star Troublemakers.
---
I've been playing a couple hours every day, but it just gets old, slaughtering all these legendaries and never getting anything useful.  The best weapon I have is a 1-star Executioner hand-made, and it's level 40.  I'm not particularly high-level (95), but it feels really crappy that that is the best I've got after hundreds of hours playing.
---
I'm starting to get paranoid about the devs creating deprecated loot tables for people that complain.  Hell, I don't know.
---
I'm reading more books, though.
---
42 here.
---
Cool story. What your describing is impossible unless you sought revenge. There is no slap dmg one shot like you have read on these forums. It's some one owing a workshop, there is a team of two, one person goes to the work shop the other teammate finds the person on the map goes to them and kills them. What your describing is impossible unless you A. Fought back B. Sought revenge
---
Each shot does 150 damage. Times that by 20 and it does 3000 damage. That is if they added up like that.
---
Yeah, he was an extremely disturbed individual. I’m so grateful that my friends stepped in to help me when I needed their support as well, and I’ve not met anybody as bad as that guy ever since. Thank you for your kind words :)
---
connect them with foundation  or easier to just remove camp and restart
---
Dude you're a bitch. Who cares what he did he knows more and plays it more than you every will. He's actually going out of his way to make helpful guides and you still try to act like a little salty bitch about it. It doesn't concern your life so why do you care so much. Shits pathetic really. I was waiting for someone like you to post some cringy shit like this.
---
RIP my CAMP and my favourite location 😩
---
It's not strange at all, you are role-playing as a survivor of the nuclear holocaust, with radioactive Skyrim dragons screaming at you. If that's not weird, playing as another gender shouldn't be either.

A bladed irradiated pool cue was my 2nd best weapon in Fallout 4 after Atom's Judgment...
---
Also about automotron where do I build the robot building thing can’t find it I want to make Ed-e 
---
Without Sentinel. But then the issue is entirely with Sentinel/Cavalier, not with Power Armor.
---
The fact that this actually needs to be a suggestion is just mind boggling
---
I don’t understand your issue, what happened? My SO and I play constantly with no trouble
---
Thats what we're here for. 
---
Yeah, I have one character with PA and Heavy Guns, so it's not really an issue to stagger them.
---
Yes sentinal is op, and the fact it stacks with assassins is. 1000 damage goes to 600 in assassins, so you still die, goes to 250 in sentinal so maybe youre ok and goes to 132ish in ass sent. You see how this is op
---
Can't help with Charlie, but PureSavagery just solved Bravo on stream, so it should be up on Nukacrypt momentarily.
---
PC
---
Yeah, I know. Like I said, they should rework the way damage works in PvP. They can leave it how it is for PvE if they want.
---
It's not terribly surprising either, as a property, Fallout is old enough to drink and many of us have been playing them since the beginning.

I’ve always had friends pick up just in case (PS4). I think a bag might disappear (though haven’t actually verified). Could try an in-world container, but to me that feels kinda risky.

- 30% extra damage to scorched

- 50% more limb damage

I can’t remember what the last one is rn

The votes tend to disagree with you.

oh yeah if you are in lower lv areas it's harder to find good parts, also everyone would be searching too but we all been there searching for those before xd

It usually gives you the choice between a new perk or to move a special

I'm having flashbacks to moving Skyrim mannequins. As much as I think a mannequin might be fun, especially if someone's setting up a shop camp, what I'd prefer is a closet I can hang up outfits in. Would add to immersion. 
---
God I hope not.  It's already a chore to make caps.  I would rather adventure then vendor hop.
---
Yeah but there's no new perk cards in there those are all the ones that you haven't picked yet when you level up before that it always shows you the new ones that were put in there for every level up it's not doing that anymore
---
That's because enemy lvl is mostly determine by players passing by
---
Ohhhhhh I don’t think you unlock any *new new* ones, the last is unlocked at 50
---
I've played enough fallout 4 to know that's intended brahmin behavior
---
Check reply

Give it a try sometime, esp with Wrecking Ball perk.  Turrets offer virtually no significant resistance to a player who wants to break a camp.  I know, I've tried and succeeded - those twits who put gun racks at the back of the golf course can tell you how easily players can eliminate their turrets.
---
I just hit 50 and was wondering this as well.  I didn't see any new ones.
---
I just finished that tonight and searched the sub to see if anyone else was talking about it. Wow! Such a good story!
---
Similar situation with exploding legendary watoga bots. If they explode and disappear then do a lap around town. It should be there when you come back and loot is in it's drop.  
---
Yup. Patch 7 changed stuff in the ini file; if you had a custom.ini, it was overriding the changes. One of the big ones was moving the archive where the collision meshes were... so the game didn’t know where any collision meshes were ;)

Bloodied unyielding build here, I run a high endurance build so run around with 75hp. But the answer is yes if you have 65hp that you get from a drug effect and you sit at 65hp when the effect expires you die. Happends a lot when taking suden high rad damage. But yeah to add to that unstable isotope and electricly charged also subtract some hp when they proc. And using an adrenal bloodied build I found it easier to stay alive without those two mutations and super stimpacks when I face the queen and use chems.

---
Makes me wonder if i should start storing all the shitty legendaries drops im getting and then turn them in. 
---
If its truly random a 1* could in theory turn into a 3*. But if it gives a legendary of an equal * then no point. Im already swimming in 1* gear.
---
Yeah, i received a notification of all my codes going boom after login. I don't know why, i find a lot of codes. I'm not even far enough into story to use them.
---
unlikely its more due to a bug in the load order of objects making plants die if they spawn in first just like how the player fast travel mats 
---
Got the same issue on ps4.

Yeah let me know when it’s fixed. I have an instigating 3* collecting dust.

Why do people go into silos, knowing they need a code at the end, but not bothering to check if they have the code until all the work is done? 
---
Check NukaCrypt(or solve it yourself) before entering the silo. It will save a lot of future headache 
---
I never thought I was "special". I like gaming, just like everyone else in the game. Just like all the other women who play these games. We get treated differently because we are women, when we don't want to be. I literally said I wanted to be treated like an "equal", which is the antithesis of being "special". I really don't understand how you came to that conclusion. 
---
Perhaps you are confused about the type of toxicity I am talking about. I don't care about people complaining about strategy, or ranting about a loss. I care about unwanted sexual remarks. I'll give you an example: 
---
In Overwatch, someone gave a direction, I said "I understand" in chat, and followed their direction. Immediately, I get repeated, "Are you a girl?" questions in chat. When I said, "It doesn't matter whether I am", two guys started asking for sexual favours. I didn't do anything except try to play the game and asked them to stop. When they kept going (for several minutes, uninterrupted), I blocked them.
---
It is this kind of behaviour that is unacceptable. It is being blatantly targeted because I am a woman. I just want to play the damn game. It has nothing to do with attitude, lacking a filter, or ego. It is all about sexual harassment. 
---
Oh and btw, all of us are S.P.E.C.I.A.L
---
I'm not sure how it'll work but that's what I've been doing. Storing away all those little legendaries I don't use in the hopes it'll be worth it one day.
---
there is nothing under the ground sadly but I would love a terraforming tool that would allow us to flatten the ground for easy camp placement. Upon moving it would just revert to what it looks like when theres not a camp there.
---
I stay in my armor now and I I stay in excavator! My current carry weight is 475. And I don’t pvp but that guy in the story sounds like a real douche! Everyone I play with uses excavator but I will say the damage resistance sucks!!! Lol
---
Caps ? 
---
Bravo is up. The others are being worked on. 
---
Until Feed the People.
---
if u need a reliable way to make 1400 caps every day: go out back of Watoga train station and go down the tracks to the box cars, go in the boxcar (up a ramp) and on the two stacked boxes to the right u will see plans (the train to the west, has a skeleton with a tommy gun and some bullets all the time) do this every day for a week or so and u will get Marine Tactical Helmet plans. those are made with plastic, glass, and rubber which are everywhere. the helmets weigh 0.1. make 50-70 each day and sell to vendors. it takes about 20 minutes to make them and fast travel to sell them. sell whatever else to get the remaining caps. you’ll have plenty of caps in now time!
---
Nice!
---
if i had any i would love to
---
Im sorry for your lost
---
Good point. I don’t know how many bars I built in FO4 so I would think those assets would be easy to bring over.
---
You got downvoted, but there's a decent chance they are female. I know a lot of women don't use their mics for the same reason, so we are probably disproportionately represented among the mute players. 
---
What system? 
---
Don't get me wrong I'm not saying it's horrid it's just worse once your able to make a good legendary set, and I still have a PA set for nuke zones or the jetpack when I want to explore places I cannot reach, honestly I think PA needs a buff of some kind. My preferred buff would be more mods and a hidden -25% dmg taken. So you can truly make your own mobile tank 
---
You get pve card pack per level up to level 10, then one pack every 5 levels there after. Level 130 and still get them every 5 level ups. 
---
I've been gaming for ages, started on a 56k modem. Usually stick to PC gaming because I never could get used to a controller. Mouse and keyboard worked much better for me. 
---
Had the xbox 360 and no matter how much I played I never got the feel. With FO4 and now FO76 I'm getting used to it more all the time. This game isnt as reflex oriented as say COD or the other fps titles. I'm 57 and got tired of spawning and instantly getting headshot killed by a 12 year old. FO is more user friendly for those who aren't used to controller gaming or don't have those lightening fast reflexes.
---
BTW I purposely seek out lower level players and try to help then out with weapons, ammo, food or stim packs.

With perks, you can survive long enough to get a few hits in, and melee damage gets boosted by strength, which gets boosted by unyielding, which also activates at low health, along with nerd rage and adrenal reaction. If you eat certain foods and have certain buffs, you can reach 2k+ damage on a unarmed weapon, that hits quickly, staggers, and ignores the majority of enemy armor.

The problem with that is that then they could just level your Camp over and over, and after you claim the first bounty, they can just build up a Bounty again and you can't claim it the second time. There's an easier fix, just have the player with the bounty have to pay a greater amount then the Bounty receiver gets. So 200 cap bounty, might cost the payer 300 caps. Sort of bounty tax. This way no matter what they're losing every time the Bounty is collected even if it's done by a friend
---
Codes reset at 19:00 Eastern. With the change of Daylight Saving Time it might be an hour off. Haven't checked. I know they changed their maintenance to 10:00 EDT as opposed to 09:00 EST. 
---
Regardless, the codes change at a set time every week and entering the silo after a reset without knowing the code is setting yourself up for a potential headache. 
---
also if your on here why can't you access nukacrypt? And silly me didn't look at the page, it's unsolved currently
---
5k
---
The group I play with is all people in their late 20s to 40s.
---
We think this game appeals to a lot of old school MMO players with the open nature of the game, the way loot drops, and the general balance.
---
Most of those players are going to tend older. My group all played Final Fantasy XI a decade or more ago. 
---
If you're carrying an excess of food and beverage that you don't want to have to throw away after it spoils, you can put it in the fridge for later?
---
F
---
Agreed. That's why I didn't want the Grognak and The Silver Shroud outfits
---
Time to give my character diabetes.
---
PA is just trash in pvp lol
---
You mean "no step on snek"?  
---
I seldom come across woman in games but have in real life but never same platform. I rather talk to any adult rather than hearing a 10 year old tell me how to play any game.
---
Studies have shown that playing games tends to help keep those skills and mental acuity.
---
for me it's canned coffee, can fly in a jetpack by feathering the key forever on coffee.
---
I've looked there too but not as often, ty I'll try again. 
---
I'd personally would like more faction stuff.  My Raider camp doesn't look raider enough :(
---
Have a vampire 90%weight reduction LMG. I use it at Whitesprings to get a hot on everything and with the ROF, I never die 
---
Not worth the toothpaste farm i would have to do afterwards.
---
The enemies around Vault 76 are level locked. They’re always low level. You’ve got a point but embellishing or lying about circumstances you’ve experienced doesn’t help anybody. 
---
Oh is that what you wanted a fridge for? 
---
nope just Bravo and i just watched one of the guys solve Alpha so that should be up soon.
---
I've been having a similar issue trying to join a friend's world. It will drop me on a different one once or twice before actually dropping me on the right one. 
---
Has anyone noticed the horde of cargo boots that is over the left side of the river by point pleasant?
---
I also am not savvy. Please help us. 
---
Thankfully most of the guys I interact with in games have always been very cool. I can't recall an obnoxiously sexist experience. My sample is biased though, since the chill ones become my friends, and their friends are also usually chill, and the ones who act weird I seldom see again.
---
What strikes me more is that in a game where there are benefits to killing other players, most people are just really friendly and give each other free stuff. You shining beacons of humanity, you.
---
Okay thx
---
Yea I'm on PC and it's like, I'm just inviting random people no matter the level to team up with me because it's luck of the draw when I try to add someone lol
---
Sell to the vendors 1400 caps a day
---
Sub
---
Wow your so cool bro! Careful guys!
---
Last night a  legendary Wotoga robot dropped 1 x Aluminium scrap and nothing else, waited around for a few minutes, nothing else.
---
BTW why do robots drop legendary wooden armor ;)
---
Just like in Arkham City, exactly!
---
Damn, I was thinking about outright buying the recipe but my buddy and I just got into it with a bunch of griefers and lost a shit ton of caps. I’ll check back in a few days and if you haven’t sold it I’ll hit you up! 
---
Fast travel around to events you usually get enough caps to offset the cost of traveling there
---
I can throw a couple levels at pistol perks and just see what happens. Who knows what the next meta build will be next few months anyways.
---
You have been playing since beta and are level 30? I quit a few months ago and I ended at 100. How slow do you have to be playing to be level 30.
---
Spider mech for sure. 
---
Wah?
---
The only time I've seen the camp under attack message was when I happened to spot it when looking at the minimap. I don't remember an obvious notification either, it would be nice if there was a more obvious one if there isn't.
---
Then how does it work for all the functional in-world planters that are already there? 
---
When they fix the vendors this will be a much more viable option, for sure! The caps usually don’t reset every day for me and my friends, so we always end up losing out on caps fast traveling so we can sell. 
---
Running through a lot of events, defending workshops, killing ghouls, and super mutants is always pretty helpful though. It takes time, but you get there eventually. 
---
Unfortunately not. Bethesday didn't even respond to my ticket, but it rather seems like they just deleted it entirely. When I go to access my tickets from the support page, which I've bookmarked cause it's a royal pain to find otherwise, it say I don't have permission to view the page, even though I'm signed in. When I go to the page from the support center, it just says I don't have any tickets, and never had any to begin with. I'm going to try and file another one and, with any luck, try a customer service number I found tomorrow morning. 
---
Will try to post results soon.
---
Farm stable flux, most sell for 30-60 each
---
I have been looking for a ultracite target hud
---
I'm impressed with how far he got with 48 fusion cores in his pockets.
---
Not a bad idea. I think I can even craft one.
---
It's a bittersweet feeling to see that someone else is going through the same problem but with about as little success in resolving it as me. If you don't mind sharing, what all did this back and forth entail? Did they try to make excuses to not refund you or just kept quoting their policies to not refund?
---
The game you are looking for is named Fallout 4, give it a try sometime
---
I believe this is why the game is not as toxic. A lot of older mature players.
---
Didn't work for me Monster mash must be broken or removed Bummer
---
I have a couple if you wanted to buy one from me tomorrow afternoon eastern time.. 100 caps?
---
I just sent this to my friend he can help u
---
Thanks. I'm there. 18 caps to fast travel at Watoga Station from WS service entrance.
---
There was a SB flying over me, had to run a bit to the south. Doing that i see something glowing blue on a tree; cobalt flux ! Wrong color, lol.
---
There was a hot rod flakes pant job in the Atomic Shop for a limited time 
---
and then make us pay $20 dollars for each of them
---
The few survival games I’ve played have had refrigerator feature. 
---
It gives you a message but it's very quick and then it's gone. If your not looking at your map as they are blowing it up you will miss it. I rather have a quest pop up for this, similar to the pick up your dropped loot quest.
---
This exactly. My group was playing the original everquest. 
---
Yeah they're buggy for sure. I was at the factory today and it kept disappearing and reappearing every few seconds. 
---
What platform
---
Use a friend it's safer
---
Just more wastelandy/apocalypse/survivor outfits and armour in general. 
---
I don't want to wear a 1950s style swimsuit while slaying Deathclaws. 
---
Probably not as 3 takes place 200 or so years in the future.
---
Later 
---
Hahahahahaha
---
Learn the civil War Top hat plan, each hat costs 1 cloth and sells for 32-35 caps.
---
Way to contribute to the discussion. 
---
Go with a rifle and use VATS. 
---
Skip heavy perception. I run 6, for explosive radius, grenade throwing (1 star), and 3 utility points for stuff like Glow Sights.
---
Here’s my build.
---
Note that for leveling purposes, there really aren’t any heavy weapons before level 25, and your first perks show up at 30, so focus on using explosives to soften up/kill enemies early on, and finish them off with whatever you find. 
---
Also, I run a low health build, in a group, so if you don’t run a low health build you might remove Nerd Rage, and if you don’t group, swap those Charisma cards out for Lone Wanderer.
---
But I highly encourage working towards a low health build, with a Emergency Protocols torso on your power armor. It works very, very well for heavy weapons
---
Aye your the deathclaw maze guy. 
---
Deal! Can you message me when you get on. I will be out from about 11am est to 1230. Thank you!
---
Remember, just because you disagree is not a reason to downvote a post.  This is valuable information just as well as the extreme positives. 
---
I’ll jump in and say I bought this game at launch. Power armor edition. I played three characters through the campaign and completely built them.  
---
The game is still unacceptably buggy. But, it’s getting better, if you love fallout it’s currently playable but will annoy you at times. 
---
Bro food preservation is like survival 101
---
Grindy teens haha :)
---
I like to think I can guess a player's age in this game. I wonder if mine shows. Both my wife and I play together. Great to play games with your other half. Some of our best memories of the last 30 years involve them from Tetris on the NES and most systems since.
---
Are you saying I answered my own question? I just wanted confirmation as some of the data may be outdated since the newest updates. 
---
Glad to hear it seems like everyones going through this same thing.
---
My bad for thinking I could get away with it ;)
---
On XB1 been doing just the chest for 2.5-3k, tho yesterday I got 12k for an arm &amp; chest bundled together. Hope that helps!

Yeah, and If the problem is that it would break the economy then make them more rare.

No step on snek!

ESO is set 700 years before Morrowind and they just moved the map back in time

---
Where are the plans for Hoppy Hunter so we can do the mission? Theres no info anywhere on where to find it.
---
I’m guessing the plans spawn randomly? 
---
my hope for this game just went through the roof AGAIN. YOU ARE A LEGEND FOREVER
---
I killed a 3* Colonel Gutsy the other day (first 3* i killed after the patch i think) and was totally expecting some garbage. Instead i wound up with a Bloodied/Explosive The Dragon! Only 2*, but I'm not complaining... Easily the best drop I've ever gotten!
---
You’re playing a very different game than we started out with. That said, everyone’s beloved New Vegas has some game breaking glitches to start, too. With the improvement we’ve seen so far and the potential of the future, this game can continue to turn it around.
---
Have you tried to rebuild database from safe mode? To many errors can sometimes corrupt the files and rebuild database corrects them.
---
Also power cycle your system.
---
Though content for it in the files currently we can’t access them or see them 
---
I love the voice actors in every holiday I've come across. The emotion behind their words is almost tangible.
---
Unfix all the good bugs
---
praise the lord!  This is exactly what is needed.  I'm so tired of getting ambushed and insta-killed by shitlords playing as "Raiders" and stealing my junk and caps.   If it gets any worse, I'm done with this shit for good.
---
yea just had a greifer  make me hate the game even more , legit i was doing my usual vendor hopping to gather mats to give low levels and make them guns and shiz, and this 45 hits me so i go around to hit him back, ( he left game)  so we found a level 15 hiding in bathroom my buddy shot him once to see if he would turn red he did not so we went on, until he plugged his mic in and started running his mouth threatening us      and now they called in a bunch of manchildren of another clan to "server stalk me"
---
lovely communty we got here, players that abuse in game things to have an unfair advantage on pvp not to mention duped armor and weps
---
There is big downside to sentinel you must use stealth boy ask the time because vats head shots will ignore legendary effects of armour
---
Look for someone posting here that they're holding the Civil War Reenactor, people do it fairly often, just like with the Lemonade stand, Graham, and the Traveling Robot Vendor
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/OuwqoZW

Where do you find the plans?
---
I couldn't give a fuck about your disorders, I was being trying to be nice about it and help you out.
---
If you think correcting an error is akin to making fun of you I gaurantee that your trophy shelf is full of participation awards.
---
Why not three stars worth? Like three 1-stars, or a 2-star and a 1-star. I mean a 3-star legendary wooden left leg is still worse than a 1-star legendary hand made rifle you should be asking for quantity.
---
I’m online now.
---
Good idea thanks I'll try that!
---
I agree. My slower response rate makes me unsuited for FPS with young players, but F76 is slightly slower paced and thus manageable. 
---
I want a Protectron guard and a Mr. Handy to tidy up/sell stuff.
---
God, I love Mr. Handies
---
I think they're my favourite fictional robot.
---
Mr. Gutsies are a close second (Third is GLaDOS if anybody's curious. She's only third because she's more of an AI than a robot. In the AI list she's topping.)
---
If the robots can function as vending machines, I'll be a very happy C.A.M.P.er
---
I seen what it's like underground. Hopefully the terraforming tool can create a pocket of usable ground in that section of the map for that player. Once the player leaves the spot or relocates, then the ground reform like you said and the pocket of dirt will be placed in the spot the next time the camp is moved or placed back in that spot.
---
Just keep looking around. There's a lot of crimson and violet flux in that area.
---
If you haven’t cleared out Misc, there’s quite a few things that can take up weight in there, especially gunpowder.
---
You can't build Eyebots on the Robot Workbench without a very hefty mod. The Robot Workbench is located under the Misc. tab in the workshop, and can only be unlocked after completing the quest "A New Threat" (or "Mechanical Menace", I dunno).
---
At this point i am just about to give my items away and snap the disk in half, sick of dealing with toxic losers ruining the game.
---
Don't dope my nope rope?
---
I'm 56. I love this game
---
Hi 56, I'm dad!
---
Yea... the Zetan signals are jamming their internal GPS.
---
Either you had a workshop somewhere or there was a bug, i killed like 100 wanted and never had a problem
---
I keep getting dcd at the most inopportune times 😑 can't wait for this to be fixed again.
---
Waited so long for another fallout and they had to go and ruin it with a flop like 76 
---
Other than the rocky launch, I think they're on a better trajectory now. This are looking bright in Appalachia and the coming months look even brighter.
---
I was thinking something similar about the used and unused enamel buckets. The used produces plastic, but the unused does not....
---
I wanna outfit that screams...
---
“Like the site of your own blood?!” 
---
I waa at a base that said trading i didnt buy nothing and left get immediately shot at and kill all 3 guys die once and message them why and they said Its the raider life and since im wearing the white responders uniform im a target for raiders i iust like the outfit man
---
They dropped the price on flux last update.  Not sure how much though.  Inert is now worth 0 also
---
From my perspective, the game is a far better experience with a mic. You just have to get past the initial wariness that comes with talking to people in an online game.
---
You should check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals. It's a really wholesome place, and I've only ever had positive experiences with people there. 
---
Palace of the winding path is actually based on this real location in WV. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Vrindaban,\_West\_Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Vrindaban,_West_Virginia)
---
Its called the palace of gold and is a Hare Krishna community and tourist area.
---
I got a bunch for 1500 each or 1250 each if you buy at least 4
---
Where do you find the big super mutants at, like the giants, I’m 125 still have not seen 1
---
Yea, it's beautiful.
---
Banned players are back and this is happening coincidence? I think not! Anyways once the next wave of bans comes in they'll be gone
---
Thats what I am wondering to because we don’t have to download anything because it’s already in the game just not unlocked and will the servers need a restart first? Or could they unlock it without restarting it? 
---
Same I did it to some robots thinking oh the robots might be able to harness that. But I tried it on some scorched and it did the same!
---
You can find one south of Solomon's Pond in a pond which is East of Whitesprings. Sometimes you can find one by Pylon V-13 which is north of Watoga.
---
Melee is still the tops for damage.  It really depends on how you like to play tbh.  I've played around with a few different builds, but the one I've had the most fun with is a stealth/commando/vats build.  I run bloodied with it and just wreck everything, though I die pretty quickly when something gets ahold of me :)
---
Play on PC? perk loadout manager 
---
Don't get me wrong i love the pvp, its just at times its utter bs, and people bringing like 10 people against like 2 guys? its just tiring and pathetic, funny enough this was all over a guy's wife being attacked once because we thought he was with the level 45.
---
That'll be 995 Atoms.
---
I meant sell on reddit. Not the raw or inert, but the stable stuff. Especially stable violet flux. Everyone needs it and most sellers have exclusivity contracts nowadays
---
Agreed, just killed a legendary 3 star glowing hermit crab. What did it drop... a none legendary radium rifle, that is it just a none legendary rifle. WTF! I wasted 16 2mm rounds on that thing. 
---
That's a yes from me that would be awesome 
---
\*Dies laughing\* Wooden legs especially weightless ones are worth a lot more then you think as they are the best stealth armor in the damn game. 
---
Use the terminals.
---
One can hope.
---
hoping that  greifing becomes a report feature, like on major  stuff not just leveling a camp and killing a player that doesn't want to fight,  i mean like server hopping just to actively stalk the user and ruin their experience
---
You can do fine in power armor, although for that level of challenge I’d recommend putting together a suit of some better armor. X-01 is great for nuke zones, but anything other than Excavator will do okay. You’ll still need to bring rad-away but you’ll be taking like 2/rad a second. It’s tolerable, ish, you just need a good supply of rad-away
---
Pun. Irony is different 
---
Just means they are [well read.](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/File:Backwoodsmanhighpoly_01.png)

Is inside the building in 3 floor , I can't log in the game anymore tho to show . 
---
I was Level 168 when I finally joined the enclave and launched a nuke. 
---
But I’m lazy. Really lazy. 
---
Welding Mask already exists in game, just a heads up
---
Your title sounds disturbing.
---
That's pretty lucky since I only get a bunch one one or two star nocturnal stuff from the queen!
---
I'm almost 39 and my husband is 47. We met on SWG and I've moved half way around the world to marry him. I'm the youngest in the group we play with. Meeting through a video game, well, we'll be playing games together for many years to come I believe.
---
I assume the bodies despawn as you repair the traps and spawn a new one?
---
I’ve turned in about 40 and only got the Knight paint, nothing else
---
And this was like 5 days ago. 
---
are you Two Shot Flamers 3 star? 
---
I can see that but it's too late to change now
---
This would be awesome. But just a heads up they are in the game files. Just not released yet 
---
Good!
---
There’s no evidence luck *actually* does anything to drops, other than their condition bar. But intelligence does increase your experience gain. 
---
Definitely, noone is really going to be sending MOST things back and forth.
---
 Maybe even a small personal wallet with a reasonable cap limit; beginning survival is a broke existence to go back through it time and again...
---
Its fallout
---
What???! This is news to me! Thanks mate. 👍 
---
I have the quantum paint that I can apply to your armor if you don’t want to do the searching. Like many have said, it’s not hard until you have to server hop several times in the hope it spawns.
---
Let me know - psn:kevo0788
---
Might have been a coincidence. I've had visitors at my camp and I come back 30 mins later to a destroyed camp.  However, it was super mutants because they were still firing when I came back.
---
Drop a nuke on the Nuka plant and a giant Nuka cappy monster spawns would be good, options are endless
---
There are no new perks after lvl 50, literally all of the perks are unlocked by then
---
No, i don't have the perk. At Watoga i went in the nuke direction. Decided to try my T60. As long as i keep to outer region i'm fine. I found only 7 of the color i needed. Hard to say wich one. I would have to set my system to english to check. Or find the recipee for the blood tequila online.
---
Well, back home i discovered i also need several other component ; one rad fluid and one harden mass? Still missing 3 "purple" flux.
---
Jumping back to Watoga would only cost me 37 more caps. But i'm late, should have stayed longer. I was trying to go around the area but the game said "you can't go that way". Lol.
---
It’s not (totally) wrong. Some are additive, some are multiplicative. I’m not sure which are which but I have about 460/shot before Adrenaline with the same build with my bloody Gatling gun. I’ve got a bloody 50cal as well but it’s only used for big boys like the Queen- the Gatling is super accurate and can gib many enemies with a single bullet.
---
How much for the two shot 10 mm
---
Yep mines doing this too.
---
At launch, this was a 30 dollar game being sold for 60. 
---
I'm 37. Played fallout 1 at 16.
---
Hi 37, I'm dad!
---
Not even close to one hit deaths, not if you know how to build and are sitting at 19%. Even my 1 endurance sniper doesn’t die in one hit (aside from the random Yaoi Guai surprise ambush). 
---
Hell a Bloodied HW/PA with Emergency Protocols can tank a couple queen hits from 19%.
---
I want my own army of liberators!!!
---
I have a feeling there will be a small patch in the morning and the festival will begin after that. Crossing fingers that some of the new bugs that popped up are addressed. 
---
Hey man sounds like you got quite a few hours of play out of it so at least got your money's worth out of it....just wait when new content launches and check it out again that's about all you can do besides farm legendary gear.. there are too many good games out there to just play one the whole time..you should check out warframe
---
I can always get a better gun and play with my build. Building new interesting camps is fun, and I generally just like walking around Appalachia.
---
Silva farm north of the nuka cola plant.
---
Lots of corn, and the workshop has lots of razorgrain.
---
With green thumb i get 130 odd corn. and 200+ grain.
---
That is over 300 caps for 4 mins of work and 12 caps worth of fast travel.
---
Unfortunately the food has been spoiling very quick since the patch, but before that, it was a very quick way to make caps.
---
Relogging fixes the quest. You can relog right after getting the quest and then it should complete the first time. 
---
No one cares about hot sauce guy anymore...
---
Had two strangers show up at a party members base, destroyed their water purifier. No wanted sign. Killed both of us(I wasn’t wearing any armor lol)
---
Had to respawn and equip my pa and yes gauss to clear them out.
---
Even after murdering us no wanted icon. It was weird.
---
I have a vampire's ripper.  Best vampire's in the game IMO.  At full 200% health I can walk through white springs, kill anything in under a second, and never lose an ounce of health.  :D
---
I don't play on PC I play on Playstation but I still wish it something like this would  be available across all platforms. 
---
The spring is made of gold, which is more valuable than the spring, hence you bulk it up with gold. (That's just me trying to make some sense out of that craziness) 
---
I learned the plans for t60 but haven't made them yet.  Need some cobalt flux before I build one for myself.  I'm on pc.
---
I feel where you're coming from but I think ppl posting about it and it'll get fixed.
---
 I got got before but I learned the rules of online play and thats: Be careful who you allow access to stuff that you can't stand to lose bcuz as you say it COULD happen bcuz sum ppl suck 
---
I got a buddy who in whatever game we play always gets the good loot....some people just have more points in luck in real life I guess...
---
probably with the weekly reset you can check it by looking at weekly challenges which is 10am EST Tuesday
---
Do you know where you find it haha?
---
Bloodied VATS sniper with a Lever Action. Walk into a room with 5 68 supermutants, 5 seconds later 5 headless bodies fall over. 
---
That’s why. 
---
Also, there’s a fundamental reality in that, the more damage you can put out, the better a LOT of things get. 
---
You use less ammo.
---
You lose less weapon condition.
---
You lose less armor condition (none at all if you’re a stealth sniper)
---
You don’t need to CARRY as much ammo per run.
---
You use less aid items.
---
You don’t need to carry as many aid items.
---
You clear areas faster; which if you use buff chems and food, means you don’t need to carry as many.
---
If you’re 1hit killing from stealth, you’re more likely to stay in stealth and continue the chain of instant death.
---
How many you got? 
---
Since the unbanning, it seems the game crashed a lot more to almost unplayable 
---
The Glow in the Dark aspect is a huge let down. Anything short of running a black light right over it means you can’t see the effect. Even bringing into a dark room after a minute in direct sunlight fades in seconds. 
---
Like. That was so much time and resources wasted to crash in the end.. I'm furious! 
---
Which one? Level 15 or 45?
---
I’m not sure how to level up and distribute points in real life . . .
---
I wear it all the time. Finally had enough screws to build one level 45 leg. Now I just need 15 more screws and $5000 caps and i can get the calibrated shocks plans for extra carry weight. Should have them by the end of summer at this rate. 
---
Us players would have to help police it, we shouldn't have to but we can't let @ssholes limit us. You are absolutely right tho: cats are going to find a way 
---
No, everything is listed for all weapons. The flamers are 1*.
---
Having to eat my Scorchbeast Mixed Meat Stew because I didn’t want it to turn into “spoiled meat” was tragic. 
---
Gotcha. I didn’t think you were talking about the PS4 people. 
---
Literally quit the server and all your problems are solved. 
---
I do hope you don't believe the 0 number. It often does not reset. Just try and sell it something and see if it resets.
---
I bought my bos jumpsuit for 2500 on Xbox 
---
The deliverer is the 9mm right? It's on a poster somewhere with the suppressor. 
---
RL lvl 53 here. The full-on FPS's against teenage reflexes is a no go. W.V. I can handle 😁
---
lol dayum after 300 levels i still learn new shit every dayy
---
Thx!
---
If that were the case I'd never break 450 damage per shot on a 50 cal, but I do. Some are additive, like the heavy weapons specific boosts - those are all additive with each other, but many of the others are multiplicative.
---
This. I got Emergency Protocols as well, and it makes a heavy weapons bloodied build a lot more bearable to run around at 19% HP. I dueled a full assn/sent guy the other day, and it was basically a stalemate. He was melee / ranged hybrid, so we has doing respectable damage to me from ranged, but I could pretty easily out heal it. I charged into him with pain train to stagger since he was immune otherwise (couldn't get a stagger with heavy weapons, just bad luck), and one shot him after the stagger, but he also one shot me with his melee weapon (some kind of crazy damage power fist). We traded deaths a few times. Was fun, but ultimately I was losing more caps due to being much higher level.
---
Because mutations can make your class near God tier, you should use them. Class freak makes negatives so tiny, and the positives shine infinitely. 
---
It’s really that simple. I don’t get it 🙄
---
Damn, that’s gonna be us when TES 7 or Fallout 6 comes out. Hahaha.
---
I think he meant pvp. Agreed on pve though. If I die on my bloodied build in the queen fight it's probably because an add stacked a bunch of poison on me (damn you mirelurk queens!) or I was just flat out not paying attention.
---
Good luck. Hope you arent expecting a big payout.
---
Do you know if Lifesaving works in pvp? I was thinking about going that route - just go ahead and die, get up with revenant active, and wreck them when they try to take my loot.
---
Hmmm, could be that Redditors are generally older too. Just guessing though, I only use this website to follow games I have.
---
Go help noobs, give them your excess  ammo. Or produce weapons. Do a power armor chassis drop off at the overseers camp. Or grief if that's your playstyle. Solo a silo using only knives and snubnose revolvers to make it interesting. Challenge yourself.
---
I honestly don't care what they did.
---
However for the sake of the the community, you should uninstall.
---
Your obsession with the word virgin hints at you being a dumbass, your Reddit name confirms it.
---
You are right with the rinse and repeat part since the bank WOULD need to be after future content, addition of thousands of wpns,armor and mods to make true sense. 
---
What would be good use of them for a sniper critical vats build?
---
It happens occasionally. I don't know if it's a bug or a feature... Last night I had Protectrons there, the ones that have the Robobrain treads instead of the Protectron legs, all comparable levels to the ghouls. Was a strange experience.
---
Ok thanks
---
They have them they are listed as "campfire" in the buidl menu.
---
/s but you can seriously build on them if youwant.
---
If server will crash those items will be lost anyway. To transfer items of high value you must trade it to your friend then your friend must log out to main menu before you will log out. After that your friend will trade it to your second character and immediately after the trade you must log out (before your friend). This way of server will crash your items will get duplicated rather then deleted, if this will happened get rid of duplicates.
---
Yea all the liberators are high level. But no legendaries
---
I think power armor displays for us collectors would be amazing!
---
Chameleon, for one. Pair that with weightless armor. Marsupial is good for all classes with extra jump height and 20 carry weight. Birdbones allows to to get from perch to perch easier. Adrenal reaction to increase damage for a few hundred more damage at low health.
---
The firefighter outfit that you get from the main story quest?
---
People buy that?
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
There’s like 6 new paints for t60 now so you still need those , paladin , Knight etc 
---
There’s a few more BoS ones available now- all the way up to Paladin I believe. Turnin rewards, like Initiate
---
Whatever they do, I hope they don't head in a wacky direction like the saints row series
---
Your thinking of the other one the fire breathers I think. The responder has a 1% to no chance of dropping. 
---
46. Reporting for wasteland reclamation!
---
I had a 3 star protectron at Wotaga instantly blow up and kill me (in power armor) and then crash the game when I tried to respawn. Then I log back in, run back even though my body and precious junk were gone, finding another 3 star protectron kill it and it also instantly blows up and kills me again.
---
I've had it every so often... I think just having one person join a server, then have everyone else join on him/her and then making the team after everyone loads in fully is a work around. 
---
Nope. That's a Firebreather outfit, the Responder one is different and rarer. Kind of like the Witch costume is to the skeleton outfit. I didn't even know it had a matching costume for months.
---
Constructive criticism, up voted
---
Sort of impossible because different enemies at different levels will spawn in the same places. Depends on recently nearby player levels, and a touch of RNG.
---
Check out r/Fo76Creations, some pretty cool camp builds there
---
I’m surprised you managed to kill him with a grenade launcher. Most PVPers run dense torso mods and fireproof, they stack for full explosive immunity
---
&gt; "...put my overloaded friend on my backpack..."
---
Thats hysterical!
---
I'm online 
---
Sorry not sure what more you can do except maybe try to clip some rugs into the items then store the rug. I tried to live under a bridge near Harper's Ferry (the one with the dead scientists in it) and my damn plants all got lost in the bridge. I ended up moving and now I live in a tent.
---
Because that's where the real secret entrance is I think in real life.
---
We really need a return to server function - the one we just got kicked from.
---
Save the structure as a Blueprint?
---
Like you're missing something. The DLC is staggered release, meaning we get content over the course of a year. It's all detailed in the road map.
---
I did not know this existed
---
Oh my god your use of appositives in your paragraph is nauseating.
---
Marsupial is a must. No matter your build. If you havent used it yet you are missing out. The jump ability alone is worth it since the default hop is horrible. Makes exploring faster and funner. Also healing factor id say is a must. Being able to heal outside of combat. It frees up stims and you dont need regeneration armor.
---
I mean u did have a bounty...... 
---
also getting a bounty from taking another players supply drop is not stupid and quite reasonable.... 
---
Dam carebears 
---
It's your inability to use the search function.
---
Seriously, though, according to the countless threads I've seen since the patch, it's your custom ini file. I play on PS4, so I can't tell you more than that.
---
Yep
---
Same with sentry bots
---
You realize you can change the category of perks you’re looking at when you go to the level up screen right? You can choose from ANY perk card after 50, as they are all unlocked, and so you can pick new ones if you switch to the right views 
---
Issues plural. Since Beta, we experienced the same bugs every single session at some point. 
---
Biggest issue is Bethesda's inability to sync our Friends lists, leaving it completely empty or would show each other offline when we were both online and either at the main menu or in the game itself. Mind you since Xbox Live launched in 2002 (I was a day 1 subscriber) I haven't encountered a single game that had that issue, not even once. It makes it impossible to join each other's game let alone group up. Only sure fix was for both of us to quit back to dash and try again. 
---
Numerous times we had issues fast traveling to each other, it would tell us we need to be in a group or friends to fast travel to each other. Again, only sure fix was for both of us to quit to dash and try again. 
---
Another less common occurrence prevented me from fast traveling to her camp, it acted like enemies were nearby so the option just didn't exist, but every time that happened I was able to fast travel to whatever random location I tried just fine, without exiting the map. This is the one Social issue my girlfriend never experienced, it was just me.
---
One hilariously stupid bug we experienced has to do with the piss poor performance of the game and servers. We both got disconnected from the server at the same time. Usually it's one or the other. I'm sure you know that when in a group at the main menu the leader has the option to "play with team" while the rest have a grayed out "waiting..." but that wasn't always the case for us. Many times we both had the option to play with team. Sometimes, the leader would select it and we both would go. Other times, we both had to select it. This one time however, none of those options occurred. When my girlfriend started loading and it was apparent I wasn't joining her, I selected play with team. When we spawned, we were no longer on a team. When she tried to add me, I was offline again, which wasn't a surprise to us since it happened every day. What was a surprise was when I tried to fast travel to her she wasn't on the map. Because we joined DIFFERENT SERVERS while on a team. How stupid is that? At that point, we'd thought we had seen almost every bug imaginable. We were dumbfounded.
---
This next problem was also one of the worst we experienced, and was a direct consequence of the piss poor performance of both the servers as well as the game itself just like the last one. Server disconnects as well and full crashes made returning to the group next to impossible. When one of us encountered either, we would almost always be unable to rejoin. We would not be on a team, but the option to invite either would be missing, because the game stupidly still thought we were on a team, and (at the time at least) the devs stupidly made it so if you are already on a team nobody has the option to invite you to theirs. So, once again, we both had to quit to the dashboard so the game wouldn't be stuck thinking we were in a group. 
---
IIRC patch 6 claimed to make improvements on server performance, so maybe the last issue doesn't happen as frequently. We wouldn't know, because patch 5 broke too many things for us to even try and enjoy playing this buggy game anymore. But that doesn't change the fact that these issues were experienced every single play session for us since Beta, and we played every single day until patch 5, except for three days in mid December when I was too pissed to play after I was stuck in power armor (two weeks after Bethesda claimed to have fixed that particular bug) for two hours straight. I LOVED wasting two hours of my life trying all the community "fixes" for that fucking bug. /s 
---
Anyway, I reported the bugs the first week of launch, and was met with a canned response, and further responses were met with complete radio silence. Their known issues post does not list them (when I checked it when it was finally posted almost 2 months after it was promised), telling me they don't give a shit. I even brought that fact to the attention of the terrible CM that keeps posting the same half dozen responses here, and she responded but ignored that particular part of my comment, proving she doesn't give a shit either. Combine all that with the plethora of other bugs we encountered that hadn't been fixed when we quit (most still aren't, and clearly never will as it's been four months now), not to mention promised features that never materialized until the community here remembered and pointed them out, we've had zero desire to come back. Add the fact that we went back to one of our favorite online games, and we realized what a game is supposed to be like when the developers know what they are doing and don't add more bugs than they fix from one patch to the next. Now we just laugh every time a new bug arises when Bethesda patches Fallout 76, while we play our better developed games that don't actively prevent us from joining each other. 
---
its pretty close I've got most of the weight reduction perks and 550 carry weight meaning I can carry a few thousand weight of junk while running not to mention rockets fusion cores grenades meds basically I'm a walking stash box 
---
3000 damage....
---
and people think TSE is op
---
(Yes i know they mean for pvp but fuck PVP i wanna one shot the annoyingly spongey AI)
---
Fun! One of my favorite things about this game is that I’m learning about stuff I never knew existed in the state despite living here my entire life.
---
Went over your head, here's your sign.
---
Something similar happened to me, sadly I had to store it all and move my camp. It really sucked, but each time I have moved I have enjoyed the new place. 
---
Perhaps see if you can destroy the item via area damage? Maybe broken it will offer something to click in order it repair? 
---
If it is any concession, half the time I log in my world tells me I have to go to a new world or my camp won't load, guess it's a popular spot?
---
I like mixing things up having mutations and managing their cons keeps me busy. The negative effects aren't so bad with the class Freak card. If I didn't have any mutations I'd still be happy playing the game since I wouldnt know what I was missing out on. I got a taste of Marsupial and Chameleon and I can't ever go back lol
---
Also you have to be old like us to have played the original games....
---
Damn... Yea that’s what I did try and that’s how not one, but three items are now stuck... Originally a vault boy gnome, ammo crate, and then a rug finally trying just that earlier for about two hours. It’s at the point I may just deal with it for now because if you’d see my camp you’d know why I’d rather not move considering its layout isn’t easily repeatable off hand nor is a blueprint. I’ll post up in the settlements subreddit later possibly and link it back on here when I get a chance. But this is really the game killer here for me. Through all the bugs, this ones managed to probably be the most damning given the amount of time I’ve put into it... So in the end whatever happens, is what it is.
---
I just want more flags
---
that is a planter I said garden plot they are not the same thing also a in game object is different then a player made camp objects and have a different spawn order that is why when you log in the buildings and ground are there but camps take a few secs to load in 
---
There are several mutations that are good even without Class Freak. Marsupial's -Int penalty is irrelevant most of the time, Carnivore/Herbivore make it easier to scavenge food from the wasteland, and Speed Demon is easily mitigated if you have adequate sources of food and water.
---
Really, the main drawback of a simple mutation build is that it blocks out 2-5 Luck perks to hold it together (though you could cut it down to just 3 if you're very careful with Radaway and decontamination showers, keeping Starched Genes on will save you from making a nearly-inevitable expensive mistake), but a non-mutant can't match the benefits of a well-chosen mutation set, such as Marsupial/Speed Demon granting unparalleled mobility.
---
You're asking for them to be banned and calling them griefers whilst running around screaming Virgin, i'd love to see what didn't get recorded...... Also you killed like 2 players breathing down the microphone hiding in a corridor, that's not a stomping, though i do have to thank you for the cute little PvP video, it was adorable
---
Server hopping should not be a feature. They should allow competitions for rare items rather than first find it, 50 other people go without. A quick timer after a competition before it restarts allowing someone new to acquire it from winning would be necessary. 
---
35 and 14
---
Lv 29 irl looking for a wasteland sugar mama
---
&gt; Yeah lol it’s been that long.
---
No it hasn't. Fallout 4 was released 3 years prior to fallout 76. So unless you're suggesting that fo76 has been out a year then he's off by 6-8 months or so.
---
The cheering is more for the roadmap than the first release.
---
Why does this feel like deja vu?
---
Nocturnal Wooden Armor! :P
---
He gives you daily quests for new fermentable beverages
---
I'd really like the ability to specialize and upgrade power armor past its current limits maybe make faction based quests to unlock new perks to make each suit of armor into a kind of themed concept 
---
example - raider power armor would have highest bullet resistance but cost mostly steel to repair and of course would be raider - excavator armor would get hazard mods from the fire breathers quests and a paint job on it making it a better support unit ect ect
---
WHSRTXUDUAT??? i have like, 100 diseases from ghouls and bugs from fort defiance due to them being bullet sponges, this will help alot
---
My camp across the river is still there.
---
&gt; Also healing factor id say is a must. Being able to heal outside of combat.
---
Healing Factor penalizes *all* chems, though, and OP's crit-sniper build may develop into a long-term relationship with Calmex, Overdrive, or Psychotats.
---
Oh right, I remember seeing that now
---
Thanks
---
Also, you didn’t even use them correctly. You should have been using dashes. Appositives are for giving extra information to a noun, not adding in a random thought that makes you sound like an idiot.
---
Pun isnt the proper term here either. There was no play on words. It is humorous happenstance that ExPA paints are found by data *mining*. Since the is what that power armor is used for. But nothing was written to make a playon the wording or to use something in a way that wasnt literal. 
---
Running out of stuff to do after level 50
---
And when you say that "when a game releases a DLC it is massive" it seems that you played little to none mmorpg's lol
---
Even with offline stuff that was true with Bethesda, with Fo4 it kinda changed.  
---
Looking forward with 76 tho 
---
In like November i was doing a queen and it crashed like 4 times and ofc just as i get back in they kill it so i got nothing at all 
---
They are releasing some new trapper armour and the cage armour in the atom shop
---
I'd say better chances to drop.
---
lmao BIGGG B00TY.  Also where did you get that blue BOS outfit!?
---
+Karma

---
How could you possibly have the stash room for that?
---
This is only the beginning, a similar content release design is being used in Destiny 2 atm - the "season" is released in pieces over time as to draw it out a little bit and, presumably, to prevent people with no life (like me) from just blowing through it in the first day and running out of content too quickly, which is exactly what happened with the game's launch and the reason people got bored so quickly. There's already more coming just tomorrow with the Fasnacht parade event, and the week after that Survival's going to release with its own unique challenges and rewards.
---
It's a slow start but it's probably better than dropping everything all at once and then leaving a huge blank period until the next content release.
---
I had the same but I don't think it's additional cost just a load up of the last do you got. 
---
You know that the door to the dome isn't even locked if you run there fast enough, right? I don't have the keys but I already snatched the plans twice.
---
I found one in delberts shower one day. Took AGES to find the perfect spot top place the camera for a pic. Also found one on its heads doing yoga. The things them sneaky Brahman are capable of blows my mind. 
---
It's the black one 😎
---
Thank you all! It didnt look like it would let me add them but I will go back and try again. Thanks so much!
---
For me it's a tie between every single time I've fast traveled to an event, only to find out there's not enough time left to complete it. 
---
I've always had a soft spot for Ol Rosie. I even visit her from time to time. Come to think on it... I'm kinda over due for a visit... 
---
If you want to join a Fallout 76 camp community, go to r/fo76settlements
---
And you get the recipe when you get the beverage?
---
[Rug Inside Bridge](https://imgur.com/a/5EWI77e) 
---
[Gnome ](https://imgur.com/a/hV6npYm) 
---
I'd buy brahmin armor..... 
---
actually seriously I'd love a pack one that would follow me around when outside so I could show I'm a merchant at a distance no in game buffs just social would be great 
---
Do the daily quest from Biv, you're supposed to get recipes for stuff like that as the reward - I just did one for the first time yesterday and was rewarded the White Russian recipe.
---
It took me w long time before i could trust that system and just leave engrams on the ground. Even though i never got burned, i don't think i ever left an exotic engram. I guess I'm just too used to games not working as intended and deleting my shit on a whim...
---
I’m sure Bethesda wasn’t expecting someone to post a video on how to get what was supposed to be one of the rarest skins in the game and hundreds if not thousands of people trying to complete it at the same time. If you want them to fix the server hopping, they have to change game mechanics somehow. 
---
And you get the recipe from it too?
---
It instantly unlocks as soon as you start the daily so no recipe notes
---
That stinks man, sorry to hear. We’ve experienced a couple of those issues (enemies are nearby, unable to fast travel etc) but only on one server. Once we switch all is well!
---
Go launch one
---
It's a pretty small first step content wise but it feels like a pretty good start. There's a lot of effort and charm in the nukashine content when there really didn't need to be for a new gameplay feature - it might not reinvigorate the game with hours of content but it makes me feel pretty confident in the content to come.
---
I don't use them because I don't want to have to manage them. Using perks for them, worrying about accidentally clearing them, too much of a hassle when I just want to play.
---
I’m not good enough yet
---
Would love to, but considering I wouldn’t be able to plop it right back down in the same spot given it’s on water in two different levels at least, that wouldn’t be feasible. But thank you though.
---
I did mine today too,  figured I should just go straight for site Prime.  my unprepared server did not win
---
I'd be ok with this
---
Yeah. Some quests give you the recipes at the beginning and you have to make it or find one in the wild to give to biv. Which completes the quest. Theres also a new random encounter where a robot sells 2 lemonade recipes. 
---
Where did you get the wrapped cap and tattered field jacket?
---
Yep really handy. But honestly after contracting the same disease a thousand times, we should build up some resistance to it.
---
I'm too much of a hoarder and collector to let that petty junk take up my stash, so i keep it on me on all occasions and save my stash for the things that matter....legendaries and hats
---
For real though i spend most of the first two hours of any play session doing inv. Management and i do hold most in important junk on me. Screws, gears, wood, steel, lead, acid, ballistic fiber, they are pretty much the only junk in my stash
---
People coming to my store and blowing it up instead of wanting to buy or trade. 
---
they’ve always done that, atleast in my experience 
---
I don’t think you are ready for this jelly.
---
Can't recall the name of the top of my head but they allow you to over repair your armor or weapon. Also I like a scrapper card, get more when scrapping. Sorry I couldn't recall specific names
---
I got a Junkie's Explosive with Vats reduction on a 10mm, I felt pretty similar haha. It takes slivers off of your AP
---
It takes a minute to fully charge, but you sure would be able to one shot anything if it worked right. Then there's the sneak bonus for the double damage also.
---
Also Healing Factor and Carnivore are good to have with this roll. And if you're not planning on using energy weapons Grounded is great!
---
1
---
Bah beth always favors stealth I refuse to conform! 
---
Seriously though, if i had a giant axe and came across some dude in the wild holding down a wolf and just calmly drilling into it's head to kill it, i would probably just slink away quietly and hope he didn't notice me.
---
Yes I know u can change category.. If they are all unlocked at 50 than that makes sense. But it wasn't like that couple monthes ago. That's why I asked if the changed with update
---
Wearing 2 points worth of perk cards is far from managing them. The benefit far outweighs the 2 points given up for them. Mutations are a major QOL feature and only 2 points to keep them is nothing. I use 8-10 mutations and couldn’t imagine playing without each one. 
---
Server crashing just as we killed the scorchbeast queen🤬
---
I don't scroll the map looking for them but if I come across a low level and I know I have something for them I'll give it to them. 
---
I agree. I definitely think power armor should be more custom. People could do so much to make them unique and they would be more valuable too. 
---
There was one time either during the beta or just after release where I was just trying to do my quest at Morgantown Airport and three dudes came along and started chipping my health away through the slap damage. Moved servers quickly enough but it was annoying to see people like that playing the game.
---
Otherwise, it would be the time I was trying to get enough commendations to hit General with my buddy and I kept getting disconnected during a Bot Patrol event. Thankfully the game's somewhat more stable now but at the time it was a real struggle just to stay connected.
---
I don't expect anything from this game. The fact that people are paying 500 caps just to have their armor painted would lead me to believe they would pay the equivalent to paint their own. If not even if it sells for 1 cap I still made a profit. I'm just having fun playing with fake money in a fake world. 
---
Oh my god that would instantly go up on my camp in neon lights if this poster somehow made it into the game.
---
I would just place a group of them somewhere in the woods to add a creepy aesthetic.
---
It's my sworn duty to exterminate these abominations in every form.
---
For the sake of discussion let's use Destiny 2 as a comparison.
---
Base game came out and a few months later we got Curse of Osiris, and a few months after that Warmind, and after that Forsaken, and Black Armory after that with more to come. Each one of those where a whole slew of new missions with content with-in the seasons of the game. 
---
So far all we have with this game, which I still love and support, is a way to keep our characters inebriated till the next mini content gets release.
---
Yes they separate, so no reason why not, just like regular recipes.
---
I found the plans twice when the door was open, yet they were never there when the door was locked. 
---
Dude, the BoS and Enclave are done for in Appalachia.
---
Except the missile launcher and AGL don't get to double dip. The heavy weapons damage perks specifically exclude explosive heavy weapons.
---
I don’t store low level stuff. You don’t have to storage space to hold things to give away. If I come across a lower level person and have some things on me I’ll give them to them.
---
Repairing: Fix It Good for armor, Weapon Artisan for weapons.
---
Crafting: Gunsmith for ballistic weapons; Makeshift Warrior for melee weapons; Science, Science Expert &amp; Science Master for energy weapons; Armorer for armor; Power Smith for power armor
---
These are all Intelligence perks.
---
Yup problems since the beta. One of my characters has no friend list at all.
---
I have yet to kill a scorch beast queen. Not for the lack of trying. And trying. And trying. 
---
I’ll check the map and do this when I get a bunch of plans built up. What’s common for long time players could make the day of someone new. 
---
50's always been the max level. The only sort-of exception is it's not based on your LEVEL, strictly speaking. It's based on your "spent perk points". If you're level 50 but have 6 saved perk points, you're only going to see level 44 and below cards.
---
Painstakingly digging through your stash, traveling to the player, spending 5 minutes getting their attention, dropping the item and spending ten minutes jumping up and down while shooting the paper bag  only to have them give you a thumbs up and run away without even looking at the bag is the quintessential Fallout 76 experience.
---
Keep in mind, you can get calibrated shocks for excavator netting you a plus 200 carry weight.
---
Me too. I've just kind of taken to it as a form of stash management. I built my camp in the Forest so I always have a couple newbies running around. Anyone who actually happens by my camp has gotten a fully loaded hunting rifle built to their level. Love helping new Vault Dwellers.
---
I spend the first 30 min selling everything I can to vendors, and the last 30 min with a full 800 stash switching to excavator PA with calibrated shocks, drinking whisky with Party Boy for strength, eating grilled rad stag and popping buffats until I have nothing more I'm willing to part with before logging off so I can just sell the next day again.
---
This is epic. Best 76 video I've seen.
---
Pretty old post BUT im sure you have learned about class freak by now. Just propping it here in case someone got a mutation and looked it up and thought it was cool but did not like the downside.
---
Would you guys stop comparing this shit to Destiny and No Man's Sky. It's getting fucking old.
---
I use T60 for nearly everything because I think it looks the best. Its looks sleek, old school and it looks mean. 
---
For the same reason I choose to drive the original Dominator in GTA online. You like what you like!
---
I'll admit it does take some...effort sometimes, but the payoff when they actually get wtf you are doing and give you a big heat emote and thumbs up is pretty damned satisfying.
---
I do a lot of trading and collecting. Iv met some great people from all over the world just doing that. 
---
45 
---
I usually hunt low levels then after my hunt proceed to gift them for their troubles and offer assistance in missions. I will track someone across the entire map over an hour if I have to just to get a hunt on
---
Only works with doorways when using brick walls. You also have to have a floor or foundation between the 2 walls to do it (you can't place a wall hanging off the side of a foundation or floor as it's technically floating). Place your first doorway where you want it, then the other doorway should click into place behind the first one with almost no effort. After they're both placed, you can just select the wall, hit "replace", and then change them to whatever wall type you want (if you don't want a double sided doorway). It's really easy to do.
---
I believe it's scorched. Unless they changed it, not entirely sure.
---
Did that just the other night. There was an AFK player in Grafton I think? Did some stuff around there then dumped a shit load of plans in the trash can, got their attention, then bounced after they gave the thumbs up after looting the can. Felt good man.
---

My go to melee weapon is an Instigating Sledge. It's only 1*, but i like how i can kill most regular mobs in one swing if i have the right perk cards equipped. I have a couple of other 3* melee weapons that are better dps, but they just aren't as satisfying to use.
---
The two are. It mutually exclusive.
---
Lol, we do that now with mules? Every online game with this kind of system has being using mules. I do it in bdo, eso, fo76. Literally everything with limited inventory. People have been using this since these systems existed. 
---
Those are for a song's composition aka sheet music. 
---
The other part of a song is its recording. They have a different copyright situation, notably because they didn't exist when the founding fathers wrote the Constitution. These were given copyright protection with the Act of 1976.
---
However, Fallout's music falls into a specific category since most were recorded before 1972. All pre-1972 sound recordings are under a blanket copyright until 2067. 
---
This also happens to be 10 years before the bombs fall in 2077.

I've gotten pretty good at stash management. Only keep what I need for junk. I don't have a huge camp and it's in one of the safer places of the map so upkeep is low. I tend to have plenty of space to keep weapons I get from lower level daily quests.

 Mine stash is so simple its over 90% junk. I don't have anything. ;(
---
 But I find all kinds of nice things, like in Wendigo's tummies, and I'll usually  give that to the first person who will talk to me. ;)
---
Put stuff in the overseer’s caches is a better method 
---
So is there still one for the camps or have hey removed it in an update. I’ve put down all the rugs I have and still it doesn’t change my fast travel point

Good on you helping a fellow Dweller out.

This is an incredibly risky request for anyone willing to do it. They’d have to give you their account info for you to home their account to your Xbox and vice versa.

Fallout's version was written by Hal David and John Cacavas and has a different melody and lyrics. Here's a [Billboard article from 2003 talking about the album.](https://books.google.com/books?id=mA0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=billboard+%22singers+and+swingers%22#v=onepage&amp;q=billboard%20%22singers%20and%20swingers%22&amp;f=false)

New Vegas had plenty of other songs recorded in the 90s all the way up to 2009.

Aw c'mon don't pick on the youngsters.
---
Is your body too bootylicious?
---
Fallout has used music recordings from every decade from the 1920s to 2009 even excluding the BoS.
---
I am going to be honest. I didn't think of that. Someone is going to shit themselves in a minute.
---
You can easily transfer items to a different character if you have a friend to help, give your friend the stuff you want to transfer and then swap to the new character 
---
FO76 is installed on a 6 Tb Western Digital HDD (7200 RPM SATA 6Gb/s 128MB Cache), though my boot drive (Win 7) is an older 500 Gb Western Digital (7200 RPM SATA 6.0Gb/s 32MB Cache).
---
Just yesterday I had a 250 Gb SSD installed with Windows 10 on it, so I have the option of installing the game there if I want to use Win 10.

Why? Is it not a valid comparison of game traits that we should be looking towards for the meta? Not the content itself but the format.

Morning MTN time? IGN skinnyhb lvl 112, happy to help, we have the parade launching tomorrow, I hear teams may make it easier
---
Most are scared for their lives. Btw in my opinion, helping lower levels was a 50/50 enjoyment for me. I've met some really greedy ones that I regretfully helped. So I just don't do it anymore. If I wanna give stuff away I just drop it. Could care less who gets it. It's all just junk anyway. 
---
lol buy any executioners gamma gun. Grief section over lol
---
Lol nice! I know what you mean though. Hearing how happy they are is oddly satisfying. 
---
Ah, I don't run PA. I should cuss I do have three full sets. But I like walking around playing fashion souls more than not getting my butt kicked.
---
Aesthetics first, practicality second. Is my none serious motto in life.
---
Pvp man. That's end game. 
---
I’ve tried that several times, haven’t had any luck with it. I’ll give it another go! 
---

---
Lol it's not that bad, I get em once or twice and then give them high tier stuff
---
Do people really pay that much for them? I can make them. 
---
Glowing Liberators? 
---
Check our r/outside
---
They may be able to help.
---
Yeah I can imagine it easily backfiring
---
Too bad your not on PC, i just gave away a 3* tse pump shotty, was clearing out my stash. 
---
Melee is fine for the Queen, though I prefer heavy weapons. I spend most of my time grinding legendaries, though it's not a chore for me, I enjoy the dungeons and events that spawn them. You don't need to kill the Queen to get Prime receivers, the regular SB drop them too.
---
This one has the highest defensive stats for both dr/Er.
---
Make sure to get the "glowing meat" off of them 😂
---
They’re wrong t51 is best for both ballistics and energy, xo1 is only the best for radiation resist.
---
 Yeah, its just best not to believe the number. ;)
---
I’m fancying to get an ultracite Gatling laser, what events would I have to grind for that? Also, thanks for the response I didn’t even realize the prime receivers were what I needed
---
If anything, I feel like can trust people who sort by new here
---
Lol 4 man team, I’m sorry you don’t think highly enough of yourself to have a fair fight. I love to PvP but the whole 4v1 thing is so weak 
---
Love my excavator armour works wonders for me.
---
Can't think of moving onto another pa set just yet 
---
Theres no doubt bloodied does thr most damage, and must be the best build for boss battles. Pve against standard enemies is easy enough that anything beyond a super sledge is overkill.
---
I'm wondering if my cavelier vanguard, aae pump action build is better for PvP though. I wonder of I could take enough shots or one shot you. I'd like to test it out.
---
I totally get you. I have a friend that headhunts bounties. Doesn't matter the level. If they happen to respawn on the same map he'll go over and give them gear to compensate for the bounty.
---
Don’t give people dysentery lol. 
---
I  noticed on spoiled meat it lists a chance of disease. Uncooked no, bit on spoiled yes.
---
thank you for the quick reply, good idea, but unfortunately none of my friends currently play or own fo76 (they are on division 2 atm)
---
so there is no "shared storage between characters on the same account"?
---
also, do you think I can run two instances of fo76 on the same PC?
---
I'll do it for 25 caps for each piece, but can go lower. Just give me your psn name so I can friend
---
I’m 40+ first time Fallout-er, level 22 and fucking loving it. 
---
Sadly I dont know of anyway to transfer without a friend :/
---
I definitely know what you mean. My buddy and I do the same thing: we farm plans and weapons then give them to low levels. A few weeks back we dropped two bags on the ground for a level two or three character, which we shouldn’t have done, but the person didn’t know how to trade and didn’t have a mic so we couldn’t easily explain it. These two assholes ran up, killed us both with like two shots, and took everything we dropped for that person. One of them traded with me before he killed me and I saw that he was wearing all assassin’s armour. Tonight we had a guy get greedy at the Whitespring, wanted to take all the kills, so he whipped out an explosive weapon and obliterated us. We both have explosive weapons too, but he was killing us before we could fire a single shot. Server hopped and it happened again with two more people. We decided that twice on the same night and down more than 1,000 caps plus a shit ton of junk was a good place to call it quits, y’know?
---
There’s no future for this game anymore.

I’m assuming us in Australia, have to wait till it’s released in the US, correct?

I did another playthrough on the original in January. I realized that the first time I played I was 1 year too young (15) to enter my real age into the character creator, and now I'm 1 year too old (36) to use my real age. 
---
You've blown my mind, on top of walking around over-cucumbered all the time I have more diseases than Mr.Burns did in that one ep. of the Simpsons when they all got stuck in the door.
---
I believe its coming out for everyone at the same time

I own a discord dedicated to Fallout 76 for PC players, if you’d like to join.

---
40+ person here. I love this game.
---
What ingredients, exactly, do you need? I may have them. I'd hate to see someone miss out on a challenge because of a few missing items.
---
Here is what you should take in... Don't waist your resources on an awesome camp. Screw that, someone is bound to mess it up. Just keep it simple and don't put any locks on it. The more glorious you make it the more likely someone is gonna trash it. Especially at a low level. Use your resources to craft weapons and armor so you can scrap for plans. 
---
As for the quest line. At level 17 you should just be exploring. The quest will activate when you find certain places. I would suggest you halt your quest search until you are a higher level. Wait til you get to 50 and figure out what build you wanna run (mele, shotgun, rifle, etc). Those perk card choices are gonna stress you out more than the game itself. 
---
Save your caps. Follow the social media posts on here as well as Facebook (if you're into that sort of thing). Slot of good weapons and armor are sold there so save your caps. My first weapon I bought was a TSE pump shotty. It was a game changer and worth the 1500 caps. 
---
The key is to keep grinding. At 140 I'm still finding places I haven't discovered. 
---
Welp, nothing over here yet so I guess I won’t be playing it until the 20th of March lol
---
Hey I play on PS4 my gamertag is ThePhychoGamer but the only problem is I don’t have internet (yet) im getting internet on wednesday though so its up to you if you want to wait (or not) but yeah.
---
I would like to know this
---
This was my biggest complaint.
---
That and the elevators in FO4 are still broken...
---
They only added more Paintjobs to the tech data reward list with the latest patch, so maybe that's why lol
---
what if I create another account?
---
1) can I run two accounts at the same time on the same PC?
---
2) if not, then how can I share items between my accounts while one is logged in and the other is not?
---
You said "xbone" lol
---
You can still acquire diseases if they're spoiled. 
---
You assume correct.. All updates have been at 9am PST time of the day they list. Like all gaming companies, they always fail to release the dates and times it would correspond with in other locations. 
---
Yeah, dang that stinks oh well. Thanks!
---
It would be really cool to have armor stands you could put specific items on and then get the total stats for the whole group, make comparing different sets and builds so much easier. 
---
thank you for your reply, at what level items becomes interesting/worth to trade with other players?
---
Hit the nail on the head. I tried a couple times but it's honestly just a waist of my time. 
---
Cheers for that!
---
Joining in ready to slay!

Mb != MB
---
There was a workaround involving stashing all fusioncores, heavy melee to drain current core, then killing yourself and relogging at death screen to fix the problem. 
---
Wish I woulda known that. Once I reached that place I never went back. 
---
Easiest to repair, you though have helped immensely thank you! I’ll keep a t60 and t51 set!
---
I’m on pc but thanks friend!
---
Heard t51 was for combat but t60 was easier to repair
---
There are so many recipes 
---
BM
---
Do you have a list?
---
 Your 100mb/s is about 12 MB/s, so its doin' real well actually.
---
Just got off for the night. But if no one vaulenteers, ill run you through it tomorrow evening. Psn: MadDogTannen711
---
Actually let me correct myself 9am EST 
---
Quick question on that though. Does whatever I drop persist or does it go away when I log out. If I am going to try and make someones day I want to make sure it's done right.
---
I'm so hype for it, I collect cosmetics so I'm gonna play it over and over!
---
It’s gotten so much better
---
Pvp mate.  A good 400 one taps Unyielding Sentinel.
---
You (or a teammate) owned a workshop. 
---
If i tag your workbench while you and i are hostile.. Any damage I do to your base doesnt add a wanted level. 
---
Otherwise explosive weapons would damage player built things on the workshop creating an unfair wanted level while PvPing. Thats why it functions that way. 
---
How to use it is to fast travel to your target just after tagging their workbench. If your lucky enough to find them sitting at CAMP, spray away, you won't pick up a bounty from damage done to their CAMP. (Thats what someone did to you)
---
I suppose its that way because people would build CAMPS with sniping vantage over a workshop. If they close themselves in a locked base its only fair to be able to smash your way in. PvP is initiated.. 
---
Bethesda made it so while workshop PvP is active no bounty is  gained from CAMP damage. Ive never tested to see if SLAP initiated PvP allows for the same effect. 
---
Pro tip: if someones wanted, you can smash their base without getting a bounty.
---
PvP mechanics are complicated!
---
I think they should make the griefers pay for the CAMP repairs. If they don’t have enough resources, they go into negative. 
---
It won’t be as much fun if they’re paying for it. 
---
Yeah for sure. It's meant to come out on the 19th, which is today (In Australia). So already by tomorrow afternoon/night we'll be able to play.
---
I'm playing sneaky sniper and I still can't make it to the east of the map because I feel so weak and I hardly do any damage to anything, even from sneak-mode. What am I doing wrong? Have I just been unlucky in weapon drops and not picked up anything good?
---
I can help you when you want! My buddy might be able to pitch in as well. My PSN is radiationdaddy
---
It's not PvP builds, it's just total lack of any balance in the game.
---
Sorry I meant I’m interested in the answer lol
---
Use them to your own discretion.
---
Party Boy sadly has no effect on any of the new drinks as far as I know. Only use for the perk is for melee or carryweight. Just drink a whiskey and enjoy your 6 strength. 
---
I miss living in America so much 😭 
---
I always take a weekly trip out to the quest driven ones. Take a penny leave a penny kinda thing. 
---
Well I love the game. Honestly the random disconnects and game freezes are not that bad. More recently, they just don't happen as often. Maybe once in a 5 hr play period. After 250hrs of gameplay, I'm still here. It keeps me entertained. I bought RDR2 prior to this game and haven't touched it once I got this game. 
---
I remember this was changed on the second or third beta session to prevent bodies from falling through the world. I tried powering Poseidon on launch day and every enemy I killed hit the ground like a sack of lead. Most of them fell through the ground, or through a platform to the ground below. 
---
This is so old news 
---
Still a bit confusing, how this chews through Steam games, but this just takes the cake apparently.
---
I got out of High School 2 years ago. Played F1 and F2 when I was 16. Got hooked on the series from F3
---
Military one is for becoming a general in the enclave
---
One should not lose access to other games for being banned for misbehavior in this game.   
---
I can't think of what could be the cause of your issue. 
---
3-4 seconds stutter reminds me of older Gamebryo games on slow hard drives where it would stutter to load in the uGrids. 
---
I wouldn't think 7200rpm drives would be an issue though. I don't know myself since I've moved entirely onto SSD for OS and Games, only data and work apps are on my traditional 7200rpm drive.
---
Are you saying fallout should be listed, and you can flip the switch for it?  Because I don't see it in the list of apps.  And yep, I'm suddenly microphone-less in Win 10, when it had been working fine since beta.
---
Oh noes!
---
I have to clear out my stash again!
---
Sometimes those ghouls have legendaries on them even when they're just regular, nukezone or no. It's a glitch nobody seems to complain about for some reason ;)
---
Sept 3 1997... the release date if fallout 1. Another excellent game was xcom enemy unknown from the same era. Also has some decent recent releases. I was almost out of high school when fallout came out. I was a senior lol.
---
Finally a raider sub. 
---
Its not using the Steam Launcher? It works well for me and has since launch ... well there was this one time. ;)
---
gonna get downvoted for this but i didnf like rose or the raider questline, fetch quest upon fetch quest
---
and the ending to it was eh too: "go to the charleston building and do something"
---
then "i lied i just wanted to steal the loot and keep it for myself but then i felt bad so take the loot and go"
---
like, yeah play into her raider personality but dont make me spend fucking ammo and caps only to redirect me back kus she lied
---
Server hopping doesn't quite work like it used to. Stashes will no longer regenerate like before. They seem to all have a time limit for regeneration. For example, you get a quest for the new BIV character, you can't just do the quest and server jump. Not will the caps stash regenerate  when you do. You will have to wait the 20hr server refresh to get your loot. I'm not 100% certain on this as this has been my only experience thus far in farming weapons and cap stashes. 
---
I woke up in the same exact place. Creeped me out so I jumped off afraid I was next
---
I’d also like a cooking stove that doesn’t look like a dilapidated pile of shit. 
---
I myself met some really awesome guys from new york state that I rolled with for a really long time. We sorta fell out of touch naturally but they were all a good 20 years older than I was. They even sent me a pretty sweet care package of used PC parts.
---
Good guys, shout out to Five Alive, Tenderplacebo and P2J2
---
Since the Flatwoods Monster is a Zetan, I agree, he needs some pals.
---
So we have a chem addicted robot and an alcohol addicted robot .... what is Bethesda trying to tell us about the future?

His build sounds a lot like mine.  And I don’t PVP.  
---
#SIT!
---
OP DONT LET US DOWN!
---
Yeah. I'm a little miffed. Just made a bunch of Ballistic Bock and was hoping for insane ballistic dmg.
---
Yup I just turned down the chat volume, left menu, and put it back up. It fixed it.
---
Gun powder and ore just to name a couple big ones.
---
Good luck to everyone hunting your dream mask!!!
---
It should stay. I’ve had people put stuff in suitcases only for them to log and still be there 
---
This is already the top post currently on this sub.
---
I think they reduced the usual and most popular grind in the game to force us elsewhere. I think they nerfed that place unless there is a bike. IMO WesTek is still a better farming place. You get ammo, caps , and at the minimum one legendary sometimes up to 4. 
---
Well people have managed to use things like the small cooking stations to clip through terrain and be able to build under the map, so perhaps this guy found a way to clip through the ground with that chair, which is how you enter the base.
---
There is the mythical flat woods monster? That thing looks like an alien.
---
Yep this.
---
Yeah that was my problem lol. I completely forgot it was the start of a new week (Monday and Tuesday are my “weekend days” when I don’t have to work so it slips my mind sometimes) I got all the way to the end where I could launch the nuke, went to nuka crypt and it wasn’t solved yet. The Seinfeld theme went through my head as I sat there like “well what do I do now”
---
I want to be able to place this in my camp
---
I just want a nuke cola door
---
Cool thanks. Going to drop some stuff tomorrow morning when there's more people playing.
---
This thread made me realize I should ask my dad to play. We've never done anything like play a multiplayer game together but any day can be the day you start something new.
---
For sure. 
---
My suggestion would be to change the perks description, make it a one level 2* or 3* card. It should keep the triple effect for normal alcohol and for the new ones it should add an extra effect that is neither useless nor overpowered. This way the perk would finally be useful for other things then melee builds or getting +30 carry weight for fast travelling. 
---
Nerds down fire/explosive damage you take
---
 For how long? One of the problems very high speed weapons have is they get used up fast. I've played with a few and always go back to 200% Repaired Combat Knives. I have a few. ;)
---
I generally feel that way in all aspects in life. I communicate and get along with 40+ year old better that people my own age. There just easier and more fun to talk to. 
---
If you want to save space, don't carry any food around at all rather than letting it spoil--meat (or veggies, for Herbivore) is easy enough to find that you're generally better off eating freshly-scavenged raw food than carrying and eating spoiled food.
---
That's because Flatwoods area is all level restricted. Doesn't matter if a level 2000 shows up, nothing will scale higher than ~20.
---
Some people carry around 5+ Legendary "The Dragons". They do it so they dont have to reload and can cycle through guns instead. Its a little quicker. 
---
With the right 2 and 3 star effects on it. A stalkers the dragon comes in handy. + Vats dmg...
---
It a nice situational gun for the Dragon builds that carry multiples. 
---
bad logic
---
Yep!
---
I think a lot of us have been playing since older fallouts. Number 3 myself and I’m 32. I like the idea that you truly have no clue how old someone is without a mic! 
---
Your saying you can fast travel to any player no matter where they’re at if they own a workshop?
---
You’re character dead ass is the exact same as mine. Down to the beard, haircut, and brotherhood scribe outfit lol. Only difference is my hair is auburn not red 
---
There's actually an invisible conduit point you can connect wires to directly above the doorframe and inside the wall. Really easy to connect to, and anything that provides power activates it. Also, the keypad pylon finally works after this update (the switch on it can't be used independently of the keypad anymore), so you can put a keypad on the non-keypad side of the door now, although it would have a different password, and it still isn't as elegant as having 2 physical keypads on the wall itself.
---
I always got along better with older people in school. Not quite adults, but just a couple years older. Even in college I seem to do much better with the juniors and seniors than my own year.
---
I'm not sure. 
---
I was able to complete 2 daily brew quests in 1 24 hour time period. They were like 12 hours apart.
---
good bot
---
Yep had it yesterday. I died.
---
If after 20 hours the vendor says 0 caps, I back out and then interact with them again. Sometimes it takes a few tries. 
---
When the enemy you’re trying to kill runs away e.g. scorchbeast
---
The best part of the whole fallout experience was when I ran into howard/bob as a tree. that story was so nostalgic and heartbreaking.
---
I walked over to it but it didn’t prompt me to do anything so I thought I had the wrong place or something. I’ll have to try again tomorrow!
---
I have those too on my current character. Very useful. 
---
At this point I would quit the game after receiving 700 .44 rounds, as it is clear thay collecting .44 is the core gameplay loop and that I had just won.
---
I can’t live without marsupial
---
So uh.. I love this game, and the parade itself sounds interesting and all..... But, and I fully except the consequences of saying it.. I hate the masks in this game. I think they're immersion breaking and just silly. Whenever I see someone running around in that ridiculous Vaultboy head it just takes me out of it.
---
That being said, I fully support and embrace those that like them, and enjoy running around Appalachia in a clown mask armed with a chainsaw. To each their own, and as long as you're having a good time I ain't gonna poop on it!
---
&gt; I have an interesting theory though. Her name is Rose. She cares for Dave. Dave had a GF named Rosalyn. There is a definite connection, or at least I think.
---
Dave had customized the Ms Nanny in memory of his late mistress. The original Rosalyn died in the Christmas Flood (ironically caused by their Raider band in revenge against the Responders capturing her).
---
Mutations will change your game but you need class freak to minimize the negative effects. I didn't buy mine, I farmed them. Yeah I ended up with some I didn't want but now the serums are so cheap I can rework my mutations. It helped early on regardless the negative effects with class freak applied. You would be at a loss if you didn't experiment with mutations.  Go to Emmit Mnt Disposal site east of white springs. There is a rad shower there and not slot of enemies. You can farm them there to experiment and when you're ready you can buy what you want. Going price is 100-299 caps. 
---
Tell me you have the glasses and you're on Xbox...
---
300 caps?
---
To what extent? I worry a bit being an avid CS:GO player but hearing the community get nervous when any of the pros even approach their late 20s. Obviously this game doesn't require split second reactions and perfect aim, but it's always been a worry of mine that eventually I just won't be able to enjoy the games I've invested so much time into
---
The bounty is taxed 50% by the game. 
---
 - 500 cap bounty displayed
---
 - 1000 caps lost on death
---
 - 500 awared to the killer 
---
 - Todd takes 500.
---
Love it!!
---
Did you use the flamer on him?
---
If you, or anyone else wants to know how you can farm canned coffee, you need the "Can do" luck perk that lets you search food containers for canned food, but for some reason trashcans count as food containers, and Whitesprings has dozens of trashcans in the main building. You'll get a lot of other canned goods other than coffee to, so it makes for a decent food supply. 
---
I am 30 I think I played Fo1 too early (my understanding of the English language was not great).
---
I loved the game though, so it also helped me develop my English. I am currently do another playthrough of 2, did one of 1 just before 76 release.
---
This is good info. Thank you very much.
---
Same here but with rum.  Needed to get a crit on it.  Tried unfermented and fermented rum.  And both at the same time.  With different weapons, ect.  doesn't register.
---
If ya got Plague Walker you can use those diseases to do some damage.
---
If you're a big Fallout fan, there's still probably something there for you, depending on what you like most. The core gameplay loop of exploring, scavenging stuff, and occasionally reading notes/listening to holotapes is pretty much the same as FO4, so if you liked that then there's a lot of that here.
---
Most people who are still on this sub likely still find something to enjoy about the game, so you'll probably get a decent number of reccomendations.
---
My personal recommendation is still to just skip it- though take that with a grain of salt as I wouldn't call myself a HUGE Fallout fan I've just played enjoyed all the titles thus far save for this one.
---
There are brief glimpses of a care and attention in 76, but most of the time it feels barren, boring, and soulless- and not just in the intended post-apocalyptic way. There's just something missing. 
---
On the other hand you won't know until you play it. I would've payed maybe $25-30 just to give it a shot instead of $60, but $40 is a decent middle-ground if you really want to decide for yourself.

Might be on to something there. Perhaps the younger people all left in that initial flood of toxicity towards the game, and the older folks remained. Only 20 myself, I feel like a dinosaur in games like CS:GO where most of my teams consist of mid-late teenagers, but it seems like I'm the young one in this game
---
On ps4 last night invited some dude to try and FT to him and invites some other random guy, both join, fast travel to the guy i wanted to join. Then i load in at the random guys location
---
The game was playable and highly enjoyable at release. The updates have added a number of QOL changes and greatly improved server stability. So yeah, get it.
---
So far my Pvp experience has been sneaking behind people with low health and no stimpacks and beating them to death and spamming the crit modifier
---
I have alot of bloody weapons.  One 3* handmade and numerous mele. 
---
Legendary robots blow up instantly according to a post i read on here a few days ago
---
May as well have a full blown Robomancer build while we are at it!
---
*in my dreams*
---
I'm also facing the crit hit bug during the luck tipsy taste test with vodka.  I tried with both crafted vodka and found vodka and no VATS crits are triggering the quest even though they register with text in the upper left side of my screen.  Hope that helps.
---
You have to use a melee weapon and use a power attack. Just tested, and confirmed.
---
Duh patches have all come at same time.
---
Servers go offline in morning Bethesda time, then depending on size it takes 4-7 hours later the servers are online. I think since last patch was big we already have most of the stuff.
---
Lol me too. Is it on the junk pile? I get lots of notices that someone is camped in my spot these days :P
---
Time to clear my stash and computer storage...again.
---
I think it would be a better idea to have train carts that warp you between train stations for free.
---
Yes it's worth it
---
Comparing Fallout 76 DLC to Destiny DLC is not a valid comparison because the Fallout DLC was FREE. Destiny charges excessively for theirs.
---
Ooh. Not only does this make me money, but I’ve actually been looking for those plans to begin with (though not as hard as I’ve been seeking out the neon lights). Thanks!
---
Not exactly. 
---
You have to watch the map a while. See where the owner is before you tag the workshop. 
---
His dot will disappear the second you tag the workshop. But if hes been heading steadily in one direction, staying still in a popular CAMP are, or doing an event... You will know where to fast travel to in order to kill him. 
---
Fast travel to a nearby landmark and run to where the dot *was*.
---
my post got deleted because of a link, but you can get it cheaper online, try cdkeys, think its like $15. I think $40 is mad expensive compared to what you can get it for 
---
Grahm didn’t like that.
---
I would be surprised if this wasn’t coming with the display rack/cases.
---
Damn son... How many points in STR?
---
Have a Junkies exploding laser rifle, was weak when i got it. 
---
But the recent update buffed if a huge amount. Not it does as much as my tse handmade.
---
It has a better fire rate and cheaper ammo to make.
---
Honestly I doubt it but it’d be super cool if they did; or at least brought back the non-cryptid mutant equivalent, aka Bighorners
---
My farming route is watoga where my camp is to Huntersville to west Tek to whitesprings. 
---
Probably just clips you through the floor and you die falling into the void.
---
Raiders of fallout, not griefer headquarters lol. 
---
Yea lol, I just ran into a dude I hunted a few months back and he went from level 17 to level 160 and he said "Thank you for helping me out and building me a house" (Hes Asian and barely speaks english) but he gave me a fuck ton of high tier loot
---
The stairs are horrible!! And they only center on the wall. If your using a power door you can’t put it at the top of the stairs because it doesn’t line up!!!!
---
What kind of build are you gonna start?
---
Yeah the flames was at e3
---
Plague walker mutation my friend, you’ll find it useful sometimes
---
Unrelated but where are those Point Lookout mutant inbred guys at? We need them in West Virginia and also give them all opioids in their inventory
---
Theres no greifing in this game. 
---
Killed 5 3* beasts around the map and got 5 1* pieces of scrap 
---
Ill provide the screw..
---
Mainly melee, but I'll be using throwing weapons (like tomahawk or throwing knives), and silent weapons like a crossbow. Something that'll make it kind of a challenge lol. Stealth build as well
---
Wait until Bethesda gets their shit together.
---
The game was never "unplayable". It's had/has it's fair share of bugs, and server issues but even on those fronts it's significantly better than it was. 
---
I play on PS4. The worst bug I've had has been the issue where Evan wouldn't respawn on a server after another person killed him so I stalled out on just that quest for a bit. So I just did other things. 
---
I've experienced 5-6 disconnects. Which is pretty solid. 
---
The problem with game reviews now, is that they are less concerned with balanced game coverage and more concerned with views.
---
 No one reads/watches "Fallout 76 has some issues, but is pretty OK".
---
Plenty of people will read/watch "Fallout 76 is an unplayable dumpster fire fueled by the lies of Bethesda"
---
The reviews make it seem like every single player experienced game breaking bugs....which is not even close to true. The reviews talk about "the lack of end game content" like this is an issue for the entire 76 community, when this is largely an issue only for the segment of players with the triple digits play times. 
---
It's a solid game, it's better than it was at launch. It's not my favourite Fallout ever, but it's a nice change. It's a great setting, probably my favorite of all the Fallouts, WV is great. 
---
I'm more than happy with my full retail price purchase of the game at launch. It's a game that's constantly getting better, and will likely to continue to do so as content continues to be added. 
---
I am a long time fan, Fallout 2 being my first game. 
---
It's not a great Fallout game but it is a good game. Although it does have its bugs and issues a lot of them have been cleaned up and most of the dupers have been stopped. 
---
The most fun I have had is being part of a guild and playing with other like minded players. 
---
I wouldnt say the masks are immersion breaking. They look weird for Fallout, sure, but that’s because they just look weird period- they’re based on the actual masks worn by the residents of real world Helvetia for the irl equivalent of this festival, and those look just as creepy and out of place in real life as they do in game. They clash with the Fallout aesthetic as much as they clash with modern America’s aesthetic, so I mean. Seems justified to me, personally. But like you said, to each their own.
---
It just take longer to load in, it still loads in where you were standing when you pressed the drop button.
---
I sure as shit am man lol. 
---
It’s fun if you like building and upgrading. The story isn’t much of a story and bugs make it really frustrating and laggy but it’s still fun. The community is nice
---
i also need it, my PSN is m00n5br0
---
Great art!!!
---
Anything with multiple stars or stats. Everyone wants max level for bartering so sell all the stuff youre not using to clear stash space. Yeah, a 3* middle launcher may sound cool but no one is gonna buy it from you. Save anything explosive or unyielding no matter what the stars. Someone will probably trade for it. Two shots are also a good barter. And I'll buy all your bloody weapons lol. 
---
Workshops flag you for PVP. There's a difference between that griefing.
---
If they actually had legendary effects id be fine with it. 
---
You know the drill
---
The queen will not be alone, plenty of melee only will do the queen just fine.
---
I'm level 137 and only did it twice. Too much work going solo. Didn't feel like dealing the rewards when I launched them. 
---
Honestly I would have agreed were it not for the fact that the last four or five people I met with mics on were like under the age of 13.
---
47 y/o here and I’ll be playing Fallout in the old folks home if I live that long!
---
My kids friends all spin out when my kids tell them that Fallout is dads game, they can often be heard saying “my mum and dad would never play console games”
---
Such a sad life they must lead 😉
---
Meh. Power Armour is for the soft. Might as well call it "Easy Mode Armour"
---
The best thing about not relying on Power Armour? When I do need it occasionally, I have dozens and dozens of cores stocked up. 
---
Imagine getting that upset about something like power armor. El oh fucking el
---
Have fun. 
---
I can't justify setting up camp anywhere that doesn't have a lead deposit. There's no reason not too unless you're building a novelty camp where location takes precedence over functionality, or perhaps setting up shop near a good farming ground. Lead is by far the only limiting factor in ammo production.
---
It’s like that with the sniper barrel on laser rifles
---
I'm fine with this, its probably to reduced stress on the server. 
---
And your turrets load first so you don't have to worry about your camp being unprotected while it loads.
---
I have a bloodied grognaks, so I don't need melee. I feel like handmade rifles are over rated, so I have to pass on that one. Thank you for commenting though!
---
I feel like this is how they intended it to work and they're awkwardly pushing it under the rug.
---
[Chercher la vache!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVsCPsQeaK8)

I've started a new character but it's mainly storage rn
---
I was thinking of leveling it up actually 
---
I might be down to join you
---
With unyielding set on luck 33 right now :) still working on it
---
Bighorners are based off big horn sheep which are only found on the west coast, West Virginia sheep are the katahdin hair sheep( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katahdin_sheep ) of which the males do not have horns  but are very buff so they can’t just reuse the big Horner if they are gonna add sheep to the game 
---
Look for places that have super mutants. I get 3-6 caps off each one. Sutton is a very low level muty spawn place as well as the dried up lake south of that. Then hit Wes Tek and the Gen Stakehouse. I can clear about a grand running that combined with white springs.

---
Eh, I'd argue there's a fine line between raiding and griefing. 
---
Show up and level a base for the wanted level to use as bait? 100% fair game, whiners gonna whine. 
---
Level 120 shows up and harasses a level 30 for shits and giggles, that's being a dick, and the reason the block for session button is there. 
---
Have a low level alt  get wanted and pose as bait for the "big brother" in power armor to demolish any challengers? Again, fair game. You never know who's friends with who. 
---
76 is online. A multiplayer game with heroes, Villains, and everything in between. I run a raider bar and fully expect to have people attack it at some point. But then where is a raider gonna find a drink and some pvp shit talking? 
---
Personally the closest to griefing that i find funny as shit its the Blackwater bandit style, shoot the cars beside a bloodied build, swipe their bag and bolt. 
---
I really like you find them in one two and three.
---
Would you be down tomorrow? I have work in the morning and it's almost 12:30. Sleepiness hit me like a brick wall 😓
---
 Dropping again ~30 mins
---
I believe luck only influences the quality of the weapon, between broke and 200% fixed. We did try high luck and it didn’t do much in the way of increasing spawn of 3*.
---
Sending thoughts and prayers. It was nice knowing you OP
---
How do you do that!?
---
What are those? I’m not exactly caught up with the road map, reading a lot hurts my head and youtubers just ramble on and never get to the point 
---
FYI. Farming stuff limits you to what you can sell to the vendors. There is a limit. Google where the attached boxes are and run a route where super humans are. Grafton has like 4 or 5 cap stashes. That's close to 100 caps for a 5 cap fast travel daily. 
---
 Yeah lead is easy. I have a deposit in my CAMP and I have not extracted it. I take a few ore when its there.
---
 A tin can has one lead. A tin can trap of which there are many has 9 cans. There are so many lead sources. I bulk it and sell it. ;)
---
There’s a YouTuber called JuiceHead that I watch and he talks about every new update to 76 since basically the announcement of the game. He’s more along the lines of the “has a few bugs, but it’s pretty okay” when he talks about the game. Even though he’s more positive about the game, he’s still pretty honest and from what he said I decided to wait, and ever since then I’ve been watching the game to see if it’s AT LEAST up to fallout 4 in terms of performance. If you say that you’ve only had 5-6 disconnects then I’d say that’s pretty solid and gives me hope.
---
Platform? Xbox me if interested will go on a run with u?
---
/r/rorikroll 
---
I’m ps4
---
That's the way it is
---
I pick up so much sugar that I have to sell it to the vendors. 
---
I think you need to stop correcting others and start correcting your attitude. 
---
I have mine on top of a mountain at a place where you can't reach unless your character can fly. I have a fuck ton of artillery and nobody can attack me
---
I like to pop on the excavator armor and hit Lucky Hole.  There's a ton of lead down there.
---
I'll suggest this to the team. Thank you mate
---
I’ve been there a while after the area cleared up and their still glowing ghouls! And that’s what I always do with my unwanted legendaries but some people are greedy and just grab up everything you drop and don’t let other people browse!
---
Rose was here looong time ago before Biv. She conviced me, to eat so much humans over 500 hours i spend in appalachia. If they refuse to give you food, eat them.

Still looking? I'm down, Name is epicness254

I always used it when i was running around the nuke zone and it wasn’t until 2 days ago that I found out it doesn’t just work during a nuke zone 
---
I can make it for you
---
Bummer but use I cat and other methods u may find what works 4 u
---
I’ve always wanted to play fallout with friends and even though they might not be the coolest missions ever, being able to go around the fallout world in a guild or with like minded players gets me excited. Even though I’m questioning the amount it’s worth, being dumb with friends seems like a definite thumbs up for the game
---
Didn't know this existed and i surely didn't know how much i needed this in my life until now. Thank you my friend :D
---
I am!  But, I am also on vacay and will not be back home to play til Friday. So that kinda sucks.  You know, told my wife I didn't need to go on vacation because I take one in WV everyday... She was not amused. 
---
I cat?
---
Cat meat adds 2 luck
---
It do be like that sometimes
---
It’s one of the few games where I feel like I fit in at 42. 
---
Hunting rifle sux. With all rifle perks it wont kill super muties on one shot (without sneak), and try to kill group of muties with that insane reload time.
---
My Stash is about 95% Junk. I have nothing. ;( 
---
 I do have lead, large amounts of screws springs etc etc. I try not to scavenge as its pointless. ;) 
---
I remember these from Fallout 4! I'll pass your suggestion onto the team mate :)
---
For me, it was usually mobs that destroyed my plants/crops, rather than them not growing.
---
I had this issue too with another code, my guess bloody mess caused the issue. I started server hoping and found I had a single of that one code. I wouldn’t worry about it.
---
Not enough.
---
Yeah but the blocking star doesn't work.  It's essentially 2 star. 
---
Thanks, I’ve never bought anything from cdkeys before, I never felt like I can trust it, even though I know multiple people that use it. If $40 seems to be like a rip off then I’ll definitely try cdkeys out for a change
---
What's your screen name
---
I like my perks though, and I can do everything I need easy enough without mutations.
---
Yeah! We or we could have a Fallout 76 'Hangin' Tree' with some Griefer Troll 'Strange Fruit' hanging off of it as a warning to the others. 
---
This would make a good mod, actually. There are stocks in Fallout 4 - how's about a set of gallows? 
---
THIS. Pair white knight with fix it good to repair armor to 200% at reduced cost. Pair power patcher and fix it good for the same effect on power armor. 
---
I've gor some
---
Mine is on the cliff above harpers ferry with the dog whose owners died. I've incorporated my camp so it feels like I have a pet dog when I come home 
---
Speed demon, 21agi, som Ap perks = running forever young.
---
I KNOW, sometimes when I get bored, I look up “does fallout 76 work yet?” On google and I head over to the news section and it seems like there’s always one thing after another they keep doing wrong, from reoccurring bugs to banning innocent players...
---
Scrapper is good to have, especially since it receives a buff in the last update. 
---
Trying to get the garage door to work correctly...
---
At the very least, you can put large carpets on the upper floor of those stair to bloack the ugliness, then you can build upper walls over the carpets.
---
Well. You're covering the best spots now. But I feel there are some gems waiting for us to discover. Try Sutton and Grafton. Lots of cash stashes. I think Grafton alone has 5 stashes with 20-100 caps each depending on RNG and perks 
---
Oh, no I mean I WANT, I mean the Raider in me trying to get out, a trap that'll give dysentery. 
---
sniff that's beautiful
---
Word, are you able to access the silos yet? 
---
Wait wait wait...
---
...Wait
---
I...did not know this...
---
So long Disease Cures
---
That would be awesome guys. I’ll add you. I don’t know if I know where my mic is though lol
---
Yeah I agree. I don't have mods for handmade unlocked so I never use it. As well, I think they are over rated. 
---
You need to pray to the RNG God's harder, and be grateful you can even complete Biv's dailies!
---
Have previously let the team know about this suggestion :)
---
I'm anew level 5 player that struggles with food and stuff. In case you're in Europe and have some spare time.... *whistles*
---
You won't regret it. 
---
İ think there is no way but if you lvl up over 50 you can change 
---
I was surprised it wasn't in game when I first started my farm. Farm plots would also solve the issue of when I can't place a plant because it's too close to a bunch of rocks.
---
Added you guys. My PSN name is the exact same as my username on here
---
Thanks for telling me! I just wish they’d fix this stuff
---
I have a bloodied explosive hunting rifle an on average it only does like 220-280 I think! The only reason the lever works so good is the faster follow up shots. Wish it could get a upgrade for the mag. I get it, that’s not real but it’s the damn wasteland and everything is modded!
---
Whatcha got
---
I think it's because the game is all about working together.  It definitely has a lower number of dipshits than other games.  Also, the early hatefest got rid of all those without fortitude or the ability to form their own opinion.
---
I've never seen this bot but that was good lol
---
I’ve never seen this guy!! Lmao
---
Maybe OP didn't mean for it to be homophobic, but it was.    
---
Yes, gamers back in the '90s did say things like that back then because they were homophobic.     
---
Using the term "gay" as being bad, in any way, derives from homophobia.    
---
You can think it means non-homophobic, but that isn't how it works.    
---
Strangers to you will not know you didn't mean it in a homophobic way.
---
I lived there, it's completely acceptable to mount your Chuck Testa.
---
The thing is,  the nuka cola t51 paint is a per server spawn too,  but getting the key is a guarantee as long as you follow the path.
---
This one,  not only are you facing a 1 per server plan spawn but the key is one per server too AND the damn code to get into the key room can be negated if someone gets their code.
---
I finally just teamed with a friend and once we landed on a sealed server we would relay the code,  grab the key, get the plans and jump again to get a key for the one that didn’t get it yet.
---
This.  The key should res pawn every 45 minutes.  Use the same timer the game used for events.
---
It really does. I LOVE the Fallout franchise. I've preordered less than a dozen games in my life, and four of them were Fallout games. I tried to love 76, but the bugs killed all my enjoyment.
---
oh you're kidding me. whelp points spent while high were never mine in the first place.
---
Fair point, if entirely off topic.
---
I’m 5 yard east of you XD I’m sitting of just about every deposit in the game (the ones you smelt from not extractor deposits) the only thing I don’t have is a body of water for my Mirelurk king. 
---
YESssssssss, need this. Don't have too many people I trust with my caps n shit.
---
When I meet new lower levels this is one of the first things I tell them. It's amazing how many people don't know! I was lucky enough to read about it on this very sub early on, a literal lifesaver!
---
Lol yup, I see people there sometimes when mine won't load in. There's alot of veins in the cave directly underneath on the north side too (if you didn't already know) 
---
Someone has already done the nukashine, it's on there and it's good. 
---
Strange, isn't it?
---
I think i have to apologize. I didn't know what got into me, thinking this would be a great idea xD
---
Btw, i heard some rumors about some other massive rpg game with orcs, mages, elfs, dwarfs etc that, according to the rumors, has such a text chat.
---
I haven't investigate it myself, but maybe the devs from bethesda can check it out and ask those devs for help 9n how to implement a text chat in f076?
---
I wish they'd add the stuff from Nuka World. My camp isn't completel without ghoul chairs
---
It feels nice as someone in their teens to know older people are getting into video games. I've met some some old people who always had fun little stories to share
---
Happens on xbox as well.
---
I don't think you're getting the message. Leaving works, sure, but assholes like him are still going to be running around being a nuisance to other players.
---
Very good point. 
---
Pretty sure hes not out for 3 weeks or so.
---
I saw a hacker on the market selling a laser musket!! He said he had 4 and was down to his last one! He just had it posted with a picture of him holding it in front of the watoga station vendor! Idk but it looked crazy
---
Lmfao ok! I was going to say... I’m a really nice guy as far as my wasteland character goes but this would be too much fun to pass up!
---
I've seen that one right after clicking the link and it was very well done. I hope to see more of it since that's the kind of memes im on reddit for :D
---
Who cares? Not your problem anymore.
---
Weird, I have only gotten new recipes. 
---
It's done now. I needed what you can see there:
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/lechattricote/screenshot/11762046
---
Yeah, this is not in english. The fact that must learn two names for everthing doesn't help much. I used the internet to learn it was crimsom flux that i needed, not purple. In that screen they say purple. Weird translators.
---
Also i needed blood from a big bug we find at George junkyard, the wood processing plant and the dunk guy house near vault 76.
---
You see, i translate back to english names of things i see ingame, on my screen and it give weird results. But not as weird as how they translated George's junkyard in my language. It's mean "unloading of the throat", it doesn't even have George in hit.
---
I literally had look up WHY I suddenly got a bounty, because I didn't know the crates were bound. No need to be bit of an ass about it.

---
You have to admit that 95/100 3* shouldn't be dropping trash unless they are more common.
---
I gotta find this doggo...
---
time to nerf water fountains
---
Damn! Thought he was part of this update off the bat. It’s fine...I’m fine...everything’s fine...
---
Thanks foe the tip!
---
Same. I'm also getting a lot of wood armour from 3* enemies at the moment. 2 days ago the Queen gave me a wooden leg. Yey! 
---
So does it have to have one line from power and one from the door to work? (Keypad pylon) I have a lot of trouble with that thing! Also what is the other switch? The one that says you can set it to fluctuate power or something maybe?
---
My buddy and I always look for low levels when we have too many known plans. And I usually drop a ton of corn &amp; razorgrain soups since I’ve had a ton for the alcohol stuff. Im like damn I feel like such a good person today hahaha. 
---
You have to go all the way to May 23rd (or later) according to the road map they showed. 
---
Lmao this is great!! Later....CHUMP.  That’s my favorite when the vendors call me a chump! I know you killed him after right!? 3 stars!!?? Is it totally random or what? I’m trying to find this dude tomorrow 
---
yea i killed him he did drop a 3* item and he spawns at the random spawn locations
---
Raiders vendors. They don't always have it in stock. I see it on the Top of the World train station vendor sometimes.
---
Ah yes, my apologies about caring about the other members of this community. You seem like quite the cynical person when you say stuff like that, ya'know?
---
cool, but panic inducing...
---
Except carnivore, I have every mutation and I love it
---
We're... just... fixing the problem...
---
I would be quite happy if there was a way to prepare a gift in advance (somehow wrap all the items into a just one item) as it happens all the time to me that I forget to give some things like plans and recipes.
---
I felt the same way, all the resources it took wasn't worth it. I did it solo so maybe as a team it would be better??
---
Ok, that one definitely got me! 
---
This is like posting a safe you found and not telling us what’s inside... ahem reddit. 
---
If you’re that into it, get it.  The only real issue with the game are griefers.  It’s way more playable than it was a month ago.
---
Not unpopular. Everyone I have talked to hates that asshole's voice and her quests. All terribly designed and extremely awkwardly leveled.
---
yeah most of the poeple that play fallout games are older. i think its because of the retro theme
---
If you are on Xbox I can hook you up. I think you get it from work shops but I have one to give you.
---
I honestly dislike kids my age. most of them think the world owes them something. i work at a ivey league school. so i guess that doesnt help lamo
---
There used to be more helping in this game... seemed to simmer down though. A couple weeks ago I dumped a BUNCH of ammo on a lower level player. I kept the two ammo types I frequently use and gave the rest to him. The guy was level 36 and replied on mic that I was awesome and I was the first one to do for him and give him free stuff.
---
From time to time I will even give weapons to lower level players that I built from my own mats to match their level and do pretty decent damage for them. They probably don't have all the plans and materials needed (I figure) so I make them weapons. Many times they don't know what to do or ignore my bags... every so often someone will take my gifts.
---
I wish there was more people helping others. 
---
(It's a fucking cop-out isn't it?)
---
With the rate I've been getting diseases that fountain isn't enough. I saw a ghoul fighting a mole rat and caught needle spine without even going near them lol.
---
Dramatic sigh. 
---
Use the snap and ding you get from completing an achievement for Atom Points  and put in a new emote that puts a nice little wrapped box on the ground with a sparkly effect.  
---
Fallout 76 being buggy isn't that weird tho. I'm fully willing to admit I might just not be doing something right, though. 
---
&gt;If you are on Xbox I can hook you up. I think you get it from work shops but I have one to give you.
---
Im on PC
---
Yeah, it had said that I did.
---
Hmm, let me report this one back to the team so they're aware and can investigate
---
So far I’ve had to craft some basic beers and I got the same as you one random beer where I don’t know the recipe for...and a Greek letter but no new plans 
---
This actually is amazing, thank you!
---
what system what user name 
---
Wears combat boots?
---
Some quests give you the new recipes (lead champagne, tick blood tequila) and you complete the quest by crafting them. Some quests require you to consume a fresh, preexisting alcoholic beverage and complete a SPECIAL test to complete the quest. AFAIK:  
---
  
---
Nuka Cola Dark, New River Red Ale, Pickaxe Pilsner, Oak Holler Lager, and all of the "cocktails (lead champagne bellini, tick blood tequila sunrise) are recipes that you can obtain as a reward but the others like Hoppy Hunter, Ballistic Bock, Firecraker Whiskey are recipes that are automatically learned to complete the quest.  
---
This was some rambling, I hope it made sense.
---
Found it there! Thank you so much!
---
Yeah at level 50 you get to choose if you want a new perk or to transfer one skill point from one skill to another each level.
---
This exactly. My group was playing the original pong.
---
I want he OG Garrahan one Inc that comes out
---
I have no idea what cop-out means to be honest
---
This has been a thing since release. It’s not new.
---
Ok, that's what I thought. I'm not getting any recipes though. Besides the Nuka Dark twice. Now I'm just not getting recipes at all. 
---
You literally cannot spawn level 60 enemies near vault 76. Regions are level capped.
---
oh it means excuse nope it isnt an excuse
---
I leveled my alt at WS. I was running bloodied early (about your level) and was moving about in a hazmat suit to keep my rads in check (since I couldn't have starched genes). Sneak attacks. Only rarely would one spot me and rush to attack. 
---
The trading reddits have a karma system. Thats pretty much all you have. Its still blind faith. Maybe sell them and just buy instead of trading. Otherwise standard internet rules only deal with established accounts.
---
This is so heartwarming. Thank you for sharing your story. It's really great to know that you've been having so many positive interactions.
---
On a side note, everytime I see these posts about how friendly 76 players are it really makes me smile.
---
Keep it coming r/fo76. You're all so awesome.
---
Hello! Aussie CM here.
---
The update will be out for everyone at the same time :)
---
Connect a wire that has power to it, connect it to the keypad pylon, then connect a wire from the keypad pylon to the top of the door (not the switch that's on the door). You don't really have to aim at the top of door though, just don't look at the switch that's attached to the door when connecting the wire. Until the pylon has been activated by inputing the correct password, the door won't be powered on. Works the same way as a regular switch.
---
I assume you're referring to the "Power Counter". Until you have a terminal you can't really do anything with it, and even then what you can do with it is extremely limited as it really works well the the interval timer, and both were introduced in the Wasteland workshop dlc in Fallout 4, but the interval timer doesn't exist in 76. The interval timer when connected to a terminal lets you set it how long you want it to power on and how long you want it to power off, so it was great for clocks, lights, and even some contraptions. Paired with the power counter it lets you simply do more things, especially clocks. Without the interval timer, the power counter is pretty much useless.
---
Does karma indicate that the trader isn't a duper though? It'd suck if I was to get a weapon only for Bethesda to remove or even ban me for it. Also the problem for me when to comes to pricing is that idk how valuable the weapon is. 
---
Well, that's because it's an automatic energy weapon.  
---
I should see what damage they toss out now with teh buff. Hrm.
---
&gt;Perk cards stack multiplicative which means you want more cards rather than bigger numbers on a single card, see below
---
Omg that video is horrible with details. You add level 3 expert gunslinger giving 20% more damage, yet you say it gives 30%. 
---
"You claim ((70 x 1.1) x 1.1)x 1.1 = 93 " yet in video it's clearly 91 because it's 3x10% increase. Only pistol and rifle cards are multiplicative to each other. To their own kind they are additive.
---
Thank you for the advice! I lack a Hazmat suit and my Rad-X did nothing. Granted, the whole ordeal was deliberately a suicide run to acquire the sword. I don't think the developers knew just how high level the WS enemies would be and how absurd approaching the zone would naturally become, due to how many quests bring you there. Again, just doing the Mistress questline. The historic sword you get is level 1, then I beat up some deer and ticks outside of Vault 76. I did get the level 25 variant once I finished, but it's somewhat absurd that I went from one of the most difficult situations I've encountered in a game at 31 years old, to whacking level 1 ticks and mole rats with the sword I got. One half of the quest was barely feasible, the other half could be accomplished by a new player at level 1. Granted, I love that there are leveled zones and actual challenges rather than Oblivion-esque level scaling where you go from fighting rats to all of Cyrodil having a glass-war-hammer-wielding Minotaur infestation. lol
---
There are several mistakes in that and your video.
---
Get lead belly and Carnivore. Collect ionized meat. Get 40% hunger satiation per piece with zero rads, zero disease chance, and no spoilage. 
---
Considering there are hundreds of thousands of potential combinations, I like the randomness. The only thing I wish they would do is guarantee the stars. 3 star enemy = 3 star item. They are already rare and the randomness of whats in the pool is massive. I believe that is fair.
---
I'm 57 and I've been playing FPS and other games since the days of the very first Wolfenstein-3D on MS-DOS
---
Thanks 👍
---
Will the update require down time?
---
Nah I prefer items that are rare to be truly rare. Too many 3 star legendaries going around. Would rob me if dopamine hits when I see 3 stars on a combat shotgun 
---
I have not reinstalled the entire game but i have uninstalled all the perks, all my weapons, armor etc.  Once i have done that and restarted the ps4 it works again for 5-20 minutes and then all the weapons stats are back to -50%.  Bethesda said in  one of their mails that it is like my perk cards are not working anymore.  For example, base damage for the dragon is like 200.  Mine does 182 or something like that with perks.  All rise goes from 260 to 150 etc
---
don't body shame heavy guns dude
---
You are MacCready
---
Sounds similar to my first WS experience. 
---
I was trying to hit up all the train stations so I could later fast travel, and wandered by the mine that is near the train station there...when all of a sudden I hear the telltale grunts if Mole Miners, super high level ones at that. 
---
I'm not a fan of power armor, so i was just running around with what I had, but wow...I had to run and had like six of them chasing me.  I can only imagine the commotion and how I looked in my Ratty Skirt running towards the train station. 
---
But soooo thankful that there were like three high level players there who took them all out with ease.
---
There’s no foolproof way. If I’m doing an item for item trade I follow two rules: 
---
1. The other player must have an open mic. 
---
2. We agree on an acceptable cap value and sell each other the items for equal values. 
---
The first rule makes it less likely to be a scam. People are a lot less comfortable telling lies with their voice than over messages. 
---
The second means that in a worst case scenario, at least I got caps for my item. It also means that if they won’t agree to that, it’s time to walk away. 
---
There’s no way to know if an item is duped or not, but you should probably assume that the super desirable items are.
---
One in five? Try one in 25.
---
It was data mined for the atom shop that means it will show up in the atom shop as paid dlc. 
---
If you want an easy life, don't head east. Anything from Whitesprings onwards isn't level capped, so if any higher level players are in the area you'll run into max level monsters. The Toxic Valley (north) and Ash Heap (south) are capped to mid levels, so they're relatively safe. Unfortunately there aren't many quests in those directions.
---
As for armor, heavy leather is pretty good, you can buy the plans from Responder vendors, and you can acquire most of the mods very cheaply by building and scrapping level 1 light arms. Mix in a couple of found pieces of raider or metal armor for better physical resistance.
---
I don't consider myself as "old" at 44 but remember that my generation was the first to really see console gaming take off and the evolution of PC gaming.  I like the fact that the FO base seems to be broad and more toward the over 20 and less the 10 to 16. 
---
http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/en.futurama/images/9/99/Bender-obsoletely-_fabulous.jpg
---
Very nice approach. I guess I'll try my luck. Do you suggest I go on discord for it or just post here? Discord traders seem to be only interested in insanely rare legendaries 
---
Yeah I'm hoping that's not the case, as the one in the atom store differs (armour made from ski signs) but oh well guess I gotta use those 2k atoms I earned through playing. 
---
Bethesda mentioned adding stuff in a few months for faction wars so maybe we will get it then? As for the one showed in the data mine it's all atoms.
---
I have a power armor chassis and that's it; I have yet to use it. I have full heavy leather but I also run around in the ratty skirt! I remember envying an NPC in Diamond City that had it in Fallout 4 and couldn't find it. When I got it in 76 I immediately was like, "This is my fashion now. Forever."  No regrets. Except the ten Radaway and poor Snowy having to listen to me Groundhog Day to him and update him incessantly on how far I'm getting. But no seriously, getting that sword was kinda not balanced at all. Fun but yeeeesh. lol
---
Same here, the mobs apparently love destroying my beloved mutfruit plants more than anything. Although I did encounter a scorchbeast that had it out for my carrots.
---
Where exactly it is? What's a gazebo? 
---
&gt; Also you have to be old like us to have played the original games....
---
It’s on Steam though, you don’t have to be old to have played them
---
I have no issue with the fancy version, was just hoping the default one would be a thing. Guess we'll wait and see. Thanks for the reply!
---
True, a thanks but no thanks emote would be nice.
---
I started a second character recently, I appreciate the offer, but I dont want stuff given to me. 
---
I prefer to find it, craft it, buy it on my own. Im a loner 99% of the time, I will help if I see someone in trouble but other than that no leg up for me.
---
My first character was 100% coop with a mate, we shared everything.
---
I just have a makeshift camp near Watoga to save caps fast traveling. I’ll bounce to my camp or vault 76 then to my location. 
---
No worries fellow vault dweller. Secretly I'm hoping for more raider gear and maybe a new gun or two. Don't tell my brother hood of steel buddies tho hahaha.
---
Fucking inspired work. You're a credit to us all. 
---
Glad to see this post got some attention. I was afraid it would go unnoticed since I didn't think many cared about the weapon. Thanks for relaying this to the team and for noticing.
---
I would also appreciate half walls to go with the half floors.
---
What system are you on? I can make some stuff for you if you’d like 
---
Likewise I'm the Elder of a BOS group but made a Raider for fun, so I won't tell if you don't haha!
---
Secret is safe with me 
---
I’m excited but it also gives me anxiety being limited time. I have a lot going on with work and really want those masks. 
---
43 dad here who is still playing
---
Please tell us what the reason is that this has not yet been inplemented, although being adressed by users for a quite a while now.
---
I'm really curious what the thought from bethesda is on this situation as it is now.
---
Same.
---
Can I get a price check? Someone wants mine for 500 I think its low
---
Most of the really active traders are really only interested in the insane stuff. There are a few trading subs here, there’s also some FO76 Facebook groups with people looking for a variety of things. If you’re on a console the LFG posts there usually have lots of trading posts too. 
---
I have so much lead, honestly. I was on a lead deposit for a long time, and when I run out I might move back, but for now I'm good lol. 
---
And yet you made it to level 168
---
Aye no need to be a dick my guy. Someone had a rather large ego 
---
No your not missing anything, I feel the same way as do others I know that play.
---
A lot of fluff not much sustenance.

I just want a fusion core.

Ok so, this is an interesting development. I just had to relog for something, and I got a SECOND quest from Biv today, and from that I got Cranberry Moonshine recipe. Are there 2 quests a day, or is my stuff just super broken lol. 
---
thanks for the response, I'm just having trouble not running into stuff that shreds through my armor or one shots me
---
Reminds me of two douche bags calling me out from outside my camp when I had a bounty on me for accidentally hitting a base.
---
"come out and plaaaaay" so I did.
---
This was back when TSE shotties were a thing, one shot the first guy and the second was like "damn! Nice sho*" and he was dead too :D

It’s right next to the tennis court by the clubhouse, it’s a small circular building surrounded by flower beds and low brick walls, the water fountain is attached to the wall
---
No just pointing out he is either making the whole thing up or at the very least not being truthful about his part in it. Its game mechanics it really is black and white, his version makes no sense.
---
Yeah the cap approach is best.  Identify cap value, charge caps for trade then caps for trade back.
---
I still use disease cures when it’s inconvenient for me to go to whitespring, I use Pharma Farma to hoard disease cures for rainy days (or scorchbeast queen fights).
---
I got hooked on the economy of the game. Since the beginning, I didn’t care about the overseer quest or the factions. I wanted max caps. That was my goal. Didn’t hit it until level 25. Then I got used to just Legendary farming. The hunt. The gamble. Still haven’t discovered about 1/3 to 1/4 of map but own every rare outfit and many rare weapons and always stuck at max caps, which is kind of annoying. 
---
Now I launch Nukes for even better farming!
---
Fallout 76 is what you make of it. This is how I enjoy it. You’re mileage may vary. 
---
I did this quest recently (second character) at about the same level with a couple of unsuppressed shotguns and one point in Sneak. Basically killing one ghoul and then backing off before the stealth indicator got to danger, or sprinting towards the robots when I screwed up. It was terrifying though. Almost as much fun as walking to Watoga Station at level 13 for the Handmade rifle plans. Not the sort of thing I'd wish on unsuspecting rookies.
---
Having played a bit more with shotguns, what you really want for these missions is a level 35+ escort with Enforcer 3 and the ability to shoot at legs. Makes the ghouls a lot less scary.
---
The person that does the voice over, should have their fucking voice box removed.
---
Most cringe voice I've ever heard.

I'm literally the second one and I'm probably the one annoying the first one. Sorry introverts!
---
I just traded one for a sent assassin leg. Ive also seen it go for 1.5k-10k. I'd push for more. 
---
Dying doesn't really matter unless you have junk, so don't worry about dying. If you don't like dying, I don't myself, stick to lower level areas. 
---
just wait till you upgrade the blade itself to bleed ;)
---
I’ll be down to play with you just to help you get through those high level stuff early on. Add me psn steelerwins

I just want to display my PA collection like in FO4

The Gatling Gun is definitely the best heavy weapon in Fallout 76 if you're looking to do a heavy gunner build. It may be hard to find and get mods for, but you can sometimes find it with some 5mm ammo in duffle bags in the Cranberry Bog (you can also find other heavy weapons with some ammo in duffle bags in the cranberry bog - I once found a 50 Caliber Machine gun with 150 .50 rounds in a duffle bag while exploring the cranberry bog) and in the wendigo's loot list at the Whitesprings Golf Club (pretty rare, but I got a gatling gun like this). there is also a chance for the Gatling Gun to spawn in the Steamer trunk in the green locker room at the whitesprings golf club. It has a much slower rate of fire than the minigun, but does the best damage per bullet with 5mm rounds (around 80 without any heavy gunner perk cards) and has a fire rate fast enough to kill large groups of enemies. The Gatling gun is also the best because you can craft 5mm ammo in hundreds - equip the ammosmith perk, and you will be able to craft 180 5mm ammo each time instead of just 100. Combine ammosmith with the super duper perk, and you will sometimes craft 360 5mm ammo for only about 15 steel and 10 lead!
---
Yeah, it was absolutely one of the roughest series of events I've ever had in a game, and I'm a huge Souls fan. It was so beyond brutal I totally gave up on fighting and resigned myself to stealth suicide-running the sword, as I annoyed Snowy every time I died, often announcing, "Wait, stop, you're probably wondering how I got here." Then just walking off. I think he was amused for about a half hour then realized he was in my nonsense for the long haul as I kited level 67 legendary ghouls to attack his base. It was kinda scummy and I feel bad because he was vaguely accommodating, I just had literally no other solution to finish the quest. I can't remember the last time I felt so outgunned in a game. 
---
super duper does work with brewing, it just doesnt proc as much as i like it to.
---
chemist makes sense tho i mean alcohol IS a solution.
---
wish they'd lower the perk cost of professional drinker to 2, 3 perk points to never get addicted is lame, especially with how lack luster most booze bonuses (not including new ones) are to begin with, if its going to cost 3 ranks it needs to also reduce booze weight.
---
after all a professional drinker lugs around more drinks.
---
Both OP and the other guy. The other guy is especially pathetic.
---
Give them Nuka Shine.
---
A new event comes out tomorrow 
---
Love my legendary vampire revolutionary sword with + 40 % swing and serrated blade. Make whitesprings a walk in the park. 
---
This would be great.
---
but I hope there is a good story behind it. Like why would aliens want to invade an nuked planet XD
---
Same
---
If Snowy was level 61, he shouldn't have much trouble with charred ghouls. They're hard for low levels, but weak compared to the glowing versions, or even supermutant warlords. People who build their base on the golf course do so because they want to farm ghouls, either for XP or legendaries.
---
OH! I remember now, omg thanks
---
cheese!
---
Yeah, went i drop a bag, they don't see or don't want to look at it. When i put suff in overseer stash, they take everything, but rarely say thanks.
---
I have a all star baseball bat that is the same, I realy thing it should be legendary but its a craftable weapon
---
I can't seem to find the right gazebo. I've seen small ones, but nothing with water in it. I thought someone was joking with me.
---
That's not what he's talking about. He's talking about quests like the Nuka Quantum paint one. You have to server hop until you get to a server where no one has acquired the key you need yet, and THEN after you get your key, you have to keep server hopping again until you find a server where no one has collected the paint plans. It took me over 3 hours to get my paint plans on a simple quest that would take maybe 30 minutes if server hopping wasn't required.
---
I always get this dude when I'm fighting scorchbeast but never insults me or does anything. And his level is 5 for me
---
&gt;Community Details
---
Stop probing for information. They either didn't think of it, have though of it and had it a low prority, or forgot about implementing it.
---
Most of people now are scared of others. Look in a bag and get their head blown off. Ya know. 
---
On the contrary, I want ALL drills. 
---
Oh it's just a fountain attached to the wall???? I was looking for a well in the middle of the gazebo. Thanks for clarifying.
---
I don’t know anything about the creation engine but I know my pc pretty good and what you write is not right D:
---
My pc gets bored in fallout 4 @ 1440p with everything maxed out except godrays to low, vsync disabled.
---
I capped it at 72fps and I NEVER drop below that. My gpu stays at 65c (msi gtx 1080) and my cpu is at 40ishc. Gpu at 90% usage when Action is going on and cpu never goes above 45% usage (delided i7 8700k @5ghz)
---
I can walk through Boston without ever dipping below 72fps, not even where swan spawns.
---
Same goes for fallout 76, maxed out everything, disabled vsync and capped fps at 100 because of the matching frametimes. 
---
In some places, like watoga, i get 90ish fps with nearly exact same cpu/gpu usage than in fallout 4.
---
Most of the time I can get 100fps with 10ms. My cpu is bored and my gpu stays below 79c. CPU never goes above 50% usage and gpu peaks the 90% very very rarely. 
---
However; next to the frametime issues I got early on on f76 release in instances - which are gone, there was 1 spot I where my fps always went down to 30, it’s where you have to play music to spawn a legendary via event. 
---
I am pretty sure it has something to do with lightning because after the Nuka shine update I get 60fps at my camp ,which is loaded with lightning. Before the patch I could easily get 100fps at the same spot, same camp.
---
Another example: while I did the nuka shine quest, I walked next to a house in Morgan town which got new Lightning’s on its walls. Whenever I looked at it, I got 50ish fps.
---
I have to explain that I literally looked against a wall while getting 50fps xd.
---
I turned around and got 100fps with 10ms again. 
---
I think fallout in generell is one of the only games which you can play literally maxed out (shadow distance, texture quality, shadow quality - but godrays Low on Fallout 4) and your pc still gets bored.
---
I can give you examples for games where the ultra setting is just for next gen, or cinematic use like you called it:
---
Kingdom come deliverance; the division 1(didn’t check 2 yet); gta 5 on release, and so on. Those are games where my pc can’t handle maxed out settings, for sure not fallout 4 and 76. 
---
Ah, sorry man, I’m on PC. 
---
You can find armor plans from vendors. You just need the armorer perk and you can craft them yourself 
---
How the fuck do you have over 1.5k hours? This game came out about 120 days ago. That's over 12 hours a day, holy shit...
---
I'm on xbox and I've been having the same problem. Locations loading in very slowly as well as loading screens taking longer it seems. I also basically have 0 fps when I first load into a world for several seconds.
---
47 year old male, here. Started out on Atari and Commodore 64,now on PS4 and working my way through Appalachia. 
---
He never displayed power armor, which I felt was odd and openly died to my kiting a few times. I offered meds through my narration of the awful state of affairs but he never thumbs up'd my attempts to keep him going. But he was croaking quite a bit, about four times across the hour I was face-tanking the historic sword. His CAMP only a short distance away, it was just so hard to press through. He was certainly killing the ghouls but having none of leaving his base to seek them. Aaaaaand then he quit as I narrated my Google search. How rude! &gt;\_&gt;
---
we really need a "its for you" emote.   
---
Most of em crap their pants when you get near (Including me when I started, power armor can get you scared lol)
---
Level 50 and up your be able to take a perk or move a special point around. There’s also a prestige system coming. No idea what it will do but something hopefully with special points and perks. 
---
Grindy
---
Not to mention the WHOLE first chapters of enclave and BoS are told in this game. 
---
If it's going to go to waste, just sell it. At least you'll get caps from it. That's what I usually do with the food I'm going to lose.
---
And here I am stalking them as a creepy looking clown with cameleon following them from a distance. 
---
Picked up the wrapped cap from a shelf close by the tents around Morgantown. I forgot which school it was close by. The tattered field jacket, my wife got from another player for around 10k caps and she ended up not liking it, I get her hand-me downs :)
---
A combat rifle with a .38 receiver does the best damage for the .38 ammo type
---
I think the Resident Evil solution works well, having a button the player can press to read it in plaintext.
---
i am level 121 and 79 years old. I still play Fallout 4, also. I have about 2700 hours in Fallout 4 and still love it. Fallout 76 is starting to be a grind for me until new new content is released. I did the new brewing DLC but it doesn't last long. Maybe the new content next week will be better. 
---
I try to help new players with supplies, but many times they are afraid of me and won't take the sack of goodies I leave for them. Maybe it's the power armor I wear? I try not to sneak up on them and always wave. I started leaving stuff in the stash box at Flatwood. I don't know if any new players gets the things there or not.
---
Same thing happened to me I was setting up my camp up in white springs and this level 70 hit me hard. Me and like 4 other players tried to take this dude down. I’m 170 and I think the lowest was a little over a 100 and we couldn’t take this guy out.  I don’t know what he was pushing but he spanked all our ass. 
---
Explosive paper bag?
---
I want a white flag comming out the back of my armor to say i'm pacifist.
---
so much this. the lore is all there but kinda anti climatic to read all those entries while someone waits for you to do it lol
---
Cool. Sounds like it would max a workshop's budget pretty quickly but would give raiding mobs something to chew on rather than generators. 
---
I hope the masks weigh very little to nothing so we can collect all of them without worrying about stash space or better yet......display them on our camp walls!
---
I haven't seen any changes to the 20% cap.  hope it's adjusted soon. I can't help other than that though.
---
Sniper really or a machete to the neck. 
---
I used to put stuff in a specific container and message some random that it’s there for them. 
---
Same, could spend the time redos loading, but....ehhhhh. 
---
I never said Fallout 76 end-game was big, I just said it had enough content for release. The longer time passes without new content the faster people will leave which is exactly what you said. I also said that they haven't been able to push content because they've had so many bugs and other issues which isn't wrong. So they haven't been able to work on a lot of content that people want yet. Hence why more and more people are running out of things to do. I personally haven't played the game in over 2 months, but I did get 200 or so hours out of the game before I stopped, which is completely fine in my book. 
---
But once they do start rolling out content rather than fixes hopefully things will be better. They specifically stated the game would be 'as a service' at release. Not 'have 1000+ hours of content' at release. 
---
Like you said though, for the people who *rushed* to endgame, they ran out of things to do quickly but that applies to any game, not just this one. 
---
The whole issue with this release was the amount of bugs and missing features which took up time they would've been working on content. Had there been no issues at release, we would already have more raids in the game. 
---
&gt;There’s no way to know if an item is duped or not, but you should probably assume that the super desirable items are.
---
Weren't people claiming otherwise because Bethesda said they could do this or something before that one banwave that targeted people having or had large amounts of anything at some point in time?
---
I’m guessing it’s too late now- enjoy the inert flux ;). For future, it might be helpful to list your platform so someone can help out :)
---
Yeah, it's really annoying. I hope it's not intended to lose our food / drink buff for logging out / disconnected / switching server. I'm that person who always maintain my weight carry with grilled radstag / ribeye steak + stingwing / deathclaw / molerat steak.
---
I'm actually getting back into the game to experience things like this. I quit shortly after launch but I feel like the game has come a long way already. Nice story, makes me want to play when I get home from work.
---
Only issue I've had is my character strafes left when ADS. 
---
You continue to come up with the most ridiculously awesome ideas. I need to figure out how you did this...
---
Its about 1100 hours. I think i mis-typed. 900 on my main and 200ish on alts.
---
One of the most holy crap moments for me was when I learned that the whitespring bunker exists in real life. Look up for project greek island guys
---
yes its so nic and shiny i want it. I sure tried like 10 minutes to pick it :((((((((
---
Oh, interesting thats Also a console Problem.
---
We had the exact Same discussion for PC players.
---
Mouse do strange stuff and so on. Immediatelly go down or up.
---
It's annoying.
---
I have 38
---
I think the same, it was and experiance that I wouldnt do again unless that add something to the rewards or something changes, definatly the rrs and time you have to put to actually lunch a nuke for what do you actually get is not worth it on my opinion. 
---
If you quit the game because of the content, it is not time to come back... yet.
---
However the game has gained on stability, performance and other technical issues.
---
Can I buy for 350 caps?
---
Curse of Osiris could be completed in under 2 hours and wasn't free. 
---
The AA one for sbq would be best for prime reciever. Things you should know though that reciever can not be changed out once you mod it to the weapon and ultracite ammo is really only worth using against sbq.
---
[Try this](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=fo76+reddit+is+the+game+worth+buying+yet)
---
Speaking of that recipe, I just got the same recipe twice; I got the white russian recipe 2 days ago as the reward for completing the daily and today I got the same thing again. I hope it's not intended to get the same recipe I have learned already...
---
With the frogs? 
---
Sure whenever you wanna I’ll stop by 
---
That's still over 9 hours. How old are you?
---
Bethesda can’t add anymore emojies until I get my middle finger. 
---
it sucks that some ppl play like that but it is part off the game, his not doing anything wrong. his just playing the game they way it should be. 
---
It's only been since the latest update for me. It used to be fine .. then this... Ugh.
---
Rose is in the "love her or hate her" camp.
---
Personally I think she's awesome, here's to hoping somebody makes a Fallout 4 mod with her in it somehow.
---
What time is server refresh? Or is it always different since it’s 20 hours
---
The legendary gear sometimes drops beside them out of their inventory happened to me a lot of times already
---
Restart game? 
---
Tried 3 times lol
---
I farm the same meterails and adhesive but everything else I keep 100 to 150 of each an that gives me room to play in my stash, i just wish i could seel ammo too. 
---
Yeahhh
---
damn. :( best of luck
---
The place I seem to run into him the most is at cliff edges. I know it's not a specific location i just seem to see him most looking out from cliffs.
---
Knowing my luck it will start working randomly as  play, it just wants to be inconvience is all. 
---
Second this. Mothman event was like hills have eyes. 
---
Scrubs gonna scrub, nothing new here
---
When they explode, look up, they go super high and you'll be able to watch them slowly fall down then loot them. 
---
Thank you for that! 
---
Now, have you heard of the mothman cult..?
---
Go eat some of his eggs next to the moth man statue
---
I recently started playing again and honestly it’s one of my favourite games now. I’ve suck nearly 40 hours in of just exploring and looting and collecting everything, I fucking love it haha 
---
Does he have a chance to spawn there if you do?
---
I used to have a similar issue to this with another game and it turned out to be my laptop interfering with controller signal. Are you using a device very close by to your controller that could potentially be affecting it? 
---
Met a dude who I believe was around 74 I think he told me a couple of days ago. He was pretty cool. 
---
Bethesda won’t remove any item you only have one of. The detect duping by having stacks of items. And prices are all relative, it’s worth how much you want it/how bad the seller wants to get rid of it 
---
are you talking about the agriculture center?
---
You know, we are not 'getting into video games' now - many of us were in our teens when video games were invented and play since the early 70s :-)
---
I usually team up in the wasteland with a friend, together we have 124 RL levels.
---
Stfu Eazymac, Sheriff here it's speaking the truth and checking that BS op was dropping. Get out of the kitchen and back to the easy bake oven with app that cheese. Poster picked a fight and is mad house yellow submarine suited gang got whipped. Nuff said
---
If Beth wasn't expecting it, it only shows how bad their design department is.
---
Have you witnessed our great lord and saviour, the mothman?
---
If so, you are greatly missing out my friend, for the mothman is waiting for you, wings open in a embrace! All you need to do is seek him, and he will find you!
---
Is server hopping really "required"?  There may be another path to success for this quest...
---
Waiting patiently for the resource to be available on your server.
---
I mean, that's not as FUN as gaming the system by server hopping, I understand, but...it's not as if server hopping was built into the game for the explicit purpose of people trying to get rare resources because they refused to find them organically.
---
Just a thought?
---
Save a stealth boy for this pvp event so they can’t vats spam you
---
Go to hornright HQ in Charleston. Take the elevator to the Executive level (you need to have done a quest before you can do this) and then the other elevator down to the sub level/basement. There’s a wall safe down there. The only thing of interest I got was a clean miners helmet.
---
No problem! Yeah, i've heard of it anything in particular you are looking for I'm not really well versed on the lore but I know a few locations? Also , There is a guaranteed spawn for the mothman if you do a certain event if you weren't already aware.
---
Sorry your 10 charisma won't work on me. You need 11 to convince me.
---
Very cool
---
Oh, I’m aware if the event. 
---
Would you like to join the cult?
---
Yes, like once every two hours, PC. I could play 10-14 hours with patch 5 &amp; 6 on the same server. My guess is that the new fermenter puts extra stress on the server or that many now try to glitch into those unreleased locations.
---
Don't mind him. He's from one of those *other* vaults.
---
You make our lord sad
---
If you play with hornets nest, 2 3 45755 cans of Hotshot won't save you. If you don't have absolute certainty you got this- then best farm your little ghouly pals and count stars on your zip guns with Captain crunch and skool back at the club house. You have no business engaging in PvP dude. 
---
Found my first AA .50 cal MG...but it was lvl 25 T\_T
---
No thanks, i'm more of a Nuka Cola rather than a kool aid kind of guy :D
---
He will (apparently) be at Berkeley Springs station (not marked yet), at the end of the tracks between Berkeley Springs and Thunder Mountain sub station TM-01. You can check it out now, already..
---
They just updated this thing and now anything besides legit boulders or big ass trees would disappear. My camp is pretty much barren, terrain wise.
---
Public service Wake up call: if someone rushes you without power armor and you think " You got this!" Cause your in power armor- prepare to get smashed into a brown paper bag. The damage resistance you can get plus buff from affixes blows any power armor away. Without counting team mates, mutations, drugs, bobbles, magazines. All those factors play in to PvP. Power armor means LoLz when they go flying wondering how they'll recoup all the screws they just lost in over confidence.
---
I had this exact same problem, yesterday. Solved it by just placing my camp down again, a bit further out. Don't just place it as soon as it turns green. Im not sure if you noticed, but once you cross a neighbor  boundary, it lets you place, but it opens up a new  set of boundaries that are even closer to your neighbor? Your circle crosses over into theirs.  So. Don't place. Keep walking until your circle edge falls outside of that new boundary. 
---
Tl;dr don't place as soon as you can. Keep walking for another half of a camp width, then it'll work fine. The boundaries are bigger than youd expect! 
---
learn it from scrapping
---
Excavator  power armor is the only one I have so far. I usually don't bother looking for different pieces of power armor, at least not now.
---
What do you play on?
---
I’m 39. I only started when fallout 4 came out, then worked backwards!
---
I never think of Skyrim when i hear this line. I always hear the ocean and then the voice of Juib, with a gravelly voice he says hey your awake we are nearly there.
---
If your PC can handle 2 instances yeah, you'll need 2 accounts though.
---
Another way, one which I am not 100% sure about, you can transfer stuff by using world containers. Put stuff in, look on your map to see what players are currently on that server and take note of them. Then switch to your other character, and go to recent players and join off of the people that you saw.
---
okay yeah, that makes sense, i HAVE moved a bit further down now &amp; we were both able to log in &amp; not have to forfeit our camps. kind of unfortunate that it lets you place like that initially if it's going to be a problem next time you log in though. thanks for the reply, weirdly comforting to know it's at least not just me, haha :)
---
I’m pretty hyped about this post! I would never have imagined 60+ yo playing online games but I’m glad they do! I’m 39 and I always feel like I’m going to be the oldest person playing, for some reason. It’s good to know a lot of older people play 
---
Dude, why do you care so much? You're wasting so much effort and energy on someone that may or may not have duped in a video game and already lost his account anyway (I think? Don't really care). You're acting like he kicked your dog or something lol. Find something healthier to obsess on.
---
Never played much of morrowind.. First i was too young for it and later i was used to much more modern technology (oblivion is still my favorite elder scrolls), but i gladly instantly got the reference :)
---
Ps: Waiting for Skywind for the modern morrowind experience! 
---
I feel you friend, I have a 65 hour work-week this week. They are rare, but of course it happens on a week when a big event is happening in-game.
---
I’m 39 and my mates look at me like a weirdo if I mention gaming. Literally none of them play games. I less of a “down the pub” type, more of a play games while the wife watches tv sorta kid. Also, I played f3, couldn’t wait for f4, really enjoyed that. Waited until a few weeks ago and now I’m addicted to f76. Pc all the way.
---
Dont even try to explain the lack of retcon because we have BOS stuff. I'm assuming it will be added into the game as filler content, which in my opinion is fine because they are cool weapons
---
How is he a cheater? 
---
I have always found server hoping design breaking. I mean take the workshops. If workshop you want is taken, you server hop, because it is easier that way. This means there is no action over workshops and that means workshops aint producing what is was meant to be produce (PVP). Then there is this thing where I don't want to take workshop, because I am going to need server hop soon. Well workshops have other problems too, but these were the ones just related to server hoping. Then there are events- you have nothing to do, your server has no events up, you are going to server hop and hope that you find server with something to do. There is more incentive you to server hop than there is you to go and clear silo.
---
Yes the worked somewhat server hoping, that you no longer can farm containers and ores, but it wasn't enough. Server hoping is a still heavy thing.
---
I'll usually fast travel to the vault if I see a level 1 in there. A paper bag of goodies is really hard to miss when you first exit. If I dont have a lengend lower than level 20, making Leather armor with pockets is the most useful thing I can think of.
---
It's only after they've picked it up that I jump out of stealth and emote furiously at them. About 50/50 those that thumbs up back vs sprinting down the hill as fast as possible.
---
Ultracite guns are all messed up due to mod bugs. Stay away from them. 
---
I love when people put a lot of effort into their CAMP! I’ll check it out if we’re ever on at the same time (Aussie here) - my GT is Lady Rot Roh
---
Yes but but but what about loadouts? Hey? Hey?
---
Can I has them? Loadouts?
---
Just bad luck, I’ve seen them 3 times on the same character so far
---
If you're on ps4 I can probably hook you up with some gear
---
I've heard about it but I never found the spot.
---
The game in its current state worth around 20 bucks, not more. Its better since launch, but not significantly. I would wait 6-12 month then get it.
---
And i just let all my cooked food spoil.
---
Just a tip from me: be sure to be above level 50 since some quests reward you with unique legendary gear (have not done many side quests myself, so i don't know their rewards, but it helped me alot to do the last two segments of the main quest [dont want to spoiler anyone] after level 50. 
---
You, sir, deserve all the 3\* legendaries you can carry.
---
He will find you. Eat of the Mothman's eggs ... cook up an omelet  you savage. ;)
---
Yes I love doing this haha!
---
Probably going to be the same weight as the other one 
---
You have a backpack?
---
what set are you wearing, the only one that has natural weight boost is the excavetor PA and you need to have the full set, the oder PA need to be modded to have carry weight, as well as the gear you can wear, you need to mod it to have more carry weight in it. I think its called deep pockets on gear to add carry weight. 
---
PS4 here too.  I get this, but for me only on inventories... it’ll be fine 99% of the time then will jump weirdly up and down the items list... annoying as you might end up trading away your prized possessions... only an issue since last patch/update for me.
---
Collect Wood + Glass -&gt; repair building :-) haha
---
Hey, I'm an Aussie too! I just got off, but I'm on most days for..  unhealthy lengths of time
---
&gt;.&gt;
---
So our paths should eventually cross!
---
Well right now I'm just like level 24 I think, so do you think I should do the side quests first? or maybe the dailies and what not?
---
Feel free to add me on PSN Zan_Wild
---
Don't think I'll be able to complete it as with the biv mission I only got the main one as daily's don't work for me anymore.
---
Whitesprings Station always has metal (by far the most expensive one) and warehouse if i recall correctly. If you need caps, there are many guides and you should do a trader route everyday for 1400 caps a day (travel agent perk is a must for this) 
---
It's like the hole in the toilet wall but with a twist.
---
You can assuming your pc can handle it. Just use the launcher for the first account and then the Fallout76.exe which will prompt you to enter the credentials of your second account. Then alt tab between the two. Possibly run the game in borderless window to speed up the process, not sure tho about that one
---
I’m I little bit worried. My camp is a stones throw from helivita.....
---
If you're on x box, I make custom heavy leather armor for new players. Up to level 20.
---
Not there but eventually he will start spawning and stalking you.
---
This is so \*freakin\* fantastic, I expected nothing less from the Iron Chef himself. Excellent music choices.
---
Is that good ? I never use power attacks because I tend to have a lot of grenades on me and it doesn't really go together, but half my melee drops have that affix. 
---
I assumed it was shitty x) 
---
Yesterday at wotoga I had a legendary robot blow up in the medical centre lobby,word must have got around as I had two before that that exploded :)
---
I disagree- whilst I understand some people want to role play as raiders I really don’t see the point of completely leveling someone’s CAMP when they continue to refuse PVP... you as the raider get absolutely nothing gained and that poor person has to spend valuable supplies to fix it 
---
Cattlepault
---
Haha I hear you. I’ve never really thought about it before but none of my friends are gamers either. My fiancé is though so it’s cool! I mean I love going down the pub and stuff but when it comes to socialising I’d rather stay home and game. That’s probably bad isn’t it? I mean it’s kinda socialising, I’m seeing other people in game haha 
---
I managed to get pretty far in the main questline around your level, but at one point i had problems due to many high level enemies, so i stopped it there and forgot about it til level 60 or so. I leveled pretty fast just exploring the world and doing many events nearby and some small sidequest. Daylies are a thing i very rarely touch, many of them are broken though. 
---
So just go out and explore, craft and do events and you should be fine.
---
Quick tip, boost your xp by sleeping, doing the lighthouse event near the vault, doing feed the people event in Morgantown and grab some cranberries if your in the lower right corner of the map (cranberry bog) and cook them
---
It’s a cheaper hobby, or at the very least a better value for money hobby for sure! Depends on how much beer you’d drink if you didn’t game hah.
---
LMAO true that. I don’t think they have even said specifically what they’re releasing for this, if they did then I never heard it. But this is what I’m talking about 
---
https://i.imgur.com/HFceyJR.jpg
---
Ignore the cryo case and shelves.
---
I'll be getting it for free myself but each to their own.
---
I spent a couple days farming straight jackets from fort defiance or golf outfits from whitesprings for cap runs. I dont know where you could find them besides getting lucky doing events 
---
Damn that's good.
---
I saw the metal set at both watoga traders today
---
Just drink beer while gaming. Still cheaper hahah 
---
There aren't plans for the BoS jumpsuit, you must be thinking of something else. They only drop as single items from events.
---
Lol read it he can’t afford to buy it off a vendor😂. Also mate if you buy some concrete of people on reddit you can go for a foundation stack as walls 
---
I mainly use it for solo play to conserve ammo! 
---
Eagle eyes for sure.
---
Anybody remember the mod for fo3 that gave you an awesome underground base near rivet city? It had a everything and a display hallway with mannequins that allowed PA and non PA armor to be displayed holding weapons. Enclave Tesla armor looked awesome on display.
---
I used to do that - gave up after my second child 4 years ago. Now I probably have one beer every 6 months. Never thought I’d be a teetotaller, but I feel so much better. To be honest, I was becoming an alcoholic because of gaming a beer, that’s no way to live. 
---
I’ve been playing since launch and haven’t had any issues like this UNTIL the latest patch and since then it’s happened 3 times (always pairs of people blowing up my camp until I leave the server)
---
Since you are going to report this i might as well try and explain my situation. I can reliably replicate this instant healing glitch of mobs using energy weapons. If i use my automatic tesla, mobs become undying no matter how much damage you make. Even after switching to other ranged weapons the bug persists, you cant kill anything. You can only do damage if you switch to melee or decide to relog. Note that this happens every time i use the tesla or other energy weapon.
---
More interested in that sheep costume from trailer. Don't think that's a parade item though.
---
My character is already a raging alcoholic I guess a few cavities won’t hurt
---
No, they actually pile up! I had 5 or 6 of them in a heap at one point.
---
The first time I read about this was also confused, as I was expecting standing water. It’s actually just a small drinking fountain, on the inner circular wall, fairly easy to miss. 
---
A few melee weapons and a few heavy weapons.
---
Instigating sledge, furious sledge. Swapping between if i can one hit kill or not.
---
Gatling gun, great ammo efficiency for a lot of events. I swap out damage cards for the heavy weapons if i have to rely on them.
---
.50cal higher dps but same purpose as the gatling gun.
---
I have a furious flamer i take out and a few other for fun weapons but those 4 are my 24/7 weapons.
---
My gold and copper collectors are still ore.. 
---
If you're on PC contact me in the evening (ign same as here) - I got nice LVL 5 3\* Fire Axe that helped me tremendously at low levels, given by other so I'll gladly pass it to other.
---
No, the other one, dome-shaped, opposite side of the tennis courts. 
---
Good luck. A buddy of mine says he gets a rare plan 1/100 maps. He buys all he can until he has a stack of at least 50 of the same map and then does that one 
---
The workshop forced pvp shit is not how it should work. Pvp should be limited to around the workshop.
---
Plenty of assholes in groups with explosive shotguns like to start capturing a workshop and have their buddy kill you across the map.
---
Did they say "I got wood for you, baby" as they did it?
---
Ah that’s not good but I’m glad it all changed for you! I do tend to have a drink while gaming a lot of the time but I don’t drink much of it because I’m concentrating on the game haha 
---
Instigating deathclaw gauntlet for punching 
---
Zealots Gatling plasma for scorchbeast 
---
Some tse stuff for fun and a sledgehammer for when I use power amour 
---
What? So lead collectors produce scrap but everything else still makes ore?
---
Dang it, thanks for the heads up 
---
Agreed that the lack of npcs is the worst factor. Not only that, but BGS doesn't give us the player to fill the role of npcs. Joining a faction doesn't mean anything, the trading UI is garbage, there's no server chat to set up events or trade or mark your CAMP, etc.
---
Such a well designed-, intuitive-, and well advertised- feature even literal people who work for the studio don't realize it exists.  
---
The sad state of Bethesda game design.  
---
Why not just turn your pipboy radio on 
---
I’m currently using a build with a two shot crossbow (only cause it’s cool) and an instigating combat shotgun. Also have an explosive double barrel shotgun with ghoul slayer that I use when I farm, but only when a lot of other players are around and I need to tag a lot of enemies to not miss out on loot. Might get rid of the crossbow later tho, cause it’s using up so many perk points to make it viable.
---
Bloodied deathclaw and TSE Pump
---
47. And actually starting to feel like the young guy in the group. 
---
I dont see a lot of people swinging crossbows. What perks do they work of?
---
No, you should not be able to do this. The workshop area should be the pvp zone and if the owner doesn't try to contest it then there's no pvp.
---
The world literally _ended_
---
Where are you gonn find a cherry-red General Atomics Vaporizer 3000 2077 model stove in the Wasteland?
---
Using a bloodied build here :-). I bring 2 weapons - a primed B/E lever action, and a B/E hardened handmade. One for longer distances and fewer but more devastating shots, one for using in the fray, with faster fire rate and more rounds in the mag.
---
I also run a melee build, got 15 points in strength, with a bloodied/swing speed deathclaw. Other than that, fully upgraded rifleman perks, cause guns ain’t worth running anymore, unless you have the perks for them active. Which is why I don’t use a shotgun, even though I’d like to.
---
There's a limit on how much damage you can take if you're not in PVP. So either you were in PVP and didn't know, wanted, had about 5hp anyway, it was a bug or it's just not true.
---
A lot of posters recently are in the last category  so forgive me if I don't believe everything people say when I have a different experience in-game.
---
Could easily be proved with a video though. Although then the person needs to prove they had no workshops, etc.
---
So you _wouldn't_ try to preserve your food in an apocalyptic scenario?
---
Well, I think we know who we're eating first when the Big One drops
---
They use rifleman. But you also need tank killer and all the crit boosting perks, otherwise it’s useless cause it can’t be modded.
---
Significant increase in damage. Running bloodied+adrenal, if I hit the queen with my bloodied/weight reduced/swing speed super sledge with a regular hit, you can't see any impact. If I hit her with a power hit, you see a small chunk come out of her if I'm low enough health. With most regular mobs, it's probably at least a 3-4x increase.
---
Okay. So its basically a rifle vats crit build? 
---
Gotcha. Thanks! 
---
Id love to play skywind but dont have huge amount of spare cash to spend on games and Im not sure my laptop could cope with it. 
---
I think the game is going down for maintenace before event start.
---
No, its rather that there is no need for PVE gear and the second is that stupid sentinel set. In what other armor set you get 70%+ damage reduction and dumb down game mechanics? 
---
There's people claiming to be 1 shotted in this post as well. It's just not how soap damage works.
---
One of the new alcoholic beverages (lead champagne could be?) provides +100 rad resist.
---
Have not experimented with it myself, should stack I guess?
---
Use with caution, the rad ant beer that gives +50 carry weight becomes -50 carry weight for me after fast travel.
---
Good luck finding 5 pieces of armor with +25 rad resist where the legendary effect actually applies, 'nuff said.
---
Healing Factor reduces the effectiveness of Radshield accordingly, factor that in if you have it. Can't complain because it should block mutations and doesn't; one possible bug that I would not mind if the devs never fix or they fix last.
---
Running down a silo just to end up not being able to launch 😡😡😡😡
---
But they can earn atoms ingame? So that would be a workaround? Sucks either way
---
No, the SBQ should drop best loot in the game, the other 3 stars should drop something between 1 star and SBQ. Because SBQ takes much longer and much more resources than any other 3 star legendary monster. If every 3 star monster is going to drop SBQ par loot, it makes SBQ even worse and SBQ already is crap.
---
Lead never stopped being scrap
---
What you mean about +25 rad resist not applying on legendary armor? I have a few in my stash (I think..). Cant be that popular? Is the effect bugged or something?
---
If your laptop can handle skyrim it shouldn't be a problem. For the mod itself to run you just need a legal copy of skyrim and morrowind (i guess you need the steam versions) which are both on sale for about 5€ a few times each year. Theres also plenty of time left, i read release won't be before 2020. Hope you gotta play and enjoy it :) 
---
My bf has a steel deposit and his makes scrap. But I literally just got my gold ore out to make it into scrap 
---
Thats the issue, This is the first laptop ive owned that can run games which has led to me owning consoles. Never ran skyrim on it XD
---
I feel your pain. When my main did the quest it was easier, he was taller at lvl 50x. My alt in her 20s was brutal. 
---
A suggestion if you’re gonna do this again w/another alt, do the following 
---
Bring PA and sniper rifle.
---
Bring them to the white spring clubhouse bots.
---
It took awhile but aggroing them and leading them to the bots to kill was much easier after their numbers dwindled to 1 or 2.
---
Amazing. Thank you so much for this. I once played for about 3 days with worms, constantly trying to find food which was no fun at all. 
---
would you mind telling me where you can get the axe or at least plans of it ?
---
PC 
---
Okay, did another test, lead and steel make scrap, copper makes ore, tested at Grafton steel yard.
---
Do it, do it now!  My son (44) and I (67) play every night on a team and have a great time...
---
Swing speed is better imo. More useful in a wider array of scenarios. You're more likely to be killing several medium to weak mobs than one big mofo. About the only time I don't one hit something on my 2 hander toon are scorch beasts and other mobs of that caliber so being able to cut through the mobs faster is far more valuable.
---
Oftentimes it won't apply the rad resist value.
---
I was looking into why this is happening months ago but it has become glaringly obvious that user priorities and dev priorities are on completely different and diverging tracks so I don't concern myself with such things anymore.
---
Oh 😂
---
That's so adorable, following them and waving. I'm also low level and when the nuke message came on I thought I was in the blast zone so was freaking out thinking it was going to come down on me - nearby Vault 76 lol so not likely. I was on edge for the whole countdown. Was just relieved it wasn't nearby didn't think to go looking for it. You're far braver than I was!
---
Yeah, that a little glitchy, by damaging your base he should hit wanted, which persists beyond suicide, so I'm not certain why he didn't stay wanted. 
---
As for leveling a base when someone refuses pvp, at that point its not about the victim anymore, its either racking up a bounty for other players to chase, or the player being a salty fuck, and whilst i have a code of conduct, they may not. 
---
Raiders are as varied as colors of the rainbow. Cutthroats will pull this type of vindictive "get off my turf" style, trappers like me make devious traps, Blackwater bandits going after targets of opportunity. 
---
It sucks to have your camp leveled. It sucks to be raided by a dickhole, but its still a valid, and expected role in the wasteland. 
---
A few of my favorite role plays: 
---
Fire insurance salesman. 
---
Chem addict
---
Wandering fireworks show (grenades pitched at 45° up explode like fireworks) put on a show, present the bill, and start chucking if they don't pay their tab. 
---
Building inspector (background in the trades) saying the camp isn't up to code, and needs to be torn down or bribe the inspector (25 caps) 
---
These are all camp oriented role plays, that necessitate hunting down other players at camp, and lead to organic interactions. 
---
Other role plays that put my camp at risk:
---
Trap rooms
---
Roadside "toll station"
---
My "raider bar" 
---
Oh. So if they dont stack, do you get the highest number or the last one you popped. If its the latter that would explain my experience. 
---
I see :D
---
Still you can get soo much performance out of ini tweaks and mods that skyrim runs on a toaster. It literally ran 60+ frames on my half broken computer, which had some hardware failures and often got a bluescreen from opening simple programs like windows media player or Google Chrome 
---
A snake would be cool, but I think the two-headed thing is a bit overly prevalent. They could add a different kind of mutation, such as various small limbs growing out of its back or two sets of eyes  with an overgrown jaw.
---
Ad victorium!
---
Certainly Intersting. Do you know if there are mods for Morrowindd that make it look better atm? Id love to go back a play it before doubling down and gatting skyrim for a third time. 
---
ELI5 what is Fashnact Parade and what should I be collecting? Can I do it being Level 14? 
---
Yes,  But A little they can buy by earn atoms ingame.
---
Well it's been established that they can't breathe Earth's atmosphere, so the gamma radiation wouldn't bother them. Following the end of the world, the Zetans would likely see the Earth as an.easy to take target, with no governments or militaries left. The Brotherhood of Steel and The Enclave are very alive in the 2100's, sure, but neither hold a a candle to the U.S.military or the Red Army, which would have posed a threat to the Zetan invasion. With all governments and planetary defenses left, Zetans could move in, enslave the left over humans and either mine or terraform the planet for their own goals, expanding their empire with minimum effort.
---
Why haven't they? They either don't want Earth because, uh, the apocalypse, or they realise that they are physically weaker than humans, and things like Deathclaws and Super Mutants would squash them unless they attacked in force. Seeing how by 2287 they're still just watching and observing, it's possible their interest in Earth is different. Perhaps an experiment they're watching?
---
Who knows. Either way, the planet Earth is a valuable target even after the end of the world.
---
Well I have a Mr. Fuzzy Yellow Hard Hat and before anyone says something, no, I did not get it Camden Park. I got it in a portable toilet at the Quarry X3
---
Could be anywhere, I first saw him near the space station, then I have had a a few encounters in the forest and savage decide and once at my camp near Harper's ferry.
---
Are you on PC?
---
Check out nexus mods, just google "morrowind nexus" there are many thousands of mods only for morrowind and even more for other games! I don't know about specific mods, but i saw a video once that was called something like morrowind visual overhaul 2018 and it looked stunning compared to vanilla morrowind. 
---
2x Muffled .45 pipe revolver, one with long scope &amp; the other with tactical long scope.
---
Only made the second as I plan to try soloing a silo soon.
---
I apologise for my lack of knowledge, but those mods work with steam versions? I ask cus i know steam has to workshop and didnt know if it stops stuff like that
---
im glad you are having fun, i did the same, I just never put the game down mainly becuase I did not experianse any game killing bugs. The game is in a way better place now than at lunch but it still needs work. I am glad bethesda are listening too our feedbackand working towards fixinf the game. I can not wait for the new dlcs
---
You can hit a lot higher than 2k and with the way damage, resistance and penetration work you should be doing full damage rather than ignoring just the majority of armor. You can hit higher than 2k with 1 handers and they're the weakest melee weapon.
---
Only if we can also leave a live grenade in there like with pickpocket from previous Fallout games!
---
All you need is Level 3 Animal Friend in CHA and around at least Level 40 base level(the highest level tameable deathclaw will be about Level 20).
---
You lack of luck pal, so far i got 5 or 6 recipe and each were unique.
---
I got mine in Lucky Hole Mine, at the entrance, looks like it's random spawn.
---
Ha! Probably that you can choose the pace plus many of us grew up playing paper and dice adventures and Fallout was actually based on the GURPS system, it feels like a classic RPG.
---
Traveling to Vault 76 somehow cures diseases aswell for me somehow
---
Yeah I guess so. I’ve found 2 so far at the Quarry 
---
To be fair it does say "steal" when you look at the other player's supply case. Is easy to miss though.
---
about time...
---
No. I’ve sold to the responder vendor and when I went to him he would never have fresh caps. It’s even on the map for what vendors are in factions that someone made. And I got a daily for that place just recently. 
---
No problem i am glad to help. And yes they do! If the install process is like in other bethesda games you shouldn't have any problems, even as beginner. It's mostly just drag'n drop and most of the mod pages have an install tutorial on their own. Just read the descriptions and care for required or incompatible mods (if theres any you will see it on the mods frontpage) and you're good to go. Just take your time and don't rush it. And if there are any problems just ask the nexus community, they are very nice and helpful and i never waited long for a response :) 
---
The last one prevails.
---
My beef is with quests that are essentially broken by other players messing about in the same world, or where some quest stages don't reset properly, and can only be completed via hopping.
---
I'm not talking about quests that you can only start by server hopping to find a random encounter, nor finding a special item like the power fist that appears in a fixed location.
---
I'm referring to the quests where anyone can start and maybe even complete 90% of it, but then the quest can't be resolved because some condition has been changed by another player or got stuck.
---
With the overseer quest I referred to, I could not complete it for weeks because the target had already been taken out, on server after server, every day that I went back to it. I assumed that the quest was bugged and could never be completed.  You literally open a locked door and the thing you are supposed to do is already done so you can't get credit for the quest completion. After completing most of the remaining quests in the game world, I had to resort to researching the quest online to see if I was missing a clue or step, but everyone confirmed that the only way to complete the quest was by hopping or returning once a day for as long as it might take to get lucky.
---
That is probably not what you meant by waiting patiently for a resource on the server, but in any case, returning to a building to open a door each day to look for somebody is not a fun or organic activity. It is a reminder of a buggy quest that you are tired of seeing on the list.
---
Traveling is also not free, so spending caps each day to travel around trying to complete broken quests is doubly annoying.
---
From what I can tell now, the Quantum paint quest is similarly faulty, but in that case, people have to redo entire sections over and over until finding all stages in undisturbed condition. Again, it's not natural to repeat the same actions over and over waiting for the cycle where someone else didn't mess things up for you.  It doesn't make sense to open locked doors and find things empty when there is obviously supposed to be something there.
---
In many cases, this sort of thing could be resolved by finding a note that you can look at, but not take, so it is always there for the next person that comes along. Similarly, terminal entries are also a good solution. Otherwise, the first stage of the quest should be what determines whether you can start and finish a quest, not step 3 or 4.
---
Once one player starts the quest on a given server, all stages should be reset and the quest should only be available to that player/team until they complete the quest or leave the server.  If it is intended to be a rare opportunity, then the rare part should be the beginning, not the intermediate steps.
---
If someone is allowed to start a quest, collect keys, codes, jump through a bunch of hoops, or whatever,  there should not be a condition where the final location is empty or  already altered resulting in a quest that cannot be resolved. 
---
Quests like the overseer debacle should have other reset triggers or reset more frequently, or have the same kind of solution mentioned above where a player can temporarily own a quest that is fully reset for them to complete. There are easy fixes to these problems if only the developers can be made aware where problems exist.
---
I am in PSN Asia so when opening Atom Shop to buy Atoms from in-game it will say not available like yours. But if I search in the store on PS4 dashboard or website it is available. It may be tied in with PSN account (like Elder Scrolls Online Crowns) but have not tested it yet. 
---
I known, it's just my luck lol but I only walk the dark side (PS4). 
---
Thanks for your thought though. 
---
FT to solomons pond. Turn around and follow the road down hill. You'll soon come to a lake/pond (this is not Solomon's pond, that was in front of you when you FT d there.)
---
In that lake will be a super mutant behemoth just chillin'.
---
My main char. moved from fanatic automatic weapon spray and pray  to sneak and i finally know the problems of having to much ammo and stims! It feels good and i can still spray if i want to, it just kills faster too!
---
Iv been having issues since the update as well, I honestly thought it was my controller sticks starting to go.  For me the right sticks dead zone will stick when flicking my aim left, so my micro adjustments can send my character spinning left. 
---
you can after you have reached lvl 50 every time you lvl up you will have the choice to get a perk card or move a skill point to were you wanted. I can also say that moving skill points around and lvl perk cards is a pain in the ass and it takes for ever. I had a somewhat of an even build when I was lvl 50 then migrated to a meele build an im on lvl 70 right now and I am half way to get it done. I would suggest that you  pick the skill that benefits you the most first, fix that one and then move to the next.  
---
No Anyway our changed so, It is Inposiible to buy atoms from Japan with PS4. It is true.
---
Her quest to run errand everywhere were a pain in the a**... Then i did Free states quest with Abbie... Damn she is Rose over 9000 pain... Then reconsider that Rose was way much nice with her quest.
---
I figured it out. My keyboard can act like an Xbox controller...so the game was thinking it was one. I had change the keyboard mode and bind a few keys to controller buttons to get into settings. I found a random post through google from someone with the same keyboard as me that figured it out lol.
---
its been broken since day 1. ive bug reported it a while back but nothing ever happened with it i guess. 
---
i found out it was a problem when i was trying to make a build for nukezones.
---
it is a fun game, it was a very diffent game at lunch tho, i have played both and I can see Anthem was far worst just with the loading screens. I could say that the FO76 you are playing right now is a very different game from nov when it lunched.
---
keep enjoying the game im on XBOX 1 so i hope we get to link up some time to play. im always down to roam apalachia with diffent ppl
---
Sorry to hear that :( Sounds very frustrating. Hope Bethesda/PSN Japan look into it soon. 
---
I would love a tag to know which PA is which in my invertory, as well as displaying them on my camp. but a tag would do just fine
---
Good to know, just feels like one of my favorite locations is kinda screwing me over right now haha
---
How did you not know this? Its been mentioned here befor emultiple times and you work for Bethesda :) lol
---
trapper armor with the +25 rad resist..... but the +25 rad resist doesn't work 99% of the time.
---
Really? I didn't try yet but I will try later. So far, I only bought using my ATOM won in-game.
---
By the way, if you're looking for partners, PM me.
---
I guess this is laziness. I had no problem buying currencies for other games in Japan (Fornite V-Bucks...).
---
i got like 20 yesterday from every monster I killed in a nuke zone. 
---
Maybe that where some players  end up  after the nukashine black out
---
Maybe the pun was the use of the word 'Hue' as both an onomatopoeia due to the sound of laughing at the pun and irony but also because the op is about paintjobs, 'hue' is defined as a color or shade, hence the pun.
---
Well here's an update I sent in a ticket when I posted this 5 days ago and I ended up having to uninstall and reinstall the game to fix the part where my a secondary weapon would be coming equipped when getting into a fight unfortunately it didn't fix the issue of when you get in and out of power armor after a few emails with Bethesda with them trying to blame it on my end from everything with save data to my connection and after I tested everything I can on my end they said that I'm being uncooperative and close my ticket without fixing anything. THEY ARE THE WORST COMPANY I'VE EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING......
---
I saved every email from them and I'm thinking of posting then to show how Bethesda tries to blame their customers for the bugs they added with their junk patches this company is trash I'll never buy another product from this company or any other company affiliated with them after this even if it's free. 
---
Thanks you ! All PS4 Fallout76 user in Japan hope it Sincerity!
---
Tbh I don’t know why he couldn’t have been a separate vendor or maybe he was at one point but what I can remember is he was never one for me. I mean he doesn’t really sell the same stuff as the others so who knows 
---
thats not a close up.... ive looked up and seen one land right on me. :-)
---
Fair enough.  Yeah, I would not expect the onus to be on you to server hop because of an actual bug in the quest making it **impossible** to complete, no matter how long it took.  Heck...if we look at this as a true survival game, where you compete with others for limited resources...maybe a week of checking to see if you can complete is reasonable?
---
Ehh, reasonable may not be the word, but not out of the realm of possibility.  Online games like this SHOULD have a sense of...this stuff is rare, this is a living world, I can't just expect to complete every quest according to my exact timetable.  (I know, sounds rough.  I'm a hardass.)
---
But...if it is your understanding and experience that, no matter how many times you check back, the quest will not be complete-able, the admins should be aware of the bugged state and fix the quest for you on your character.  I hope that happens for you.
---
I haven't done that quest; how much rework would it take to abandon and try again?  Or is that not even possible.  I'm just throwing out ideas here, not intimating that anything you're doing is wrong, or dismissing the frustration.
---
I can only assume you've put in a support ticket or something.  Dunno what to tell you.
---
it happened to me as well but it was just a wooded door, it was a loading issue for me, i did had to wait a few minutes and then the door was there. 
---
Yes it is true ! No one can not buy ATOMS with PS4 in Japan.It is completely impossible with system.Only Fallout76!
---
That is amazing
---
I could've sworn he was a different faction, but it would sort of make sense because he isn't tied to the railroad stations, although technically he's a responder trader but he's named? Idk, Camden Park certainly is unique and I would like it to be even more so. And actually functional for me lmao
---
&gt; love me some marine wetsuit under leather!)
---
Ooh kinky -- leather and latex.
---
same here, its making me nervous because im seeing new camps popping up near town.  if i dont have to swap servers for my camp i can drop artillery in town at least
---
It's okay. I'm pretty sure I crashed a server new years by taking a photo in a nuke zone. Server rolled back and I lost all sbq rewards but my resources remained depleted. 
---
I read this in torques voice from BL2.
---
Works for me.
---
Sheesh, kids of today...
---
Sorry for the late response, Im on Xbox
---
My game crashes regularly when using pip boy menus since last patch.
---
You're right. Bethesda JN announced it when the game was released:

Maybe try to contact @Bethesda\_jpn via Twitter.
---
Rad resist is useless in nuke zones without additional rad reduction provided by hazmat suit or power armour frame (so bad you can't read it in-game anywhere, power armour frame gives you 100% limb dmg protection, high explosive protection and radiation protection)
---
get perk cards every lvl. the only time you got the pack for every lvl was until lvl 10 or 15 after that is every 5 lvls. if I remeber correctly
---
I agree that they need to change the mechanics of this type of quest if they want certain items to have a special status.  If they want an item to be rare, then the trigger to start the quest should be in random locations and at random intervals, and the locations of each key, card, clue, note, or terminal entry should also be randomized.  It's not really possible for something to be rare if it is always available in the same place, particularly in an age where every secret, easter egg, and quest solution can be found online in seconds.
---
So, I think they have to make certain quests possible to complete once started with no server hopping, and other quests should perhaps simply be harder to start, such that no amount of server hopping will help.
---
Random encounters would probably be the best way to do it. One of the random encounters I experienced in FO76 with a rare creature was unfortunately anti-climactic, as I didn't get any memorable item as a reward, nor did it start a quest.  It occurs to me that bringing down such a creature could yield a note or holotape on their body, and that might be a great way to discover a special quests for a very rare and special item. That's just one possible mechanic.
---
edit - I'm on PC.
---
Shame. I don't get it though. It says 300 rad resist on radshield. My PA is only 366. I have dense torso, fireproof, blocker and adamantium skeleton. I have no trouble soloing high level scorchbeast. I just need a f'ing way to deal with the radiation and I can dump my PA and fusion cores for good. 
---
You can change receiver but each time you will need to craft it.
---
In all honesty, we just need more vendors that are separate because the whole 1400 every 20 hours is crazy 
---
Yeah i cant take the amount of spoiled food i have everyday, why would a tomato spoil after one day!!! 
---
Thank you, i will check this
---
Yes We know It very well.the message had Fallout76 start time.Not update message yet.
---
So I can't expect Bethesda JP,Lots of user had mailed to Bethesda JP yet,No reaction.
---
So I try to question in this Reddit. Last hope.
---
Hazmat and pa frame has additional rad resist that isn't started anywhere and is multiplicative with rad resist that you can see in stats
---
does that mean they fixed the hive mind enemies for stealth builds?
---
I do. I know the risks, and I still have my fun. A lot less of it sometimes, but that's life. 
---
May not work for you, but the Buried With Honor quest up near the fort in the toxic valley always gives me an okay armor piece. Nothing mind shattering but always decent. Super easy quest, but watch out for the bear in the parking lot. Long way to go but decent civil war loot to help pay your way.
---
You still got them?
---
I have two Bloodied Explosive Handmade rifles..
---
One with DR while Aiming, as it's modded for Sniping. My other one is for medium range and close up, it has -25% reduced vats cost. 
---
I don't like power armor, it's ugly and useless in PvP, so I've made an almost untouchable rifleman sniper build with the SENTINEL ASSASSIN ARMOR. Only the Scorchqueen can give me grief, literally. 
---
Not bragging either but learnt a few things from talking to other players. 
---
Only lvl 103 and I'm yet to be overpowered as such or bullied, even by stealth melee builds who run up to you out of nowhere and whack you with a deathclaw gauntlet. 
---
I honestly think through perks, weapons and armor, I have made one of the best builds in this game... 
---
Obviously dlc over time will add and subtract but still I'm winning. I don't play in teams either, I have friends now and again to trade but aside from selling the odd legendary and radaway I'm a sole wanderer. 
---
Another lady was 74
---
Good to know. Thank you. Guess my vampiric Grognak axe power attack reflecting damage isn't that bad then.
---
Now, did you try to engage any of them? Or just chase? 
---
40 and female. I really love this game! 
---
Agreed, or have each railroad independent, or something like a timer so you know, or have it once a day, and refreshes at sometime early morning, not every 20 hours or so
---
I know a guy who runs a MUD, he coded it exclusively for the majority of the over 20 years the game has been in operation.  When discussing features of the game with him, the number of times I've seen him say 'Wait, we can do that?' even with people publicly discussing things where he can see them is VERY high. 
---
Games have A LOT of moving parts, a lot going on, and a lot of people working on them. Plus this person is a community manager, which isn't even the same thing as a person who worked on the game. It's very very easy to believe they wouldn't know about a thing in the game. I imagine there are MANY things in the game they don't have direct knowledge of. 
---
I wish I could find a chainsaw and do that, I chase people down (and kill them if they engage back cause they do have a choice) with the same outfit and a fire axe haha 
---
imo not enough people do stuff like this, i’d say keep it up because i’m sure it was a memorable moment for those low levels as well
---
İ think its fun but if you didnt attacked them
---
I did lunge at them a few times, but the damage with the chainsaw is so pathetic that I struggled to kill a lvl 5 radroach with it. 
---
WOW brah ,you are soooo cool ! Gotta teach me how to be like you ! 
---
You are going to have a doozy of a time.
---
I am not saying is not achievable but is a chem/perk micro-management hell.
---
Personally I just follow the path of minimum resistance and use PA and a laid back build (shotgun/melee combo, heavy weapon/melee combo) in nuke zones.
---
Gee I dunno. Same place I found my brand new bed, couch, dresser, end tables, ceiling fan, posters, etc
---
Damn that suck man
---
Nice ! Which level of armor is taken in the Guide?
---
Uhh the patch needs to come out first 
---
Moving into white springs then 
---
It's on the 19th by US time, so I guess it's not time yet
---
I had a real similar experience with pokemon go. I went raiding for the the first time in forever last weekend and ran into multiple older guys over 60 they where real nice guys we did a couple raids together we each ended up getting about 6 rayquazas each i hope i see them again cool guys
---
I've been unable to get the daily on my character who normally does the dailies here.  My other characters seem to get the dailies, no problem.  So I'm a mix of both.  This is on PS4
---
When is it coming out in your time?
---
well, if the rad resist on legendary armor is bugged its gonna be rough. I dont mind carrying an excavator PA, really, it's the fusion cores that I find annoying. Having to pick them up and their weight. You're probably right that its the easier way none the less. Thanks for the input. 
---
I play since BETA and recently left Vault 76. The world outside is amazing ! Can't wait to witness my first nuke
---
Thank you kind Sir !
---
Whatever level the other guy made his spreadsheet at. I assume max level for all items.
---
Probably around 9-10am.
---
Lucky hole is great if you want lead ore.  Then suddenly your lead problem has become an acid problem.  I usually find more lead than acid.
---
What do you mean you’ve opened shop? Player vending isn’t until April 
---
What area, the place just north of whitesprings?
---
The only reason I engaged In pvp was because I was getting bored of being killed and losing 115 caps every time. And besides, if you read another comment of mine you would see that I wasn’t farming ghouls, I merely wanted to go to the bunker and trade. Seems you must base your build around beating down players who just want to have fun in a game where teamwork is a primary part. Next time you comment on one of my posts, be polite about it.
---
I mean I make looking for group posts and people get intrested in the post and join a party, Ill ask what they want and sell it.
---
Yay I'm so happy for this I was unsure if my metal best could get better being at 117.
---
Turns out it can't which is great means I can find other better gear to go with it 😊
---
meele still king, but weapons build are fun as well, and some of them op as hell
---
Isn't it almost impossible to be killed in pacifist?
---
If you’re trying to sell any of that for caps, I’d wait for player vending and set up an in game shop on low level player areas. Most of that is relatively common and any players that would be in a trading group would more than likely have heaps already or know how to easily farm it. Especially the stimpacks and tick blood. 
---
Try getting revenge on a griefer but also dying in the process only to drop your brown bag and disconnect from the server before you can pick it up :(
---
I mean, you aren't wrong. Bloodied melee characters die. A lot. Definitely more than any other build. But that 4 digit damage is so pretty.
---
yeah that's the bulldoze feature but i want to get rid of a big tree because it clips into my base really badly
---
Started it yesterday for the first time and all 3 games appeared, returned today to only find a single game starting for me on the ps4 version. Idk what's considered "normal" on those but they may have just changed a thing or two.
---
Hey! 
---
Are you adding a title in the title input for the note?  That's a required field, and you'll get a 400 if you don't add one.  
---
Otherwise it should be working - and I can investigate after work today if you're still having issues.
---
Let me know!
---
(Also, thanks for the support!)
---
Tspoon
---
what's your ign?
---
Considering this game is meant to last indefinitely I am pretty sure that new (and old stuff from previous games) will be added over time. They are pretty much adding a couple of new things each week so be patient.
---
Technical data dosn't stack if you have started the BOS quest line so that on might be hard and flux normally costs 25-35 each and regular stims are 7 (not sure about diluted) and .556 is 0.5 caps per round. As for tick blood,I haven't a clue never seen anyone sell it and didn't know there was a demand for it.
---
after a few weeks you got bored, you did everything you could do, well damn. I have over 200 hours and I still got side stuff to do. but going back to your post, as far as content we are starting to see new stuff roll up, and the game runs a lot smoother than the last time you played. I dont know give it a try, we do have a few new quest to do and new dlcs that should be rolling out you could look at the road map so you could have a better idea on to what is to come. 
---
That’s fine, I can understand your mistrust. I believe I might of had a workshop somewhere as I’d been on the server for quite a few hours by then. I didn’t realise that owning a workshop means you can get one shot even if your just roaming the wastes. In regards to a video I don’t have that but I know his Xbox GT.
---
Not a big demand, but you can make stims with tick blood
---
Oh :(
---
There just needs to be a marker of where your kills are until you loot them or walk too far away. Grassy areas suck for killing anything, explodey or not.
---
Lvl 96 in Fo76 and lvl 42 irl so not that old but not a kid by any stretch of the imagination 
---
I make them with blood packs, purified water and steel if I remember correctly.
---
Some people try to get the daily by talking with him once. But each time we have to speak more than one time. I just wanted to say it just in case. Sorry if you still cant get them.

I craft lvl 1 BoS Recon Rifles along with lvl 1 Deep Pocketed Heavy Leather sets and put in the overseers camp along with some diluted stimpacks and purified water for lucky newbies to find. Sure, there is no thanks when you just leave it there, but no hassle getting peoples attention either. The introvert in me prefer this solution.
---
Across the river is fine, just can't build right up on the church. You can build on top of one of the farm silos though.
---
I’m an older YouTube and I’ve dreamed over 90 episodes of 76, that speaks volumes really. 
---
The Secret-Super-Duper-Mart on Golden Avenue?
---
I though I was the only guy who scavenged there :(
---
Damn I solely use PVE armour like -15% damage from (insert enemy type here) usually 2 star with something like ammo weight or action point refresh. That sentinel set sounds a little op lol 
---
Hey i know this post is old. But can i still join the CDN?
---
Thanks! There's a lot of really good "old music" in the public domain archives: [https://archive.org/](https://archive.org/)
---
Well, you didn't read them, both say the same thing.  
---
The first one is complaining about high level players giving him too much assistance and gifts...
---
You can find the code on the enclave military wing, there is terminal on the far left corner the information only found on this terminal, read two messages from the inbox with a title "Remote Lab 1.2" and "Remote Lab 1.2 Access Code"
---
If you just use the Excavator PA for mining nodes/nuke zones, you don't abuse Power Attack - which chews through the core and no perk mitigates this - and as appropriate you equip the relevant mitigating perks it should be manageable.
---
Personally having been playing since beta and watching the direction the devs were going with things I made provisions for fusion cores never ever to be a 'a thing'.
---
I leveled a mule, equipped Batteries Included lvl3 on her (among other carry weight/weight reduction perks), set her inside a set of Excavator PA with 2 x Calibrated shocks and Motion-Assisted Servos and she is now holding something in the region of 700, 100% charge, fusion cores among other useful/needful things.
---
Before the first major \~\~nerf\~\~ rebalance wave it was totally possible to take over all three power plants without having a swarm of 'but muh PvP' guys circling above you.
---
Ok, I have yet to aquire the stimpack recipe but Ik how to get it, I would probobly make more money just to sell stims( ir change the 1 stim to 4 dilluted)
---
48 and female as well :)
---
This is handy
---
Lol. I mean if I can build a fusion generator from the ground up there’s no reason I shouldn’t be able to build a stove without the damn doors falling off. Besides there is a plan for a nice pre war stove but it isn’t functional. Hell bathesda can sell the re skinned version in the atom shop for all I care 
---
I have one if you want it say 200 caps?
---
That... is amazing! Good job, both to you and the guy who made the first spreadsheet! You guys rock!
---
Sure, my xbox profile is BobaFettscousin
---
Okay I will be about half hour I have radaway one too if you interested
---
Yes yes good idea get me fridge I’ll put a gun in there by accident 
---
Okay thanks
---
I'm fine with quests that require time to pass, like come back in an hour, or a week, or when the moon is full, but that wasn't the situation here.
---
A week of checking or longer would be fine if I'm looking for some rare legendary item or whatever, but even then, I would prefer such things to be random than to encourage hopping and waiting until something respawns. I think it is a huge mistake to have fix spawn locations for unique weapons, for example. 
---
In the case of my first quest problem, I was looking for something the quest audio indicated still needed to be done, but when I opened the door, it had already been done and I didn't get credit for doing it. Another player had done it when they were completing their quest and my quest tracker was not aware of the status, nor could I do anything to flip that bit.
---
In that case, what I had to do was essentially wait for the thing to respawn, and that isn't the same as waiting for a rare item.  I was literally and knowingly waiting for an in game timer to run out, and hoping I was the first to get to the location when the respawn occurred.
---
I did eventually succeed in completing that overseer quest, but only after a couple weeks of patient revisits to the area, and then ultimately by resorting to a few hours of hopping because I didn't want to waste any more caps or ammo fighting my way to the same location again.  Any quests like that in the game need to be revised by Bethesda because it is too easy for players to conclude that it is broken and just give up, and it is just entirely unnecessary. They could easily change the condition required to complete the quest so that it doesn't get stuck like that.
---
For that quest it didn't require re-doing the quest line, it just wasn't possible to finish until the respawn had occurred and not been gunned down by another player. It just meant going to the same location over and over, killing the same monsters in the area repeatedly, etc.  For the Quantum quest, it sounds much more annoying.
---
When it comes to a quest reward - in most cases the reward is not something you physically pick up a the end of the quest.  It is just forcefully jammed into your inventory when the quest is completed.  In the case of the Quantum quest, it sounds like that isn't the case, but that the reward and the necessary items along the way are all up for grabs. It would be better for all of the information needed to advance from one stage to the next are non-removable items like passwords, combinations, or locations - or that necessary items are dispensed and not unique items.
---
I would even be fine if it were presented in such a way that multiple people were racing to get all of the items like in a scavenger hunt, but instead it comes across as a broken key fetch quest where any of the keys as well as the final goodie may also be missing.
---
My basic point is that Bethesda should look at any scenarios where server hopping is occurring, and use that as a guide to where problems exist.  They did a great job in making plans available at vendors so that people don't have to server hop for five hours to find the one plan they are looking for. Anywhere that hopping starts up again may reveal a problem and offer an opportunity to improve the game.
---
Sure, cant hurt
---
I've been doing runs around West Tek on an alt, and have noticed that the containers, as well as world items such as paint cans, do not respawn for me until after quite a long while. So, clearly some containers and world items are tied to the character and can't be reset by world hopping.
---
My personal two cents on this are that Bethesda needs to extend this to all content, and then give us some reasonable respawn times for stuff, so that we can stay in one game and farm things. Make it so that the respawn timers are tied to the player, though, so that in the case of a disconnect or crash, things aren't reset. Also, on that topic, add the rejoin period so we can get back into the same game instance after a disconnect or crash.
---
If you find those ants dead at those locations, use your Buther's Bounty perk skill and loot ant meat from dead bodies.
---
Look, I have almost 150 hundred levels of a Guerrilla PvP build without ever using Power Armor. My "fights" (if you can call them that) last no more than 5 seconds. I know.
---
I'm just asking which PA is the best; and also I'm asking for a PvP rework, because this is ridiculous.
---
Same here on Xbox one
---
I see. good to know it can since some games do not allow two instances of the game running on the same PC
---
My camp is on a cliff, so one day I loaded into the game, and spawned at my camp. Except it spawned me right on the side of the cliff, and the only place I could go was down. I fell and died (this happened like 3 times too lmao)
---
Yeah, I'm actually quite excite. I've wanted more events that can bring the server together and hopefully this will be a good one. 
---
I am soon Level 47 in rl. Watched and guided my son for years through different FO games. I am more the Zelda RPG Gamer. Then came FO4 on X1. He made a character for me and said you gotta try it Mom. I played non-stop til he returned back from his Dads house. Haven't really looked back. 
---
I am an OCD gamer &amp; the FO series is great for people like me who just can't stop picking stuff up. I also love exploring every nook and cranny in a game. Recently got myself a gaming laptop and the entire FO series plus some online games (which I previously thought I would never like). FO76 on X1, has changed my perspective on them, the way FO4 changed my perspective on games in general. Now I am looking for enough time to play em all. 
---
I bought 76 when it first came out and I am only on level 26 on X1 and level 1 on my PC:
---
but just as with FO4.. Bethesda games are like a good wine.. They only get better with age.
---
I stopped by in-game after the latest update. Besides some frame rate issues I was impressed with the changes. 
---
The people I have come in touch with so far, are  few younger people; most seem like an older gen crowd which surprised me. Everyone is always friendly and willing to help. It is especially noticable now that there are less grifters. 
---
Well I'll see you all back in WV sooner or later :) 
---
It was normal for me as well, first time i started the quest, all 3 were there, next day after next was only one, which I was fine with. Now, it's none every day 
---
I am not. I wish they would have skipped this event and put their energy to better use focusing on getting other content ready. I think Bethesda should focus on bringing us gear and outfits that fits the fallout world better instead of more silly masks. Players running around in all of these crap outfits really make it hard to get into the right fallout feeling.
---
It feels like Bethesda is focusing on bringing outfits to kids playing the game.
---
With that said i really hope the ones of you that have been looking forward to the event enjoy it. Just because i think this event is bullshit dont mean other cant enjoy it. Happy mask hunting!
---
They know how to treat people :) something the new Generation doesn't. 
---
Except at no point did I criticize LVW for not knowing. I was pointing out that it's a poorly advertised feature that many-, I daresay most-, people miss because it is not made obvious in any way whatsoever.  
---
Having a feature in a game that most people miss, is poor design.  
---
Mind you we're not talking about some obscure side-quest, or multi-step easter-egg here, we're talking about a water fountain, in the open, in the most visited part of the game, that directly affects a significant survival aspect of the game.  
---
FO76 is full of absurd mistakes like this (Not being able to inspect legendaries in the trade screen for example) It is obviously not LVW's fault, and if you think that's what my post said you're mistaken.
---
It has been taken off, I'm sure it will be back eventually though
---
I can see them not knowing everything. This particular one is just slightly surprising and amusing to me is all.
---
30 next month. Gaming has been my hobby since I was 6 and got a sega megadrive. I've played RPG games the moment I got an N64 and the rest is history. RPGs and card games are my preferred games. I've spent who knows how many thousands of dollars playing yugioh in the past and 12 years of WoW adds up too. Plus well over $5000 on Hearthstone since it's release.
---
Summoner 1/2, Kingdom Hearts 1, Halo 1-3, Mass Effect 1-3, Dragon Age 1-3, Fallout 3-76, Bioshock 1-3 etc. Just off the top of my head my favorite games ever. And throughout all of those I played the same character in WoW from the first day i played in August 2006 until the day Demon Hunters came out. He was Glorfindeld the human Paladin, named after Glorfindel from Lord of the Rings. Later shortened to Glorf.
---
My best friend and I would game non stop together until we had a falling out recently. Mostly WoW and Diablo and who knows how many fantasy games. Just for reference as well, I'm currently off work with an injury and as I stated above, largely friendless. Gaming is my way to distract from a shitty time in my life right now. Recently I lost 60kg (130+ pounds) and tried to change as a person. I was previously a morbidly obese fantasy nerd. Now I'm a flappy skinned fantasy nerd. I am aware the hours I play are ridiculous, but I simply don't have much else to do. Prior to being hurt I was very physically active, now I can't do much without being in pain.
---
I hope this gives you a bit of insight to how/why I played for so long. 
---
Thanks!
---
I would assume that such an emote were great for highlevels aswell, cause the HP scaling for enemies punish them for lowlevels being around.
---
A couple weeks ago they were running a spring cleaning sale, after which the sale items would leave the atom store. The rocketsuit was one of those items. I was frantically doing all the challenges I could so I could get the thing :D
---
I started with Wasteland.
---
My grandma is 81
---
Just owning the workshop isn't enough but the other player may have contested the workshop. Even for second means you're both now in PVP against each other. This has caught out a few people so far!
---
No worries mate I'll try but beathesda is no interested in helping at all,this game has the worst customer support ever.
---
I don't know why people gave this game such flak it's been fun. I mean name one mmo that hasnt had a disconnect  here or there. It seems like they have a plan for alot of content I'm looking forward to it
---
Server hopping needs to be stopped to begin with. Put a 15 or 30 minute timer after being logged out before you can join a new server. 
---
Did they scream and run?  
---
😂
---
free DLC as to paying DLC, not the same.
---
Agreed. Fortunately, you won't have to wait too long. Someone data-mined the most recent patch for any upcoming Atomic Shop items that are in the game's files but haven't been added to the store yet. [Have a look at the last item on the list](https://imgur.com/a/x141HZ8). While the off-kilter door will always bug me, I'm into that cherry-red paint. 
---
I haven't figured out how in game items or containers work with regard to reset/respawn.  Sometimes it definitely seems to tie the state of the environment to me, like when I've already taken all of the junk from an area and it is still gone even if I get kicked off of a server or come and go while playing one day or night.  Other times, it seems to reset some or all of the items when I change servers. I would be fine with junk and supplies to have fairly long timers, but I don't see how that can work for things outside of containers. Let's say I've looted an area of all the loose junk laying around, if I get booted and join another server, that area shouldn't then be barren of all junk, and again for every time a server change occurs for any player.  I can't think of a good solution to this one, but the first step is to add your suggestion which is to be able to re-join the last server.
---
What's a grindy teen?
---
Why would anyone complain about free gifts?? Just don’t take them if you don’t want them lol
---
There are plenty of spots for steel! One is just outside of Flatwoods (a bit north of the motel, on the left side of the road). There's another behind the Nuka Cola billboard next to the Slocum's Joe. There's a particularly good spot on the mountainside west of the Gorge Junkyard where you can fit both steel and copper into one camp. Those are the only ones I remember off the top of my head, but you can Google 'fallout 76 resource locations' and you'll find maps with all the spots.
---
I guess you're going to have to just grind for them. I hope Bethesda fixes this soon, for you.
---
As I see **Heavy Combat Brotherhood legs** are better than **Metal Heavy Polished legs** for **High DR+ER balanced set with no RR** category, because first on gives you total 80 combined while latter one gives you only 66.
---
I'm 57. I have what every gamer has: 7 gaming consoles, PC and a tablet. I play like all gamers play: daily. I think like a gamer. Well ok, I think like an adult who games: I love wrecking monsters and also helping out so others can too. Because both things are fun.
---
I watch YouTube gamers and Twitch streams and I know what 'Yeet' means.
---
Gaming is a fun part of life. It's all one life. Be yourself. Be skilled *and* kind, and you'll find good people. It's not an accident, it's how life works.
---
PS: My mother is 97 *she's* old. I'm definitely not. ;)
---
The only reason i'm tempted to join the event is so i can sell the masks... Hopefully we'll be able to do so
---
There is a clean version of the old mining helmet. Oddly though it really isn't that clean compared to the normal version, but you can still tell the difference when looking at it closely. Travel to the Vault Tec University in Morgantown, go to the left of the center building and go forward past it (while facing East) and you'll see an opening to an area behind the large wooden walls. That area has a shelf next to a red couch. The area is also filed with tents. I found a clean mining hat on that shelf. I've also found a ritual mask on that shelf. It just seems to spawn different hats.
---
I know there is a light-ish blue, red, and white hard hat mining helmet.
---
Yep, our group was chatting about this the other evening.
---
Exactly what I’m saying. That’s why once I go my plans I went into about 10 other servers unlocking the room
---
A Stalking Mothman jumped me on a bridge at Whitespring, broke my kneecaps, called me a fgt and stole my caps :'(
---
Thanks you !
---
I can fill my steel needs in about 5 minutes, so an extractor isn’t needed.  If you go north from Top of the World along the forest side of the mountains you’ll find power pylons.  Locate the one with the shooting range under it.  Face the mountains, walk to the lowest edge and you’ll find about 6 iron nodes...more to the North if you want to wander.  With excavator PA, you’ll get a lot of ore.  Smelt with Super Duper and you have a couple hundred steel.
---
Man, you must be fun at parties
---
Take that perk that make weapons repair to 200% then the chainsaw is pretty great. It make the damage go up :)
---
That's a shame, hopefully they bring out an event where they "open the vault" and let you have the vaulted items.
---
For me it happens something like 7 out of 10 times. I farm Watoga alot for ammo mats and legendaries. You will get the occasional one that won't explode immediately. Seems to be some sort of time advancing bug in the game since last patch.
---
where did you get the fasnacht mask from?
---
My great grandma who lived in West Virginia is 90
---
Selling that extra nuke coka dark on xbox by any chance? 
---
Damn must have missed the prompt. Thanks for the heads up
---
Let me get this straight, I am having an issue placing something in my camp that I have placed in many camps with no problem before. And because YOU have 3 in your camp, my problem is incorrect? 
---
It's like the people writing these quests wrote it for a single player game...
---
I do agree I am tired of server hoping for a set of keys then having to sever hop more to get a set of plans or whatever, I noticed the areas where that is happening alot (Dome 7 for the new power armor paint) gets very laggy 
---
I'm 51. Been gaming (both video-games and tabletop RPGs) since the days of Atari and 1st edition D&amp;D. I game with my sons, ages 29 and 11. Fallout is by far my favorite franchise (but I also enjoy playing Minecraft with my youngest). ;-)
---
Sent ya a request, I'm just need ya to slap a silencer on my gauss I'll let ya have a look at my stuff to see if want anything.
---
It can't be stopped as long as server instability and resets cause players to be disconnected from servers involuntarily.  The only solution I can think of is to have players automatically re-join the same server if they are disconnected or leave voluntarily, but that introduces other problems.  First, sometimes the server goes down kicking all players and nobody can re-join the same anyway. Secondly, sometimes people choose to leave a server to get away from griefers, to join friends who have come online, or to be able to place their CAMP in a currently occupied location, and that wouldn't be possible if we weren't able to choose to go do a different server without penalty. If I were forced to wait 15 or 30 minutes every time the servers disconnected me or I was trying to escape some jerks, I just wouldn't play anymore.  I've also been disconnected a couple of times during brief network outages, power fluctuations, computer crashes, or bathroom emergencies, and again wouldn't want to be forced to wait so I can play again. I think the key is to remove all incentive for "server hopping to get stuff", so no one will abuse the function.
---
I’m 49 been a fan of power armor since I was a kid so Fallout was a perfect fit for me !! even though power armor for the most part is outgunned by these overpowered pvp builds there’s nothing like running around the wasteland clad in exotic alloyed black titanium to make you feel invincible!!! I’ve met some great friends from all over the world on here and I consider that to be one of the best things about the fallout community !!! 
---
Hopefully it'll be cheaper next time. 
---
Sandhog? Were you an old tunneler? Sandhogs work safe? 
---
Well that sucks. 
---
Or maybe. *Just* maybe. They can bring ALL of that in and people can choose what they want and don't want. I couldn't care less for the Nuka-girl Rocketsuit but my Girlfriend loves it. The game should cater to just about anyone so everyone can find something they like. 
---
Yeah but he’s right...
---
Exactly we should be looking at the format.  Fallout 76 is software as a service; destiny is not hence the whole "2" ar the  end.
---
Sea of thieves and or no mans sky are better comparisons though I've never played NMS so cant really talk about who does the SaaS model better.
---
That's pretty much my exact rate maybe even worse. In around 200 hours I'm sure I've killed hundreds of 3*. I've got maybe 5 or 6 3* armors and ONLY 2 3* weapons and they were all unusable for me.
---
Both my characters are melee, one is maxed in slugger (with a melee/heavy guns combo build in reserve for scorched earth). Her main weapon is a furious grognaks axe with 40% faster swing speed. Arguably her instigating super sledge is better but it's ssoooo much slower so I hardly ever use it. She has an exploding black powder gun in reserve if ranged is required (taking potshots at SB's until they land). 
---
My other character is unarmed/gladiator maxed and has a few shotgun perks because she got a Tse shotgun off someone. She switches mostly between black diamond, an instigating assaultron sword, instigating knuckles and a furious deathclaw gauntlet depending on how the fight is going. She also has an instigating the dragon I got off my husband's collection of instigating weapon for shits and giggles (it's sooo slow! Can you tell I don't like slow weapons?) 
---
No worries. Sorry if I seemed rude before.  :)
---
Mole miners, farm them loot it all and profit, seriously one run through black water mine will net you a couple hundred, do the uranium fever an you'll get near 1k
---
Although I agree with you on how some of the atomic shop items are geared towards toddlers, it shouldn't stop them from making new dLC content. The masks arent too childish at least, feels ike early Halloween 
---
Gets darker at night, you say? What madness is this?
---
I believe the lore us what Bethesda says it is tbh jyst saying.
---
Yes, just a little bit down from White Powder Winter Sports.
---
No. Wait till mid summer.
---
Thats awesome, thank you friend. I might have to spend some money and head back to morrowind in the future :-)
---
Except it's not really a feature. It *is* an easter egg. Whitesprings is based on the Greenbrier, which was, originally, [the White Sulphur Springs](http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/springs/whitesulphur/), where people actually went to drink the sulphur water for it's curative properties.
---
I just thought the titles appearing next to each other were amusing :)
---
No aspersions cast about the content of the posts!
---
haha :)
---
I don't think you annoyed anyone at all :)
---
Although I got 2 sets of plans from simply going to an unlocked Dome, last night I followed these steps and got my key first try....well after falling to my death at Tanagra once haha
---
Yeah it’s that door that puts my OCD into overdrive lol. The paint is nice though just not sure why they couldn’t fix the door while they were at it
---
Doesn't it pointless to do point 3 when secret door in overlook cabin are open? From what I understood, one-time code won't work on another server, so first you have to make sure nobody took keys, because you'll have to generate code again after server hop.
---
Except this game is about being in the very specific place that is this part of West Virginia, and Fasnacht is an important festival in Helvetia. You should look up the history of the irl town, it's fascinating.
---
...and then people say:"No, the trailer was not clickbait", yet here we are, because trailer didn't give information that it should have given.
---
No... he's not...
---
If i remember correctly a max lvl Heavy Combat Armor Chest BOS mod have 99 DR and not 86.
---
I've actually been theorizing about a fashnact event since day 2 when I found the Fasnacht man mask. I'm super hyped about it.
---
You are soooo cool! Must make you feel like a big boy abusing a flaw in the game that makes it possible to use pistol+rifle perk cards and then with a pvp setup shooting a player in the back. Not much to be proud off.
---
I bet it was just ONE guy making that part of the map who decided "ya know what... all the diseases... ah let's just give them a cure fountain"
---
Probably not. It will be stationary, but chances are his stationary location might be different on servers, but probably not.
---
No Daily quests at Camden park are triggering for me since the latest update.
---
Lol, same here, 7 days in the row just when event is on.
---
Lvl57 here. Been a Wanderer since Wasteland. 
---
No. if you can't get it free or for \~10$, not worth.
---
Nah we just dont need to look anymore since its on the roadmap, lol
---
It might be cool if things like this happened at a number of locations on the map, so that all players would be given more opportunities to join forces for large scale battle events. Right now we get a server wide warning only when a nuke is launched, which gets players to join in on the SBQ, but after the 50th of those, I'm pretty bored.  I would love to see more server wide events, and yours is a great suggestions.
---
Ill try it in a few mins see if ir works
---
I actually found a better one thanks to another commenter on another post. Go to Hornwright Testing Sight #3, which is right next to Vault 63. Immediately where you spawn there's a few nodes (2 are bugged and either don't show up sometimes or you can't loot them, so there's only one that works) to your left, and if jump up that tiny clif there's 6 more nodes. If you go SE for a few meters there's 2 more nodes on top of the same kind of small cliff. Go back to where you spawned. In front of you there's a fence. Go through and at the end of where the fence stops there's another node to the right of a blue/gray barrel thing. Again, go back to where you spawned. Go forward and to the right of the fence in a NW direction and go down that small edge and head towards the buried dump truck. Keep going to the right of truck and right before the cliff is another node. Take and immediate right from that node and jump down, and there's another node. There should be a vague sort of dirt path in front of you now, and there are 2 more nodes along it. Total of 12 lootable nodes. Plus the only enemies I found there so far are a single officer ghoul that spawns sometimes.
---
Been digging through game files and it seems like the event is ready to go, just needs to be activated. But who knows, maybe there's gonna be a small patch.
---
I came across a moth man in one of those pink tree areas in the Cranberry bog.
---
Im thinking exactly same, i wish there would be some more postapocalyptic outfits maybe old mad max style
---
Yep. I was playing video games as a kid on the Atari 2600 and my Amstrad PC, I'm still playing games as a 42 year old married mum. My son says I'm the only gamer mum among his friends, but its certainly not that we're 'getting into games'- we've always been here! 
---
No you're right I tested it. It is definitely missing.
---
New bug: you can only see when nukes are landing and blinding you
---
👍
---
Ah ok
---
Yeah but the event is a real event that happens in West Virginia. Can't be much more immersive than that.
---
Yes it's the game answer to end game content and it's a fucking awesome one. You get to launch a god damn nuke 
---
I play with a couple of guys who are retired, really sound guys
---
“NO PRINCESS BED” those are fighting words mister
---
They also added a new vault. They are adding stuff in waves, probably for testing reasons. 
---
We’ll see another patch, and it will bring the activation of the event along with it. 
---
Good for you, even though i think the event is crap i still hope everyone that has been looking forward to it enjoy it. Happy mask hunting.
---
Server hopping is a quest, once you do it 76 times you get 100 atoms. At least it seems that there's a reward for doing it.
---
I've noticed that too, in the woods just north of Cliffwatch - I even walked down that way to see what was so good. Unlocked Cliffwatch, but didn't find any reason so many people's map markers were there! 
---
Fort defiance (Mental asylum)
---
Nice :-) I'd love to have a mule, but that would requier having a friend or two instances of F76 at home, right? Won't it also lead to mico managment shifting stuff from one character to the other?
---
Grats
---
&gt; I would be fine with junk and supplies to have fairly long timers, but I don't see how that can work for things outside of containers. Let's say I've looted an area of all the loose junk laying around, if I get booted and join another server, that area shouldn't then be barren of all junk, and again for every time a server change occurs for any player.
---
Right now, some world items definitely stay looted when hopping, so that "barren world" -mechanic is currently in place. However, that's just an issue with the spawn timer. As long as server hopping itself doesn't reset anything, the spawn timers for things can be adjusted.
---
I don't know if the world item spawn timers for stuff like paint cans for example are tied to time spent in game, or to real time passed, but I've gone something like two days real time without seeing those items respawn. I think timers like that are just silly, especially since we've got stash limitations in place. Maybe put a 30-90 minute timer (real time) on such things, and an average player can then reasonably get a couple loots from one server in one sitting, and then when logging in the next time, all the stuff will most likely be back. Then just make it so that server hopping won't reset this.
---
I'd extend this to most things, but the main thing is, however long the timers are (and that can be debated until the brahmin come home), just remove the server hop reset, and that'll stop people from doing server hops as much.
---
That'd be an interesting way of doing things, activating events via patches. The Sheepsquatch and backpacks are also in the game files.
---
I was thinking they'd do things more like GTA Online where the content is ready to be released and the devs just need to 'flip a switch'. Bethesda already has those switches for Atom Shop items but maybe not for in-game events/quests.
---
Yup, that’s a good one too. 
---
Brilliant.
---
...or be stuck with your old restored XP-machine during holidays... it doesn't run fallout tactics at 60fps, but F2 runs as well as on any modern machine
---
my main issue with the old ones is inventory management, it's just too unwieldy :/
---
Why in earth would you want a princess bed in a post apocalyptic world.. He has a point though,  were are the raider cages,  corpses on a pike, the bloody walls and floors, torture furnitures... 
---
I hope I’m wrong! 
---
Cool. I was wondering about how you melee people feel about the assaultron blade. I keep finding them, for some reason. 
---
Steel is everywhere. I would help you out and give u my camp location but I feel like not sharing my little secret of my steel farm
---
Omg lol I'm not the one that's upset. I'm just trolling.
---
No... you’re expectations are WAY too high and you’ll never be pleased. Just uninstall the game so the rest of us having fun with it aren’t bothered by your nonsense posts. 
---
Yes
---
Please tell me you are joking
---
I teamed with Bobby from Texas the other night. He's 77. Funny dude, lots of stories about his ex-wife.
---
Got my paint after my third server hop, my brother in the other hand had no such luck, helped him look for a couple of hours, didn't get one yet.
---
I found many chainsaws in the basement of mountain side bed and breakfast. It’s normally in a shelf by a tinkerers bench
---
So it seems to me that the best bang for your buck is, depending upon how greatly you value protection against radiation, either the BoS heavy armour chestpiece or sturdy buttressed marine armour, with heavy studded leather arms and legs. 
---
I have to say, I find the way that the heavy leather limb armours just dominate their respective fields both surprising and a little disappointing. Considering that the plans for them can be cheaply and easily obtained from a vendor, one would *hope* that some of the more difficult-to-obtain plans would produce more impressive pieces for the limbs. Only the heavy polished robot limbs even come close to the total bonuses. 
---
What about the scorchbeast queen?
---
Holy shit...I thought that was just a cute little flavor thing, I didn't know you could actually drink from it!
---
found the teen
---
&gt; As for leveling a base when someone refuses pvp, at that point its not about the victim anymore, its either racking up a bounty for other players to chase, or the player being a salty fuck, and whilst i have a code of conduct, they may not.
---
This is 100% griefing.   Griefing is any action or use of gameplay mechanics with no objective in-game benefit where the only potential result is to harass/annoy/frustrate someone else.
---
Outside of a couple events and the hunter/hunted radio PvP is entirely opt-in in this game.  Continuing to attack someone or their CAMP who clearly indicates their not
---
 interested is only being done by you to annoy them.  
---
More like mounted and stuffed.
---
I have multiple accounts. Doing this with a single account is either a massive risk - if you try the 'mule with oneself' procedure using world containters - or a pain for the person who has to be there staring at paper bags while you 'do your thing'.
---
It does involve - for sanity's sake - ledgers (of sorts), planning ahead and leveling toons that you will very likely never ever 'play' again, but once one gets 'in the groove' makes life so much easier.
---
Is just another little routine like vendor runs or daily chanllenges/quests, but in my experience is pays dividends. I don't really know what 'being short of x' in this game means and if I have a say on the matter I never will.
---
Of course if the feeling of scarcity and need is part of your enjoyment please do not do this.
---
The fasnacht event starts today, idk where to go as I’m busy this morning, but I’d start by checking Helvetia. It’s a small town just east of Sutton station.
---
Oh good lord yes, please don't do this for your own sanity. I was merely referencing how it seems you get rewarded faster for server hopping as opposed to just waiting it out.
---
Same here. 
---
Your build doesn't make any sense if this guy wants to make a heavy explosive build. What I see here is a heavy guns build like mini or .50 Cal.
---
yeah man that is why I was surprised because it did not start yet
---
I believe due to the way the % reduction PA and the hazmat suit give in their hidden stats, it was figured you need around 32,000 rad resistance to get close.
---
The boss would be Tom Cruise.
---
They're not the best sword out there, though with legendary effects they improve a lot. My instigating one does more damage than black diamond on the first hit, but if the enemy doesn't die from that they usually take twice the hits to finish them off compared to black diamond, even with that first big hit. But sword stats seem to differ a lot even if they are max level, I have two max level black diamonds and one does way more damage than the other 🤔
---
Maybe you can learn patience instead?
---
I tossed it aside because I couldn't mount a jetpack to it, but recently I found some plans for it so maybe I'll give it another try. Farming the calibrated shocks for the x01 is a pain in the ass.
---
The wastes are a truly hostile place to your tendies, m'goodboy.
---
My man.
---
So you have two consoles / PCs with F76 running? Im never low on anything on this playthrough either, but would love to hoard more stuff :-)
---
At least you could eventually kill it - I've been harassed by invincible glowing radroach in asylum - I've swinged it with SS and it's health got down almost to 0 and fully healed in a sec later. Then I couldn't harm it any other way (no matter the weapon, melee or ballistic), couldn't close it in the room (it magically opened every doors) So I have to run form the building. It's sooo embarrassing to run out from lvl5 radroach ;)
---
Isn't that where the dev room is?
---
[Between whitesprings and cliff watch there are three resource nodes](https://m.imgur.com/9Rccgzd).  Possible ut was someone's CAMP, or did you check the area out and not see anything?
---
At lvl 48 the X-01 gives marginal improvement on RR.
---
To be honest, I kind of like the idea of removing items from the store. It makes them more “collectible” and truly rare, since Atom store items cannot be sold or traded. 
---
I misddd out on the Red Rocket sculpture as I didn’t start playing until late January. Now I have to envy those that got it. 
---
That's me -- heavy combat chest, heavy studded leather limbs.
---
Just have to find the elusive deep pocketed...
---
oh ffs.. than it hopeless, I guess. Thanks for chipping in. 
---
You should not be going to Watoga if you are looking for excavator mods
---
Your mistake was believing that Fallout was ever a serious grimdark setting.
---
Level 165 on PS4, level 48 IRL
---
It didn’t? Maybe it starts later in the day... the site said it started today though so be on the lookout.
---
You only need one of the cards, it’s pretty rare to actually use the wasteland Whisperer card tho so I’d say animal friend 3 is the one to have. Me and my friends have shared the animal friend perk with a player who had one charisma and it worked :) 
---
Yep us 45 year old kids.   Fair enough, I’ll break out the abacus and do it the right way.  
---
Lol see you next year!! 
---
ive ran into insult bot like 5 times and he just stares at me, never insults me :(
---
Thanks man. I get where your coming from though. The atom shop should have more stuff that'll make the world seem like the quirky ramshackled kind of world fallout is. If there were more interesting yet post apocalyptic looking outfits and paints in the shop, masks would actually feel better because they are some sort of goofy change. The WA trailer did seem like you might get your wish for outfits and paints though.
---
How should I know which type or armor I'm wearing again? It doesn't say anything when I inspected my armor, no light, sturdy or heavy in the descriptions.
---
Where the deathclaws spawn
---
&gt;Why in earth would you want a princess bed in a post apocalyptic world.. 
---
Because it's Funny
---
&gt;where are the raider cages, corpses on a pike, the bloody walls and floors, torture furnitures... 
---
Hopefully coming soon so I can add some flair to my Princess Bed
---
&gt;He has a point though,
---
No, he doesn't seriously it's a 1 week event and no one is being forced to participate.
---
So get a few when you can and break yourself of your degenerate completionist habits!
---
It just went up to 39 hours! I’m assuming you are to blame for this lol
---
I started the quest when I was level 10 and by level 12 had to get that. I gave up eventually and took a break from October to just last month. I finally finished the quest at around level 35 by using a super sledge!
---
Why are people downvoting this? Us Appalachians need to stick together 
---
Damm dooo ... you downloading over Morse code?! Lol jk don’t listen to the hate, I love the game. I have a lot of fun and met a lot of cool people along the way. You’ll have have fun. 
---
Friend has the princess bed in his camp. Goes with the theme of building death trap rooms to some degree. Xmas PA paint that made jungle bells ring with every step was hilarious. Only way to have total control of a games content is to be a dungeon master. Might want to give that a try, except you might not enjoy what players do within the narrow limits you set. This complaint seems to be anti-fun.
---
As a younger person jt nice to play with mostly mature people 
---
Ugh right after I came out of the vault I got parasites that suuuuuuucked.
---
Idm the event, but some stuff in atomic shop is just... Idk
---
Lol
---
Just because you get disconnected doesn't mean the whole server does ;) So i'm sure it's no problem.
---
I have multiple PCs and is possible to run multiple instances of the game in the same PC hardware permitting.
---
Same here, only happens with unarmed! Also, after a few swings of the Power fist, the animation get stuck so it's always open and never closes!
---
Same, never says anything..
---
Thanks man! Morse code would probably be more efficient lol
---
Well, he wants to be low level so he doesn't run out of contents, and don't want anyone's help so he can feel the challenge.
---
Emergency protocols sir
---
I dunno, I didn't used to die much but now the sbq seems to regularly kick my butt.
---
Great discussion. 
---
I’m a Two Handed Melee Build. My loadout includes 
---
1. Anti Armor Grognak’s Axe, SS, +1 Strength Arguably, this is the best two handed general purpose melee Weapon in the game. 
---
2. Ghoul Slayers Grognaks Axe, SS, +1 Strength This is for Whitesprings 
---
3. Mutant Slayers Pickaxe, SS, +40% power attack This is for WestTek. 
---
4. Prime Gatling 5mm This is for general ranged needs and for SBQ. 
---
5. Two Shot Explosive Hardened Lever Action Rifle with RW. This is for general use. 
---
My other slots include corn soup, razorgrain soup, Radaway diluted. 
---
I carry an OBSCENE amount of Diluted Stimpacks and Radaways. I do not like to be ever low on health. My health bar is perpetually at 70-80%+. Bloodied is NOT my thing. 
---
I never use Rad-X as I’m heavily mutated. 
---
My perk specs is catered to my build, but I have two specs. One for combat and one for fast traveling. I WISH we could blueprint our perk specs. 
---
I’m 31 and played Fallout when I was 10. Damn, I wish I had the time I did back then. 
---
BTW, Fallout 2 is probably one of the best games ever made IMO.
---
Probably just sad that they don’t get to play with me yet! 
---
Are you hooked directly to the modem or are you downloading via wireless? My guy and I each have a PS4. I'm connected through wireless and he's wired to the modem. It takes me almost twice as long to download. It's worse if I try to stream Netflix or Hulu while downloading updates. 
---
I haven't purchased any weapons yet, though I've had offers.  I was initially reluctant because my gaming experience goes back to beta-testing Everquest, and I don't want to crate more demand for gold / cap farmers and the like.
---
I had a toon in the 140s which became unplayable when they dropped the weight cap in the patch a while back, which for me was just another way for Bethesda to express their contempt for the players without giving them a way shed weight with something in exchange for the trouble they went through in farming all those mats, weapons, etc.  It was basically a limited ban hammer, in that I couldn't even pick up weightless caps, and it felt so punitive that I quit the game for a while.
---
I came back, but I'm really just killing time until Borderlands 3 comes out, as I regard the franchise as more focused on creating a fun and lively experience for players.  The MMO aspect of F76 has brought all the toxicity I expected, and hardly a day goes by where I'm not attacked by some roving band of assholes, who for some reason never flag although they spend several minutes meleeing me or shooting me with their TSE shotguns over and over.
---
I also think that Bethesda is seeding the forums with sockpuppets to badger and insult players who complain, so really, I'm just killing time until something better comes along.  I can't believe how much I invested in this game trying to make it work.
---
I spent a long time looking around, and I found nothing. I couldn't find a single player, it was like they were beneath me inside the rocks or something. Just poof, gone.
---
Whoever decides what goes into the atomic shop should be removed from that position.
---
I have never seen such consistent crap. 
---
Used to set up infinite Man Cannons in Halo 3 forge with my buddies back in the day. 
---
Great stuff - especially when someone stuffed a mine on a warthog and sent it flying around the map 😂
---
It is.  You can’t stack enough.  But if you play on a team you can run rad sponge and ghoulish.  I run on a team of two with 2 star rad sponge shared and 3 star ghoulish.  
---
Rads?  No, that’s airborne heal sauce.
---
Dial-up is a bitch
---
Weird, yeah I've got nothing.
---
52 and Pong was my jam haha!  FO76 is how I like to play video games. I always do the campaigns whereas most of my younger gaming friends go straight to PVP in a new game. I'm good with solo, not much on PVP. Don't mind jumping on a team to co-op a quest etc. but am usually reluctant because I fully admit to being a camping noob! Idk if that's an "old person" thing or not!
---
Actually a "back off" or "danger" emote can also be used to warn people.  
---
And it is just supposed to inform People that those emoting want to be alone.   
---
That is nothing aggressive.  
---
And for a group of people being stalked by some douches spamming the "join group" emote it would be nice to have a way to communicate "No, i wanna be alone" without just saying "no" or "angry".  
---
Nope, I didn't know that either, thanks!
---
Been having it happen with ranged sneak attacks. Takes a second or so for the bonus to be applied. Also noticing some remain alive for a second or so after they should be dead. 
---
I was on a roll. 3 successful SBQ kills then the most recent one was a dud. We killed her about 2 minutes after the event ended. At least we got the loot. 
---
If you need lots of steel en extractor is not the way to get lots quickly. 
---
Maybe an option to toggle hide / show backpack will fix the clipping issue. Just like hide helm / cloak / shoulders in WoW.
---
We had a dud one last night bro, it just flew off the map and didn’t come back 😂
---
Thanks, very nice!
---
If any of you guys are on xbox definitely send ne a friend request. I work swingshift so that kinda puts a dent in getting to play with anyone. My girl cant stand gaming and all my buddies are obsessive over pubg and apex, wont touch fallout. So itd kinda of be a joy to actually get to play with people lol
---
Nice. That’s a new one I haven’t seen yet. 
---
I know if someone builds their base where she is flying, she won’t land as often. That played a part in this one. 
---
Lvl 47 in real life lol
---
I found excavator cal shocks (1x) at the vendor at Harpers Ferry. And found the second one at Camp Venture.
---
Actually, I think it was parasites for me too! And for some reason I couldn't fine a disease cure anywhere.
---
Bro everyone was just stood there like wtf just happened?😂 I just turned the game off and went to bed when it happened haha! 
---
Yeah I’ve noticed that, I’d prefer people didn’t build a base at SBQ fights tbh
---
If I could cure that one I'd be thrilled.
---
Welcome to the game of the ~~year~~
---
~~decade~~
---
century
---
Seriously tho its a great game since the amount of toxic people is like .001% of players
---
I’m on ps4 as well and it takes a lotta time to update/download and its annoying
---
Nah, i have herbivore and it blows
---
Hey there, sir! I am a very new traveller from a far away country and I'd really like to enjoy a stay at your hotel. The Wasteland can be pretty harsh at times when you're still learning how to hold a weapon and I basically have maybe 10 Caps I can pay but I hope I am welcomed after all if our timezones (Europe / Aussie) should cross at some point. So long, may your noble thought and hotel live on! 
---
(GT is PanzerPanda91)
---
The guy that designed the fish lamp can stay lol
---
They think it helps because of turrets. I will grant that turrets do take away some of her health bar, but I don’t think it’s worth it. 
---
I felt the same way, switched to melee and power armor for anything that seemed "mean".
---
The last 3 times I’ve killed a 3 star legendary I’ve gotten lvl 1 crappy armor or a in the case of weapons a trouble shooters pipe pistol 
---
thanks, this spreadsheet is really useful gave me some new insight!
---
I always thought heavy armor had to have the Heavy tag but it looks like that isnt the case.. Maybe only the non legendary gear gets the heavy tag.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/7bB9VTF
---
My shit took 9 hours when i bought plus the three hours when the game regularly dowloaded. It sucked so bad.
---
I celebrated Fasnacht in Helvetia when I visited there in real life, it was awesome. Looking forward tons to see this in game. Make it much more immersive that they bring in things that actually belong to the region we play in.
---
I've caused many a crash.  I'm sure I'm part of why there's a cooldown on nukes. Used to launch almost as fast as I could run the silos.  The bots used to be good XP. 
---
Most recent was during the cooldown fiasco following Patch 7. Two hits on FSP. Before the second one landed we were all booted.  
---
you better hide your kids and hide your lvl 5 characters, lol you made me laugh but i feel you. 
---
I only just came out of the vault last night and was greeted by a scary clown who waved at me...
---
As my first experience of another human player I can honestly say - 
---
10/10 would come out of the vault for the first time again. 
---
I am doing it over wireless... no other option unfortunately! We’re supposed to be getting NBN this year, fingers crossed! That’ll be a glorious day!
---
I have both consoles and I chose to get FO76 on XB1. I just can’t stand PS4 controllers. My kids play Overwatch on it and I played Watchdogs on it (and a little bit of Fallout 4 and GTA), but I just really prefer the Elite controller on XB. 
---
If I give you the materials can you make me one 
---
Haha that’s good to hear! I’ve been considering getting it for a while, but there seemed to be a lot of uhhh.. drama! I’m really excited to play it tho!
---
Don't forget about special impact too. Super mutants have lower int and agility, but higher strength and endurance. Probably more, but I feel like this plays a pretty big role in species. 
---
No kidding. 
---
This, "Not in MY Fallout!" shit is getting old. 
---
Fallout is supposed to be grim funny (whatever that's called) not some dark broodfest. 
---
Sure, it'd be interesting. But don't hold your breath for it happening in 76.
---
The BOS is the most "fun" especially when you get to the part where it requires you to get a license in Charleston :)
---
Pvp would be more interesting 
---
Also noticed that the deathclaw gauntlet appears to break the game if you spam a pacifist while they’re fast traveling. On four occasions I have seen it happen, appears to freeze the game for both players involved. 
---
I feel your pain! But times like 4 lol. I’ll keep on playing Smash in the meantime!
---
Oh gosh not the DMV
---
You're just helping them exercise. Cardio is important.
---
Not as old as my name suggests apparently, but I'm still 50+
---
I always seem to run into them around Abbie's bunker
---
That's for sure, and it could wind up being a part of the legendary update. All I'm thinking is that it would end up being one complicated system to work out the five details with. 
---
You make caps and junk from it.  Its part of the game by design. If i want a bounty to attract PvP, it's a legit tactic encouraged by the developers. Its not greifing. You are absolutely incorrect. This isnt a matter of opinion. Smashing any camp i want is part of the game and not griefing. 
---
You just don't understand the game you are playing.
---
Sorry! Im not trying to be mean its just the was the game was made!
---
It's actually 10 EDT now- which I suppose is actually the same time. 
---
It’s definitely not worth it in my opinion! No one showed up bro but we just took SBQ down on a 3 man in less than ten minutes! 
---
This is why 80s music on the radio would be a great addition!
---
Now you have to found a Two-Shot explosive Gronaks Axe.
---
I agree. Bethesda owns the IP. Their word really is final on what the lore is now.
---
I took it as that costume is part of the quest. You have to put on the costume in order to draw out the sheepsquatch- probably to try mating with you. 
---
Trying to get your friends back into the game with things the game is weak with may not be the best idea.
---
I mean let's say they finish those "fun quests"... then what?
---
Motive doesnt matter. You are incorrect. It isnt griefing. 
---
Griefing is: following a player to another server to attack them specifically after they jump servers away from you. Thats it. Everything else is fair game.
---
Had a 57 and 59 attack me (Level 24) for the Billingsley farm, just a copper, gold, and fertilizer deposit, well, one shot me really and take all my stuff after i tried to be peaceful. Then proceed to keep killing me anytime I got near. Once I realized I had no chance at getting my stuff back I destroyed everything I had built, killed them both once, then left. 
---
Went back 20 minutes later and they had boxed themselves in and were sitting and not even using the workshop or had anything set up. Left me disgruntled and I just logged off for the night. Sometimes pvp isn't about resources or wanting things, it's about being a dick I guess.
---
Hey 900hrs guy. Why would Bethesda thing you had hundreds of thousands of rounds of ultracite ammo? No hate, just curious on what you think happened and maybe how to prevent this from happening.
---
Make sure the game isn't actual running while you download,   it's so much faster. 
---
So is Warhammer 40k for that matter... self important edgelords always ruin everything.
---
It's a slow build up, but you get there in the end! The components that make the Sneaky Sniper work for me are: Sneak 3, Covert Operative 3, Escape Artist, Action Boy 3, (Optional Mr Sandman 2, Ninja 3), Concentrated Fire 3, Rifleman 3, Expert Rifleman 3, Master Rifleman 3, Tank Killer 3, Bird Bones, Marsupial, Speed Demon, Stabilized modification Arms x2 (completely removes 'wobble' while aiming using scope - no need to hold breath), Sleek modification legs x2 (increase speed while sneaking) and most importantly, silenced/suppressed weapons!  
---
The mutations (and to some extent the sleek legs) allow me to get onto rooftops, cliff ledges or other vantage points that take me completely out of melee range and give me the ability to just disappear at will. I can hop around rooftops in Harpers Ferry or Watoga with almost complete impunity and, as the OP very humourously mentioned above, you can just run, do a little teabag dance and resume stealthy activity if you do get spotted.  
---
Sneak in, recon the area, pick your targets when they are isolated, drop in at close range, target head with VATS, two shots, \*GORE-SPLOSION\*, sneak away... then repeat the process! It's definitely slower than the Power Armour and Sledgehammer method (not that there's anything wrong with power armour or sledge hammers!) but I find it a very rewarding kind of gameplay :)
---
I could definitely see raiders wearing them, psychological warfare and all that
---
I support this idea, but only if Bethesda also does a promotion with Monster Energy and I can get a code for the Monster Energy claw mark to place on my power armor in Fallout 76 when I purchase specially marked cans. 
---
Survival mode, he wants to play that definitely. Just tryna help him level up and get some decent weapons before he does.
---
I can offer validation for C.A.M.P. pics but I'm too lazy and curmudgeonly to go through all the rigmarole of navigating to it on xbox :p
---
I tried to see if I could sneakily play it without updating - when it booted up it said “to play, please reset after the update has finished” - I was disappointed lol. It’s in rest mode which generally speeds things up.. hopefully by tomorrow after work I will be good to go!
---
Mine was 102 until a few months ago
---
Ha!
---
Orks aside, when has 40k ever really been all that funny?
---
Unfortunately, people will just server hop to farm the random events in that case.  They already do this when they're trying to find creatures that they can tame for their base.
---
The real issue is that players are a bunch of Veruca Salts and "They want it NOW."  They don't want to be patient or put in effort, they just want all the shiny best stuff right away.  
---
I respect the hell out of the devs for trying to gate this stuff, but it's tough.  People banding together to solve stuff and then sharing it can't have been the way they planned it to go.  What the hell can they even do about people data mining? Even if they encrypted the game data or whatever people are smart and relentless.   
---
But did you find the mushrooms?
---
Ok........ 
---
Cheers mate! 
---
HA HA HA HA HA HA. That's not going to happen. I mean look at the posts. No one is upset that some guy basically cheated, datamined the information then put a video out just because he wanted to be the first to tell everyone about the paint job and how to do the walk through.
---
This is a paint job that does nothing in the game for you, other than allow you to brag you have the paint job. And not one person on this thread figured it out for themselves. These are people that want the reward without doing the work. Totally entitled here. 
---
They don't realize that if the guy hadn't cheated, there wouldn't be a bottleneck to try and get the paint job. And it'll be a bottleneck for about 3-4 weeks. Maybe longer.
---
It's hilarious. 
---
I actually looked it up, apparently there has been one in the game since launch, the OP might be talking about that.
---
Ok. Never knew
---
I've found pink, blue, red and I think yellow
---
You can run two instances if you have two accounts. (otherwise logging into the second will kick you off the first)
---
I bought a second account to serve as storage for things I don't have room for on my main / want to transfer to other characters.
---
We'll probably get an update at 10 EDT- which is 2 hours, 12 min from now. 
---
Iron Fists perk, Talons and Twisted Muscles mutations all add to unarmed damage.  Armor mods don't to my knowledge...  not sure what you're referring to.
---
I believe they scale with whoever's there when they spawn. WS has spawned lvl 9 - 62 depending in the clubhouse.
---
I like to think we're more "windy" than "grindy."  But it was that burrito -- it was delicious!  I regret nothing!
---
Shhh I was already going to do it, don't give everyone else ideas :p

It's an ongoing series of releases... this isn't the end of the update. They release a whole roadmap about this: [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)
---
Nice to know once myself and husband are able to get inside without dying every 3 seconds.  Level 32 and 39.
---
Maintenance usually starts at 11am EDT/ 3pm GMT so I would assume then. 
---
That would be a pun. 100%. But that isnt the post being referred to as that comment was in the post that used irony.
---
I know others have gone through much worse, more often. Stories like this help me cope.
---
Have you come across the never falling scorchbeast yet? I just got the courage to start fighting these things (low level 40s - haven’t played as much as I want) and I think the 2nd one I killed just flew up in the air and stayed there. I know a few levels down the road I’ll be killing these like scorched, but it was deflating and hilarious at the same time. 
---
I know, but remember that 90% of this forum is tryhard grindlord manchildren. They ran everyone else off with their toxic circlejerk and like to try to pretend that they are the voice of the 76 community.
---
I’ve been having same probs on ps4. 
---
The ridiculousness of of everything in 40k is what makes it funny. 3mil staff on an 8km long gothic ship. Hilarious.
---
Ergo my code of conduct.
---
No going after under 50s. Theyre not even a full person yet. Let em grow up
---
No ambushing at plot quest locations (abandoned waste dump for example) they only get that dialogue once. 
---
No bringing help unless it's going after another group. If i fight and lose against one person i might seek revenge, but i won't message my level 200+ buddies for backup. If my victim calls backup, now we've got a gang war going. 
---
And hemlock holes. I choose to leave players at that workshop be, because they're probably scavenging acid to smelt ore, and gods that is a chore and a half. 
---
There were missions I hated, but I was talking about how Rose was just different. She didn't act like a robot, but a person. I like her because she is different from other robots, same for Big, except Biv is funny because he seems drunk.
---
Depending on how it was set up, it might not need maintenance.
---
Could be Bethesda just flips a switch on their side fir the servers that says "Parade event is active." 
---
The first trade I set up on Reddit, I told the guy we would each sell our item to the other for 5000 caps. His response was- oh, you're the guy from Reddit? And then he just gave me his item. So I gave him mine. No silly standoffs or cap down deposits. Being from Reddit gains you some trust. Some of the other players you meet though? Yeah... Get a deposit.
---
Your comment doesnt make sense. Im duscussing the mechanics as they are right now. 
---
This isnt a discussion about what people wish they were. 
---
Right now, this is how they are &amp; how people are using them.
---
Weird... your best bet might be trying to glitch yourself inside the bridge so you can select them. If you jam the C.A.M.P. object up in there and fast travel you might spawn inside, maybe. Some crafting stations (if you face them the opposite way) might also glitch you inside the bridge. Other than that all I can think of is jimmying around with the camera angle until you select it.
---
Aw. Cmon on 
---
My first experience of leaving the vault last night was another human player dressed as a clown standing waving at me...
---
10/10 would leave the vault again.
---
Because when Bethesda replies "We've let the devs know about this idea"? it might have been suggested a thousand times already?  
---
Rather than request a refund I just asked if I could have my username changed as I already invested some time in playing and assumed a refund would be out of the question. Sorry for not clarifying!!
---
Initially I was told my strange username was a result of making a "quick account" and to try verifying my account again. My desired username would should up once selecting the verification link via email and would then revert back the other username upon clicking another page or opening launcher. I explained this to them and was told they'd send it to a specialised team to resolve the issue, only to get a response stating that my "username cannot be changed at this time" and to keep logging in with my actual username. Lovely.
---
I've noticed that there's been an increase of players with the coded username so hopefully Bethesda feels more pressured to resolve the issue.
---
Sorted! well i'm a total dumb ass!  Sorry for wasting your time.
---
It's ridiculous, I thought I'd come back and see what the new update has to offer but I'm greeted with constant disconnects instead.
---
PLEASE
---
May as well help him play effective then. Beckley and everything down south-wests is a pretty effective farming spot and overall untouched by high level players (which raise the enemy level with contact, what's quite toxic for leveling players)
---
There's the Camden Park dailys up north and several events along the road down south. The overall level base is 20-30 too so it's quite managable once he's over the starting procedere. My second char is stationed there and it's been quite enjoyable so far.
---
Hurry up! The parades starting soon.
---
Use an armor workbench and choose modify, you can see what mods your armor has equipped
---
one of us. one of us.
---
WHAT? 300h+ hours of gameplay and i didn't know that! 
---
Haha nope, and I love the game, I am just always low on .44.
---
Yep same here... It's annoying!
---
Was a good fight, thanks :)
---
I haven't aquired incisor, starched genes or class freak yet. I plan on using those if I get them and getting rid of the ones you said like pack rat. 
---
All of the dumb bullshit that people take seriously was actually jokes. The 3rd ed 40k rulebook had a picture of a land speeder made from an empty deodorant container.
---
If you don't see the humor in "Blood for the Blood God, Skulls for the throne of Khorne,"  I just don't know. 
---
What pa armour is it for?,I’ve seen it on the xo1 but no others yet
---
There’s a parade?! Oh man, I am missing out!!
---
No problems on PC. Though I used a wired connection rather than wifi.
---
Oh yeah. I did always take the shear over-the-top insanity of everything as a little tongue in cheek. 
---
You won't be able to play.
---
You haven't followed proper procedure: start a new thread in this sub asking if the game is worth buying now listing your many misgivings in the process first.
---
Skipping this step may result in long download times and unwanted/unpredictable behaviour including (but not only) fun.
---
I bet ya they make it an exclusion zone like around Vault 76...
---
The Flatwoods monster is an alien I think
---
Turn the tables, run Plague Walker for easy aoe tagging and you'll be happy to have a few diseases!
---
For example the brawler armor mod that's moddable on most armor hands (including power armor, which don't allow unarmed weapons though)
---
Level 151 PS4 and level 49 in life. Playing since Fallout....still playing, plan to till I'm over 100.
---
I did this once too, 1 runned, i turned around and laughed and 1 tried to attack me 
---
PA is noob lol
---
Intentional and it didnt come with the new patch, that has been there for some time. Alien is basically the Flatwoods Monster
---
Soon.. soon...
---
And here i thought i was too old to be playing videogames at 32yo. Tks guys
---
Damn, your letting my secret out, lol, Watoga also has quite a few just spread out more.
---
The flatwoods monster counts as an alien but other than that there are no living Zetans...yet
---
Just last night got disconnected running threw a whiresprong nuke zone, uranium fever, and a biv quest. Frustrated isn’t even the word . It’s been laggy af also, to the point I can’t even play the game. I love this game but it I can’t t move my character what’s the point? Hopefully today the fix it . 🙏🙏🙏
---
I ran into one of these bloodied builds a couple days ago... I hit him twice with a 2-hander and did 0 damage. Actually crazy.
---
Well then just do the event in PA and unarmed. Should be fun.......
---
Ok wait I'm out of cores Damm.... Where's my rad suit.  What!!! How does a moth eat the faceplate?
---
Grrrrr guess I'll just watch the parade from the next county.. oh well. Have fun stay safe and nuke it till its in a nother dimension cause we all know. Nukin it from orbit is the only way
---
Really enjoing the damage of Bloodied plasma thrower atm only downside is. It drains ammo like crazy.
---
Haha - no worries. To be fair, the error message is totally not useful.  It shouldn't let you try and save a note without a title anyway.  I'll put it on my list of chores to fix!
---
So you're just here to troll, then.
---
How you liking those downvotes?
---
The answer is PvP. Easily the fastest way to make Caps in the game.
---
I make 3k caps easy in an hour or 2. Last night i made 5k caps from PvP and another 1200 caps selling the profit junk i made during PvP!
---
Dude I feel this pain. I built a rig on Saturday morning and I'm glad I grabbed some indie games first to have something to do while other stuff downloaded.
---
Nice, i think it keeps your reflexes sharp, and we are having real fun at the same time, lol
---
I like the mic approach. The cap thing is of course an option, but if both are maxed or close to maxed on caps, which will often be the case, this wont work. I reckon someone with a "shop", i.e. actively trading with a huge spreadsheet etc will be less likely to scam you. Their reputation would suffer and they have all those god rolls in any case and less incentive to scam you. They will typically have high karma as well. On the other hand, some random dude with no / low karma and no / little trading posting history I would stay away from. 
---
Worst case is you being scammed for an imaginary weapon in a video game, of course. First world problem :-)
---
Here are a couple of my ladies :)

---
That's what brought me here to make this post. I hit level 50 and I had to pick. I realized I better not screw around and ultimately have to move a point twice so I figured I better ask for some advice so I can plan it out a little better or know exactly where I want to go. It makes it a lot more difficult when I need certain perk cards that I don't have too
---
Yes, it would. I’m 46
---
And I keep thinking they reset when the weekly challenges do,
---
I just want to passively farm it 
---
I see the theme of 40k being "overkill of everything for overkills sake" (just watched a huge series of videos on the Siege of Vraks- the most overkill 3 day artillary bombardment ever) but never particularly funny. 
---
I've always used wired. Still using it and getting this problem for some reason.
---
Fun?! This is not what I have signed up for. Good day to you.
---
Because its a bit of light hearted amusement in an otherwise depressed world?
---
My fav outfit is a dirty clown suit and a Fashnacht mask.   
---
LOVE IT. 
---
+10000 points to you for that Aliens reference...
---
I texted him last night! I hope he says yes. He's played video games for years, but mostly NES stuff, so afaik this would be an entirely new experience for him.
---
If you don't think server hopping for 4 hours takes patience and work, you're insane.
---
I have both consoles too (one x and ps4 slim) but on Xbox the game have heavy frame drops, froze like half second, etc. On PS4 without issues. 
---
Haha what indies did you get??
---
After I saw the complete plans for app the T mods, I was afraid so. Looks like we're headed to Harper's Ferry next.
---
Haha, if you sit in that chair you will definitely fall through the map.
---
Thfis is very usefull and also incredibly intuitive. And about armors, is there someone capable of create a Marine Armor Assault Helmet? I litterally can find this. Hope that bethesda increase the dropping rate.
---
We open in about 12 hours, if you ever need some extra caps, feel free to bring me any alcohol or chems you find on your travels bad I'll pay full price. It's free to sleep and enjoy, so even if I'm not home, help yourself, the Starbound is directly next to Whitespring Station. If you've not discovered that location, we can team up and that'll mark the establishment on your map.
---
Happy trails!
---
Before every maintenance they ether tweet or change the ingame menu info box. Even if it's emergency we still get at least an hour before it happens.
---
Try teaming up. I farmed Whitesprings pre-patch 6 and got a 3\* enemy in about every 20 legendaries. Post patch 6, I got almost always 1\* there if I went alone. I teamed up with somebody and there was a fest of 3\* enemies with 2-3\* loot (non nuked). 
---
In addition, Watoga was like every 12th legendary was a 3\*, even solo. If I went there and saw a 3\*, the server kept respawing them every 30-45 minutes while I was away grinding some other location, such as the Steakhouse and Harper's Ferry.
---
Some say it's pure chance and luck but I'm more inclined to think the RNG on the server can glitch for some players and give unlikely good or bad streaks. For example, I threw away anything but Vampiric weapons and the game kept dropping me Vampiric items disproportionately often.
---
I'm 52 and personally volunteer to create the playlist for the devs!
---
I spent all weekend playing Hammerwatch.
---
😂😂😂
---
I'm hoping it's gonna work like that because I'd hate to have an hour downtime for just the parade to be made active.
---
Use the search function. Someone posts this at least once a page.
---
&gt;They join my game and use my camp, which is cool, I made it for everyone to use, but then I feel terrible for turning down their invitations and everything.
---
Instead of an emote, how about a state selector. Like a messaging program that lets you select [Online, Appear Offline, Busy, ...] and instead have [Solo, LFG, Busy, ...]. This way there are no hard feelings from an actuated response due to a message, they will already know before they message you. If they establish a color code, it could even be displayed as an icon when hovering the reticle over another player. 
---
There's actual aluminium cans, which give aluminium, you can tell these, because they have a dent on the side, and say Aluminium can. Then there's tin cans, which give lead, and just good old regular cans. 
---
Sidenote. When you eat certain foods, like dog good, cajun beans and rice, you should get a can, like you when you get a cap for drinking a nuka cola product. 
---
220 hours and I didn't know that :O
---
Last night the Vendor in Cammden Park had a large number of Excavator mod plans.
---
Servos, which I think helps increase weight, were in its inventory.
---
Its not against the rules to not have a code of conduct. 
---
Ita part of the game. By design
---
Therefor it is not griefing.  People need to understand they are incorrectly assuming people are griefing when raiders are out farming caps and junk from other players. 
---
Objectively it is not griefing.
---
Smashing camps to bait PvP
---
SLAP dmg to bait PvP
---
Using workshops to target PvP anywhere on the map. 
---
None of these things are griefing.
---
The Siege of Vraks was released after GW decided they liked the smell of their own farts.
---
I'm actually laughing at you, FritoZanzibar, for how childish you're being. There are MANY MANY MANY scenarios that I can think of just in my own mind where you could be extremely disruptive by speaking out loud at 2AM in a household.... and I don't even know if any of my imaginary scenarios are what SLRWard has to consider. Again, this isn't the point.... the point is, you're being an asshole.  If you aren't capable of answering the question that was asked, don't bother replying and go read something else.
---
Too late now... Someone should have done his/her homework first.
---
There is a possible way out though: just focus on the small issues that by cumulative means might grind you down over an extended period of time and make them ALL your immediate priority :P
---
I disagree. A while ago, some old fucker threatened me over Xbox live for picking up things he dropped on the ground, then when I  ignored him he decided to harass me on reddit. 
---
Depends, how long did you do this to any of them. I had a guy follow me around for over 10 minutes doing this. I didn't get hurt, but it was just annoying as all get out. 
---
I wouldn't say he cheated in datamining. In fact I think datamining is extremely useful at least in regards to this game. With Bethesdas stealth nerfs that never get brought up in patch notes it's nice to know everything that gets changed. 
---
46 and a male gamer as well.
---
Biv from the new dlc is fun to listen to.
---
"Biv's the name, drinking's the game. And I'm in first place, old boy!"
---
Cool so after a disconnect I can just be done with the game for that day lol. 
---
Ah, well. It's the thought that counts.
---
This thread made me think I'm still young. Only lvl 35 IRL :) Thanks for that feel ;)
---
Anything new on the glitched tropies? I didn't get the trophy for reaching level 100.  
---
I did not play in the beta.
---
Yeah, man - a water pump that cures diseases is an absurd mistake.
---
It's unbelievable. I can't believe Bethesda screwed up this badly to let something like that go live /s
---
It's like looking behind the DM's screen. So it's cheating. That's it. Saying stealth nerfs is just a way to justify the cheating. I was looking for something else that probably wasn't there, and look what I found instead. 
---
You have a Fallout76Custom.ini set.  Do a search for it on your PC and either remove it, or make sure the line starting with sResourceArchive2List looks like this to begin with:
---
`sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2`
---
If you have any mods you can put them at the end but make sure you check the mod author's page to ensure its up to date and compatible with the latest FO76 version. 
---
I’ve invested 150 hours into the game and I paid $80 at the time.  I’m kinda annoyed that the price dropped shortly after, but I don’t regret buying the game.  I’ve definitely received my money’s worth, especially knowing I’ll be investing several hundred more hours because of my style of play.
---
I am. How’s it gonna work though when everyone on the map is trying to complete it? Not complaining just curious
---
It happens a lot. Not sure what the backlog is, but if you survive long enough all the damage seems to stack all at once.
---
Thats my standard outfit as well.... 
---
About as soon as all the nuke codes are decrypted. Sooner, even.
---
Wrong. I smadh camps to get a bounty to bait PvP
---
Thats an objective benefit. I make over 5k caps a night doing this...
---
Part of the game by design. You need to understand the game better and realize it isnt about making you frustrated. Frankly i want the junk, the caps and the pvp experience.
---
I may be smashing the camp to bait anyone on the map to come get me. If you dont wanna PvP its your camp im smashing, i can still benefit from attracting other players. 
---
You are absolutely wrong. 
---
Why not use the Grafton Steel Workshop, east of the dam? Steel and lead, so good for bullets
---
I think the masks worked out for the White Glove Society in New Vegas. 
---
Old people are great... except the racist ones... and the occasional evil old lady.
---
Dude, I'm agreeing with you. There's a measurable difference between being a raider that's also a dick, and being a griefer. 
---
I also agree, having been called a griefer for using wrecking ball 3 is a crock of shit. Being called a griefer for server chasing one specific victim, is a duck being called a duck. 
---
The unruly golfers is really fun. People do it for months without wanting to finish.
---
Farm it by having the scrapper perk and scrap weapons. Each weapon give like 20 steel
---
Oh I know exactly what you mean. Consider the OP. He's upset that he has to literaly wait and try to server hop to get this paint job, so he can walk around saying how he got the paint job, and is mad that he can't have NOW. He's totally Veruca Salt. Give it me NOW!
---
He even then complains about how there's not enough to do in this game, even though he's trying to do a quest that is designed to take time. 
---
They really did run people off. I've seen some brag about it. And the moderators let it happen, because they are the same kind of players. Toxic. 
---
Dam, man. Wish I was on...lol
---
Should be
---
some salt doesnt hurt either. I mean it hurts but well you know what I mean.
---
Some lvl 300 near white springs followed me home and orbital strikes me
---
Yes, server stalking IS griefing. Agreed
---
Or trade for them with some generous player who will get several of them all.
---
What is that?
---
They need to learn how to run 
---
*"Oh Neptune..."*
---
The presence of living Zetans can neither be confirmed nor denied.
---
From my experience, no matter what it actually goes to your workshop, it says it's always sheepsquach
---
Hrm. Interesting! But ... did you do any work on leaded Combat Armor? The RR you can get from some of that is nice. It's not a \*huge\* thing, but any radiation resistance is better than none, right? (I'm not sure which armors can get the best RR tho. \*probably\* Marine, but I'm not certain.)  
---
Now, if you want to take this to the next level, try to figure out how much weight the assorted pieces have when modded in order to find the best bang for the carry weight. Leather, I know, looks even better like that while metal, not so much...
---
Oh :( that sucks. I'm sorry. We put a lot of effort into our camps, it is a shame a jerk can come along and undo all that work in an instant. 
---
Rad worms HATE this one weird trick!
---
It didn’t happen for all my workshops. Only Billings, Grafton Steel, and I think the food factory
---
I was @ Camden last night.  Killed everything, got a few cool weapons, picked up a fusion core, checked out the vendors inventory....but the event did not spawn while I was there. 
---
Maybe it's a magic text window? That's why FO76 doesn't have it, no magic.
---
Stop. Find a different game. Division 2 and Warframe come to mind - just give the game a break until new content comes out.
---
Different kind of patience.  You're still trying to force something to happen instead of waiting to see when you'll get lucky and have it be there.
---
In a few days or weeks the hype will wind down and people will be server hopping to do the event for Fasnacht masks or whatever.  Or else they'll change the quests now that people have essentially hacked it, and people will be all butthurt about how easy they made it after you wasted all this time trying to get Quantum Paint. It's just like when they made plans available at vendors and people were salty about the time they wasted hopping for Handmade plans.
---
It's the same thing with farming Legendaries.  Maybe it's just my attitude that's so different and I get enjoyment from different time, but I bet that if people would stop trying to face tank the RNG until they get get the thing they think they want they might be a little more chill and find other ways to have fun.  
---
It’s a dev room item I think. It was meant to be in the game but I don’t think they implemented it fully to have it spawn but some people managed to get it
---
If you're looking for someone to play with feel free 
---
Yeah, every few days I go and make 20+ of the things at my harvest spot. I tend to burn through around 2 a day normally but, sometimes, I can eat 8 (!) in a single day's exploration. 
---
Trust me I know that feeling. Downloaded the game the day the first big patch came out. Took around 11 hours to download the game on my dsl. Then as soon as it finished I had to download another 40gb for the patch before I could play for the first time. Was 2 days after I bought it before I could start because of work lol. So yeah I know your pain all too well
---
I the early eighties I had a Commodore 64 with a datasette. (I recorded games from the national radio!). 
---
*God I’m old!*
---
350 hours and I never saw this...  Thanks for posting!
---
Just as you might find a synth component on some corpses in FO4, search the loot bags of some “players” in FO76 and you may find alien components.
---
Thanks I’ve been looking forward to this event.
---
Not really. A post apocalypse doesn't _need_ to be some Edgy McMyChemicalRomance affair. The silliness and humour has always been a staple since the days when Interplay ran things, and that humour is what makes the actual edgy stuff stand out as horrifying.
---
Listening to a goofy song while traveling with your Eyebot when you stumble upon a buss with a bunch of child skeletons. The origin of Super Mutants. The way it brings the idealistic future of 1950's America and then bombs the shit out of it is what makes Fallout what it is.
---
True, 1 &amp; 2 had a more Mad Max vibe. But the cars still had fins, the technology was still retro and the humour was DEFINITELY there. Fallout 2, regarded as one of the best in the series, was criticized occasionally for being TOO silly. Does that mean Interplay wasn't making a Fallout game, and instead were making something else? This isn't The Last Of Us, the Walking Dead, Mad Max or whatever he thinks he's playing. It's Fallout, where the leather, mohawks, spikes and blood live with the white picket fences, poodle skirts and tommy guns. 
---
Fasnacht is actually one of the most Fallout-y things I've seen in a while.
---
So... No, he doesn't _really_ have a point. Not in my opinion, at least
---
Some enemies do better with non explosive weapons ( armored type)
---
I haven’t thought about GURPS in decades!   Thank you for the memory.  
---
No go to camden park for excavator. There is another one also
---
I played FO1 shortly after release, and I've been a FO fan since, Level 150+ on Xbox, &amp; lv58 IRL.
---
I've met a lot of players in my age range on 76, most are more casual players, and also met a lot of young (20s-30s) players (men &amp; women), that are laid back and fun to play with as well. I really enjoy helping others, cooperative game play is what I always wanted from an online Fallout, But the PVP aspect of the game can be fun as well, as long as it's not some group griefing a lone player just to be an A$$hat.
---
79!?  Awesome!  
---
I believe that is intelligence.
---
Thanks.
---
&gt; yeah I’m that guy 
---
Amos?! :P
---
It's already there though.
---
Look at Nuka-Shine. That first bottle you have to get from the frat-house, is always sitting on that desk, for everyone. At least that's what I saw when I went there and 2 people had just went in ahead of me.
---
Unless they didn't grab it for some reason (the quest tells you to and it's incredibly obvious where it is), it's visible to everyone and each person that goes in can grab it.
---
So it at least seems like they can totally make an item appear for everyone and be able to be picked up by everyone without a new server or long respawn timer.
---
Maybe folks want to design their CAMP like the old days before the bombs fell. They want to be reminded of the daughter they lost in the wastes before they had a foothold from the vault. Samantha always talked about wanting a pretty pink bed instead of the "Vault Blue", but she passed before her dream was realized. As widower to a late child you want to keep her memory alive.
---
You find a pristine bed in an abandoned "Wilsons Atomatoys" and all those memories come crashing back. You bring it back to you humble abode to be reminded of a time before you wife was left out of the vault and your daughter was killed by monsters. 
---
You sleep in it every night wishing to be with them, but you can't bring yourself to give up until you do everything in your power to make the wasteland safe for every child... You know your work will never be done, but every step closer keeps you going. 
---
TLDR; Princess Beds are cute.    
---
Excavator Mods Plans at Camden Park
---
Send me a message not online at the moment but I could always have a look got one vampire and I think the other might be AAE or bloodied.
---
I don't use mods and my ultracite laser rifle with a sniper barrel shoots red. I literally just posted about this lol
---
ApologiseMeow 
---
So did I.  Signed, Finster.  
---
Would love to play with you...in 10 years when it downloads!
---
It's not started yet but I think it starts today for a week. You should be ready just in time 😀
---
I was reading last night that they will be an update before 
---
Vim and hot rod shark were amazing 
---
No! It should cater to me and only me!
---
Well rested vanishes too if my camp cannot be placed.
---
yup, about 3 hrs from now, same as challenge resets, so check the timer on the daily/weekly.    
---
I'm practically vibrating in anticipation, and I haven't even had a coffee yet.
---
So the one-time code resets for everyone if anyone else gets a new one?  The how-to I read made it sound like it was instanced for each person but I've had trouble using the code.  If someone else can reset it, that would make sense.
---
Do you think there will be a patch and downtime?
---
I have had more success with Power Armor /w Emergency Protocols + overdriver servos.  Then speccing towards them.
---
Yeah I just got an Instigating limb dmg one from a protectron yesterday. Wanted to make sure the bug was gone before I risked 3700 fusion cells lol
---
It’s been happening with my melee weapons too, and gun bashes.
---
Probably wasn't there?  Come on now, they haven't been exactly upfront when they nerf something into oblivion. They've backpedaled A LOT when they get caught and say "Oh we just forgot to put this hugely annoying change into the notes" or after a really big mess up "Oh that change wasn't supposed to happen at all, it's totally a bug". 
---
Is the disease airborne or only communicable through direct contact? The difference between catching a cold virus because someone sneezed or getting herpes because someone... Well, we all know how to get the herpes mutation and usually take precautions to avoid that.
---
I have literally never had a "griefer" on me following me around before. I've had raider camp attacks though.
---
I was coming here to say just this.   I’m not 100% sure how it works, but thought I read something about it scaling with your diseases, so I don’t cure them. I’m also very lazy. 
---
It's great to have the base stats! I noticed you don't have weights on here. I would be cautious about characterizing higher resistance alone as "better" and "best" because it also comes with much higher weight and for players without weightless legendary armor or mutations who have low carry weight, wearing heavy armor can really make gameplay difficult.
---
For example I wear tempered/hardened ultralight marine armor because it has a good mix of DR, ER, a little RRb and with ultralight it weighs 1-2 pounds per piece. I can make heavy combat armor but even with ultralight, it's too heavy with the pieces coming in at 5+ each. (Chest is 8).
---
By that level I had sneak skills, marsupial and a good gun and still got killed a few times getting the historic weapon lol
---
Hmm no idea with those - I haven't tried them.  Was aware of rusty knuckles for power armor but not the ones for normal armor.
---
Likewise, eager to hear some advice too.
---
Is someone able to post the german location names?
---
Because nobody would ever talk to each other again if that was a feature?
---
Other players: Appear on map
---
Me, if this was a thing: get inside, the germs are coming
---
Wish I could have hopped on.i saw your first post as I was logging out to go to work.
---
Sorry, but I think fastest way to get steel is to go to the top of the world and grab the 6 tin can traps at the raider camp and resourt, then server hop so mabye a camp by top of the world
---
You still doing it? 
---
I am not sure why, but I automatically read that last part in Hank Hill's voice. 100x better.
---
Yeah man. Dropping this last nuke on her then will have a break for a hour! Jump in if you want bro 
---
İ wish they do such a thing
---
T51 has the best DR, but there's really only a narrow build set that benefits from it and even less that would be vulnerable to such a build in very few circumstances. 
---
I think some of the issues with PvP balance get much more balanced when survival drops just on account of how aid items are dropped upon death. Add in legendary PA and things get even more interesting.
---
If I had a cap every time I saw a post identical to this...
---
I’ll still be doing it later on dude
---
You can get 1200 lead in ten minutes by collection all the lead ore in excavator power armor, but you will need around 160 waste acid to smelt it down. Still beats an extractor by a long shot though
---
What does heavy/explosives mean to you? To me that means heavy weapons/explosives. Which is exactly what is in my build. Even ignoring the heavy weapons part, what, pray tell, would you say is missing from an explosives build?
---
was wondering that myself, the balloons and banners aren't up in Helvetia yet, so a maybe? or perhaps just a rolling server reset. I just hope nothing gets F'd up when this starts, there is enough instability still in the game as it is.
---
@ L42, I've these have been my goto's for a long time:
---
Vampire machete (nuke zone, everything)
---
Death Tambo (everywhere except nuke zone - can't equip this while in power armor)
---
Furious fire axe (everything)
---
Marksman hardened Sniper Rifle (mutants)
---
Marksmans hardened combat rifle (mole miners)
---
Tactical combat shotgun  (flying critters)
---
My advice? Do what I did and switch to melee and secondary your heavy weapons. The game got much more playable when I did.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I believe that PS4 is a superior console. However, I believe Sony’s insistence on certain proprietary things as well as the DualShock’s lack of long term comfort, turn me to Xbox. 
---
It all started with Fallout 4. PS4 only had in-game assets for external mods. Xbox allowed original assets. Granted, it’s not the free for all that PC gets to enjoy for mods, but I had Fallout 4 on both consoles, and hugely preferred Xbox because of those mods. 
---
And the Elite Controller on Xbox is seriously awesome. 
---
Won't be there for the third one, heavy guns ftw
---
"near impossible", really?
---
I’ll still be doing it later bro 
---
There's a game mechanic that you have access to as early as level 2 that allows you to entirely negate sentinel damage mitigation. They're called critical strikes.
---
Be there in 5 mins just finishing an event. Might need some fusion cores if someone is selling them
---
He didn't cheat he is playing the game fairly and the way he wants to within the confines of the rules of the game. Why report him? I get that most people want nothing to do with other players like that but he isn't duping or rule breaking.
---
What about wood armor?
---
Super duper in the luck tree helps. But as a ex heavy gun user I say make your own ammo. See those cans? Take them! One can has 1 part lead and 2 parts steel. Need gunpowder? Sure you can kill the big green guys but make it yourself! Just need acid and cloth. The spots that I like to farm cans at I can easily make over 20k ammo for my guns
---
You on PC? I can craft deep pockets onto all leather armour. In fact i think I can do it for all armour!
---
"No, keep playing." -Bethesda
---
See, this is annoying. They have never nerfed something to oblivion. They have not had to backpedal A LOT saying they forgot something. A couple times. 
---
And a nerf is when you make something completely useless. Not even TSE weapons were made use less. An increase in damage is still an increase in damage. 
---
So when you say nerf things, it's really been a case of tweaking, because nothings been made completely useless.
---
People will claim that it has, because it went from always winning when doing this, to not always winning, but still getting a benefit out of it.
---
A lot of the people on this reddit are a lot of the kind of players that don't actually want a game to be a challenge. They just want to feel big and important about being uber in a video game they put the least amount of effort into. 
---
I hope so, man.
---
Sweet! Hopefully future patches wont mess with it again. Fingers crossed.
---
Feel the same way. Started on Day 1 so it is definitely doable. Only thing I might take since they are rather rare early on, are a few Radaways...collecting water before getting the Hazmat suit is a bit annoying. 
---
My approach:
---
- 50 Cal is Queen only. That thing chews through ammo.
---
- Minigun, traded; bye bye Minigun.
---
- Hybrid build; every cartridge/weapon farmed with melee is a net gain in terms of ordinance and materials to make more ordinance. Nets exp too as opposed to dealing with the 'muh PvP' crowd by taking over workshops.
---
- Supermutants for gunpowder, steel and plastic (from laser weapons) robots for lead. Picking up dumbells and stuff is something you do as you grind XP, not instead of, up until XP no longer matters.
---
- Fuck workshops. No, really, fuck workshops.
---
this is what i do, my only slowdown is acid: 
---
1. run to hornwrite testing 3, you can get 100-200 iron ore (luck dependant)
---
2. run lucky hole for lead ore
---
3. smelt with super duper (chance to double)
---
4. then craft ammo with ammosmith + super duper (to get bonus ammo and a chance to double)
---
imo: also unless your minigun is godrolled id stash it and use the gatling for ammo efficiency and swap to the .50 when you need dps.  the ammo plant is also super slow for heavy ammo and you can outcraft it.
---
Played Zork on my C64 with my cassette player too!
---
Well I heard that they confirmed that having it and spread trough player isn't illegal but thanks, I 'll wait then!
---
Nice, 
---
So they have 50% armor ignore and explosive with vampire or bloodied as well ? didn't know that, if so it must be vampire for me, since i run a full health character :)
---
It was a good move to give another extra week of life to the game ...
---
Well I did quite a lot of research last night and from what I understand, when you log on a server a loot table is set for you, dependent on a lot of things, mainly how many people are on the server and what legendaries are left on the loot table. 
---
This is an absurd take. It's supposed to be a cool little secret you stumble upon as you're playing, not something the devs would "advertise." Those kinds of things are a staple of Bethesda games and part of what makes them unique.
---
Put on excavator arms, go to lucky hole mine for 2-400 lead ore. Now you should only have trouble keeping up with the steel and acid you'll need. Munitions factory really isn't worth it.
---
Whoever decided “limited only” items should hit the can, I would had payed real money if I had all the options available at all times 
---
Did you play FO4?
---
They eventually gave us display cases / wall mounts for weapons, mannequins for clothing and normal armor, and larger display stands for power armor.
---
I'm not 100% sure what we'll be getting here, but they have mentioned giving us displays in one of the upcoming patches.
---
April 9th is player vending so that MIGHT be when.
---
They list it in the same bullet point:
---
&gt;New Features: C.A.M.P. Decorating, Player Vending, Functional Camera – Use items from your stash to decorate your C.A.M.P. Build vending machines and flag items for sale. Simply set your prices and walk away to continue your adventures in Appalachia, being sure to capture all your favorite memories using the new functional camera. The vending machines do all the work, you just need to count the caps.
---
[But the date specific listings only mention Vending on the 9th, and the camera on the 16th.](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/3WheBXLAEMvTMFH70ejA9x/c38119dfaf0c67a3434df05b7d76d2c6/Fallout76_RoadMap_1920x1080_WildAppalachia-05-EN.png)
---
So at best I would confidently say early-mid April we should get it.
---
Such information is highly classified. Not that it exists.
---
Well, I got few advices (maybe obvious, but might help)
---
\- always craft ammo with superduper perk - it randomly double crafted items - from my experience it's around 30% chance, but sometimes even more frequently.
---
\- visit cervasse dam - there are always can chimes (at least 4) that gave quite a lot of lead and steel as well as supermutants, which almost always gave some gunpowder.
---
\- get yourself good melee to not waste ammo on smaller enemies - melee and heavy gunner is easy switchable if you got perks learned.
---
Do you want the Corrupted Blood Plague? This is how you end up with another Corrupted Blood Plague.
---
This would be interesting! But to balance it they'd need to make it a low percentage chance of contracting the disease from another player or everyone would be constantly diseased! It would be funny to see the response tho! I could imagine players banding together and creating a F.O.D.E.P or Fallout Disease Epidemic Prevention unit! 😂
---
There's a notice once you start claiming a workbench that claiming it can pull you into PvP. You have to agree before you claim. How is it forced PvP?
---
Yes I took me 4 hours and 2 k caps to realize get key cards get code generator , investigate cabin and then proceed if the cabin is closed 
---
I'd recommend looking into the real life history of the Flatwoods Monster, it's pretty cool.
---
WTF
---
Only communicable through direct contact. It would help to make player interaction more tense since you don't know if they have a disease or not. Plus, if diseases where airborne it would be annoying constantly getting a disease for no apparent reason.
---
I got the SGT paint a few turn ins later
---
“Limited time”
---
It depends on how it's done because if they do it like ark survival evolved it would be annoying as hell.
---
Met a 74 year old man in game 2 days ago. He showed me his base not far from top of the world. And was kind enough to give me a lot of adhesive.
---
I gave him a two-shot lever action rifle - and clearly made his day. :)
---
That would be nice, especiually since I have 2 unused points in Strength....
---
The cards I have not used are dupes of cards I've already maxed...and I can't pick a new card when I level up b/c it tells me I've already maxed the category.
---
Hahaha was it worth the wait??
---
Hawt
---
No worries man. Thanks for the help! 
---
We are not using them on other players, lol :)
---
I agree. It seems really unbalanced until you really pick it apart and make a PvP build. Then you realize you have the upper hand against anyone without a PvP build but you're still fragile to a good number of common PvP builds.
---
Great idea , but then even rolling power armor skins seems to be slow , I’ll be 50 by the time they do something like this 
---
I've only had one server disconnect in the past week. But if it's really such a big issue, Bethesda should really pick up the pace fixing it.
---
Would be intrested in buying the nuka cola dark recipy if your on PS4
---
The diseases in this game are a joke and we have abundant disease cures. Lol
---
They both suck, but I can at least plant crops to eat w/ herbivore
---
As soon as the lead developer wakes up and pushes the button
---
I didn't know this either 
---
Hells yeah man! Is it easy to find people to play with? 
---
Yeah, the possibility of getting a disease would be low, but it would help to make player interaction more tense!
---
I use the sack hood 
---
174 tokens.  
---
Not only isn't the daily dropping but I also can't buy the costume because the option doesn't show on the redemption terminal. :(.
---
I should juuuust make it 😂
---
Going to be honest, that would be awesome.
---
Yeah I charge in with a Space Suit and an Explosive Gatling Gun. Super fun and I still die often enough to make it a challenge.  Maybe I should invest in some armor...
---
Melee weapons
---
I know right??
---
Not sure it could be considered complete without wood
---
it has ? i have the long bar and the flamer, didn't know about this on, thanks, have to go chainsaw hunting then, since we cant make them  :)
---
+karma
---
World was full took me about 5 minutes to get in. Be ready by drop time. Plus one for the good fight! 
---
I imagine the possibility of it happening would be low. Not enough for you to be concerned by it but just enough that interacting with other players becomes more tense.
---
That wouldn't really make sense, though. I mean, Vault 76 only recieved the 2000 model. Assuming every Vault in West Virginia was built within the same timeframe, the 3000 wouldn't have existed yet. And since no Vault with the 3000 has opened yet, that kinda makes it... Impossible.
---
For me absolutely. I've always considered Fallout and Elder Scrolls games to be my favorites. Fallout more so. . So I am kinda biased lol. Now that they fixed alot of the old bugs and added new things I play it 2 or 3x as much now as I did at first. Esp when you get past level 30 or so. It's gonna be tough sometimes until you get your perks and weapons right. Best of luck to you!
---
It worked for me, showed a damage increase on my lever action, my 10mm smg, and my gauss rifle.  The effect was there and it seemed to be working.  Not sure what's going on on your end but it seemed functional to me yesterday...
---
Because no other secondary prefix gives more damage than explosive.
---
AAE and IE is still good for PVE situations. 
---
Since the in game opponents can all be destroyed easily with the All Rise, I thought people invest to be "ready" for a pvp battle, not that they want to do it, but as soon as you have a workshop you are forced to fight.
---
I liek the tradein option.
---
I'm strength 15 with 2 unused points.  I have 2 available cards, both of which are dupes of others I've already maxed out.
---
I can't select a new card at level up, because 15 is max....
---
So ya, I'd like to trade in the two useless cards I have so I can utilize the unused points.
---
I only have 3... Am I doing something wrong?
---
All plans should be treated that way.  We can't sell them to vendors, so that can't be exploited.
---
Sure, you could sell them to other players, but they would be worthless (*as the should be*) if everybody can just grab it unless they are too lazy.
---
I mean, there aren't "rare" plans.  There's just the effort to get them.  We can all get the exact same plans.
---
Explosive is still one of the best legendary effects. 
---
Stims 5

Flux 50 ( I payed 100 once but I was delivered to me and crafted lol ,times of desperation )

Thank you sir! I’m going to hook up a pylon today.

Would have joined, but PC master race...:(
---
A set of heavy polished robot armor will give you 115 rad resist.
---
the 25% more speed should be more effective against players, when they are wearing Fireproof or am I wrong?
---
In my opinion, yes! You'll likely come across many players who would love to let you tag along and help you!
---
Speed??
---
I’m looking in to the future and yup it’s gone 
---
How long does the event last?
---
I forgot about this and landed the killing blow on a legendary Mr Gutsy while another melee player was up in his face attacking. The other player was hilariously killed in the enormous explosion that immediately triggered. But I stimpack revived him right away. 
---
I also forgot and killed a legendary Gutsy in the parking lot at Sugar Grove. I knew what it was to roast in the depths of the Tor that day I tell you.
---
I've been farming them for ages and they definitely changed.
---
Legendary protectrons previously exploded most of the time, with a delay. About 10 seconds or so from when you killed them to when they blew up.
---
Now they typically explode almost instantly upon death.
---
It's inconsistent though, some times none of them explode. Sometimes only the level 50 ones do, other times only the level &lt; 50 ones do. It's pretty random in my experience.
---
true, but i am one of those that never takes a workshop anymore, my big goal in lift is to kill all the nastys in the wasteland, once and for all, lol
---
That's probably if it's repaired over 100%. In my experience, 86 is the max at 100%.
---
I’ve got red blue yellow and some sort of teal or grey
---
until the Lone wanderer rolled into town
---
That's my plan as well. I'll be on around 5pm.
---
I am a full melee buff build player. I have none of these problems and I don't sneak.  
---
"HULK SMASH!"  
---
See you then bro
---
Xbox here Camden broken since patch 
---
The rad resist on power armor and hazmat suits mean nothing. You used to be able to stack rad x diluted and could add additional rad resist on top of each buff. If you took so many that you had double the rad resist of PA you would still take more rad damage than you would in PA despite having double the listed rad resistance.
---
There's just something going on in the background that isn't readily viewable on the data sheet. 
---
That said, I know one person who has a rad resist build that allows him to travel nuke zones without PA. It's mostly trapper armor with +25 rad resist, 3 levels of rad sponge with a full party around him constantly, and stacking rad resist chems. It all sounds great until you realize glowing ones still hit you for a crap ton of rad damage.
---
Because there's no way Bethesda system could have false positives because they're a perfect company and everything they do is perfect.
---
If Todd says it, so shall it be.
---
We don't tolerate non-Bethesda worshippers here, though. 
---
25% more firerate instead of explo
---
You have to match it up based on its DR/ER. It's really dumb that they took the type out of the description.
---
The more I think about it the more I love the idea!
---
You need to pay attention to who is replying to who.
---
  "In your camp you can only have one cow." - is WRONG.
---
Besides the right perk cards you should have mutation  Adrenal Reaction and  Talons  for sure. Twisted Muscle is always good to have and my favorite  Marsupial

@lonevaultwanderer
---
lol this is like a 6 month old topic. Nice Necro skills there. Also it wasn't childish if you were around at the time and saw the dozens of posts and attitude this guy had wanting everything spoon fed to him and changes to fit his play style it would be a different story.
---
Also no, it is not HIS workshop. He currently has operation of it and people are allowed to challenge that and attempt to take it. That's the whole point.
---
So long, don't play this heap anymore.
---
I have tried to often share a workshop if someone shows up by teaming with them. Trying to guard it is easier with a group since I'm often busy with a quest and have to stop to go back and defend, so with a group we can take turns defending and work out a deal to share whatever we are producing. 
---
Please share with those guys that get paid to play 
---
Hahah yea for me sometimes it fixes itself other times I have to switch too ranged weapon to kill
---
+ custom fitted leg armor ftw
---
Tbh I don't use a powerfist but I haven't had that happen with other weapons
---
Can traps at Whitesprings are the best for this.
---
Ah I see you have been to that hut at the bottom of the map where you launch skeletons into the forest for this idea... I like the idea of Brahmin launching more! 
---
Yeah I've noticed this as well
---
You don't always get "Wasted on __________" either, sometimes it's "Tipsy Taste Test". 
---
I have to talk to him about 5 times for him to give me his daily. Annoying little drunk. 
---
It WOULD be a lot of fun and immersive, but I don't see it happening. The devs would have to add armor and clothing models for all the variants that fit all the new character models. That would be a development-level pain in the ass, unfortunately. And extremely bloat game file size. Just two genders is hard enough. Multiply that by adding extra "races" and you have a colossal mess.
---
Don't play on pacifist much tbh, but that's an interesting bug
---
It's not patience to bang your head against a wall until you bust through just because it takes a long time.
---
I feel your pain , while duppers had their share of fun with tokens a good gamer gets nothing in return I have 96 tokens shows the amount of dedication I had to this , because tbh if it wasn’t for things like this I would not be online longer then 20 minutes ... then this ... 
---
I dislike all the hate on a group of people that push the game to the max even if they're breaking it. Call them cheaters if you will, but half of my FL getting banned made things lonely for a time. Sick of all you casuals wanting hardcore decisions made. Why does everyone care so damn much what others are doing? Worry about Bethesda fixing it, not questioning the morality of other's motivation over a damn video game. I know many dupers, they are just people. Some with families, some are successful in life generally, others are trashy people. Call me a duper all you want but I buy everything with caps and damn if I don't appreciate only spending 10k caps on a gun rather than never getting the gun without a world of warcraft mentality.
---
I always imagined "building" those items as your character literally dragging the item home lol. Like, scrapped together generators yeah, but a pre-War sofa even is just unlikely.
---
I guess, realistically, you can make any number of excuses for a stove. I mean, there are empty houses with intact appliances. It shouldn't be too hard to repair said items
---
Farm scorched, mole miners and super mutants (in that order) for their weapons and scrap them. Weapons are my prime source of steel scrap. Don't bother with extractors, their production rate is garbage. The only worthwile extractor is acid as there are few reliable sources for that.
---
I'll have to do some testing to confirm this happens to me as well because I occasionally do ranged sneak attacks
---
I have this bow bar on my chainsaw but it only does 5 damage it’s a level 25 , school me in this piece of equipment lol
---
There's a pic of the legendary vendor with a PA piece on a dresser next to them. I'm pretty much jumping to conclusions here, but I think it'll happen. There were a few legendary/unique PA pieces in FO4, so I don't see why they wouldn't put them in FO76
---
Yeah I’ve gotta save for that sweet sweet nuka cola sign 
---
I agree with this or have a small constant glowing exclamation mark near the hunger/thirst bar to notify you of that.
---
The fact that it fits with the lore of the area makes it pretty neat IMO. It's a real life event, plus it's a bit goofy so it fits perfectly with the Fallout theme.

Unless someone tries to physically molest me, my space helmet keeps all your nasty joojoo outside of my personal biodome.

---
Theoretical DPS yes, reality no. In terms of versatility explosive outweighs 25% more fire rate.
---
1. More damage per shot( save more ammo)
---
2. Aoe effect so even if u miss u can still do some damage
---
3. Stagger chance(best on shotguns)
---
4. Good on literally every weapon where as fire rate would be useless on non automatic weapons
---
5. Boosted by demo expert unlike fire rate which isn't boosted by anything

Just because it’s possible to do with game mechanics doesn’t mean it’s not griefing... to me griefing is when you are deliberately ruining or harming someone else’s gaming experience with little to no incentive or reward on your own end. PvP is opt in in this game and some people simple don’t want to engage in it. 
---
Let’s remember this isn’t real life, some people are just wanting to have fun playing the game and making innocent people upset/angry/frustrated with the game for your own entertainment is pretty inconsiderate, raider role play or not.

this is awesome!

Yes, please.  I need to build an Iron Man-style Hall of Armor for all my power armors.  That was always my endgame in Fallout 4, and I need to do it here, too.

It affects the durability of the loot

What do you mean? As in if i've changed it before?
---
I’m on PS4 my tag is hanzito_

I second your LOL
---
Wow you are pretty pathetic.
---
I agree with you in the controller opinion in ergonomics. On the PS4 controller only 2 thing is what I like betten than on One. Thumbsticks (it's tougher, more precise) and triggers.

First I bought the Xbox version and after that PS. The game looks better on Xbox, but perform on Sony console.
---
I have lot more friends on Xbox, I play my times 90% on Xbox. 
---
That's it? 
---
First thing you need to do is get it repaired to 200%. That ups the dps quite a bit. 
---
Yeah I was looking for it the other day and did not see it cause I was looking in the middle of the fountain.
---
I was genuinely hoping one of those guys in power armor would give me a good gun or some armor but all I got was waves back and decline team invites lol oh well. The first guy that helped me out was a total gem. 
---
yet another dumbass that defends sad pathetic losers get lost fuckboy
---
oh so this must be one of the losers that was trying to get people to server stalk
---
If you are not on PC and /or have not edited your *Fallout76Custom.ini* file ignore this advice.
---
Yes, the game tells you this
---
You’re right I just tried it, only got 8 Blamco after 15mins. I hooked up to the terminal but didn’t assign anything. So I think my gf must’ve assigned and not realized it after awhile playing idk. Sorry guys.
---
Hard to tell, but that looks like the union soldier outfit. It has a non functional backpack. Cosmetic only.
---
I'm sure you have noticed in the past, but just in case, my PS4 downloads much slower when I'm streaming Hulu/Netflix. My internet is 300 so that isn't the problem. The PS4 just seems to prioritize the video. To be fair, this could be confirmation bias so take it as you will. 
---
There are many ways the game could have been set up when it comes to legendary drops, but in order to maintain a balance for the game economy and create a reason for player to player trading, Great 3\* drops have to be rare, otherwise the game would be stuffed with God Roll weapons &amp; Armor, and no one would have a reason to grind or trade. Duping flooded the game with Top Tier weapons and other things that had a very negative effect on the game economy not to mention the effect it had on the servers.
---
If every 3\* Legendary enemy dropped a top tier 3\* Item it would have the same negative effects on the game as Duping did, and the only other way to prevent this would be to make the 3\* Legendary Enemy spawn more rare.
---
So, would you rather have a higher number of Legendary Enemy Spawns, with a rare chance for a great drop, or a rare chance at finding a legendary Enemy with a higher chance for a great roll?
---
Just my opinion, but I think  things are working as they were intended, to maintain balance, just not the way some players would like it to be. I've gotten a lot of really good weapons in the game, but those are roughly 1 out of every 250 drops, which seems appropriate for something that is supposed to be Rare.
---
Also, maybe this is somewhat related to who's game you play on. If you're playing from oceania but joining on friends in NA you'll probably experience it more often. When I was fighting you the other day at vault 76 I def noticed it off and on. Maybe the upside is there's a chance it'll go both ways?
---
Should only be Hard when you have to many low levels with you, they Do little to no damage but up the armor of the queen 
---
Third the LOL
---
The Atomshop.. its like Amazon for the wasteland!
---
Nice! We can only hope.
---
I also just got the game due to the recent update and it’s on sale on PS store. 
---
Having trouble teaming up with anyone saying invites were declined but they didn’t even receive it. 
---
Other than that, it’s a good game! Only level 7
---
For me personally, the queen is supposed to be the ultimate in end game content and therefore not supposed to be easy.
---
She is supposed to take time and planning with a team, or to be completely annihilated with a massive pick up group making goo use of their perks. 
---
What would be nice instead of a nerf to the queen or buff to weaponry, would be some much better loot on her loot table. 
---
Just my 2 cents
---
I am on pc and have changed it to fix a resolution bug where alt tabbing lowered the resolution.
---
Devils back bone 
---
Look at pictures. Its from FO4 but still use the same models for 76 for armor types.  https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_4_armor_and_clothing
---
Yes. Killed me a couple of times.  
---
It happened way too fast since the Wild appalachia update.  
---
Just before the update I was farming something in Watoga. It was normal. Now, instant BOOM. As a Melee that sucks.  
---
I think they mentioned you won't be able to target a nuke there for the duration of this, it would be interesting to see happen though. Suck for low level's trying to do the event, but could be a hell of a fun party at higher levels
---
Reaction time goes down with age, but mental capacity and coordination can be preserved by playing games.
---
You order with an Emergency Requisition Holotape and get same day delivery via cargobot.
---
Well, my mind's changed. 
---
(I'm not being sarcastic, my mind really is changed)
---
That’s awesome to hear. I’m also a big Fallout fan, so I’m really excited to get into it!
---
Pretty useless once you hit high levels you literally have 1,2,3 star variations of the same cards for different type of situational combat 
---
Sounds great! Perhaps I’ll run into you! 😁
---
Go to West Tek and pick up all the assault rifles the super mutants drop. Scrap them with the Perk that gives you extra materials when scrapping armor and weapons(I think it’s called Scavenger under intelligence) you get 19 steel per gun. 
---
Gotcha. I don't care about cosmetics so I wouldn't know about that one. 
---
and i know you're one of those pathetic losers,   get lost bud, you're not proving anything other than you are the reason this game is shit greifing other players and harassing them. i would love to see you join my psn party but oh wait cowards like you won't do shit but hide here ;)
---
Oh no, you’re totally right, the PS4 seems to prioritise video! It’s in rest mode now, I find that usually speeds things along a bit
---
I'm glad more people are trying the game. That's all I can really say. The mob of irrational hate still has me irritated. I'm just glad the trolling has died down. 
---
Wish more ppl had your mentality. Started about a month ago, lvl 14 at a train station. I was looking at all the stuff soaking it in, when this level 120 guy in power armor started hitting me with a sledgehammer and before I realized what happened I died losing all my junk (starting out that stuff is useful for me at least).
---
I left the server and joined a new one, I make it to the golf course and I get to the middle where this tennis court is, I'm slowly doing ok by running on a car and killing them. This level 79 guy waved and shot the car I was on, then proceeded to crouch/stand (teabag) me and killed the rest of the guys). I literally stopped playing for about 2 weeks. 
---
I don't even bother anymore...and if I do go to Fissure Prime during Scorched Earth and notice she's down 1/3 health with 10 minutes to go, I'll just farm nuked flora or various other mobs...  
---
Fuck that fight
---
I play solo a lot. Each have their advantages, but you can play the entire game solo. 
---
20hrs seems about right although I did hit the caps stash above the tattoo parlor last night and found caps there within a 5hr window without server hopping. So who actually knows. 
---
you can solo until you’re blue in the face. plenty to do, i have nearly 700 hours in and i’ve only spent like 10 playing in a team.
---
Its better with friends but still great solo. You'll meet lots of people, most are nice or ignore you, few are trolls. Short of maybe the end boss  you can technically solo the whole thing end to end, but i almost guarantee you'll  find a like minded individual to casual with.
---
Because what else 2nd effect beats that? In theory 25% increased fire rate beats it with what 3-5%, but Explosive effect can be boosted with Demolition (If I remember name correctly) perk.
---
Oh I hope that gets sorted soon! Yeah I saw it on sale and decided it was worth giving it a shot!
---
Super duper is essential if you want to maximize your ammo gains. In fact, everyone should have this perk at rank 3 ready to swap in, it's incredible I'm so many situations.
---
people like you are the half the reason this game is utter garbage, trash ass greifers  go back to fortnite, or gtav you filthy trash.    would love to see you idiots join my psn party and try to talk shit ;) of course i know you wont because fat keyboard warriors such as yourself won't ever be a man. just a little pathetic coward
---
Beth changes the names/adds things to the list. You need to update your .ini to match the changes. 
---
I have a great time playing solo. But you should be open to player interactions. 
---
I've moved on to doing stuff outside of PA and not using my heavy weapons all the time on my heavy gunner.  Have thousands of 5mm (no minigun, but I have been using 2 gatlings for a long time, one prime) without ever taking the ammo factory - mostly I just hit Hornwright AMS3? from time to time for lead mostly, and supplemental steel.
---
Outside of PA I just use a 1\* Instigating handmade, nothing too special.  Various armor pieces with weight reduction, no bloodied/unyielding/etc just a simple mixed set.  One Chameleon piece.  Pretty much I do everything now without PA/heavy weapons except for AWOL Armaments, silo runs and Scorched Earth.  And for silo runs I tend to just whack them robots instead.  I have an Anti Armor gatling that I do use occasionally outside of PA (mostly when SBs attack, sometimes when the mobs get too big).
---
Always have 2H weapons as well so I tend to whack to conserve ammo...  eg. Watoga robots, just a whack and drop them.  Have tried a .50 cal more recently - I would only use this for Scorched Earth as it burns ammo.  Also got a Gatling Plasma now - that's a nice change with all the recent fixes/buffs, those plasma cores aren't too hard/costly to craft, they just start to weigh quite a bit if you don't have Batteries Included.  I don't like using it for anything other than the SBQ though - given that spin-up delay.
---
Must admit I don’t like the limited time only tactic either
---
i only play with another players the first days ,
---
now i play all time alone 
---
I don't think armor mods are represented on the damage sheet. Your best bet is to do some testing on a friend who can tell you how much damage you're doing. Unequip all your damage perks and hit a friend while they're hostile. Let them heal up completely and unequip your brawler's arm pieces. 
---
You'll see a difference.
---
could be it im from australia
---
That’d be awesome! Do you just add with username or something?
---
It sounds a little uppity, but try getting another commendation. I had 10/10 and t didn’t trigger, when I got one more it completed.
---
Will give it about 30 minutes then.
---
Hey man! 
---
First did you ever get your account back? It's a shame if not, Bethesda said they'd give it back after a while right? 
---
Anyway, my question is about that Perk "blocker". Does that work in power armor? 
---
Thanks for the tips btw, really appreciate it. A shame there's shitheads like that Oceanslim kid that follow you and harass you rather than contributing anything worthwhile to the sub/game.
---
That happened to me i solved it with closing and opening game again
---
I've been playing solo on PC since the BETA, almost 800 hrs now and I'm enjoying it. The interactions that occur with other players have been good, only 1 asshat in all that time.    
---
CAVEAT : my experience has not been typical if you read this reddit but is very normal if you actually pol the players in game, reddit attract's those comment's, nobody comes here to tell you about how smooth the game has been or how many time they have had a great encounter with a random player etc.    
---
&amp;nbsp;    
---
TL:DR/ It is worth playing solo, don't get turned away by losers
---
You have to add me on PSN "airhawk_henri"
---
It says it effects weapon durability and it’s condition. 
---
I’m not certain but I think a weapons durability refers to the size of its condition bar, and it’s condition is how full the bar is. 
---
Limited time only works if the options are so many it’s overwhelming but in this case some power armor paints or anything else “skins” I could count with one hand (not quite literally but you get it )
---
Just give up already and get on the bloodied tesla rifle meta already
---
Just a tip, I play mostly all solo. But having a team mate to help you will help a ton. Depends on how you want to play. But just remember it's gonna be a grind for a good while and can be tough at times esp in the higher level regions. Just hang in there! I'm on XB1 or I would Def help you out. You can make a post on here and I'm sure someone on your platform would be glad to give you a hand. This game has some really awesome community members
---
What ?
---
Would have loved to join, but stuck at work.
---
Thanks. I'll do that
---
The accommodation count saves, restart your game or try joining new world. 
---
Who the bloody Hell appointed you the complaint police?!  Ever hear of server lag?  Much better now but that's the explanation for Stash not being present.  When one's attempting to get to dropped loot and some triple-digit lvl SOB in power armour blocks you in a small room and won't move until you whack him with a fireaxe, that's griefing that can't be reasonably solved by server hopping - 1) you lose all your dropped loot and 2) who knows where you'll respawn.   Nobody "requests" an airdrop to land at a specific location.  They just land where they land, sometimes in the vicinity of the relay communications tower but, more likely, far, far away.  So . . . piss off, eh?
---
just wait till you see 90% of the server at the grounds, lol, 30 minutes might be too long.
---
Demolition and Greandier, but 3-5%? A 25% improved firerate gun fires 5 times instead of 4 times in the same timeframe. A free extra AA hit with a hardened level 50 gun. I'm really bad at math. But it feels so much more. :)
---
Lets say one doesnt have Demolition. Would E still be better than +25%?
---
Eventually youre gonna want to play with someone. Especially mid level like 30ish. You will realize that you are much more powerful when teamed up. Just cause your teamed up doesnt mean you have to actually play with them. I usually team up and we all do our own thing (ie play solo). My special stats increase when teamed up and we can share perk cards amongst us. 
---
Fourth it. U just need to know how to kill her... 
---
Let's do this GAMERS 
---
So... the Enclave has secretly secured a spaceship that crashed in Roswell and has been trying to reverse-engineer its technology ever since, albeit unsuccessfully. But with the arrival of the aliens, "all the little gizmos inside turned on". Now, in order to defeat the seemingly invincible Zetan invaders, two players need to first acquire "Fat Lady" cigars, then pilot the vessel to the mothership in space, enter it undetected, upload a virus to disable the energy shield, then launch a nuclear missile to distract the aliens and finally make it out in time before it blows up. The players on the ground can now engage the aliens and penetrate the hulls of their smaller ships.
---
"Welcome to Earth! *lights cigar* Now THAT'S what I call a close encounter."
---
Damn, they really should turn this into a movie and call it "Reclamation Day" or something like that.
---
Probably when challenges reset...that's the "new day" on 76.
---
The queen takes time, planning and a good team with an actual strategy. Have a few melee players to take out the mobs. Have a few players with limb damage on their weapons to keep her on the ground. Carry back up weapons. Prime up your weapons. Stock up on chems. 
---
Learn to adapt. Don't just go down there with your TSE and expect to wipe the floor with her.
---
In terms of loot, a fusion core in a raider PA and a safe. Couple of weapons. A little ammo and some food I believe. 
---
This is why we need private servers. That way, low level people don't make her impossible to kill.
---
Yup. If someone comes behind you and generates a code, your code is nullified. 
---
`Note: Wood armor is not listed because it is uncraftable.`
---
Yeah. Me too. 
---
But just to let you know, that is always the daily reset time (for challenges and such) as well as the update time. 
---
It says it effects durability and condition. I always assume durability was the size of the bar and condition was how full it is. 
---
How do we place objects from the world at our camp?
---
I definitely got wrecked at Whitesprings my first few times and didn’t really know what to do to prevent it. So I took a lot of time to just level up other ways since I like to take the quests and side missions slow.  One day I went to the Lewsiburg vendor and someone had dumped a level 40 1 star instigating power fist and I was level 39.  I quickly upgraded and headed straight for the Whitesprings to get my revenge.  My god did I ever, lets just say Mike Tyson would’ve been proud.  I will never get rid of that damn thing and after thousands of one punch kills it still makes me giggle to see them drop.  
---
For me it's all about those clean water purifiers and stove. This said, unless they're limited-time items, they take a back-seat to something else the same data-miner found in the game's files at the same time: A couple of alternate paintjobs for the excavator armor which are absolutely day 1 purchases for me. That red &amp; blue paintjob that people have been asking for for months now will soon be mine. 
---
XD nice job using alts to dislike bomb my post dumbass,  i can just easily undo that ;) with a simple report to the admins ;)
---
I'm also sure they weren't expecting that, which is a good illustration at how poorly they understand online games. 
---
becuase his was an asshole, and more than likelyhe knows that is the most vaulable/painful item to repair. thats why I have kind off two bases one open for everyone to use and everything you might need, and then I have one that is looked with the arch and other goodies that are hidden away. 
---
Didn't mean to rustle your jimmies...I'd still take the loot loss, block, server hop, done... What all are you really going to lose you can't get back with 5 minutes of looting... You just want to complain about stupid shit... What's next? I bet the carry weight is too low for you too right?
---
Oops didn't see that
---
I always give steam packs and purified water!! I have too many ☺️
---
Hey I made a flag too!

On the nose exactly 
---
I have makeshift warrior at level 5.  It goes about as quickly as my combat knives honestly.  I didn't realize it would last as long as it does.  Now, when it gets lower I just use it as a health revive.  
---
I had to log out and back in for it to register 
---
lmfao. The only sad pathetic loser on that video was you.
---
I am level 50 now and most of that was solo. I feel like group play maybe fun but they need to include other means of communication to make it more user friendly if the player doesn't have a mic. 
---
I havent moved into the harder areas yet though, ie Cranberry Bog or Mire. But at this time I am enjoying being a solo.
---
A glowy hole?
---
&gt;  with a simple report to the admins ;)
---
Dew it
---
The minigun makes a sick blender with no ammo and the shredder mod
---
I’ve run high luck for ages I still get 1* of 3* mobs all the time. So no I dont feel like it helps.
---
That sounds like part of the problem. Bethesda likely tied the scaling of toughness to the number of players in the area instead of factoring in the levels of players in the area.
---
:D thank you!
---
If you don't have the perk card enforcer get it. Makes pve content trivial as you just knee cap everything
---
There’s 3 different set of repair cards , one for melee , pipes , and guns 
---
I love this questions. My general loadout is:
---
- lever rifle (1* bloodied) for long distance / crit headshots
---
- handmade rifle (1* bloodied, semi-auto) for medium/cqc and panic fire 
---
- tesla rifle (1* quad, full-auto) is one of my favorite toys. it's great for tagging and clearing trash mobs even without any auto rifle perks
---
For SBQ fights, I bring:
---
- cryolator (3* bloodied, faster fire rate) which I spent too much money on. The DPS doesn't matter so much as the utility.
---
- endangerol syringer. everyone should bring one.
---
- radium rifle (1* bloodied, prime full-auto) as it seems to melt the SBQ. I'll switch up my rifleman perks for commando. Occassionally I swap a auto prime receiver on my handmade although it feels like the radium rifle performs better.
---
For farming in nuke zones with high-density plants but low-density mobs, I bring a bloatfly syringer. It's tedious but it works great.
---
On a side note, I've been thinking about crafting extra endangerol syringers and dropping them with ammo at SBQ fights. I'm curious if other players would bother using them. 
---
In some of the battles I have been in, the only planning of others was to throw everything they had at it.
---
I was like level 130 something when my son told me about it.  I'm a regular visitor now. :D
---
Check vendors for calibrated shock mods. I put them on my x01 for 600 caps and 0 flux. Though it did take several weeks to find the second one...
---
I didn't see the Scout Armor in there 
---
I know a guy that will roll in his camp every single time he leaves it 
---
That made me chuckle but yeah, that is the long and the short of it.
---
Not sure if the changes in patch 7 made it any better but TBH the gatling is a much better use of my 5mm :)
---
&gt; but as soon as you have a workshop you are forced to fight.
---
Not really. I take workshops almost every play session for the free fast travel, and little defend events for plans and XP.
---
But if they're contested by players I just ignore it because I don't care for PVP.
---
I tried to keep my camp by the overseer so I could give new people free starting packs. Got tired of getting raided by higher levels though so I moved back into the hills
---
But Vault 76 and 111 closed at the same time, just before the war. So surely they would both exist ad they're both pre-war pip-boys?
---
Yes. you need account name or my char name to find me?
---
Chad at Camden park is your buddy. He has most/all of them for the excavator set.
---
 But Vault 76 and 111 closed at the same time, just before the war. So surely they would both exist ad they're both pre-war pip-boys? 
---
Yup, modded games have that problem after the patch. Need to update your Fallout76Custom.ini and possibly some of your mods (guessing from Nexus).
---
150 damage? I'm only seeing 40 (or 44 with one +10% pistol perk equipped) on the weapon label. Even with all the pistol perks equipped, I'm not sure how you get that high. 
---
I am on PC too and had the exact same problems. I renamed the .ini files and then ran scan and repair from the launcher. To get around the resolution bug, I switched to fullscreen windowed mode. After that, no more problems.
---
*Harold
---
Use the Max Weapon artisan perk card  under Intelligence to repair your ripper or chainsaw to  +200% to get more DMG rating. It’s well worth it.
---
On a side note on the topic of scrapping for mods. I cannot for the life of me unlock the extended blade for the ripper. I’ve been scrapping five rippers a night. Has anyone else had this issue?
---
I absolutely have a pink mining helmet. I picked up several that looked pink until I equipped them and they changed colors.
---
I also found a Mr fuzzy mining helmet... at a vendor. 
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one.
---
Then youre just lucky that you dont be a victim of serverhopping attack teams every second time you do this.
---
I would've preferred having fo4's exact system for building than a lot of the weird BS we have to work around. It's a pain in the ass the amount of building and scrapping I have to do to make an awning. But my awning is a glitch so 
---
Yeah armor / wepon racks were awesome in skyrim. I would hope they would make a way to leave things on display without them being stolen, then again I wouldn't mind displaying certain things that could be stolen (ie nuka colas, magazines, junk)
---
Brought by data mining too,  not even gameplay.  So entitled they don’t even use information shared from a player,  just info from some entitled person who can’t even play the game so he takes it apart and tells everyone how the parts work.  Then they bitch they have to compete to cheat with others?  So sad.
---
Right? 41F here and Fallout is MY game (on my son’s Xbox lol) :)
---
I keep 4 each of Mutfruit, Tato and Corn at my Camp and harvest them two or three times a day, if available. 2 Tato + 2 Corn + 2 Mutfruit + 1 Water = Vegetable Starch which breaks down into 2 x Adhesive.  
---
If you do it regularly you should find you run out of adhesive much less often :)
---
Very true - I referred to those as pick up groups. But it's possible to do with a group of friends also with proper planning.
---
Otherwise you just head on down when the event is up and hope that any pick up groups are equipped to handle her, and that not too many of the group are hiding out hoping for a chance at the loot without contributing anything at all to the endeavor 
---
Make your own at your camp! Tato, corn, mutfruit, and purified water
---
Can not un see now lol 
---
Hodd Toward?! But he's been asleep since July 2018?!
---
The best place is definitely in your CAMP. Tatos, Corn, Mutfruit, grow six of each and never think about this again. 
---
well you know what im going to try later on today, after I get me a jetpack
---
Cool guide but missing the weight of the item. I often use light armor instead of heavy and accept the reduced damage resistance for the increased carry capacity. 
---
And ladies...
---
It has been irking me for months..
---
Technicial
---
Vault 76 got all it's equipment in 2076. Nobody owned a Pip-Boy before entering. The Pip-Boy 3000 didn't exist in 2076. If every Vault in Appalachia was built and supplied in 2076, then it is impossible to get a 3000, since Vault 111, 101, 81, 88, 21, 11 etc haven't opened yet and as such there's no way a Pip-Boy 3000 could have come from those vaults.
---
There's no way to get one.
---
the perk sharing is a great advantage, I have just had a hard time finding player's who want to team up on PC. When invited I will usually accept if a friend invite precedes the team invite.
---
This problem seems more common on x box then ps4 or pc based on the replies I've seen. Rather odd.
---
That's because it's only for XO1
---
Technical 
---
I've got an X-01 jetpack mod to trade. I'm interested in seeing your melee weapons. DM me your PSN name and I'll be on tonight
---
Account. But I can’t till like 4:00
---
Information obtained through data mining too, that’s how lazy people are, and then they bitch about server hoping for something nobody earned and someone cheated to find.
---
I play solo because I like just doing my own thing and sometimes that means I want to spend an hour making sure my crops are all in a straight line or there's a particular kind of hat I want :/  
---
I have occasionally teamed up and there are definitely some really cool folks out there in the Wasteland but solo has been fine so far :)
---
Did you remember to bring your endangerol syringer like a good boy or girl? :)
---
Aluminium. The word is aluminium. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
And don't forget to use paired keycard 01 first
---
Those have adhesive? How do I get adhesive out of them?
---
oh, I do this quest multiple times a day and never even noticed that.    
---
gotta get a new prescription for my glasses I guess, lol
---
It's not you. It's the game. I have a 4790k and gtx 1070 and at 1440p, some areas are easily over 100fps, but whitesprings for example im lucky to hit 40.
---
For some reason my brain never took the moment to see the composition of the word ... now i feel uncomfortable 😣 
---
What are you saying about Alex's writeup is wrong?   I frankly noticed a huge performance bump and graphical bump using this preset and his recs.  Followed his recommendations to a T.   (1080ti/8700k here).   I quit playing FO4 in early Dec because perf and graphics were so bad.  I had all the settings all the way up (ultra) and it ruined the experience.  Ultra doesn't always mean best.   I have AC Odyssey and Witcher 3 tweaked and such to get the most performance and graphics and do not have everything all maxed.  
---
Anyways,   I wish more devs took the time to make a post like this to solely help others.   It's a great thing to see and very unselfish.   All I can say is try it.  If it works for you great.  If not, go try something else that may work for you. 
---
"Casual" is a dirty word these days, but I think that *is* part of the appeal.  76 isn't a hardcore survival game where death is always one wrong move away.  The game is mostly content to hang back and let you do what you want, a similar quality that Skyrim had, and I know that's something I find appealing about it.
---
I found more 1 \*'s lately, but still not a single multi...
---
I can't seem to naturally get mutations without a shitty one getting in there, then when I do, the bad one is the last to be removed.

Do you mean the wetsuit looking one? I can make it on xbox, vexingmagpie is the name.

You know that it is not the next 100 days of release right? It's a road map for the year similar to what other games do, my point is even tho its "free" does not mean that we should get excited for 1 mission and a few minor updates and anyone that says they are excited to see what possibly could be put in ny the end of 2019 should not hold their breath... Bethesdas track record is spotty at best. It's like hiring a crack addict as a pharmacy technician because they wrote out a 15 point plan on how to get sober while working there.

Your brain is lying to you #fakebrainnews
---
These posts are getting weird. Like within the last two weeks I've been seeing these posts with nearly identical content saying.
---
"I wish I didn't listen to the negative reviews. YouTubers were just lying etc etc  I'm level 9 and this game is pretty great"
---
Someone always replies with "well the game has come a long way in terms of stability, performance, and bug fixes, but back at launch there were times when it was unplayable"
---
If the other vaults in Appalachia were supplied with them? I can't see it being impossible as they're not all that far from DC?
---
I'd personally like to see it!
---
Ahhh something other than bright bumble bee yellow.  Yes.  !!
---
yeah great suggestion, i noticed when it does get attacked, its very low key, it just gets added silently to the active quests on the side of the screen, it would be great if it appeared like when you start/complete a quest, big letters and a pic appear on the screen letting us know our CAMP is under attack!
---
Even closer to iron man, I'd be game

great. thank you

Or how poorly they understand many people who play online games and whom prefer to cheat and take shortcuts.  But yes they should have seen that coming.  It’s why Rockstar kept RDR2 off PC.  At some point game companies get tired of the lazy, impatient, entitled data miners.
---
Once they start getting back into it they'll realize it's a lot better than launch. Maybe try doing less fast travel and kinda exploring with them
---
It's the game, there's nothing you can do to fix it. It all comes down to the games transfer rate online, it seems way lower then most games that I play online.
---
This.  Probably why we enjoy a community of friendship and teamwork rather than the standard PVP game environments.   At least for me this is true.  
---
Had a good laught. Thank you and take my upvote.
---
Use your cooking station, utility 
---
I would never have guessed that there were players in that age range. Really cool! Also, I'm super jealous of how much ammo you got.
---
Shrug. My friends who have consoles (Xbox and PS4) have solved most of their disconnect and game freeze issues by updated their router drivers and making sure the game is ported correctly, and is assigned a static lan ip.
---
These issues are rare on PC so it is hard to help you with anything other than what I have heard from others. 
---
Disable vsync,  That helped me a lot.

Ok sweet! I’ll do that tomorrow 😊

Good work. Someone tell Bethesda that it has been proven that their Atom Cap Store single armour paints are useless. Even if we don't wear random legendary armour pieces, our armour should be a mixed bag of types.
---
Nobody is saying that, idiot.
---
The problem is that a group of 2 or more can simply follow you around the map as one of them sits on your workshop.
---
The one guy can start claiming it, allowing his teammates to force you into pvp from anywhere on the map and insta kill you, and repeat the process over and over.
---
The daily reset is at 10 EDT. 40 min from this post. 
---
I'm assuming its then. 
---
good for you!  makes me happy to hear others are alos kind!
---
just like you, i try to give the basics, ammo, usually all the 38 ammo i have as i never use them, and some 10 mm and shotgun ammo and maybe some 308 ammo as i figure those are what the most beginner weapons use
---
then if i have any low level guns/armor ill give those
---
and of course some purified water, some food, readaway and radx, 
---
finally, i like to give plans, any plans i already know i either gift directly or drop in the flatwoods overseers chest
---
keep fighting the good fight!
---
The other Vaults very likely received the same Pip-Boys as Vault 76. Not to mention, everyone else died and Pip-Boys are apparently very glitchy. I doubt they'd survive the conditions, tbh
---
There is no good reason not to be a marsupial
---
Exactly this. Unfortunately, I've played solo almost exclusively (lvl 32), and I feel like my anti-social tendencies have gotten worse during my play time rather than better. For instance, I was all alone in the Ash Heap this weekend (no one else was showing on the map down there), and stopped in at Welch Station. All of the sudden I hear the rapid thud-thud-thud of someone approaching in power armor and I kind of froze with anxiety. He comes bounding in, and says "what up, dude." Even though my mic was on, I couldn't even reply. 
---
I'm trying to be more relaxed about it, as I know it would probably lead to some great interactions.
---
Thanks for checking. Seems like it’s PS4 only as everyone else says it works. 
---
I killed a Zetan a while back at survey camp alpha. I was fighting a few scorched, and fixing the missile turret when I kept seeing a prism looking cloaked thing darting across my screen. I shot at it and it uncloaked long enough to see that it was a little green alien. I eventually killed it. I don't remember it having any notable loot. I don't have a photo, but you can clearly see that I killed an Alien. \[url=https://imgur.com/AcXcmX7\]\[img\][http://i.imgur.com/AcXcmX7.jpg\[/img\]\[/url\]](http://i.imgur.com/AcXcmX7.jpg[/img][/url])

Oh that’s great, thank you so much! From all the posts so far, seems like the community is pretty awesome!
---
The map text for one location says *Wilson Brother's Auto Repair.*  So it's owned by a guy named Wilson Brother?  Game is trash. Uninstalled.  
---
I was thinking about that.  The day I realized wood was everywhere from fallen trees was amazing! Lol
---
This explains why I started wearing leather armor at level 1 and still end up with leather armor at level 100.  Pretty disappointing.
---
Are you PS4?

I stay 60-70. Except for at sons of Dane compound and a few other high demand areas. But I have a 4k 60hz monitor at the moment. So I don't aim for anything above 60-70. Lol. 
---
gotcha, i didnt realize the chameleon armor pieces actually stacked!
---
i do have 15 agility and maxxed sneak perk cards, but if i can find some other good chameleon armor with high stats, ill try em on!
---
thanks for the reply
---
Same, also luck seems to be inverted for what mods you can find at vendors. There was a post from a guy who said he and his wife ran an experiment at the enclave bunker and she, with really low luck, was finding the X-01 jetpack and calibrated shocks nearly every time they reloaded but he, with a very high luck, was never seeing them.    
---
sorry I couldn't find the original post, I tried.
---
I'll do the math!
---
For the sake of example, let's stick to easy flat numbers. The actual end results should fit the same pattern in game, with whatever starting numbers.
---
* Base damage 100 damage per shot, 10 shots per second = 1000 dps.
---
* Per the last nerf: The Explosive legendary mod’s damage bonus has been reduced from +100% to +20% of base weapon damage, with explosive radius damage. (+20%/30%/40%/50%/60% for all 5 points)
---
Now, flat boost from there
---
* 100 + 20 damage * 10 sps = 1200 dps
---
* 100 damage * 10 sps * 1.25 speed boost = 1250 dps
---
So for pure instant bonus, we get an extra 50 dps in this scenario. 
---
BUT we get a Demolitions Expert for up to 60% explosive damage increase:
---
* 100 + 24 ( 20% DE) damage * 10 sps  =  1240 dps
---
* 100 + 26 ( 30% DE) damage * 10 sps  =  1260 dps
---
* 100 + 28 ( 40% DE) damage * 10 sps  =  1280 dps
---
* 100 + 30 ( 50% DE) damage * 10 sps  =  1300 dps
---
* 100 + 32 ( 60% DE) damage * 10 sps  =  1320 dps
---
So if you use AT LEAST 2 points in Demolition Expert, explosive is the better card.
---
The safest place for you to be is somewhere were you have some fortifications that gives you an advantage. Probably not your CAMP because the budget sucks. Maybe something like a workshop.
---
If you don't want PvP, don't agree to it when you claim a workshop.
---
Ok,thx,I kinda like my xo1 paint job atm lol
---
Maybe Wilson's last name is Brother?
---
Ill try to go in there with full health next time. :)
---
Yes I need the light.  Amazing. 
---
Yeah, tell me how much you save up after so long, I'm curious to see how much someone can save up with/without using a Flamer.
---
It's the view distance, in some cases it's set to 100k if I remember correctly, so in my fallout76prefs.ini I have this
---
&gt; [TerrainManager]  
---
fBlockMaximumDistance=0.0000  
---
fBlockLevel2Distance=0.0000  
---
fBlockLevel1Distance=0.0000  
---
fBlockLevel0Distance=0.0000  
---
fTreeLoadDistance=0.0000  
---
fSplitDistanceMult=0.7500  
---
May not look pretty in the distance, but you should see the FPS Gain.
---
yeah i think i had that same problem. if i remember a complete close and restart fixed it for me. if not then maybe try another commendation after restarting
---
This problem would go away entirely if there was a final confirmation before the trade is completed.
---
Yeah I suppose! I just love the look of the 3000 mark 4.

Please do not presume to know how I feel. I want quests that make sense and can be completed in a normal fashion without flaws that force players to repeat steps over and over again or hop servers in order to complete them. I am not deeply familiar with the Quantum quest because I don't want to spoil it for myself, but what I have learned is that it is apparently so flawed that even with a walkthrough, it can take people tedious frustrating hours to complete, and not because there are hours of content or numerous time consuming objectives. 
---
I started this post precisely because I don't want there to be quests that are frustrating due to poor design. I started this post because I've run into a quest in the main story that has a similar problem, and was dismayed that it wasn't an isolated incident.  That quest was not designed or intended to require patience, it had a flaw that required the player to use a workaround to get it to complete. I am not upset about needing to wait or needing to server hop because I'm not going to waste my time siting in front of the computer doing either for an optional item. I am disappointed that it doesn't sound like a quest that I can look forward to, but I had hoped that Bethesda might notice and fix the quest at some point in the future. I just don't think that anyone playing the game should ever have an incentive to server hop, and it seems clear to me that certain poor game design decisions can promote such behavior. Bethesda should be looking for server hopping to help find flaws in their game.
---
I never said that I was trying to get the paint job. I never said that I had even tried to do the quest. I never said that I was opposed to investing time in quests.  I will do the quest, if and when I find it, if and when it has been revised to be possible to complete by staying in game.  It is fine if a quest takes hours, that's called playing. A quest is not "designed to take time"; however, if it requires server hopping to overcome flawed design.
---
And yes, there is not enough to do in this game because I've completed all of the quests that I have been able to find and done each event type 50 times. FO4 had a lot more content and allowed detailed settlement building, so I was able to complete everything in about 600 hours.  I've run out of quests in 76 weeks ago at a fraction of those hours. 
---
So, when I heard there was a new quest to do, I didn't know anything about how it was discovered or datamined or whatever. All I cared about was that there might be something new for me to do, but then I was disappointed to learn that it seems to be broken. I play in first person so I could care less about a power armor cosmetic. All that I want "NOW", are quests to play.
---
I’m on Xbox

Indeed!

Did you feel any guilt?

You can choose a card in a different special than the one you choose to put a point in. They are just auto sorted to the special you pick.
---
I made an account almost a year ago and never felt like using it until now. Was looking for tips for playing fallout 76 and decided to join the community. Everyone has to start somewhere.
---
You are acting as if theres a conspiracy at play but maybe people are actually starting to come to the game now that it's cheaper and find they enjoy it?
---
It's not 80s, but I've been thinking about how Three Dog Night's "Out in the Country" fits my experience with the game so well.
---
I don't feel there's a hard cut-off with Fallout music, because it's not like the artists that played music in the 70s didn't exist in the 50s.  There would have been some inertia there.  But what I think would be most fascinating is if you did 50s-style recordings of songs that came out in the 70s or 80s.  That's one of the reasons why "Wouldn't It Be Nice?" sticks out - it *sounds* too modern compared to everything else.
---
And in fact, Bethesda did this back in Wolfenstein: The New Order, when they remade various pop songs in German.
---
*The Courier

Your next issue is going to be lead and aluminium, and screws, build camp beside a lead node and set an extractor on it, lead issue is then fixed forever. As for aluminium and screws never skip a can, tray, coffee pot, globe, fan, typewriter or hotplate.  
---
Also, military grade duct tape and military ammo bags pick em all up always. 
---
I know what it feels like to be too anxious to say anything. 
---
Once i realized that no one gives a fuck about what I say or do, it freed me a bit.
---
No one cares. It may seem like a depressing thought, but in reality it frees you to make a mistake. Because deep down, that’s what we are afraid of. So make a mistake, the only one who cares is you. Good luck bro.
---
But anyway, I feel like Fallout is just suited as a more lonesome experience anyway. I always travel alone, but I’m always willing to say hi and help out any fellow adventurers. 
---
Can you learn all the mods from scrapping them? Or just a few?
---
I have a double bar, flaming chainsaw but I found the mods on vendors. 
---
Surely you aren't suggesting that I learn to be more patient and accept the time investment that is required to server hop. I don't think I ever suggested that I wanted less play time.
---
I thought about it, and then I was like “NO. I MUST CONSUME MY ENEMY.”
---
I'm getting invisible enemies on 3 different PCs (High-end, middle, low-end), for example:
---
[https://youtu.be/Oq5sYEuCvBI](https://youtu.be/Oq5sYEuCvBI)
---
I did get stretched ones before, but never a completely invisible one that I couldn't even VATS but could shoot and the air bled. I think I found it near that lookout next to some dead traveling merchants and their brahmin.

15 str +2 from power armor +200 carry from excavator armor 
---
They fixed the Overseer quest and the Watoga mayor quest that “required” server hopping. I have faith they will fix this, too. I can’t imagine they expected people to solve this riddle so quickly, there’s no lore in the game as far as I can tell for sending you to the crashed plane, Ingram Manor, or Overlook Cabin... and the lore for the original keys is so vague.
---
That muffled leather right leg tho
---
I have some hand made mods unlocked, if you wanted it upgraded a little.
---
I think I was in the 70s before I actively started looking for other players, and even then it’s mostly just to drop “starter kits” off to new players. Level 96 ish now and still usually solo. That’s said, I have just turned my camp into a player hub for anyone who wants to use so interaction will increase substantially soon lol.
---
Maybe it was named by Hulk Hogan, brother.
---
Thanks for the info. Im glad i made this thread and saved me from wasting my time. Its a beautiful dream, but obviously just that :-)
---
They respawn as soon as someone uses them though. So, in theory, they should be available ever 30 mins or so.
---
I was quick to bash the game before playing it but absolutely love it now. I do find the lack of NPCs a bit annoying but otherwise it's a great game for it's current price. Not sure if I'd pay full retail to be completely honest but that's not fo76 specific. I hate paying full retail unless it's something I really really want like red dead redemption 2.
---
Sure, just one?
---
I was looking at ini tweaks cos I am having the exact same issue but I was worried cos I am sure I heard stories of people getting banned for tweaking their inis???
---
buy, beg, steel or borrow a lvl50 quad harpoon gun (extra stars a bonus), flechette mod it  and use that for daily runs at whitespring or moleminer hunting. That or a decent railgun, both are at worst ammo neutral as you usually loot more  harpoon/spikes from the corpses than you fire! Harpoon gun counts as a hvy gun to so your perks all work for it. Mine does a nice 370 with 6x hvy gun perks without adrenal or chems kicking in. It'll one shot your average lvl 62 Ghoul. Speed demon to enhance reload. 
---
If you are on PC look me up, tarnowski1, as I picked up a 2nd quad yesterday so have a spare on offer
---
Even a *Void Storage* would be nice. Pay to put a few things in, so its just long term storage. 
---
Not going to give my age but I started playing games on the PC on my TRS80 in middle school.  I had a commodore 64 in High School.  My son bought me Fallout NV when it came out for our xbox, I prefer the PC versions.
---
I JUST got a TS Combat shotgun level 50. After 150 hours. I couldn't believe it.
---
Lvl 50 irl, lvl 150/800 hrs in game and my objective is to make it the best possible experience for all. I regularly drop plans, meds and ammo to lower level players. I will always lend a hand if I see a low level player struggling to clear an area as well. 
---
Which makes total sense since &lt;checks notes&gt; wood is literally *everywhere* in Appalachia.
---
Yeah and a fully decked out power armor suit at level 15 for my next character would be awesome especially with Bethesda planning to release more content 
---
We badly need the ability to rank down/split perk cards. When playing in a team, I can't share some of the perks because my card level is too high.
---
Thanks for sharing! What does the cryolator and endagerol do to the SBQ?
---
holy hell yes please
---
and please make it end lvl content, the scorched invasion was a joke once you reached lvl ... 10
---
&gt; got what i needed from your accounts
---
Good, now go logon to a multiplayer game and roam around spouting the word virgin repeatedly as a way to compensate for your soy infused beta-ness.
---
Right? I think "Bethesda didn't expect someone to make a video" is the lamest defense I've seen yet.
---
I'll be able to trade sometime today, and be able to most of the time between now and 12 hours from now.
---
Don't get me wrong. I do like to play by myself mostly but if they want to team up and not talk or hang out then I'm all for it. Free fast travel and better perks. 
---
I think you have entirely missed the point.  I have no objection to a long, detailed, laborious, involved, or difficult quest line.  I do have an objection to the idea of any quest where you do what you are supposed to do, but something doesn't work, making it necessary to change servers or wait for a server reset before the quest can be continued or completed.  Of course I want to do the work, but by "work" I mean playing the game, not server hopping. I'm not sure what that has to do with entitlement except to say that I think we would all prefer quests that can be completed.
---
i hope this gets some visibility and acknowledged by Bethsoft
---
I used to do this, but I've found that newer players are just really skittish now.  You'll stand there with your baggy for minutes trying to get their attention, and it's like they pretend you're not there.
---
I'll still wave, but I've started ignoring players who don't wave back.
---
Solid suggestion.
---
I don't know what you're saying... just seems like you're complaining because they didn't release it all as one big chunk. They haven't even finished with 'Wild Appalachia' yet which includes survival mode, player vending, Fasnacht Parade, the Shear Terror/Ever Upwards questlines and some other random stuff.  
---
&gt;Tell me I'm wrong and that there's a bunch of new stuff to do right now other then making jello shots in a musty basement.
---
You're not wrong, other than the Fasnacht events are starting today.  
---
&gt;When a game releases dlc...
---
It's not a DLC though
---
&gt;...its normally massive add ons and cool new items **that last a lifetime**...
---
Most of these additions are permanent
---
I don't use it so not really needed. My other weapons are better IMO. But thanks 
---
Same problem here, PC
---
Thank you! I've added you to my list of valuable contacts and will see if I can join some time.
---
I wonder if I have tried to login when you have been online. Sometimes it tells me that I will have to move my camp... You have done much better with the area than I have
---
On the topic of rapidly spoiling food, I sold a vendor 200 razor grain. Then a little while later I needed razor grain so I tried to buy it back. It turned to spoiled vegetables in the vendors inventory.

I've won and lost against the queen. My problem isn't her difficulty, but that most individual player contributions are imperceptible. Players aren't getting feedback, so it's really hard for them to course correct. 
---
Even if the queen doesn't bug out and is well balanced, the game UI needs something more to help players learn and adapt. 
---
Nah, PS4 me.  Don't worry, I'm just going to keep scrapping 'till I get it.  :)

The cryolator freezes her and slows her way down. It useful for keeping her grounded so the heavy melee dudes can do their thing. The endangerol syringer reduces the target's damage resistance by 25% for 2 minutes. I've heard it stacks per player so if everyone used one it should bring her DR way down. Either way, you're gimping your own damage output by not using it.
---
HAHAH! Someone genuinely loves the game and is expressing that?! Nonsense. There MUST be something more sinister afoot....
---
HOW MUCH ARE THEY PAYING YOU?! 
---

---
Lucky servers! I knew they were a thing.
---
Absolutely. I’m 27 and starting to realise that I’m becoming a grumpy old gamer who frowns on the likes of Fortnite, Apex Legends and CoD. I’ve found myself muttering things like “CoD ain’t what it used to be” and “I played Fortnite before it was cool, before they ruined it!”
---
I tried to play CS:GO years ago but honestly I’m really not that good and the toxic players down the mic put me off. I’m liking the fact that this game is attracting a more like-minded, level-headed audience that want to help others instead of ruin things and troll
---
In addition to the OP's great suggestions, I'd like to see keypads that ask you to set a number rather than getting a random one assigned when placed.
---
Try weighted next time, it adds armor penetration. Incisor gives you 75% armor penetration as well. I think brawler only works with bare hands but that isnt all bad if you're built around unarmed. I can get a little over 100 damage with fists using the right perks, armor, mutations, and sometimes chems. 
---
I even notice it happen with junk items u got tagged, each server is bias to one item or another that u got tagged for search.
---
Might be useful to mention the region and your general free time.
---
I think that's part of the reason 76 had such a rough go at the start.  The bugs didn't help, but neither did the "I expect everything to be explained to me" attitude that modern gamers tend to have.  A lot has changed, even since Fallout 4, and it feels like that lowest common denominator gets lower every day.
---
why are you laughing?  repairing 25 years of neglect is not even close to worth it, it is literally better to just start from scratch than to use existing structures.  
---
I..... think you got the wrong sub....
---
Aw man, I know them feels. I ended up at Whitesprings at about level 25 with decent sneak perks so basically just snuck my way into the building while listening to the level 70ish ghouls outside and crying silently. Then a legendary diseased yao guai showed up and started eating the ghouls, so I hid in the bathroom for a very, very long time.  
---
It was awful. I have to do it again soon. LOL.
---
my dad is 72, i could never see him playing video games in general!

Ooh could you help me with that? Im only lvl 30 but running only 2 STR so I’m very limited, even with pocketed.
---
What I find annoying is when one is in a new area where there are supposes to be fusion cores, but someone else has come along and taken it/them. If everything else resets upon entering said area, and start an event (and one is the only person around for miles and miles), why aren't the cores?

There's actually 400+ iron ore (in Excavator) at Hornwright if you cross the road and head towards those towers. We have a run we do that nets 400-600 depending on how many we remember plus 100 or so lead ore.

the only issue is, so many times the people seem to not know what the hell im trying to do unless i put on my mic and basically scream, "Look at my feet! on the ground!  Im trying to gift you supplies in this paper bag!"
---
and even then some people dont seem to get it
---
but dangit i try!!
---
and the the ones that Do appreciate it really make it all worth while, i love hearing people get excited!
---
yesterday i gave one of the best gifts yet, a level 5 chameleon armor piece i had been saving for a noob
---
How much RAM do you have? With every patch, the game eats more and more and if it fails to allocate, it just dies. Check the Windows Event Viewer for appcrash.
---
ARE YOU ME&gt;?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
---
Regret nothing. You are so lucky you don't worry about having to get stuck in power armor or losing your camp permanently because someone happened to have one in the same area. There were many unbearable bugs at release and you get to enjoy a much better game.
---
I'm wearing full Raider-Armor for the looks. 
---
Also interested in this information
---
Farming is your best bet as others have said. Hell about 50% of my camp is dedicated to farming. I have Mutfruit, Tatos, &amp; corn for adhesive. Razorgrain for spirits and purified water for everything else. 
---
There's quite a few farms around the map that have all of these already growing so that you can start your grow operation yourself. 
---
Oh shit, totaly forgot about that haha
---
king yes, 45% no.
---
hmmm seems your dumbass has stopped replying all together having issues?
---
&gt; I'd buy brahmin armor.....
---
You know where leather comes from, right?
---
I played in the BETA and joined teams then, but not since. I have a bug where I can't hear any voice chat and can't chat myself so it's just easier to solo.   
---
It's fairly doable, there are times I wish I had another body around to help but eh. I'm also not doing the main quest line, just wandering about doing whatever.
---
I’ve found workshops to be a good way 
---
I have a shotty tse my account is BulkNwHoles 
---
if you put them in world containers they stay longer, but if you drop them in a paper bag they despawn alot quicker
---
Thank you! I'm busting to get back on but have adult stuff to do before I can! 
---
next time you run it do you mind getting a compass bearing from a building for me? i only knew about the 3 at spawn, the 8 or so above spawn, and the 5 at bearing 208 from the truck (up the hill)
---
I reply to people expressing this type of opinion but it never gets traction. Most people don't want to hear that it is a personal issue that they have to solve themselves and not a Bethesda issue that they can just complain about until it miraculously goes away or they stop playing.
---
Best way to get caps is to not spend them. 
---
I know this isn’t the answer you want but what were you spending caps on to get your excavator Armor? If you were buying junk, that’s your problem. 
---
Grape mentats and the grand circuit tour of the vendors.
---
Feel the pain I'm saving up for Combat or Marine armor mods &amp; plans.
---
Go to welch kill moleminers sell the weapons. Or stuff from enemies near you.
---
No problem, if you find anything similar to the top of my list can you give me a shout?
---
Pick up every expensive thing you can be that armor, weapons or rare junk that’s worth money and sell it to vendors, doing this when I was broke netted me about 970 caps between all the vendors after all the fast traveling 
---
You're thinking of the breaks more slowly &amp; modding perks. Weapon Artisan works for any type of weapon.
---
That is good to know!
---
Agreed. These paints should be sold as a set that applies to all armors. Similar to what they do with PA paints (except that they don't apply to excavator).
---
He said that fallout 4/76s high/Ultra preset is other games ultra preset on steroid and I think this is not true. 
---
That sounds like it’s our fold that we get bad performance on maxed out settings. 
---
While this is true for most games, it’s definitely not true for fallout 4 or 76.
---
Like I said my pc gets bored while I’m at 30fps, before the patch he got bored too but I had 90ish fps :D
---
I also said I don’t know anything about how engines work but I spent very very very much time in pc gaming and I play pretty much everything so I think I can tell when bad performance is caused by ‚settings on steroids‘ or due to bugs or bad optimization.
---
Witcher’s ultra preset- without nvidia hairworks- is very easy to handle too. 
---
The only tweaking i did there was decreasing mouse speed and increase grass view distance and i still get min60fps (most of the time 70-75) in 1440p. So not a good example for a game with presets on steroids :D 
---
kingdom come is a better example, if you crank everything up to the max (texture quality, view distance, shadow quality/distance, vegetation) you’ll end up with 30-40fps, and that’s ok because it really increases those things by aaaaaaalooooot. 
---
And you can’t tell me that shadow, texture, vegetation or whatever quality on medium looks better than the maxed out option in Witcher 3........
---
In my opinion, bloodied would be better for a damage build, but this appears to be intended as a tank/juggernaut build. The way i see it, it makes more sense to keep the health up to maximize the hits required to take down the kill. Maybe instead of bloodied you could invest in perks and weapon legendaries that would boost survivability, especially with heavy weapons. As for weapons, i would suggest gatling gun and .50 cal machine gun. Gatling being used for longer range armored targets and .50 cal used for close range unarmored/weaker targets. A trick i use for aiming the gatling is third person, as there is a small dot to mark where you shoot. Id stay away from minigun, as it burns up ammo and has low damage, whereas the gatling uses the same ammo but much more sparingly and with much greater damage.

I know Party Boy/Girl increases the effects IDK if it increases duration?
---
Hello, thanks for giving me credit :) I know every armor mod so this is all vetted on max level armor. Couple things to note -  
---
* Lower level armor have lower resists, obviously, but also the material mod itself provides lower resist bonuses (i.e. on a level 40 Combat chest the BoS mod doesn't provide 25/25.  
---
* Damage Resist increases when the armor is over repaired, by approximately 25 when at 200% condition.  
---
* Energy Resist is unchanged by item condition, so you need to use that to determine the armor type.  
---
* Weight is not a reliable indication unless the piece does not have any mods, and the standard mod isn't always craftable.  
---
* I am a hardcore trader, so I also vetted the numbers by looking at the (literal) hundreds of armor pieces I've collected. You can check by looking at the Armor tab.
---
* Shameless plug: this is my trading inventory list, so make sure to check out the other tabs and let me know if you wish to trade :)
---
Like others have said, you tend to gain pragmatism as you get older.  76's botched launch filtered out those who were easily swayed by, and cater to, majority opinion.  The rest of us could look at the game, despite its flaws, and see *something* there worth playing.  What Bethesda was getting at, but didn't quite reach.  And fortunately, they haven't given up, so we'll hopefully see more of it.
---
Is that possible, can anyone confirm that?
---
See cap stash run videos on YouTube and super mutants. Events also
---
How do you feel about the brotherhood of steel? I run a discord group of about 40 ish people on PC your welcome to join us if you wanna hang out and play. We have people all over the world that we play with.
---
damn this guy goes the extra mile!
---
i usually just give stuff i find on my travels
---
Oh i'm 24 leveling and the lv20 moddet molemen glove is allready above that so no worries there, i was just a little irritated about the lack. (That's about equal to a moddet sledgehammer of the same level. Man i sure need that reciepe asap or someghing like a legendary version eventually)
---
I'd be interested if anyone has any detailed info on how "Furious" works at all.
---
I can't seem to find anything online, and haven't had the time to find a good furious weapon to try to test it myself.
---
Good for you!
---
yeah i do the same thing, its unfortunate so many high levels seem to be so bored they just go around destroying other peoples bases geez
---
is there any limit vending?
---
What kind of internet you have att dsl?
---
Depending on what you want to get out of the game, solo can be great. I love listening to all the holotapes and reading all the terminals so being in a team doesn't really work for me, and I love being able to go at my own pace.
---
Anything easier for addictions?
---
I wonder if we could pre-nuke so the blast zone would last into the parade. They will probably disable nukes and/or add an exclusion zone around Helvetia.
---
Exactly. Something like in like a fallout 4 but with both sides confirming 
---
You new here? This has been an issue since the beginning.
---
If you play on xbox feel free to send me a friend request and we can hack and slash together. 
---
Im level 150, GT is Justinfod 
---
Ahaha he's going maaaddd
---
ehhhm... fast traveling?
---
Predominantly solo, but will join in events and help people defend their workshops when I see them. I always wonder if people think I am there to kill them at their workshop, but usually I just go for the events. Lol.
---
im FINALLY getting to the point where i can realize what junk i will need and how much i will need of it
---
I found the best way was to get rid of as much junk as possible, then play normally and see what i really needed to actually play
---
hoarders anonymous should be a thing in fo76 heeheh
---
Yes 200 caps per vendor and I believe that refresh’s every 4 hours or so 
---
250 hours in, not a single one in teams. And I'm loving it! But of course I'm very welcoming to people that pass by my camp.
---
Explosive helps stagger other players, so its a counter to sentinel armor sets.  Still I do think explosive is maybe a bit overrated just as assassin's sentinel armor...  there's a case to be made for faster fire rate and cavalier's armor.
---
thanks. will try to make a route and sell crap to those vendors
---
https://discord.gg/tvEc2J this is the discord FO community. There are loads of groups there, there are a couple specifically for players looking to group up. Hope that helps 
---
Do people pay 2.5k for them?
---
https://imgur.com/a/RmV9IC7
---
I can make them.
---
The spelling changed in 2070 due to a lack of Special points in intelligence. Someone doesn't know thier Fallout lore.
---
Steel is one of the easiest things to get.  Simply kill supermutants and take their assault rifles.  With scrapper, you quite a few steel each.  Don't waste your acid on steel, save it for lead ore from the Lucky Hole Mine.
---
On Bethesda plz list. Reported.
---
I run a bloodied build with a bloodied explosive handmade. 1-2 shots almost everything.
---
That rule is actually false but yeah...they should fix it.
---
Pro tip in watoga the bos vendor and the train station are different vendors so you can sell to both 
---
Yeah they are, but the thing is I'm mainly looking for locations to farm the materials not workshops, but for some materials like acid, the only good way is workshops
---
I have been doing the same thing. I’m trying to get another T-51B nuka plan for an alt so I’ve been running past Dome 7 on my way and opening it for everyone. 
---
So PC players who don’t have the key, you might find that door open anyway. 
---
This is going to be very useful. I've been running out of fusion cores lately and I'm getting tired of it
---
I really appreciate the epic guide to armor. It totally made me rethink my quest for a full robot armor suit since the numbers don’t look that great even at their best.
---
I have a question about the combat armor. What does the ‘Brotherhood’ designation mean? Like, what does it do stats wise?
---
Mistress of mystery.  
---
Wasted on nukashine is fun but very short.
---
The BOS questline can be fun if you don’t mind the most realistic DMV experience any game has ever attempted.
---
I'm kinda surprised that I'm not immune to these diseases by now since I've contracted them over 100 times.
---
It is DLC, I'll leave that here and nothing more....
---
What I'm talking about, what this whole post is about, it's about people celebrating and giving way to much praise for 1 mission with the promise of more to come. Any other game, with a few exceptions, I would celebrate with you but Bethesda has been know to shoot themselves in the foot. They do not deserve this much praise just yet.... 
---
It's on the Bethesda plz list. I just reported it. This sub is just an echo chamber of "can I has power armor rename plz?!" The amount of repetitive suggestions in here are insane.
---
Yeah, I’ve heard so many stories about coming back to camps being flattened and not even seeing the notifications.
---
When I played solo I had fun as long as I was doing quest missions. Other stuff like farming workshops, nuke zone raids, event hopping is more fun with a group in my experience. 
---
I see. It's not like I'm looking for an op legendary just something a bit handier than default. I saw that post of a guy called complaining that Bethesda took a legendary he bought from a duper so it got me a little worried. Guess I'll try my luck today
---
You're all sounding pretty upset to me, bud. 
---
yeah i have noticed th------------------ *BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM*
---
There was a similar phenomenon with Half-Life.  The realization that the current gamer would either have been very young, or not even born, at the time when the sequel, let alone the original, came out.  It's at the point where you couldn't make a third one even if you wanted to - you'd pretty much have to start over.
---
Be lever is awesome as well
---
I see.  I take all games separate because they are all made by different people and different engines so engines matter.  Also, are we talking stock game on ultra or modded with the stock ultra settings?   I also think someone who has developed mods for the creation engine knows more than me about the game.   For FO4/Witcher3 and honestly most games I use graphical mods which change the performance immediately and in my opinion the stock settings go almost out the window.   My Witcher 3 graphics are completely enhanced from stock as is FO4 and Skyrim.    I'm not really concerned with ultra.  I want max 1440p graphics combined with max performance.  In regards to graphics I want less blurry, crisp visuals.   Kingdom Come is a different animal as its Cryengine.  I've managed to push that to stable 50-70 fps with a reshade at 1440p except when you go in towns like Rattay.  What an absolute masterpiece of a game.  
---
Lastly, let's just enjoy FO76 and work together to try to push the max graphics and performance through settings and reshades and share the wealth.   
---
Sounds like something changed with this after Patch 7. We're looking into it!
---
If ur ps4 I got some for U 4 free
---
nice...I have a bloodied handmade, but no Explosive effect.
---
Whats your base damage at around 30HP (thats where i usually stay)?
---
That’s a lot of fast travelling. If you do it so much you spend all your money, you need that perk that makes it cheap. 
---
Also try just walking from point to point sometimes. Never know what you will see along the way. 
---
I love how they ran away once u got out lol
---
Yes please I wish I didn't have to server hop for anything but joining friends. Currently I'm server hoping 20 Times just doing my daily cap stash run. Have to hop just to get them to spawn. Cap stashed are only a daily thing now not like before where you could be it unlimited  so why do I have to hop to get them. Make them part of the world. Take some glue and make it so they can't move and stay their for everyone. 
---
Yeah, I'm gonna be getting that perk either way because I want my Nukashine to increase my unarmed damage by 300% so my [Deathclaw Gauntlet](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/thehappyraider/screenshot/11684387) can reach numbers around 10452 when under the effects!
---
For general combat, handmade
---
For sniping, lever action
---
Milage will vary depending on legendary modifiers. 
---
I've been playing with a bloodied rifle build over the past week. With a BE lever action, I'm getting 600 base damage at &lt;20%. That's with maxed Bloody mess, all riflemans, and demolitions. I don't have all of my perks filled out yet, so with Nerd rage I expect it to go higher.
---
Never found a leg. Guass of any kind, I'd like to try one eventually.
---
Damn on PS4. But I already have it, and I think it doesn't match with the Marine Armor. I was talking about the Assault version, the one with the green visor that is more an helmet, than a mask. I think it's in the game files, but it's a very precious item
---
Will bring this up with the dev team for investigation. Thanks for the report!
---
Excellent, thanks for the response!
---
Guess they probably won’t fix it, just waiting for the older pieces to get dumped on the robot vendors. Sigh.
---
Anyone know what determines how long it takes for a disease to run its course? I seem to recall at low-levels it was short enough (5-10 minutes) that I'd sometimes just let them run their course, but now at higher levels, it regularly takes hours to cure a disease without outside intervention.
---
Likely they were running a Bloodied build (Increased damage and stats from low health, most people fill their health bar with radiation to keep their health where they want it) combined with Sentinal armor  (seriously decreased damage as long as they stand still). What likely happened is that one of your shots finally staggered them which broke the sentinal protection and THEN they died. 
---
None of this is even particularly difficult to figure out based on the mechanics of the game. Some people ENJOY build optimization for its own sake (I am one), others just copy whatever the newest fad is. The thing is that there are hard counters to every build that I have seen built into the game. You found one by accident.
---
 Teal and yellow are the only ones I’ve seems
---
I usually wear leather only but im gonna swap to a brotherhood chest cause of you.
---
Wow, good job! 
---
hmm i wonder if there is a timing bug affecting the internal chrnometer of the ingame systems, so the game thinks when we kill one, that the 10 seconds have actually passed super quick in game 
---
, this would also explain why food is spoiling so fast now
---
Exactly.
---
Go LEFT on the Ingram mansion.  If you go right (player perspective) you have to circle the house.
---
Tag target materials in your pipboy and you can then see if items contain them. 
---
If you want specific locations just Google it and you will find lots of articles/videos showing exactly  what you are looking for
---
Nice I have a Bloodied Moleminer gauntlet with +40% swing speed I'll be doing the same with. 
---
oh damn, great minds think alike, i also just posted that theory!
---
I'd encourage you to not completely write off playing with other people though. Solo, this game is a Fallout experience but it's a pretty mediocre Fallout experience. 3, NV, and 4 are all significantly more fun in my opinion. It's that multiplayer aspect that makes 76 unique and offers the best opportunity for truly memorable game play.
---
I can sit here and think of instances where I really enjoyed playing solo, and there were definitely a few standout parts. But the stuff I \*really\* remember is when I was playing with my team. So, just keep your options open. 76 definitely has a helpful player base relative to other games I've played. 
---
I would have to get on to see for sure, but i want to say its somewhere around 600
---
Ohhhh, thank you I didn’t know.
---
I have a TS Gauss rifle, and it deals some good damage, but high recoil, and not that accurate.
---
Im loving my Bloodied handmade, but want more damage to save ammo.
---
I’m assuming the servers will reset before the parade event launches.
---
Lvl 50 all rise
---
Lvl 45 fire axe
---

I have 16GB of RAM.
---
I'm not super-amazing with computers, but it's a:
---
AMD Ryzen 7 1700X Eight-Core -- 3.4GHz
---
with a GTX 1080 Ti.
---
Event Viewer always brings up an Event ID of 1000 whenever FO76 dies.
---
I am also running adrenal reaction and nerd rage so i stay at 20% health.
---
That’s a kickass title for a Fallout spinoff novel. 
---
great post.
---
Rad-X is 200
---
Rad-X diluted is 100 and does not suppress mutations
---
It should be.. unless they’ve pushed everything out a day, from last week’s patch/update
---
That would be helpful too, but if it’s a quest anyone who doesn’t care can just turn it off and it can just flat out say it.
---
Solid post!
---
Would it make you feel better if you got a participation trophy.  Not everyone has a Two Shot Explosive I am a level 121 and have never got a TSE from a legendary drop. I use an Anti Armour Gatling Gun with speedy receiver and extended mag along with an Anti Armour super sledge and Executioners super sledge. Very few times have I seen the Scorchbeast Queen live regardless of how many low level players.
---
I feel bad that dupers ruined the TSE weapons did you get yours from a drop or did you buy one if it's the later you are part of the reason why the nerf happened.
---
Cool. Is the multi axe a popular weapon?
---
Brahmin Milk cures 25 Rads each.
---
Nuka-grape
---
I have a BE gauss and the BE lever action is a lot better in my opinion.
---
Thank you!
---
well the game has come a long way in terms of stability, performance, and bug fixes, but back at launch there were times when it was unplayable 
---
I've been able to learn dual bar and bow bar. I still use vendors for long bow bar and flamer.
---
&gt; but for some materials like acid, the only good way is workshops
---
Must of the materials you are looking for will come out of a junk extractor placed on a junk node.
---
As for nuclear material the tattoo parlor in Morgrantown behind Vault-Tec University will contain 2 or 3 board games with nuclear material in them and up to 3 nuclear material in cannisters if it hasn't been cleared. 
---
hi, check out this interactive map!
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
first, deselect all icons, then scroll down in the index and choose "iron deposit"
---
it will auto=populate the map showing all the known steel resource pits!
---
:)
---
I'm aware. I have a spare extended blade if you need it.
---
I've avoided seeking details about the new quest, so I didn't even realize that it doesn't give the player clues about each of the locations (if that is what you are saying) and I haven't watched or read a walkthrough because I hope I can just discover it myself. Unfortunately, as soon as I learned of the existence of this quest, it became clear that people were talking more about it being broken than they were about whether it was fun or interesting. My disappointment comes from knowing that I can't look forward to the quest since it has the same kind of problems as the other quests you mention, so I'll wait and hope they patch it in the future. I would rather wait and enjoy it when it is fixed. Cheers
---
A little text alert: "Another camp that needs our help!" should do it.
---
I'd like for Preston Garvey to appear and alert me that there is a settlement that needs my help...
---
You have to use weapon artisan to repair it. Its damage scales with durability.
---
Yeah, the game does a bad job of telling you but you can level up a special stat completely unrelated to the card you pick
---
It must have evolved in a Nuke Zone.
---
Hi all, 
---
If you unlocked the Looking to the Future pose while it was available in the shop you're supposed to still have access to it. We're investigating this and working to fix it up as soon as we can.
---
Yes good idea I usually miss the pop up and end up fixing the damn thing.
---
Pirateglenn1 and thank you for message. Look forward to talking and trading later. 👍
---
I think he meant be patient and wait until less people are looking for this item. Its supposed to be very rare. Maybe check once per session, and eventually you will have it. 
---
I never stick with other "Appalachians". Certianly not on the 26th. You're all in trouble then...
---
Just walk, it doesn't take long to walk across the map
---
Ok please add me on PS4 pirateglenn1
---
Huh. I did go into a Nuke zone for the first time today.
---
Sweet! My only concern is if there isn't a way to increase the duration of Nukashine. Being teleported to a random location after \~2 min would be extraordinarily annoying.
---
Even without Data-mining, people would figure out sooner or later, and then we'll be in the same position.
---

Follow this guide will net you at least 2k a day 
---
Been there at least since fallout 4 (I don't remember trying it 3 or NV).
---
I’ll put you on my payroll for 250 caps a day but you gotta give me a cut of your junk hauls and start calling me daddy
---
I was a workshop guy. The team kill mechanic killed that.
---
If you rub bones with someone the bone worms jump across and spread 
---
You should take the time to prime your guns and collect flux to make ammo for it. It's not suppose to be easy.  My group took her down in 10 minutes last night. If you actually take the time to prepare she is easy. People need to get over the TSE it's not good for the queen. Lazy players.
---
Yeah, the general plan is not to do top damage but ENOUGH to keep aggro and keep Tenderizer, suppressor, vampire procced so that the dps folks can go to town. Rapid fire something or other with explosions probably. 
---
I lost a shotty the other day as well. No idea what happened. Sometimes the game lags when you drop / sell things, so that even if it looks like you are clicking an item, you are actually clicking the one below. Its a problem if dropping, selling multiple identical items.
---
That or we are the victims of some shotgun curse / bug... sucks in any case. 
---
u/ladydevann can you comment on this?
---
Maybe these were duped before the fix
---
Mine too😣 it’s been there for weeks and I don’t wanna move out 
---
It is disabled, still not helping unfortunately.
---
Fashion &gt; Protection every time. 
---
think it's actually 20 hours
---
Its still around. I think I know to do it and reported it, but have yet to hear from support. 
---
What is the user on here that has the dev's ear again? The community manager? I can send them a PM if they aren't already aware. 
---
Somebody a bit earlier was saying exactly that. Said the change had to do with the fermentor
---
They got it right with Sunday Brothers and Darling Sisters, at least.
---
It is the same franchise that brought us the awkward "Slocum's Joe" (and the hidden speakeasy, Slocum Joe's).
---
If I ever get to retire, I hope to play video games. I'm sure it's better than watching TV.
---
Of course, all of the games I've bought over the years will probably have expired by then, but it's ok because I'll probably have expired before then too.
---
On a similar note im a bit annoyed they don't group all the factions in the same pool of like 1000 caps. I bet fast traveling would be cut in half. I can imagine the excessive fast traveling for vendors AND server hopping for quests/notes both strain the servers. They are also immersion breaking.
---
Maybe. How can you explain someone having 5 sets of 3 star sentinel armour? Lucky?
---
was there an enemy corpse in the landing zone? that causes the cargobot to retreat.
---
That would be great. I'm on console and usually invisible but it still shows you on in game. It would be another nice little QoL change.
---
PCMR!
---
Just kidding, enjoy your new sandbox. F76 is awesome. I found some amazing people out there, with some I've been playing for 4 months now because we have so much fun playing together.
---
It's a concern for sure 
---
wood : everywhere.
---
adhesive: farm (tato, muttfruit and corn) (with the perk that doubles the picking).
---
screws, aluminium, copper, lead...: workshops or the event Breach and Clear.
---
Have they said if this will be level restricted or only feasible after a certain level?
---
Pick up everything you see, resources are in everything. You will find everything you need as long as you as actively picking stuff up and scraping it. Also a good way to get legendarys and resources is too run the whitesprings farm over and over picking up everything. You will max out your stash box in no time at all. 
---
It’s all good the base was a farming base and was poorly made
---
Hi, is the Fasnacht event still set to release today?
---
I thought the Fire Breather line was excellent, especially the finale Into The Fire. I also enjoyed the Free States quests, that area is really atmospheric and difficult but not unfair.
---
Of course the Brotherhood line is fantastic and is best played with friends. Really about the only part of the story quests I thought sucked were the Raider quests, which were bugged and just a chore.
---
Events, I like the ones with waves of enemies so Line in the Sand, Uranium Fever, Breach and Clear are some of my favorites. Also keep an eye out for Enclave events in Harpers Ferry, those are a good time because that dump is usually crawling with mutants. 
---
for those unaware, you can build a fertilizer producer for your camp. it just builds a trough for a brahmin to feed from, and BAM, free brahmin. thus, the fertilizer producer also gives you a milk producer!
---
Ps4 here I got it.  Redownloaded game recently too. 
---
I agree that it should be a cool thing for people to work through and discover, and that server hopping should never be helpful to completing a quest, and definitely not the only way to complete a quest.
---
No corpses even remotely near the landing zone. They all spawned at the front. First time ever not getting a drop from it, I swear ive done that event 100 times!
---
My LE is going to be my primary from now on. It easily outdamages any other gun I have. I'm still not fully specced, and my armor is all still RNG stuff, but I die less now than I did with a full health.
---
I literally just got it off Amazon! Looking forward to large downloads!
---
It does like 2 damage.  What would you use it on, level 1 mole rats?
---
my guess this is a priority for them
---
I’d try to uninstall and do a fresh install of the game if I were you. I’ve actually done that a couple of times when the game was really buggy at launch, following Bethesda tech support’s advice. Make sure you back up the snapshots you took in game, I didn’t do that and lost all the early pics I took when I was exploring at low levels. I also wiped my PS4 hard drive just to identify the cause of issues. It was crashing like crazy for a few weeks I could barely play for an hour without a bluescreen. 
---
The mod? How much do you want for it?
---
Not really since an identical multi axe is always worse than a fire axe but I use it for “boss” fights because of executioners 
---
I for someone reason cannot get this quest to trigger anyone. I completed it once and have never been able to redo it. I've listened to the holotape that initially triggered it dozens of times and have collected over 30 Technical Data in the meantime. Anyone happen to have an idea why?
---
Go around and visit as many workshops as possible. Clear out all of the enemies, but don't claim the workshop. The act of clearing out the enemies will net you about 45 caps each. With a little server hopping, you should be up a few hundred caps in no time at all, and ready to get back on your feet. 
---
Like he said...they were duped before the fix 
---
What are the benefits of carnivore cuz I mainly feed my character by eating my enemies with the cannibal and lead belly perks 
---
Like I said, you're thinking of something else. That's the BoS Knight underarmor. NOT the BoS jumpsuit. Different things completely. The jumpsuit is valued high because they are only obtained as rare drops from events and they are uncraftable.
---
Ahh.  I never built one but was always curious as to what it did.  Thank you!
---
I lost my AAE shotty too, It kept getting confused on the favourite wheel and mistaking it for my BE shotty, then suddenly it disappeard. Idk if it’s connected, but it definatley annoying none the less.
---
Its fekking bullshit is what it is pal. Thanks for the reply though mate.
---
Lol, apparently there is now an actually jumpsuit. I’ve been out of the game since patch two, and the wiki doesn’t have it on there.
---
Thanks for letting me know.
---
Hey neato! GJ
---
I’m totally interested.
---
Same here on the health and death thing. I think running around at 20% health just forces you to plan out all of your attacks instead of just going leeroy jenkins into a full mob.
---
Nah no one was.
---
had to move camps 3 times now since the update, all were on the western river near vault 76 using junk extractors.  wish they would remove the resource locations from places i cant build, or tell me in advance i wont be able to leave my camp there.   i built a camp, server hopped 5 times, played all day and did a vendor run the next day, and then that next evening i couldnt load the camp anymore....theres not even a good way to test if u can keep a camp in a location
---
im currently theorizing about a tank support build that uses a fast-firing rifle with low AP cost (like combat rifle) and Medic legendary effect. I have yet to find out how much these actually do heal tho
---
Good bot.
---
I've been running through Helvetia with 4 people and nothing has triggered yet, I think it's a waiting game at this point
---
it used to just make fertilizer and give you a useless npc cow on your camp. since i can get all the fertilizer i need by scrapping old fruit and vegetables (i have a very large farm), i didn't see much use for it other than the "pet" brahmin. now that you can milk brahmin, it is a much more useful item to build.
---
That stuff will all be coming, drip by drip
---
I’d have thrown in bodyguards and probably removed all the power armor weighs less/cheaper to repair/fusion cores last longer to add more points to Nerd Rage. Could’ve throw in Blocker aswell for the melee hits from the boss.
---
Emergency protocols aswell on power armor, if you’re still thinking on running a bloodied build.
---
I guess it is an access violation 0xC0000005 indicating an application bug. I can only give you a few troubleshooting tips:
---
* Remove game mods if you have them. Some tend to get unstable with a fresh vanilla release.
---
* Remove any custom ini modifications.
---
* Set the [CPU affinity](https://merabheja.com/set-affinity-for-an-application-on-windows-10/) to use less than 8 cores, even down to 1 to see if it still crashes.
---
* Downgrade the NVidia driver to the launch version from November 14.
---
If these still crash your game, post a report with the [Incident app](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10). I recommend feedback instead of tech support as tech support will only mantra about upgrading drivers.
---
Your build is heavy guns with grenades. Heavy Gunner perks do not affect Missile launchers, AGLs, or Fat men. From the OPs post he wants to use missile launchers and the like.
---
Yes I think the fight should be possible without everyone having OP weapons. Currently a team of 8 players without expensive weapons and armor have no chance of defeating the queen, half the time a team of 8 even with OP weapons fail because her DT and health goes way to high when too many players join the battle.
---
That's my go to outfit! also, make the chainsaw flaming... the light from the flames is hella creepy with the mask!
---
[Here, check this map out.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/508524419715563522/513492796213166110/Channel5-Fallout-76-Vendor-Guide.jpg?width=738&amp;height=703) 
---
Each faction (some of which have just a single vendor) has a total of 200 caps they're willing to part with every 20 hours. Many of us begin our day by making a circuit, visiting seven different vendors, selling off 200 caps worth of stuff, then repeating at the beginning of the next day. 
---
I typically begin at Harper's Ferry, then fast travel down to Watoga to visit the two vendors there. Then I fast travel west to R&amp;G Station to sell to the raider vendor there. Then further west to Lewisburg Station to sell to the Responder Vendor there. Then it's north to the Whitesprings, to sell to the vendors in the resort and then the ones underground in the bunker. It takes around 40 minutes or so, and then I'm set for the day. 
---
Yup. Shotgun the bugs bethesda ffs!
---
Following, for news
---
If you look on the legendary item, you'll see five diamonds. The number of stars on the legendary enemy should equate to the number of diamonds on the item. I have yet to see anything above three stars. That means that four and five star items may be in the future. SBQ should be what drops those, but it would also be great to have a chance for other legendary enemies to drop them.
---
For my melee build, I like using Polished Heavy Metal chest &amp; left arm + Polished Heavy Robot right arm + Studded Heavy Leather legs, which has a base 266 DR, 217 ER, 23 RR
---
With Barbarian 3(15 STR), Iron Clad 5, Evasive 3(AGI 8), Scaly Skin and Grounded, that gets up to 450 DR, 441 ER, 23 RR.
---
So far with 5 pieces of Bolstering, 2 of which have +25 RR, the max it could get is 625 DR, 616 ER, 73 RR.  Although instead of going for 3 more pieces with +25 RR, I'm going for ones with +25 Poison Resist, which would further balance the build defensively.
---
I wouldn't think server hopping would affect server stability at all...
---
Holy shit... are Fallout and Idiocracy the same universe?!
---
They unbanned a bunch of cheaters, and they are proving they didn't deserve a second chance.
---
Does the biocommmesh armor mod affect alcohol?
---
It does increase chem duration.
---
Anyone around for the early days of GW knows it started out as a a weird tongue in cheek/super edgy mash-up. Religious murder-zealots facing off against slingshot launched hang-glider goblins and squid riders. Somewhere in the early 90s, it started going "oh so serious".
---
I think we have all had similar experiences, but thankfully they seem to be less often than the good or neutral ones...
---
I try to tag along and help low levels with a mission every once in a while.   Most times they seem to be afraid - and they run away...  
---
PS4
---
Don't forget the ammo!
---
I looked in the market and finally found it. Google only yielded the under armor so I believed this thread was calling that a “jumpsuit”
---
Even the wiki didn’t have it nor google images.
---
I haven’t played since early January and didnt know they had released that.
---
Thanks for that, I'll try the CPU affinity and downgrading my driver. 
---
I haven't got any mods or custom ini changes at all.
---
Cheers for the help!
---
Take 1 out of your stash
---
Quit the game to desktop or quit application if on console
---
Load up the game
---
Load into world
---
Mission should start automatically
---
Rinse and repeat (you have to take 1 out, close to desktop and start up again)
---
Yes. I'll be 80 in July. I started playing "Zork" on an IBMJr in 1984. Then a Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga, etc. I build my own gaming PCs from parts. I taught electronics for almost 30 years so it's easy for me.
---
Good luck in W.V. (My great-great-grandfather on my Dad's side came from W.V. after the War of 1812...which he fought in!)
---
Sadly true; people wouldn't be doing it if they weren't getting rewarded. Still, I don't want anything badly enough to server hop to get it, and wouldn't hop even once for 100 atoms :D  I tried that early on looking for vendor plans, and quickly realized that it ceases to be play and immediately turns into work.
---
Yes. I'm a bit glad it happens because before, it could take 10-30 seconds before they exploded, if at all. I almost died a couple of times because I thought they won't explode and they did the moment I went back to them. Fireproof is your best friend.
---
Lower level than you, right?
---
Ooh please! Where are you in the world, I’m uk and generally play between 7-10 bst.
---
Are you telling me this just to make me feel bad?  :)
---
You can seek out other players and SLAP them a little to see if they want to PvP, claim workshops to see who shows up to defend/retake them for PvP, or turn on the PvP radio for PvP.  There are plenty of options besides getting a bounty and waiting for someone to claim it for PvP; you dont need much besides an entry level bounty to attract PvP anyway.  
---
Leveling a passive player's CAMP is something you're choosing to do to cause them grief.  It probably shouldnt get you suspended/banned, but its griefing.
---
This!
---
Well, they unbanned people and those account still have all/most of their stuff as long as it wasn’t in huge stacks 
---
If you're on ps4 i can craft you a stack of civil war hats that sell for 31 caps each.
---
What we really need is the Pimp-Boy 3 Billion
---
it's entirely possible to do everything except the final part of the "main quest" by yourself. and even then, triggering that last quest alerts everyone on the server, and not many will turn down to loot so you'll have help. no need to actually "team-up", just try not to shoot the other guys by accident (or turn on Pacifist Mode in the settings, so you won't deal damage to other players that are helping you kill the "boss".)
---
Waiting for it...
---
I have a furious rad rifle, but I think it only affects the balistic damage. Doesn't matter what you do that affects the physical damage, the rads stay at 15.
---
Sorry, I am new. I didn't realise it was already a thing.
---
33 hours to go! woohoo!  Started playing again after about a 1 1/2 month break.  Still fun as hell.  If you enjoyed the other Fallouts you will like this one I imagine.
---
I sent this thread to the people I was talking to on Bethesdas so I hope not.
---
I hate masks but in games like Fallout, it is good way to enjoy the game and having fun. I'm the kind of person who loves role play but some times (like in real life) you just want to do stupid things and have fun. So take some friends, grab those masks and kill some monsters will be pretty fun. 
---
Does canned dog food count as meat or grain?  Both/neither?
---
I think Bethesda refreshes the servers at around 11 am EST, so I think that's when it'll start?
---
Add me, festista, I’ll help ya out if I see ya! 
---
There's probably no better way to accumulate anywhere from 60-100 units of adhesive than the pitcher plants in the Cranberry Bog.  Once you recognize the plant and the locations, you'll find adhesive is not an issue.  If you have Green Thumb, you'll get 2 digested goo per plant, and they're 4 adhesive each.  For comparison, Economy Wonderglue 5 adhesive I think?  
---
For aluminum, Fort Defiance has quite a few surgical trays spread around that give 1 aluminum and 1 rubber each.  In general, aluminum is pretty easy to find once you highlight and memorize the items, it's actually pretty common everywhere.  
---
For a more specific supply of aluminum, there's also the Harper's Ferry Armory in the Mire.   The armory has these air cooler/air conditioning units mounted on the walls of the armory structure that you can interact with and search.  They seem to always have coolant caps inside the air-coolers, and each coolant cap is worth 2 aluminum, and there are quite a few.  You might have to search the ground for them too, since the air coolers can be knocked over by explosions.  There are some on the outside walls, and the inner walls when inside the courtyard.
---
Keep in mind, this for players who have branched out this far, getting to the Cranberry Bog as a low level
---
Um, thanks.
---
Seriously
---
Lv 54 on PS4 and just hit Lv 40 IRL today.  I will celebrate at work lol :(
---
Adds 15% damage for each consecutive hit, that caps at 100% additonal damage is what I've seen. I don't recall the posts showing the research, it's accurate to my experience.
---
i read that party boy does not increase the effects of the new alcohols, and neither should they, regarding balance. I tried it with ballistic bock (+damage for ballistic weapons) and the bonus stayed the same with and without party boy, so dont invest too much into that
---
Not even almost what I was saying, but OK. If you don't believe me check the history of this sub for the past two weeks specifically. Its literally the same post over and over.
---
I remember a puddle there...
---
I don't think it's a new patch. I think it's something they can turn on and off from the server side. A couple of community managers already said it was already added as part of last week's patches, it just wasn't starting until today. Someone already found where the legendary vendor is going to be too, so it seems like some of these are just a matter of flipping a switch and not having to take the whole system down.
---
I'm inclined to agree. Exploring with friends was fun. Questing with friends was usually a disappointing mess, particularly around the multiple diamonds and stars for each player at different parts of the same quest, and progress getting deleted. It was a hot mess. 
---
yeah its back to how it was a  month ago... it sucks really, im on Ps4, and i have noticed the server stability get horrible after last patch
---
Sometimes it takes 3-4 minutes for the legendary item to spawn on the body for me. Since patch 7, I have always received something legendary from them, it just takes longer to load for me.
---
Not that I'm doubting you, but sometimes legendaries take a while to load for some reason. There's been times where I sit there for a minute or two and *then* it shows up. Did you wait at all for it?
---
If you're close enough, hit up Fort Defiance and pick up all the straight jackets. With max level hard bargain, you can sell them to vendors for 48 caps, or 50 if you also take a grape mentats. Sell four to a vendor at a time, and bam, easy 200 caps. That's what I do
---
yea... I'm confused about the point of the number of stars... If they all drop random then why even have a multiple star system...
---
They really do need to add more faction oriented content and stop drowning us in things that are totally out of character for the franchise.
---
I went in to complete miracle miners after 2 months, and there was a mine cart blocking the way. Just in the hallway if you go left from the entrance.
---
but if i can play EVERY OTHER online game i have with no problems, and then i get into FO76 and it crashes repeatedly, what then?
---
its obviously not a internet connection issue on your ends, i have gig-fiber and have no issues with other games online
---
Nope saying I'll make it for you 
---
Turn on pacifist mode, it makes it that vats doesnt target other players
---
i think most of us are smart enough to realize if we play other online games, and they never disconnect, but fo76 DOES
---
I understand that this works...but it is ridiculous that you have to wait by a corpse for up to 5 mins! That does not make it fixed
---
No its the stock of the weapon, u should have picked grip not stock. Go back and modify weapon and pick grip... No biggie...
---
Was there a drill?  That shit is pretty frustrating. 
---
That’s a mighty fine radium rifle. If I weren’t at work all day I’d be online to make you a small offer. I suppose if nobody else takes a nibble at your bait today, feel free to send me either a DM or shoot over a message to my Xbox account: Walther Raft
---
I’ll be online only after 4pm, sadly. Also, you might try the bazaar subreddit if you get no luck from folks here.
---
Any idea when it starts???
---
I guess but that’s still going to break player vendors. Last night someone wanted to trade with me. He wanted to sell me serums for 1000 caps. I can already get them for 250 each. There were others I was playing with and he just gave me adrenal reaction for free . When I wouldn’t buy the serums from the guy trying to sell them for 1000 caps he started shooting at me with his explosive shotgun.
---
If you go NE instead to the cemetery south of Pricket's fort, you can find a whole set of union and confederate gear
---
If you run Top of the World a couple of times and pick up all the ski poles you will be set for aluminum for quite a while.
---
Thank you, I'll give that a shot tonight
---
Awesome thank you!
---
I'll probably still put together my own tests for it at some point and post results on here.
---
I might have an extra plan for it, I'll need to check after work to make sure
---
All quests should be designed around instanced loot period!
---
i do this EVERY DAY...as i am over-encumbered every day.
---
i may have a hoarding problem
---
Yeah, that's the spot, down the steps and left into the little corridor.  I remember a puddle there, but not a mine cart.
---
I.... I don't know what I was expecting when I clicked on this but I was not disappointed. 
---
I mean, that just means better odds of all bots surviving so better rewards
---
Rad Storm!! 
---
I wouldn’t mind if the drill was legendary 
---
radstorm!!! take cover!!!
---
if you have an enclosed room with a ceiling, 4 walls you can wait it out
---
Seems its not fixed yet by the amount of itens you see on in game sellers/forums/facebook and in places like Ebay...
---
Yep! Fasnacht is still on track to begin today.
---
It is an internet connection problem, normal games and services you’ll experience lag, in a game whih requires you to connect to an external service (Fallout, ESO, All EA games, Destiny) will drop you because they have strict network management to the point where if you drop packets at anytime during play you’ll Disconnect.
---
How do i know? My old ISP would occasionally drop one or two packets here an there, i would get tiny lag spikes on most games but on Destiny i would ALWAYS get the “Weasel” error code. Bungie stated this is most common in UK connections as half the nation aint on full fiber yet. And soon as i changed ISP, problems eliminated.
---
It’s 100% ISP related
---
I heard that the more people doing it the better the rewards or something so having a lot of people there will help (it was something like that) 
---
Every time this happens to me the rest of their loot is not spawned either but he had an inventory full of loot. Just no legendary item. I waited around for a while too. 
---
Haha, yes!!
---
Killed three last night with no drops. Even waited around to see if it would load in for each. Nope...
---
i favor the handmades and the lever action rifles
---
i have been a fan of this game since the BETA, so listen to me when i say that you waiting this long is GOOD. dear god, the launch was a mess... like, i can enjoy something but still admit it's flawed. and this game, as much as i love it, was flat-out BAD at launch. if anything, the Wild Appalachia content drop is the signal of 76 actually being good.
---
This is great.
---
Question, unless another player targets a specific body part in VATS, are all other attacks subject to the total DR, ER, and RR of all your armor (that you see on the status screen)?  Or does it always hit a specific body part and look at just that resistance?
---
Ok I wasn’t sure how the rewards would be givien out if its during the quest on bodies or after it’s completed 
---
Weird. Have you been recently? Seems like an odd thing for them to patch in. But it is a mining company HQ.
---
works both ways. A couple old war buddies and I were holding munitions factory when some guy came in. I sent an invite, but he was just there to kill. Didn't want the factory or anything in it.  
---
We spent a few minutes ganking him over and over till he went away. Don't screw with old Marines.
---
I can't find any info on it. Bivs quests stopped working for me 2 days ago, and Bethesda as usual isn't saying a thing.
---
Avoid them for now - not worth the drain on your resources - they are higher level content.
---
What do you consider an op weapon?
---
No u can
---
I haven't been there in a couple months.
---
That would be hilarious yet horrifying lol.
---
Ok nice. I wasn’t sure
---
More people the better. I want all the masks.
---
Thank you sir
---
i did notice the servers got WORSE the same day all the banned dupers started posting they were able to log back in to the game
---
honestly i blame them for the recent server instability
---
Shelve the minigun, it burns ammo too quickly. Tag lead and steel, grab cans whenever you see them. I farm Flatwoods motel weight room and Charleston Fire Department for lead weights, and make my own ammo. Ammosmith and Super Duper make it much more efficient. I use the 50-cal and gatling exclusively, and I'm sitting on around 14k ammo for each without too much work. Gunpowder is easy enough to make, just grab any cloth/paper and Abraxo Cleaners. A lot of animal parts also give acid.
---
It makes me laugh that my character is tossing gold and silver, and is like "screw the precious metals, give me all of the tin cans!"
---
If you don't come back at level 30 and make a post about how this game helped you reconnect with your estranged dad/cousin/dog/sexuality or how nice all the players are you legally need to uninstall and never come back to this subreddit
---
I didn't modify the weapon in anyway. It changed by itself.
---
Well here is to more people picking it up now! I'll def be telling my friends I was wrong and to give it a go! 
---
"choosing to do to cause them grief. It probably shouldnt get you suspended/banned, but its griefing"
---
 - This is 100% false
---
I want to PvP. I am a raider. Im *encouraged* by the game to wreck camps. I may want a bounty ro attract high level bounty hunters in order to bait them into PvP. I ultimately gain caps and junk from camp smashing. I need to smash 4 camps to get the 1000 cap bounty i like to play with...
---
Its not griefing at all. Theres just a portion of the community (including you) who misunderstands the mechanics of the game. 
---
It has nothing to do with upsetting other players. Im encouraged to bait people into PvP however i see fit. 
---
You guys need to do a better job of understanding PvP mechanics to protect yourself from *perceived* "greifing". 
---
You are objectively incorrect and have no method of proving my motives. I make 5k caps a night, im max junk/caps. All from playing the game as a raider.
---
I have no intentions of cause grief. I expect players to underatand the game they are playing. They understand raiders are a risk. 
---
Im looking for PvP, Junk and caps. Its totally 
---
a  legit and encouraged playstyle. 
---
You are part of the problem. You should be spreading awareness of raiders and PvP mechanics. Not mislabeling raiders as griefers. 
---
This community has a huge problem with people like you, ignorant to the reality of the brutal game mechanics.
---
Its the game. You are in denial if you believe otherwise.
---
Something like that. Or a recording plays with a responder or overseer that alerts us.
---
Drats, good to know! Thanks!
---
Ok thanks 
---
This is why: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted_Blood_incident
---
tl;dr: They did this in WoW once, and it turned into such a shitshow that real world epidemiologists studied it.
---
Personally, carry weight be damned, I only like the look of the Excavator arms and can't stand the way the rest of the set looks(outside the colors).  It's why I plan to use the arms with the rest as Ultracite once I get my PA character to 50.
---
But thanks to those data mined skins, I'm at a cross road.  Do I get the Black Excavator Skin when it comes out, so the arms match with the Ulracite, or do I get the Black &amp; Yellow Ultracite skin so the Ultracite matches the Excavator Arms?
---
Usually takes 15mins in case your wondering.
---
That question also swept my mind
---
When this event starts? 
---
my favorite part of questing with friends is trying to listen to holotapes or read notes while my friends are talking in my ear...
---
random exploration with friends is much better.
---
It's the 19th I'm in Helvita nothing new :/ 
---
What time zone are you in and what are you willing to pay?
---
I'm looking for fiberoptics and ultracite. If you don't want those I can take caps.
---
if you MUST engage them (which I advise against at lvl35) use dense mod in your chest and fireproof endurance perk. Their attacks won't do squat then, just watch for the scorched they call in.
---
Valseek has confirmed in another thread that Fasnacht is still on track for today.
---
I’ll finally see some people again!
---
At release I always ran into people, now not so much. 
---
I see a few doing Biv quests now too. 
---
I don’t know, I always play solo but it’s fun when I come across an event and others are there. I’m excited for this event :)
---
Yet another lie Bethesda has told us.... right in the loading screens it says that "Outclassed only by power armor, every piece of Marine combat armor provides exceptional protection in nearly every battlefield scenario."  
---
I was really happy when I found the plans, only to craft it and think... "Wait, why is this worse than what I was wearing?"  LIES!!!
---
I use full Trapper.  That RR is more important to me than the extra DR or ER.  Not going to run a blast zone in it, but fighting ghouls and walking near waste sites it saves from losing my health to rads.
---
Agreed - I have missed every notification of my camp being attacked. The only time I've ever had the opportunity to defend my camp was when a lvl 13 destroyed my front door (a powered door) only to find me crouched inside waiting for him. I just happened to be there repairing and breaking down junk. He got a Dragon to the face for his efforts.
---
I am not saying that there are not fo76 specific issues. What I am saying is that Bethesdas servers seem to be more picky about small drops in connectivity on consoles and that can be solved in some people's cases at the individuals level. 
---
And will be your worst day ever
---
You're really not going to, at Level 35.  Avoidance is really the best strategy you have, whether that means going around them, or having the Agility perks to run away.
---
I'd say if you want to be a little more survivable, take a perk or two of Fireproof in Endurance.  Yes, it says its for fire resistance, but it covers the Scorchbeasts' green Cheerios too.  Short of finding the rare Dense mod for your torso armor, it's the best you can do at any level.
---
I play destiny 2 as much as fo76, and my kiddo plays overwatch and battlefields and call of duties, and we dont get disconnected
---
so, your logic is flawed
---
Ha! I got a notification to defend the dump from sheepsquatches and got hyped. Then just a bunch of mutants showed up. Talk about blue balls.

Ok I understand your point. I'm not even trying the quest right now specifically because of all of the activity and I honestly haven't discovered the starting location. What I've gathered is that it is designed like a single player quest and can become impossible to complete on a given server since there are other players in the world that can interfere with quest objectives. There are several ways that the quest could be revised to prevent players from spoiling the quest for each other and I hope that Bethesda will be careful to avoid this mistake in the future.
---
You sure?   I’m always in pacifist and am pretty sure I still VATS target players not on my team.  Will have to double check.  (I know I still VATS target friendlies and non aggressive targets like Whitespring bots)
---
Likely they haven't caught the issue yet then. Unfortunate.
---
We know where toast comes from too but we still like bread :p
---
woah woah woah, don't say you were WRONG. just say they fixed it.
---
...well, most of it.
---
It’s so weird. A couple weeks back I saw someone talking about rad storms here and I thought, bullshit, I’ve been playing for 200ish hours, rad storms aren’t in the game. 
---
Then later that day I saw a rad storm. Still the only one I’ve ever seen. 
---
YER KILLIN EM, INSULT BOT
---
Sometimes today, prob after 3pm est or whenever they done patching it in.
---
I have loved crafting in online games ever since I first tried out Ultima Online back in the 90s. So for me it is a double win. i get to do something fun and then give it to someone who needs it. I just wish you could see on an item who crafted it.
---
I had someone that sounded much older run after me from a ways away ( i know because I kept checking the map and getting nervous that some high level guy was running at me), and because of my gamer tag, yell, “Shirley you cant be serious!” And started running away. I yelled back, “I am serious, and don’t call me Shirley!” He stopped and we talked a bit and I commented on how he had the worlds clearest mic. Great random interaction. 
---
Took 10+ years of having that gamer tag for someone to finally get the reference. 
---
This community rocks. 
---
All?  I don't even know what this thread is about, but I saw your lame comment and wanted to correct you on what patience means.  Server hopping for a reward over and over is patience, just because they got it much faster than you through their patience of suffering through a very boring task.  
---
Your initial comment was riddled with anger, mad at the fact that other players are obtaining something you want through means you don't approve of.  Relax and just play the game your way, don't check your neighbor.
---
It's the marker from a crypt.  It's similar to the crypts on the way into the Railroad headquarters in FO4
---
These drinks aren’t novelties to us pvp people. They are a stepping stone to even higher damage output.
---
I will have a look and see! :)
---
I think that would be awesome! A world event caused by the players would be amazing!
---
Nice! For the mission where you have find the brotherhood signal beacons, I had to face like 3 of the fucking things. I ran away then and SOMEHOW managed to complete the mission but jesus those guys are tough. The server was fucking me in the ass. 
---
May sound like a NOOB here (I mean I am to reddit i guess) but what the fuck is the rare dense mod?
---
Only one week unfortunately :/ 
---
Hi your game not working? you must be new here.
---
Ignore these guys. Hop in your raider power armor, ammo up, carry a secondary back up rifle, get some stims or healing salves. Do work. Kill those nasty bastards.
---
Until you do them the first time, dailies only trigger at a specific location; after that their auto-trigger area is much larger.  In this instance, the start is at the Tygert water treatment plant.  After you complete it, it'll trigger almost every time you go to the Forest.
---
We're actively looking into a fix for this. Thanks for the report!
---
Nice! I didn't realize the fireproof perk covers scorchbeasts #win
---
its a fun glitch, i like to then leave a surprise paper bag in the houses glitch in, so it surprises the owner when they come home
---
Thank You for info! 
---
As far as I understand it will work as any other event, so rewards will go directly to your inventory.
---
I'm partial to the view from my roof.  It's not so much nature, as a majestic view of nature.

---
get Plague Walker and revel in your diseases.
---
Yeah I can help out. I don't have all the materials though. For each piece it needs 5 cloth, 7 gold, 6 leather and 6 screws (assuming this is for leather). If you give me that i will do it for you!
---
I’ll look at my inventory and get back to you tonight.
---
What? you are disappointed ? what were you expecting? a good game? 
---
carnivore = no cranberry relish.
---
I've done it a few times and haven't gotten anything spectacular.  But it's an easy daily that keeps you in the Forest area, so it's good XP for low levels.
---
Yeah for some reason they aren’t that common in the game. Fallout 4 has them pretty often and I loved every second :)
---
I have a character... Sandy the Clown. No chainsaw. Doesn't attack other pplayers… but he does creep on 'em. It's how I've been exploring the map... find someone, keep them sort of in sight, follow them everywhere they go. 
---
Let 'em see me... if I can find a place where they can
---
t reach me without my escape. Peek around trees, try and guess where they're heading, and if possible, fast travel there so I'm there ahead of them. That sort of thing. It's a nice change from the oh-so-serious business of survival.
---
Because vats is dumb.  Should have never made the jump from fo4. Devs know this so they're sabotaging it so when the get rid of it and let me map a favorite item to left button, no one will complain. 
---
UK here too :) That's when I'll be on and can help. I don't have enough materials to do it all though. For each piece it needs 5 cloth, 7 gold, 6 leather and 6 screws (assuming this is for leather). If you give me those then I'll happily do it for free.
---
Yessir
---
As long as the chasing and lunging only lasted under a minute, but hounding people for over five minutes straight is being an annoying pest. I've had a couple of people do the former, which was fine, but lately I'm experiencing more of the latter - requiring the use of stimpaks - which is irritating and results in me using the Report Player function.
---
Yea, he’s was being a jerk....but maybe unintentionally. 
---
Sometimes I’ve seen people ‘hold’ him, but as soon as another player showed up they exited so others could use him. 
---
Personally, I would have preferred that they give us a couple of weeks to enjoy the NukaShine content, and other random stuff added in the last update before hitting us with  limited Time Event.
---
Hopefully the Fashnact Parade and other future "Limited Time Events" will be recurring periodically for those who can't play all the time.
---
I set my camp next to the Overseer's camp, that way new players almost always swing by. There are no doors, and I hope the big bright Welcome Home sign helps put them at ease.
---
If anyone is on PC (Lionneserra) and having a hard time, drop on by! I leave freebies in the Overseer's stash, and I built two spare rooms for guests.
---
considering you can get a player icon of the 3000 Mk IV from Fallout 4, and 76 was built using mainly assets from 4, i feel that one at least could be added. the others (handheld 2000 from 1 and 2, 3000A from 3) would take new models and animations, which if they do them at all seem like something they'd do after finishing the "important" stuff.
---
as for an in-lore reason for them to be there, they can definitely say that other vaults besides 76 were completed and outfitted at different times, and thus had different versions of pip-boy.
---
again, i don't think it's LIKELY. but it is theoretically POSSIBLE. i mean modders were able to add the 2000 to NEW VEGAS.
---
when is it happening? I see nothing on the Bethesda site or twitter. 
---
OP is right about the flags being everywhere here
---
Hate to say but it's better to have waited to complete that. The ultracite powerarmor reward is level 50 anyways. It will sit in storage for awhile. 
---
On PC?  Look me up - I'll give you some
---
I can't be the only one that thinks the power armor skins aren't even that special... it's just blue as far as I can tell. People goin' crazy. If we wanna start a real fashion trend we should all wear power armor with the left leg off. We'll call it the Reddit gang. It can be our gang symbol. Then there can be a rival gang with the right leg off. And then there will be people missing arms but we don't care about them because Reddit gang is the real OG... wait, what were we talking about?
---
Me too! My boyfriend and I can’t wait to get dressed up for it. My bf loves masks so this is all him 
---
thanks for reminding me I have some Technical Data to turn in 
---
I’ve looked for ever for this and I’ve even checked, now I know for sure thank you
---
With the bit you interact to keep him from walking off. If another person shows up you break free for them to look. When they finish you go back to interacting. 
---
Sounds like that person interacted to hold it and then took off to go do something. Kinda stinks for everyone else. 
---
That may explain why the playerbase also in general seems to be much better to play with for those of us who dislike PvP (btw, I'm in the 40+ crowd). 
---
Go get Mothman Eggs at Point Pleasant and make omelettes.
---
Same. It was only a couple weeks ago I encountered one. Been playing since launch. 
---
My house is right outside of that town and it would suck if it got blown up.
---
When will you be on?
---
how I've done it 
---
OMG :D ! LOOK EVERYONE! SHEEP!! 
---
On now
---
Nothing more satisfying than flattening faces with a weighted boxing glove. 
---
I always carry:
---
a full repaired firearm and ammo
---
a fully repaired melee weapon
---
an outfit
---
and a few pc of repaired armour
---
to give to low level characters.
---
Slocum's Joe isn't wrong, Joe, aka cup of Joe is slang for coffee, meaning Slocum's Coffee.
---
It's my understanding that player actions in the game world follow them to some extent, such as, if you go and clear out all the lead weights and other good junk at certain locations, leave the server, and join a new server - the new server will usually be depleted of the items you have taken recently.  There is also your CAMP which has to appear in the game world, and your inventory, stash, etc being moved from server to server.  Wouldn't repeatedly moving each of the types of information and potentially hundreds or thousands of in game objects from one server to another while thousands of other people are doing the same thing be more taxing than just staying on a server and playing?  I don't know what is going in internally with a game like this, but I assume that the more data that is moved or processed, the more likely it is that an error may occur. At least Bethesda uses server stability as an explanation for limiting stash size, so I was thinking along those lines.
---
Does anyone have a list of the effects?
---
I have enough karma that I find them amusing. Not a troll, just an unhappy customer.
---
Hopefully I can still play it despite having pretty crap stats and weapons. I’m only like level 35,and really want to participate, but I might get obliterated immediately 😂
---
Oh yeah I figured but I'm in school and will be on around 5 pm est
---
me too. i turned off quest tracking for it so i dont have to see it ever. 
---
As stated above, if you repair it to 200 percent durability the chainsaw WRECKS. This goes for the Mr. Handy Buzzblade and the ripper as well
---
Dense is a mod (like Deep Pocketed) you can apply to certain torso armors (Metal, Marine and Combat for sure) that basically reduces damage from explosions in the same way that Fireproof does.  It's very difficult to find and one of those awkward mods you arbitrarily can't find through scrapping.  Some have reported getting the plans from Scorchbeasts (ironically).  I've bought mine from vendors, mainly in Watoga, but there are so many combinations of armor+mod that I've only ever seen Combat Armor Dense Mod appear *once*.
---
For the Brotherhood quest, at some point, you really just need to run for it.  You can easily have 2 or 3 Lv. 80 Scorchbeasts on your tail on the way to the Glassed Cavern, and they'll keep respawning.
---
Actually a lot of places, just check before you place it, I have had like 3 camps with this issue out of like 12 idk tho good luck tho
---
you need to horde antibiotics which increase your disease resistances
---
I feel like its because Appalachia wasn’t directly hit by a nuclear strike. The Commonwealth WAS, and its even stated in game that the radstorms are caused by thunderstorms passing over the Glowing Sea. So if you ask me, my guess is the radstorms in Appalachia are rare because they blow in from somewhere heavily irradiated outside the region- like the Capital Wasteland for example.
---
Good gf
---
Ok see you then👍
---
What ammo do you use?
---
Hopping, rabbit, lol!
---
Go melee build. 
---
I'd pay 1k for a level 50 one. If it's not max highest I'll go is 600.
---
This is a core part of the Fallout 76 experience though, buying the game is just the first step. You spend a week downloading all the updates. Once you actually get into the game somebody will immediately try to trap you in an oven and burn you to death. By this point you should have a party hat and one 10mm pistol.
---
I think there are no places because setting up a CAMP either creates new spawns or there is no place without. Maybe Seneca rocks on top but i think there are some SB spawns.
---
Glowing Steaks for days
---
So this is the real reason for all the dead brahmin I keep coming across in random locations.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
TSE and bloodied builds. I just think that casuals should stand a chance at winning against the queen. the last main quest is to launch a nuke. most people will launch it at prime to fight the queen. these people should at least stand a chance at killing her with basic end game weapons(gauss rifle and good heavy weapons). as long as they come prepared with proper ammo, guns and chems they should be able to kill her with proper prep. considering you have to kill her dozens of times or even more to get all the recipes and plans she has she should not be hard as she currently is. i agree it is end game content but RNG is a pain and its not really worth it to farm for 100's of hours to get TSE weapons just to get a chance at something you want from her then farming more for ultrasite ammo to do it all over again just to get the same plans and a wood leg legendary 
---
None of the effects affect the secondary damage types. Rad damage doesn't get increased. I've tried with a bloodied gamma and it only increases the ballistic component. 
---
For 1 shot the Instigating lever action do the job, mix it with sneak bonus and you kill almost any mod with 1 shot, except the SBs.
---
Also bloodied lever works good if u runs with low health.
---
Primarily of course
---
My favorite players in this game are female. they bring a certain civility ; )
---
Pretty much nowhere. Enemies are made to spawn at and around your CAMP to attack it. You may see less spawns in places such as on top of the mountains in the Savage Divide, but even then I don't think you'll be 100% safe. Best to CAMP in the Forest area, where mobs are restricted to lower areas, so a few turrets will easily clear them before they reach your CAMP.
---
Also less worry about trying to look cool. Not that I was that bad about it in high school but there were things I cared about that now I'm like I'm so glad I don't anymore (some kids aren't really. Hell, some of the coolest kids, the ones that were the kind everyone liked, were not super focused on it either). But I do think a lot of jerkiness you see in late teen to early 20 something gamers is worried about looking like a dork/bad gamer/etc. and caring too much about that (usually expressed in trying to get one over on everyone else).
---
Wouldn't know because I am a solo player. I would love to have a team but no one my level ever has a mic + is cool and chill
---
At the top of seneca rocks
---
You must be using an automatic build to be consuming that much?
---
Hop server, problem solved
---
What platform? Also what ammo type?
---
i set up base in the starting woods portion of the game, and i still have molerats and the occasional ghoul come attack my stuff
---
i think they are attracted to sounds of resource collectors, power generators, and crops
---
so, i think everyone has to deal with them occasionally if you decide to have any of the above CAMP items in your base
---
but, placing your BASE near an obvious hub for enemies is going to attract them
---
I think a lot of players who love immersion would really enjoy it, especially if it was a managed event with Bethesda employees monitoring things, and a storyline to it.
---
But players who aren't into full immersion would *hate* it. It's basically a debuff that you can get just for being closer to another player. And if they really wanted to make it a fun event for the immersion cried, it'd have to be a pretty potent debuff, too. Probably one that progressively gets worse and requires you to complete some quests to heal it.
---
Same here - I'm on the cliff Above Greg's Mine Supply, just North of Horizon's Rest. I would not want to deal with repairs.
---
Well that's dumb, I've never used it so idk
---
I am willing to bet someone drops a nuke on it. I saw the same thing happen day one with the Nukashine stuff.
---
Some people just cant let others have fun.
---
an in-game event inspired by a real-life West Virginia event is lore-breaking?
---
that's like saying that the Freedom Trail in 4 is "lore-breaking", or that Project Purity being built in Thomas Jefferson's memorial in 3 is "lore-breaking" or that New Vegas having strip clubs is "lore breaking". it's not lore breaking to include something from the real location the game is set in.
---
It only prevents u from harming others
---
I enjoyed fallout tactics I know that’s an unpopular opinion.
---
aight bet
---
Usually it's a Super Mutant or Scorched shooting from a ridiculous distance away which doesn't proc my turrets so my crops get totaled. This is also an issue that needs to be addressed. If the enemies can attack from such a distance then our turrets should be able to do the same. Treating an attack on any part of the camp should be treated the same as if it were attacking the turret directly.
---
Chainsaws &amp; Drills are all low level, but with mods, they can actually do some impressive DPS
---
Thanks for the responses 
---
I encountered this last night, although it only happened twice immediately one after the other then was fine for the remainder of the time I was on.
---
He says it like you need to be older to form an opinion or something. 
---
Place it by the butterfly on the map there’s a junk pile and noting but radstags 
---
I guarantee it'll be back eventually. probably more expensive, and for like a weekend, but it WILL be back.
---
Ok sure my reddit is my gamertag message me and I'll get back to a soon as I can 
---
*kills 3 star glowing mirelurk queen after spending 1284 round of ammunition. Walks up to corpse to claim trophy...... 1 star junkies pool cue, 5 and a half caps and a half eaten tin of Cram.*
---
I could be on board with this. There'd even be a market for vending these if people didn't want to manage the substantial power needs.
---
Yes, I would love to see the info on scout armor.
---
At low levels, maintaining ammo may look tough. Invest in sneaking and VATS to fully utilize criticals, use head-shots in VATS so that enemies die quickly. Best to just stick to one heavy hitting weapon such as a .308 bolt action pipe pistol. In any case, the problem will be there for a while. I felt the same way and slowly started to move into melee.
---
to be fair, it never said limited time. it was just on the store, and they took it out.
---
There's a Chainsaw in the Shed behind Ranger District Office,
---
First, I can presume anything i want.
---
Second you most are trying to get the paint job, otherwise I doubt you would be complaining this much. Or writing such a long reply making all sorts of statements about what kind of amazing person you are. 
---
It's one stinking quest. Guess what. There's going to be more. There's 8 TNT domes. Each one will most likely have some sort of unofficial quest to get something like this. The alien blaster, the nuka cola paint job, and now the Quantum paint job. 
---
They are perfectly valid quests. They are for the players that are very observent and figure things out. Players that want a challenge that require thinking, and observe things. 
---
So stop pooping on things that you don't like, because it makes you sound like a self person.
---
The 40+ people are really the first possible generation that could have played video games all their lives, lol.
---
After 10 minutes?  I probably would have killed him.  I'm not even a player who does PvP, but at some point, a player is just being rude.
---
Thants not a cheater thays somone that doesnt know their prices dont try and start a witch hunt because of a griefer. Theres a diffrence between griefer and duper. 
---
Crimson is from cranberry bog nuke zones. Just farm the blast berries. Hope this helps!
---
Oh no I hope not, my camp is right next to Helvetia and Greg's mine supply, right on the river.
---
I will typically post the hold on Reddit, and then hold at that location as long as no one else shows up. If no one is interacting then I will hold again. I do not hold and then go afk.
---
i saw that graveyard and was really sad i couldn't loot the "custom" helmets. looking back, I'm glad i couldn't take them. but i still wanted a helmet with writing or a sticker on it.
---
My Lever Actions are my favorites! I use a TSE Dragon for Scorchbeast fights too.
---
Pretty easy, its all over whitespring 
---
Man, for someone that isn't doing the quest, you sure do a lot of self righteous I'm so great replies to make. 
---
/joke 
---
Was it a legendary? If not, more than likely you just scrapped or sold the wrong thing.
---
Lol and here I am just thinking in fallout 4 when we log off, the world stops as in fallout 76 it’s online so the days continue basically 😂 just never changes days on our pip boys sadly 
---
Shoot him
---
I think that people are bored out of their minds, and maybe this shows that Bethesda should have delivered a lot more quests rather than a brewing add on that I'm not sure people are all that interested in.
---
I'd suggest focusing on **events** as a group, not quests. You can power-up plants together. Play some music in one violent night. Do a silo together and drop a nuke. Feed the people. Most events work well with a group. 
---
With a normal vendor, sure. But Graham wanders and the Responder and lemonade stand are  random spawns. Hopping will lose them.
---
I have my camp over the waterfall by the plane/lead mine and I haven’t gotten attacked yet. Once in a very, VERY blue moon there’s a moth man that spawns way out but he has never attacked. 
---
Also wondering when this starts...
---
How do one reconnect with their estranged sexuality?
---
Why are you on ebay looking for armor sets lol??  Dont start a witch hunt when your personally seeking these items on ebay 
---
I live above the trees on the top of a cliff.  
---
I have a junk node 8 stories below me.
---
Ammosmith is very helpful. Grab all the steel, lead and gunpowder you can and craft away.
---
It's kind of normal. Until you're high LVL with perks that make 2 times more ammo when you craft and legendary weapons that do more dmg (therefore using less ammo), then its generally a struggle. Just make sure not to waste ammo on lesser enemies. I'm a solo sniper, and at lower lvls and even now, I normally carry a main dmg weapon, lesser dmg for lower enemies and an instigating combat knife for when I'm fighting enemies up to LVL 20 so not to even waste ammo on them.
---
i mean they can just say it's a deathclaw or mole miner scratchmark and avoid paying Monster Energy a dime lol
---
or make a Fallout-themed knockoff like Nuka Cola was to coca-cola.  ...how about "Mutant Energy drink?"
---
It's called Gallows Humor
---
There is a combination of humor and horror, but the balance is what makes this franchise great, and the humor employed in the early franchise does not have an overabundance of slapstick. Some of that humor is made of pure darkness.
---
There is nothing more iconic in the franchise to sum this up than the Canadians getting shot down in the street and the US soldiers waving to the camera right after. 
---
I would also argue that the ambient soundtracks are absolutely setting a brooding tone. The franchise is dark as it gets.
---
The quantum armor paint is **not** a quest, it's a rare in-game item. 
---
Hey me too!  I grew up during the golden age of arcades...you know...when you actually had to go out and be social to play video games?  Frankly, that was the first era of 'social gaming'.  People tend to forget about that.  I also built a 'mame' arcade with full arcade controls.  Also had Atari, Commodore 64, Amiga, etc....
---
Fallout is my favorite series too.  However, my kids never got into it.  My son grew up with Nintendo and loves it to this day ( he is 17 ).   BOTW is his all time favorite.  Although he does like his fortnite and such on occasion...
---
My brother and I were talking about this the other day. If you wanted you could slap damage them until they died if you didn't mind a bounty. But when Bethesda makes pacifist mode no longer receive any damage (which I support) what would prevent someone from trolling (or just unknowingly going afk because real life calls) and just holding a vendor until they timed out after half an hour? They should implement some kind of 3 to 5 minute vendor timeout timer.
---
yeah most of my guns are automatic which is the issue i guess, theyre the most fun to use!
---
I honestly did not know this was a problem until I got on reddit, my first try doing the quantum paint quest I got everything in one shot without having to server hop
---
Love it! 
---
Hey what works for me with Biv is to spam the interact button to get the daily quest. Maybe this will help you too
---
10mm, energy cells, shells, and .308
---
the energy cells and 10mm are on automatic guns
---
i have a chinese officers sword that i use more than id like to lol
---
Is there enough of a difference tanking different styles of enemy?
---
Single enemy versus multiple mobs?
---
Perhaps a kiting build would be key if there was a mechanic that focused an enemy onto you.
---
A fusion generator should be the fusion core recharger. You can build one at your house, so throwing a core into the generator should be able to recharge a core over time.
---
I’m not. I googled Sentinel armour because I’m not a pvp guy. Wanted to see what the big deal is when it popped up in the search. I could care less about pvp but lately it’s been a problem in the game.
---
The best part of this post is how the OP says he's not even doing the quest and doesn't care about the paint job.
---
But how he's taking some higher stance on how quests are done in the game. Without considering this wouldn't have been a problem if another player hadn't cheated and then posted about it. 
---
Man, entitlement in gamers is so high. 
---
How much DPS?  
---
Not really needed in **my opinion**. Im constantly dropping cores all over the place since since i have way too many of them.. You can find them all over the place very easily. And now that they fixed the brotherhood event line in the sand you can farm them too by realm hopping if you really need to (rewards 2 full cores).
---
which leg upgrade?  i thought the motion assist torso added carry capacity. 
---
Nope. I only play with pacifist on and I target other players all the time.
---
When I started playing I really miss garden plots, mainly because after a par of weeks I put my CAMP on lead deposit behind the mental hospital and my plants were being destroyed by scorchebeasts. So I had to make a kind of warehouse to protect it and with garden plots it could be a less materials and time consumer. 
---
Especially bad if using VATs in melee. Exiting vats allows the hits to connect.
---
i'll bring my fatman. this will be fun!
---
Pacifist only turns off player damage. I do a ton of messenger missions and it always targets the bot. 
---
This. Holy schnikes, so much Crimson Flux, lol.
---
There's some Crimson at Whitespring. It's at the large East entrance to the resort, on the outside of the oval-shaped drop-off (pretty close to the train station). Alternately you can get it from cranberries in the bog. 
---
Its actually good for pve as well as long as you dont get staggered. And its not a matter of it being a problem..people dont seem to understand how the game works. Use vats Crits man it ignores sentinel i personally use sentinel armor and believe me im killable.
---
Fireproof doesnt matter when you hang out at 40% health and are right on top of them. I have to be on medx buffout and psycho to tank the blast. Very much a glass cannon build.
---
20-30 was the toughest grind for me with regards to Ammo. Once you start perking into your weapon class, it will take less rounds to put down enemies and ammo becomes much easier to manage. Also Super Duper (Luck) &amp; Ammosmith (Perception) are perks that will become available later on and allow you to make ammo at much higher amounts for the same amount of materials you are using now. Until then, get a good melee and keep switching weapons. GL 
---
if you actually killed them, you're a murderer. which is part of the game. so, no.
---
if you waited to kill them till they attacked back, you're just fighting. so, also no.
---
if you attacked them, and when they didn't fight back, threw a hissy fit and destroyed their camp, like a toddler who broke someone's toys because they wouldn't play with you, you're an asshole. so, yes.
---
...but if your goal was ALWAYS to destroy the camp, then you're a vandal. which again is part of the game. so, no.
---
Mods, or plans I have for the Chainsaw so far:
---
* Bow Bar (Learned by scrapping)

I have some for sale on Xbox if anyone is interested.
---
GT= Medieval Paul
---
Thankfully I have friends who love that shit. So if some level 150 wants to kill my level 35 god help him.
---
Hahaha! I wish xbox would record voice like this
---
Used weapon artisan plus long bow bar 35 damage . Gotta see it on the field now ? I’m assuming all 2 handed melee works on this pupper 
---
Which is why I didn't say it was wrong - I said it was awkward.
---
Especially since Fallout 4 also had the secret speakeasy, Slocum Joe's.
---
Sometimes other mobs will pick up legendary weapons from dead mobs (looking at you Super Mutants). Make sure to check all the bodies after a massacre.
---
Well...
---
You could start out as a human and "evolve" into a ghoul or a Super Mutant...
---
Finger placement is the same 
---
People will then (finally) realize griefing often has nothing to do with PvP.  
---
I used to run scared from them and now they’re just an annoyance. You’ll get to that point one day too. I’d rather take on 2 scorchbeasts at once now than face a Mirelurk Queen and her minions, the Mirelurk King and friends at once.
---
My dude, I’ll be following closely. Hopefully you guys will still be launching when I get out of work this afternoon!
---
pc!
---
Get a gaming laptop or take your console with you!
---
yeah but they didn't say it was a limited time item back when it first came out. they just decided to take it out and gave people a warning.
---
I have my camp south of Camden park near the ash heap on the river, i rarely get attacked and its been at least a week since I last got attacked.
---
Also had my camp close to the nuka cola factory at one time, rarely got attacked there as well
---
It’s letting you know that enemies are very close by or that they noticed you
---
Lol i have a lvl 50 with full unyeilding sentinel and lvl doesnt matter in fact the higher the lvl the more caps you loose . having a high lvl protect you isnt efficient. Use a low lvl with a good build. Saves caps and males folks salty
---
Logged in for a few minutes and saw people around Helvetia already lol
---
Visually modding Power Armor like modding a car in various racing games would be a huuuge untapped potential in 76! 
---
Not only colors (and I'm not talking about red arm vs blue arm but each individual piece could be colored) but also lights, decals and other decorative elements (like spikes and skulls, armor plates, different visors and headlamps, vents, valves, heck - even capes, whatever). 
---
The possibilities would be sheer endless. 
---
And imagine the cool designs the players would come up with. No two Power Armors would be alike.
---
The plans could be purchased at vendors, rewards from quests and events, rewards for defeating the SBQ and some could be sold in the Atomic Shop.
---
This is an expansion that I'd be more than happy to pay for!
---
And whoever prefers to use regular armor instead won't have to pay for it but they'd still be able to see others running around in their cool customized Power Armor - thus giving non-PA user a strong incentive to change their mind and purchase the DLC aswell. Advertising 101, folks.
---
Also: there could be a bi-weekly styling contest. The winner would get 500 Atoms (or whatever) and an exclusive unique piece.
---
If you are growing crops this will attract the critters, I think. Been less of a problem for me after I removed my adhesive farm.
---
Set a time irl for 10 minutes 
---
Sounds like they were AFK maybe another player killed the bot because they were pissed off. Though TBH I'm not sure if you can kill vendor bots
---
Yeah I was joking too. Just a weird coincidence.
---
I didn't sell anything. I was thinking that maybe I scrapped it accidentally, but it was favourited on my weapon wheel at the exact same spot, so, I dunno,? In any case, weird things do happen with weapons anyway; my Rose's Syringer just straight up disappeared from my inventory one day. It had done that before too but had come back that time.
---
I sure can. For reference:
---
- I start at the spawn and pull the ore node in front of me on the left and ignore the two broken ones. 
---
- I then turn around and go loot the lead nodes now on my right.
---
- Then continue up the hill and u-turn and go back towards Hornwright and loot the 8-12 above (on two levels). 
---
- Then I run through Hornwright diagonally to the far corner and go down the hill looting the 6 along that path which takes you close to the vault. - - From there I head towards the nearest tower and loot along the road towards the headquarters. This part consists of me wandering all over with friends yelling "over here" because they are really scattered but there are multiple groupings of 5+ nodes.
---
Violet is the annoying one to collect everything else is plentiful
---
Being an unarmed melee build I got super hyped upon reading that Vintage Nukashine buffs unarmed damage by 100%. However, I can confirm that Cola Nut and Party Boy do not boost it to 300%. From the few tests i've done,those cards only affect SPECIAL stats of consumables. Still a phenomenal buff for unarmed builds just gotta be careful with the timing when using it during SBQ fights.
---
Collect tin cans. They give lead and steel. 
---
Mistress of Mysteries
---
Enclave, Firebreather (but requires responder stuff first), and BoS quest lines... but the BoS questline has a few "rip your hair out" moments. The payoff at the end, learning what happened to them and going through the glassed caverns, is worth it though.
---
kinda spoilery, but there is a non-hostile mothman (the "Wise Mothman") who appears if you complete the event and Landview Lighthouse. he gives you an experience boost and hangs around for a few minutes for pictures.
---
i'm sure you meant the one you actually fight, but if you just wanna see a mothman this is probably the most "guaranteed" way to do it.
---
Hit me up if you wanna trade for some armor. I have most sets and i dont charge cash. Lol 
---
Whitespring resort, if you go to the back entrance, there are about 30+ crimson plants scattered around the garden. Equip the green thumb perk card, and you get double
---
Caution means nearby enemies are alerted that you’re there, but don’t know where you are. Danger means they know where you are. 
---
LMAO!!!!
---
Sounds like it'll be easier with more people less work for everyone. Let's just hope there isn't too many A-Hole griefers
---
You on PS4?
---
Yup thanks
---
Use Melee for lesser enemies to conserve ammo, this is an issue for all levels.
---
I'd pay 600 for the level 40 if he doesn't want it
---
I don't think there will be a patch. I feel like I saw that last week's update already has the event in it so we should be good to go when it starts... don't quote me on that though, lol. :P
---
Is it out yet?
---
That was the one place I've built that actually got destroyed by other players on a regular basis.
---
The ballad of the teenage moment.
---
The suggestion is more for QoL than out of necessity.  Personally, I'd prefer managing just a few FCs rather than farming them or compulsively picking up ones I find.
---
Sure am. Id rather trade then sell anyday. Alteast we can both walk away with somthing we want at that point
---
I was doing a vendor loop once recently, and came to the Harpers Ferry vendor, which was tied up with another player. I was \~lvl 100, he was \~ lvl 35. I gave him 5 minutes while I sat crouched and hidden, watching while playing on my phone. After 5 minutes he was still standing there with the vendor locked, so I went out in the street and got the attention of the lvl 60 ghouls that I had crept past on my way in, and pied pipered them right to him. Once the Ghouls did their work and freed up the vendor, I used my instigating pickaxe on them, and carried on with my commerce needs. I was a fair sport though, I didn't touch the guy's junk bag and he did show up about a minute later to claim it's contents.
---
Or a Syringer.....I shudder everytime
---
Get the chemist perk, turn 5 blood packs into 80 diluted stims and sell them for 5 caps a piece. Sell them to vendors if players dpnt buy them or throw them into a vending machine once we get them. 
---
I use a Furious Prime Gatling Plasma or a Furious Prime .50 cal. I have no problem killing her. The plasma cores are easy to prime just need yellowcake and Violet is easy to collect after the queen fight. You dont need op guns to kill her. Just need to be prepared with the right perks.
---
Yeah I gathered this is an accidental bug, just hadn't seen it mentioned yet
---
Love the 56k modem, that’s how I played the original Doom lol 
---
Yesterday’s you had Bethesda community managers or whatever they are called that they was gonna be a patch this morning and nothing so I’m guess something ate dog poo along the way 
---
Shouldve tried to get the lemonade vendor instead. Hard lemonade!
---
That's terrible! Nobody's ever attacked my base, but maybe it has something to do with the hours I'm on.
---
It was in the atom shop limited time 
---
Camden park is broken for me
---
Thank you for adding this - good to get some additional solid leads on finding these plans. I’m still looking for the BoS leg plans and the deep pocketed combat armor limbs plan.
---
Any particular treasure map type or location work better than another? I’ve seen rumors of savage divide for BoS but nothing too strong to that statement.
---
It need to be live soon :(
---
Well if they know where I am it should say "Enemy Urine Detected" because they'd be pissing themselves. I AM THE DANGER.
---
Nothing over expected over here. I'm just so disappointed for the bug or intended decision to remove every daily. And if it was a bug why no official word. And all the lost atom challenge. If we do not get any compensation I will be very hesitant buying any atoms in the future.
---
I got the dense plan for raider armor from the SBQ. 
---
Are you saying you cant learn the plan from scrapping armor?! 
---
Corey what's your gamertag 
---
+Karma Thanks
---
Have they said when it was going to be live yet? I was hoping to get incone or two gos before I have to head to work for the day.
---
CoreyG1234
---
This coincides with my experience, hmm
---
I thought this today too. Probably to prevent griefing where someone gets loaded up with diseases and runs around to other players. 
---
"Go Outside"
---
Try putting your PS4 in standby mode. It should continue to download but a lot of the processes that are prioritized over downloads will be deactivated. It works for me.
---
No, but you gain wisdom and pragmatism when you get older.  Things aren't always so black-and-white, and you realize that few decisions lead to total success or disaster.  You become a better processor of information.
---
That continues to a point, at least.  The mind does become less malleable over time, which is why some seniors can often be stubborn and locked into a particular mindset.
---
Never payed attention to this I had two tse one with a prime receiver and yup missing as well 
---
I think the "diseased" tag overwrites the "legendary" tag on em. So it'll be a legendary, but it won't be obvious until it drops something.
---
But I'm very possibly wrong. 
---
Build a camp next to water. Deconstruct everything you get. Prioritize the hacking and lockpicking perks above all else. You got melee weapon and heavy weapons damage under strength, semi auto and full auto rifles in perception, and smgs and pistols under agility. Energy weapons are a given (Intelligence). Level up your charisma to 9 if you want to share a lvl 3 perk ( 3 charisma for every level of that perk). Soups. Lots of soups.
---
Go outside, Meet people, Get a job
---
You need to do a mole man impersonation over the mic.
---
Nothing that wouldn't sound insulting.
---
You care way too much about this, dude.
---
No just people waiting lol poor souls 
---
I play almost exclusively solo because I like to take my time and explore, read notes, listen to holotapes, etc...  When I have tried playing with others it just isn't the same....I always feel rushed, etc...
---
Maybe, but these are quality of life things that need to be address
---
Yeah, this. I mean, I've spent ages finding armour and finding it nowhere near as good as my leather deep pockets, and being puzzled. At least now I know the answer. 
---
Because it isn't.
---
I am level 175 and have never seen a chainsaw, but have seen lots of mods for it. Where do you get it?
---
Ahh, I was gonna try and help out a fellow wastelander but I’m on PS4 sorry. When I was lower level I used the 10mm, shotgun, and hunting rifles. Mostly because that was the ammo I would find laying around the most. Don’t buy ammo from vendors just loot bodies. I used to farm the prison north of the Morgantown air port for shotgun shells/.308. Also, be sure to check suit cases/etc. at train stations. I stumbled across many outside train stations with tons of junk/ammo/etc in them. Sometimes people like to leave little happiness bombs for other players. 
---
"Damn"
---
They are free to do what they want, but that’s an unhealthy amount. 
---
Oh, it happens. But I'm glad to hear that no one has bothered yours!
---
It's actually not that great of a story. Who gives a shit.
---
Or put one point in Good Doggy. Dog food is everywhere and there is enough in the game that you can pretty much rely on it as your sole food source. This is more point-efficient, doesn't require you to rely on access to a nuke zone, and lets you vendor the more valuable ionized meat for caps.
---
You must be good at crafting 
---
darnit, now they know and they're going to patch it out. you were supposed to be quiet about this! 
---
it's okay because any time you try to use it, while you're drinking you're immediately attacked by another diseased enemy and you have to use it again. and during nuke zones make sure you put your hazmat suit on under your power armor or you suck down a LOT of rads with your sulphur water (oh and also you're attacked by a diseased ghoul and you die)
---
That South Park episode. “Maaaaamm toilet!!!! toilet!!!!!”
---
I go try make friends with anyone who's 300+ they always have hints or tricks to share.
---
I'm not trying to get the paint job nor have I said anything about being amazing. Please re-read the original post.  I have seen main quests that were broken and required server hopping to complete. This is a known issue.  People have reported that this new quest is broken in the same way as some previous quests, and requires server hopping to complete. I am hopeful that Bethesda will patch this, and be more careful to avoid this scenario in the future, since they are repeating a past mistake. The only thing I disapprove of, is if a quest is flawed or broken such that it cannot be completed with normal play. I cannot speak to whether the quest is valid since I haven't played it.  What I am aware of is that no amount of being observant or problem solving ability can overcome the problem of quest items being missing from the game world.  My expressed disapproval of poor quest design or a bug, is not "pooping on things". It is an attempt to improve the game experience for everyone. 
---
That would be OK with me.  I suppose my suggestion of a seperate object is so that it could be locked behind late-game faction or something like a lvl.3 terminal.  I also wouldn't mind having more CAMP items that can utilize the large amount of power that a FG outputs.
---
That's not really quality of life, if all it takes is 15 minutes. You can easily do something that will keep you distracted for 15 minutes
---
It is quite common to use variations of well established brands to market yourself, even more so with a speakeasy. 
---
Ah.. Didn't think about that since i never seen those spawns yet (lv191)
---
For quite a while at lower levels, I had my camp adjacent to Camp McClintock, an a ledge to the right of the main entrance, it only required 2 turrets (One at each end) and took no damage for 2 months, also McClintock is a great ballistic Fiber Farming location.
---
Now being over 150, I keep my CAMP in the Cranberry Bog, in a spot that invites several High level (sometimes legendary) enemy attacks.
---
Repairs are sometimes costly, but the rewards are great.
---
I don't know. I use it on lvl 68 super mutants, it tears through them 
---
seriously during SBQs i put disease cure on a hotkey because every darned scorched thing on the ground gives me rattle hands or whatever 
---
I don't drop as many since last week's nerf to wild fusion cores, but I agree that it's not needed for those of us who know the spawn locations. I could see it being good if it's built in a way that helps struggling casual players. 
---
Lvl45 here, lvl142 in game. Thanks for bringing this up. It has usually been a pleasure to play with those younger than myself, especially those interested in learning from the experience harnessed over the years. Teaches you patience and to never give up, even when things start to get somewhat boring. I generally find that if you're in it for the ride, you get companionship for a long time. Hang out in Discord servers with the soon to be elderly, and you'll be surprised how much fun there is to be had. 
---
That leaves you 103 hours for Fallout 76, slacker. Get to it.
---
Ps4 i fear 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Yeah I can’t see anything either, daily has been reset and still nothing 
---
I have been robbed at least 50 weekly / daily glitched bugged quest since released date, starting to suspect these were by design as I would had been sitting on an extra 2000 atoms or so ...
---
Sometimes the legendary takes a while to load in after the other loot.
---
FR sent 
---
You can fix that yourself actually.
---
* Build wooden doorway
---
* Place the desired door in it
---
* Select the wooden doorway and select remove
---
   * From here it will give you the option to scrap or replace
---
* Select replace and toggle the options to the desired doorway
---
*Viola*! Now your doors will no longer be off-kilter!
---
I haven’t been able to find him :(
---
only cures 120% of disease not 200%
---
Early days were like the wild west. It could be from the disarm trap xp glitch. 
---
Then I forget I left the booze in there
---
could be a person on disability who unfortuantely has no choice but to be home all day, so this could be a pasttime for them
---
or maybe they have really bad depression or social anxiety and this is how they get relief, it takes their minds off of all the things they are worrying about
---
but mostly, i worry that they need some sunlight and personal interaction with real people
---
Lol I don't even care at all. It take 0 effort to post this stuff...
---
THANK YOU for not making me go to a video, not trying to kill my data.
---
Thank you! :)
---
I'm not sure what is self righteous about wanting bug free quests that can be completed without workarounds.
---
You... Clearly
---
Swap to melee occasionally and for long periods or until melee breaks I know ain’t my style either but helps the ammo bleed 
---
They sell for 4k? !?! I've only been getting the plans and I've been selling them for 20 caps lol
---
CAMPs need to serve more purpose in the game as it is. There's such an emphasis on them but little to no reason to go back to them except for when you need a break.
---
You should be able to easily plant gardens, generate/charge cores, etc. Right now it's just a quick place to craft and bank, but stashes and crafting tables are found all over the world so it reduces their functionality *slightly*. I'd just love to see their versatility upped quite a bit.
---
Lol we should tear shit up together!
---
You might be waiting another 100 lvls because I'm 221 and have never a TSE to drop. Honestly I could care less. One of the guys I play with has 5 pips in explosives on a tse combat shot gun. He gained 30 dmg from it. My opinion is that it's a waste of 5 points that could go elsewhere to up the dmg.
---
I gave an extra set away to someone . 4k?
---
That is apparently the case, yes.
---
I guess this is a peasant joke that you are too rich to understand.
---
Yeah, they are fun and very powerful, I'm using a similar build, because automatic and non automatic rifle perks are both perception you can make a build that is very easy to switch out on the fly, what I do it use not automatic when I'm just exploiting ect, then switch to auto when I'm fighting tanky bois like scorchbeasts :) makes ammo consumption easier to manage without make automatic weapons unusable 
---
This morning, while in Watoga, I killed a 3\* robot and got a syringer.
---
That shouldn't be happening still.
---
Here's what you don't get. The quest was designed to slow the rate of the paint job entering the game. It was meant as a rare paint job. 
---
It's not wrong how they set the quest up. It's not broken. So it doesn't need to be patched. But they might change it, and increase the amount of times it can be gotten per day.
---
What it will do is make them work harder to stop people from cheating and data mining this stuff and an SPOILING THE GAME for people.
---
Why don't you get upset over the guy that cheated? Huh? 
---
Iam in the nirthern Mountain of Seneca Rocks and there was literally Nothing for weeks 
---
LMAO!!! That's too funny!! Love it.
---
The way I do it is each time I craft I pull out the fermented ones and put in the new ones it works organically as I’m hitting my base every 30 minutes while logged in 
---
yeah it seems level dependent, a higher level player would be more likely to know the recipes for disease cure (i know 2 of them, not sure if there's more) most of the time i just check in Status-&gt;Effects at how much time is left and if i'm in camp i just wait it out. sleep, play an instrument, make some glue, disease is over. 
---
There is a problem with that since the game is meant to be about survival and scavenging.. Things shouldn't be handed to you in gold platter in a game like this. Just my two cents again. Given them like that wouldn't be as rewarding as finding them on your own.
---
Yea wasnt sure. Havent build there just read about it and saw some videos.
---
Ok so I should always keep a safe distance from them I guess, no shotgun :(
---
It might be worth 4k for some. But price is subjective.
---
I have kited enemies to them on many occasions, but when they don't react to the attack (Obviously AFK) then I consider their junk payment for being inconsiderate, I do leave them some fertilizer if I have any, as a message.
---
Make sure you use green thumb when you collect and super duper when you craft.
---
I am in the same boat except with 5.56 ammo.
---
I don't know their situation or story as an individual conciousness so I try not too assume anything rude or condescending like the typical "virgin" comments but I also am not naive to the thin lines of this life and if he is enjoying himself, that's all that matters. 
---
Make love not Warcraft.
---
granted, you need to burn some caps to fast travel and if you spawn at the clubhouse it's a risky proposition. i have never traveled to WS just for the fountain
---
Same 
---
Most I’ve seen people sell them for is 500 caps or the seller gets lambasted by people.
---
Ya'll need to chill
---
Nothing at the top of Seneca 👌
---
I didn’t know I wanted this 
---
There's also a lot of violet there as well
---
That sucks. But good to know. I can relax on the armor scrapping then :-) Thanks. 
---
Likely just a shut in. At that high level the level up must do nothing. Must have every perk card. 
---
Am I missing something?
---
I've been avoiding telling people exactly where my camp is because I love the spot too much, but, between the Savage Divide and the Bog, there are numerous cliffs and ledges that stick out halfway down those cliffs. I've tested a couple of them, and none of them spawn enemies directly on the ledge. The only one that actually gets attacked is my current one, where scorched spawn on the cliff above me, and either fall to their deaths down to where my camp is, or try to shoot me with shotguns far outside of their damage range. 
---
Added Bonus: Constant view of nukes going off at FS Prime :)
---
Lol I use a combo of lead belly and carnivore mutation, I just eat the glowing and ionized meat straight from the ghouls, and then eat flux for my water.
---
Holy crap! That's broken as hell!
---
Especially given how many people are on a server at a time. 
---
It's not bugged. That's where you are wrong, and you can't see that you are wrong. 
---
The quest was designed to give out one per day, per server. 
---
FYI, server hoping isn't a bad thing. The game is designed to handle that, they have said so. 
---
Since you are only applying your own standards as the only accept ones, (How you think all quests should be done in a day), you are being self rightous. That's what it means. When only the way you think something should be done, is acceptable.
---
I'm in helvetica rb wondering the same thing 
---
The point is that if people have to server hop in order to obtain certain items or complete any specific quest, then there is something wrong that should be patched, and future quests should be designed with this in mind. I'm not sure how else to explain it. I don't ever want to have to server hop to finish a broken quest.
---
👍Thx
---
"im shooting these bullets really fast and miss most of them and don't understand why I can't keep ammo?!?!"
---
For the next week is what I think will happen 
---
Totally agree.  Aside from the fermenter, all a CAMP truly gives a player is a free fast travel point and a cootie-free bed.  More functionality would be ideal.
---
It’s just for fun. Lighten up a lil
---
I got some tick blood cocktail one time without the base for it and then got one of the dailies yesterday that doesn't even give you a recipe!  Luckily I got a new recipe on my other character, so just got it done in time.  And I'm not even sure its daily - I went back the next day and Biv didn't give me anything - I guess a day means 24+ hours or more in this case?
---
Is there anywhere that tells where mods come from? I've not seen shadowed plans in ages. Vendors dont sell them. It seems I may have to farm plans on shelves, but I'm not sure.
---
also the "dome sculpture" camp plan comes from the statue atop the gazebo here
---
/r/nichnamechecksout
---
It's better, but the gatling gun is my go to for easy to kill stuff like glowing bloated ghouls and max level super mutants. With one or two stacks of adrenaline or a headshot, my bloodied gatling gun one shots them. Ridiculous ammo efficiency. 15,000 5mm rounds, which I can craft in a few hours of collecting ore / acid, will last me weeks. Thought about switching to ultracite, but... I'm already one shotting stuff, and that lowers the attack speed by 20%.
---
New random encounter added last patch that sells lemonade and hard lemonade recipe.
---
Encountering them is already rare enough. Then it's only a small chance they'll actually drop one.
---
No fun allowed
---
At least quote it correctly.  
---
That's good to hear. I would be perfectly happy to be wrong if it means there isn't a problem with new quests in the game.
---
Care to share? Even in a PM? Pretty please? heh.
---
I feel bad for you. 
---
Same here. 218 hours, level 132 and yesterday I discovered 4 new locations while exploring the Mire. 
---
I seems to be an exactly 24 refresh cycle in my experience
---
You can check on them from any stashbox
---
To the very north of the map, slightly northeast of the WV Lumber Co is a very safe area. There's an oil deposit in that area where you can put in an extractor and a fairly bit of flat area to build. I've been in that place for 200+ hours before moving to Helvetia. I've probably been only attacked once or twice every 20 logins, usually just one Mongrel or Super Mutant 
---
Still nothing yet from Bethesda 
---
Especially in a video game!!
---
I'm in my mid 40's my boyfriend's cousin plays and he is two years older than me.
---
False, I have that mod in my stash right now. I bought it from the Watoga train station, mostly because I had never seen the mod before, and figured it was probably rare.
---
Im thinking maybe i just got lucky? From reddit though youd swear it was a huge issue but i did this quest on a sunday afternoon full server no issues.
---
It's optional so why Do you care about it, you can finish the quest without repairing it 
---
This is fucking serious
---
There are no other mobs. It's just the behemoth in this location.
---
Data mining isn't cheating, and what do you mean "it's why Rockstar kept RDR2 off PC"? If I didn't data mine, I wouldn't know that at some point we're getting a power armor skin set in the Atom Shop that I've been saving my atoms for SINCE THE PC BETA.
---
I was actually mistaken. 
---
It's actually 11. 
---
Stupid daylight savings 
---
Nuka grape is the best. Use it as huge health and rads cure for Scorchbeast Queen. Even better with cola perks.
---
When it does
---
Well all I got is marsupial. And my ocd compels me to complete so what ever you got I'll take, caps permitted. I'll be on tonight making my rounds. My psn is the same as my handle here

---
Shhhhh, I was trying to keep that a secret! 
---
console. I appreciate the offer though. this games community is great
---
It doesn’t give an extra reward or anything?
---
Isn't the paint obtained through discovering and visiting several locations and by gathering information and items? That is what I was referring to as a quest, but I don't know if it has a name in game.

Do you have a link to said thread? If not it's fine

Hop servers at the Overseer’s Cache. If you see balloons up the road toward Flatwoods at the random spawn point past the truck, you got him.

It was my first pass at regulating the free market economy, sanctions may be more restrictive in future instances.

A lot of high level peeps are folks on disability/unable to work. Most of them are nice folks.

ahaha I feel bad too, that's why I want this notification thing
---
The house always wins!
---
Cool thanks! That’s good enough for me!
---
It's a classic pin-up picture. Nice find!
---
Its a shame they nerfed the selling of raw flux to vendors. It was around 5caps per, and you could get a ton using green thumb.
---
Check around. I think bethesda said on twitter
---
I figure it would still be way more lucrative and less time consuming to use power plant workshops to make vendored FCs but if someone is dedicated enough to keep rotating cores it could be profitable.
---
Yeah, with this and the refrigerator they can just remove all resource management from the game. 
---
I'd love to see crafting get a slightly bonus when done at a CAMP, too. Maybe you make a few extra shells when making ammo, weapons and armor get a slight buff to durability, etc. This would allow players to do whatever they needed at any table in the game, but when they're at their home base, they get a *slight* edge. Not a huge buff, but just enough where it makes a difference.
---
No information yet.
---
It may be that it’s not possible to get those through scrapping any more. I’m just doing events, opening containers and server-hopping at Grafton a few times per session. 
---
Get further back. If you kill them and are far enough back (medium to long range) they don't explode. It is only when you or someone else is in mini nuke explosion range that they will explode.
---
We're able to scrap car wrecks, concrete barriers and other obstacles at workshops - but not at our actual Camp. Why?!
---
Literally nobody builds anything at workshops, thus nobody needs to clear out a big area to build. So what's the point? On the other hand, we tend to spend a lot of time at our camp, trying to make it pretty and functional. Scrapping unwanted objects should work exactly *the other way around*!
---
[Betheda please i'm begging you](https://i.imgur.com/QXGbqHa.png)

The just try'n to move perk points after every nerf an buff to keep their toon min/max'ed.
---
I just want a way to consolodate like 1/2 charged cores into fully charged ones. Like maybe what you suggest, just it has an "instant" option to drain another core to recharge the "charging" one.
---
I’m just glad to see how many people are wanting to do this. Finally big groups of people other than the SBQ fight 
---
There is one vague note as far as I'm aware. The OP even stated that the only reason he was able to find out how to do it was by mining the data. 
---
I don't think there is a linear path you can progress through.
---
I'm pretty sure you can just buy the plan from the Enclave...it's pretty cheap if I remember correctly.
---
Jaoh33
---
Cool, what do you know about it?
---
yeah, players love it when you ruin a game by rushing them to the nonexistent endgame by removing all challenge of limited resources and giving them items better than all the quest rewards. Lets them turn off the game and never play again all that much faster. 
---
I will play with you on fallout 76. Send me your psn name
---
Nope lol I haven't even told my wife where it is lol
---
I liked the Morgantown nukes. Crazy amount of glowing ghouls and a lot of cobalt flux- which is pretty rare at Whitesprings. I'm upgrading vaultsuits to sell so I need a lot of cobalt. 
---
True. Not going to dispute that at all.
---
a drill and syringer are in legendary loot pool.
---
Heart of the Swamp event I got a 3\* legendary Mirelurk Queen a couple nights ago - no legendary :(
---
That DEFINITELY addresses the issue I was expressing with the way that the model for the cooking stations' stoves have their doors slightly misaligned with the rest of the model! 
---
It's a mr handy that spawns with a lemonade stand trying to make money for master jimmy. he sells lemonade, the lemonade  recipe, and the hard lemonade recipe. 
---
That's about it.
---
That's not how it was before and I don't like the way it sounds.
---
Yes. I sent one 
---
Me too. Although I won't be *too** put out if they wait until I'm off work.
---
Don't remember that being how it's meant to happen
---
I don’t understand. It’s not a quest and It is not tracked. It’s like a secret plan in the game. If it wasn’t for people datamining no one would even know how to get it yet. So I wouldn’t call it a quest. 
---
What’re you looking for? Guns or melee?
---
This right here is a great example.  I see posts all the time about how the Atom Shop stuff is dumb/childish/etc.
---
This game takes place very shortly after the bombs fell.  Many folks are probably still holding on to pre war ideals of life.  The other Fallout games take place further into the future, when new generations have only ever known the wastes.
---
I love that 76 seems to have that desperation to hold on to pre war life. 
---
Damn, I'm gonna have to test this later but I feel so dumb that I never thought to do that... I replace literally every other kind of wall but that thought never crossed my mind. Brilliant! XD
---
Thank you so fucking much.
---
I found the plan at a random train station vendor. Dont remember which one but it was pretty cheap
---
Oh whoops sorry I was reading that wrong lol. My bad!
---
there's a challenge to scrap 75 shoguns. Not shotguns. shoguns.
---
It's no different than being submerged in your phone for 12hrs a day. To each their own.

Here's my build: https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#Aw4CAwQOAwkBAQEANicCIwOTAQE7ARMBmAEBqQEBmQEBogEBGQNVAX4CwgEBKwMLA9cBASUDcAXxAQJxA+oBAjUBJAPwAQPEAQI5AzYCAA==
---
With Adrenal Reaction at 40 HP and whole set of unyielding armor.
---
You can?
---
Can you take them too?
---
That would be immensely helpful. 
---
Honestly, I was curious why they didn’t give me alerts for this.  I was like, “what the fuck is happening to my camp and how do i stop it”?
---
Is it time for a meme to die when it because a text post?
---
Cool I’ll check some vendors. I was under the impression you had to do a power plant event. Thanks guys. 
---
Same always did that in the other games it definitely would be a nice thing to add
---
Watch it again. Why do you think the guy in the costume suddenly gets super wide eyed? 
---
That could be a great new perk card.  Get bonus CND or ammo yield when crafting in your CAMP.  Call it "Prepper" or something.  
---
I would also love to be able to repair (maintain/keep sharp) gear that's in the 100 - 199% condition range.  That would be something perfect for only being able to do at a CAMP.
---
There are other power plants on the map that you can do it at.
---
I actually got the idea to try it when I was watching one of Jug's videos on tips and tricks. His didn't include the doorway fix though and instead he used doorways to clip objects into walls like the light boxes to make cool decals!
---
do you play with random people or a team. I play with a team and yes its easy at this point but when i nuke it solo and see who comes to fight along side me it is impossible with randoms. It is a server wide event so everyone can come. so when half the server comes and none of them have any l good legendary weapons we end up losing all the time, even with everyone shooting with all they have. I mean we lose bad not even 25 percent of the health gone. I just want it to be fun so everyone can join and feel like they are actually doing something and not just wasting time shooting a bullet sponge .
---
To each there own.
---
Damn I've already dropped two in the blue cases in watoga station. Didn't know they were that rare or worth anything (although I am doing brewing dailies on 4 characters).
---
Bethesda said they'd unban them once the exploits were patched. Maybe you should consider that the servers just suck and the only reason it was more stable post dupers is because there was simply less people. New content + unban wave = more people sucking up server bandwidth.
---
Right on! Well thanks so much for sharing! :)
---
Thanks - the vendors are only a 21 cycle in my experience so I thought it would be the same for Biv, but apparently not.  24 cycle is bad, you're always a bit behind each day so if you play in the evening, it'll be past bedtime before you can get in the next day at some point.
---
Exactly. I've had people talk shit before at the golf club about my damage, not realizing I'm standing up and have switched to a crappier weapon so I don't instantly kill everything.
---
I'll sit on the roof tops now. But this is bs. I liked howd they exploid within 10 seconds. Then its my fault and I can only laugh at myself. Now I swear their eyes glow red with evil
---
If your on Xbox I'll give ya ammo. I have plenty and can craft large quantities with super duper maxed 
---
i second that
---
oh geez this should NOT be a thing... did you try logging off/shutting down game and then restarting?
---
hopefully that will fix it?
---
If that is happening - it is a new/changed thing, and I hate it so hard....
---
I know sometimes I was 'sure' I tagged something but didn't. For example, I was at my limit on range with my shotgun shooting at a flying Scorch Beast. Had the red target cursor and heard the 'hit' sound at least a dozen times, but got 0 loot for it and no XP when it went down.  I think there's a damage threshold you have to pass for it considers you to have tagged it. Sometimes that's hard with a shotgun due to spread and the low damage of each pellet. If you're shooting into a crowd of Glowing Ones and players doing melee on them, you could have been hitting the players and thinking you were hitting the ghouls because it makes the same hit sound.
---
That doesn't explain seeing loot vanish while looking at it, only the ones that were empty. I do know there's a glitch where when you go to loot a body, it will temporarily show you a wrong loot table and then update to the correct one. For example, I've taken down a sentry bot and had it show 500+ 5.56 ammo and then disappear and show the fusion cores and the regular loot. Just some thoughts and possible explanations.
---
Yes, you can retrieve them from any Stash box.
---
&gt;Note: Urban Scout armor is not listed because it &gt;is uncraftable.
---
Reckon it's been delayed till tomorrow because of last weeks delay
---
They do but the probability you’ll actually see the small  text in the time it’s up is negligible.
---
could be, but i dont trust dupers to stop duping as long as there are ways to dupe out there (which there are still ways)
---
Hang on, I have a furious Mr handy, gotta go test this.
---
Killed a 3\* charred feral yesterday and got a 1\* TS the dragon. Even the SBQ fights I only get some 1\* or 2\* armor piece. Weapons not Armor please! 
---
Except that it's not a hardcore survival experience to begin with and it locking the feature behind late-game barriers would still necessitate effort on the player's part to obtain.
---
Sometimes you can jump between them and break the trade connection also.
---
Going iff the last update, tomorrow XD
---
So what you're saying is that no one should have a melee build?
---
Prewar terrorist army
---
Unfortunately there are no enemy focus mechanics that I am aware of at this point. It can be observed that enemies can and will change focus but the EXACT thresholds for such are black boxed as far as I know. The best guess I have, or have seen, is that there is a certain damage threshold to cross to get the attention from someone else.
---
Aaaah thanks for the tip :)
---
Totally random or specific known locations?
---
I had the exact same bug, maybe the quest line is glitched, I just went on to finish the quest without it. 
---
Lever action for my sniping/general use and a handmade with explosive and the automatic mod when I just want to kill everything in a room quickly. 
---
Like how to glitch xp...
---
Those plans are going to be the next Ultracite Explosive Vents...
---
That’s is not gonna work just like that you people realize that ?
---
Nuke related loot was always a single loot pool. If you dont get there quick enough you dont get hardened mass etc. Legendary lottery shouldn't be like that and qasnt for me in my nuke yesterday 
---
Why would you not want free food delivery service tho
---
Oof, thats okay. It messes with me too.
---
thus my idea of using explosive weapons and rapid fire to draw as much attension as possible. LOL Who knows if it will work but I was already planning on a Clashing Boom Boom character next anyway so thought that I would start considering how it would work
---
My body is ready—will be in touch shortly 
---
I play other games (ESO for example) that do this often. Items come through the store for a while, And they eventually get taken down after a period of time. Every now and then, They bring them back for a short time and then theyre gone again. Most of those items didnt say “Limited Time” either.
---
ive been stuck on this one since launch, however my issue is that when i go on the computer or check the mailbox it doesnt give me the info i need so im always stuck at 'Go to the post office'
---
Sell ?! I drop them in doggy bags
---
We're all redditors. Our brains have learned to just take it in and not lurch to a stop when confronted with poor spelling.
---
Hey man! I got my account back roughly a week ago. Seemingly most people banned in the February banwave got their accounts back. But those who got banned in previous waves are still banned.
---
Blocker should 100% work with Power Armor. There is a few perks that dont work in PA and they normally tell you that. From my knowledge Marathoner does not work in Power Armor and I think it's one of the only ones that doesnt say so.
---
Those are (or were?) in the atom shop. One purchase gave you a different flames paint for each T/X series PA
---
it could have been shot down, I may have done that before, just for research mind you, and of course verification...OK, so maybe I shot it down several times, that's what survivor do.
---
The random encounter locations around the map. Easiest one to find is right down the road from the overseers camp
---
Devil's Advocate (I don't agree with what I am about to say):
---
It is a pretty small window of time if you fast travel. The time between you generating a code and using the code is less than 5 minutes, depending on loading times. 
---
Where it really gets broken is the steps needed
---
1. Get key cards from Nuka Plant and Tanagra. Opposite sides of the map. Expensive fast travel.
---
2. Get note from crashed plane. (this is a one time thing)
---
3. Generate 1 time code at mansion
---
4. Go to different mansion, use the key cards to access code panel. This removes the key cards from your inventory. 
---
5. Use the one time code to unlock door.
---
6. Get key from pedestal behind door.
---
7. Go to TNT Dome 7 and get plans.
---
The key cards from step 1 are single use. If you use them and somebody has borked your code... gotta go get new ones. If the keys are already gone, gotta go get new ones. 
---
All in all each attempt costs close to 100 caps *with* the fast travel charisma perk. I get that the paint is supposed to be rare. And rare things *should* be costly to get. Either in time or resources or both. If they aren't costly, they aren't really rare. Or at least they don't stay rare for very long. But having to essentially start over from scratch is bad mojo. 
---
Atom Cats/Flames/Hot Rod was in the atom shop. Maybe not still there? I bought it so I dunno if it’s no longer available 
---
To call out  a spelling error with grammatical errors = priceless.
---
The spelling error is not stopping you form playing so the game is not unplayable, therefore the word literally is not used correctly.  
---
The double periods are not necessary at the end of the sentence.  
---
Can alarms are like winning the lottery if you are an ammo crafter.
---
The ITV post specifically said there are new camp plans rewarded for the parade event.
---
1st launch is happening now dude! Gonna be nuking her for a few hours 
---
You can find a  few in the pool at the agriculture center in flatwoods
---
Theres a reason most games do not feature communicable diseases. 
---
And that's because of the corrupted blood incident.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted_Blood_incident
---
Last thing they need is rampant killing of servers. 
---
Plus if you think griefers are bad now, try them with a disease you can't see
---
They only grow on Water thats All i know 
---
Ha I love that comment i know people that tally hours of social media time ( multiple ones ) the scrolling is unlimited fingertip must be missing prints already 
---
Behind the Vault-tek Agricultural Center in flatwoods. There are two pools with tarberries floating in them. Also all over waterways in cranberry bog. 
---
Nah, you can't get banned, been tweaking and modding fallout 76 since just after release.
---
Yeah, it should be 23 at the most so it can fit into someone's schedule.
---
I wish the vendors refeshed caps extra on the weekend too, filling up your stash and being unable to effectively sell more just makes you play the game less even if you have the time to play.
---
Been killing mobs all morning, in nuke zones too and haven't noticed it. Maybe it was a buggy server, OP
---
Showing my age, I guess. Or thinking of the Fashnacht mask's similarity to Alex's from the movie, or maybe the dude over on r/fo76FilthyCasuals seeking a bar theme for player vending to whom I suggested he wear a bowler, suspenders and slacks, and carry a cane when tending bar. I've had that movie on my brain for a couple of days now.
---
Ah! So Party Boy will be useful with the new drinks, I'll keep that in mind! Thanks!
---
Thank you!!!
---
For me, bos has a higher value in all stats I'm not sure how it's different for you ?
---
My standing theory is that the method I traded items to my mules is why I got hit in that ban wave. Dropping items on the ground then picking it up on the mule. Repeatedly doing this led to really high counts. When I got my accounts back I had nothing seemingly removed.
---
Nah sometimes real people make you wanna avoid real people 
---
no one cares
---
They are hard to see but once you see them for the first time they will stand out. 
---
I should try out that Anti-Armor / swing speed / +1 Agility combat knife I have sitting around in the stash box.  Wonder if its any good vs. the SBQ?
---
Given that workshop given me close to 20 levels of advantage before they patch the craft xp I would literally take all workshops and fully build at least full budget 
---
I must kill them and collect 600 caps.
---
Right.
---
It took me several levels to gain a partial understanding of how the perk system worked, so all of my early points went to strength.  
---
@ L42, I have 15 point allocated to strength, but only 13 points used.
---
The two Strength cards I have available to me on the perk screen are both packrat 1.  
---
I already have packrat 3 applied, so those do me no good.
---
When I'm on the level up screen, it will not allow me to select any strength card from the deck because I've already allocated 15 points to the category.
---
I think my current allocation is  S 15, P 8, E 5, C 3, I 6, A 3, L 2.  
---
Its working reasonably well as a melee/sniper.
---
 I still need perks in the other categories, so when I pick a non strength category, thats where I select the card.
---
To that end, it would be nice to be able to trade the two (useless to me) packrat 1 card for something else so I can apply perks the 2 unused S points, without having to carry unused points in another category.
---
At least now I understand of all the posts about rebalancing.
---
No prob. 
---
Chinesium
---
yea i noticed vats screws it up real good
---
Yes we know lol it’s just for fun 
---
As far as being bugged, I can only go by what people have reported, which is that they have had to resort to server hopping to advance though the quest, which I experienced with other in game quests which were in fact bugged and were patched accordingly.
---
I don't care about being right or wrong. I care about the game being enjoyable. If the quest activities are not bugged, then I would gladly be wrong in a reddit post in order to be able to enjoy a fun quest.
---
I just don't personally want to server hop because I would rather be in game.  If other people find server hopping to be fun or the best way to get what they want, then that's great for them.  I just want to be able to accomplish the same objectives by just playing. There are no standards or judgements from me, because how someone else enjoys their game doesn't affect me at all unless they happen to be shooting at me. For all I know, 99.99% of the time, all of the other players could be dancing across the mountaintops in clown costumes, and it still doesn't affect me at all.
---
There is no self righteousness in expressing my preferred gameplay style in a post.  It is my preference, and everyone is entitled to their own. It is perfectly acceptable for others to server hop as much as they want. I just don't ever want to get stuck on a quest that can't be completed unless I server hop. I just don't find it fun, so I want to hope that all quests will work as intended and as expected.
---
I fully respect anyone here who has a different opinion of what is fun or what they enjoy in game, and I can only say that what is right for me is what is right for me. 
---
This was me last night and the day before.  Came back after a month long break or so.  Running around I'm still finding places I missed.
---
Damn commie bastards
---
Enjoy your drill 
---
Cranberry bog , big pools of water will have multiple tar berry , flat woods pools have 2.

Make sure to equip green thumb before picking up

Forget Snowy, I'm on PS4 if you need help.

Ok mr downer. We can hope

It is time ?!

You could have just started playing the drums and poof, out from behind the door. Spoiled their fun.
---
i personally forget what she sounds like, she is very forgetable for what her personality is other than RAIDEEERRRR
---
Same, except absolutely no dailies are popping for me anymore. At higher levels, dailies and events are a huge part of leveling (in my opinion), so this is a big hit.
---
Some do not many lol 
---
I had nearly the same experience, I actually came here to post about my journey.
---
I hated the game and the whole premise of it. Didn't watch YouTube videos of it, didn't read any reviews, I just KNEW it was bad and refused to play it outright.
---
I now see how wrong I was.
---
Fallout 76 is truly fun to me. I understand that it's not for some people, but I wish everyone would at least give it a chance. For me, it's actually better than Fallout 4, and I've only explored about a sixth of the map.
---
The community in the game itself is so positive, I haven't had a bad experience yet, always someone helping me out or waving from the top of another building. It's amazing how friendly people can be without ever saying a word.
---
That's the best thing I've heard!
---
It is indeed bro
---
You can definitely solo one but it might be a little stimpack intense. if it lands, you'll have a good chance. If not, you'll need like a level 35 gatling gun
---
Jog on mate 
---
Makes me wonder what it would be like to have enough points to try any build at any time on the fly. Wanna go str heavy to agi gunslinger ? Done. wanna go charisma farmer ? Done. feeling lucky ? 
---
I've been using the perk loadout manager since it came out.  They just don't support them, so if you use them it's on you to make sure you check after updates and make sure there aren't conflicts. 
---
There's usually info here or on the various mod author pages detailing any issues after a patch.
---
At that level a full suit of power armor is almost mandatory to wander around Whitesprings.  Not only for the defense but the rad resist as well. Otherwise the ghouls will just swarm and destroy you. 
---
I dont think anything has happened yet anyway. 
---
I was just playing 5 min ago and didnt see anything going down. 
---
Agree! Getting the mutations I wanted took quite a bit of it.
---
In a way, it adds more management.  You need to refrigerate food before it spoils (rotating out a maximum amount in the suggestions I've seen).  For FCs, you'd need to manually swap them out before they fully depleted in order to recharge them.  They would, however, reduce the need for scavenging.
---
That used to be me too - I stopped playing on some days after I couldn't sell anymore of the looted good.  These days I just break down most things, drop some of the junk and keep a few legendaries for sale.  Easier to craft/sell certain clothing items for daily caps on days I need it.
---
&gt; so were the storys of the bans fake?
---
The stories of people getting banned for mods were fake. They also don't support mods yet, which means each release you will need to adjust and reset your custom ini.
---
Lots needs to be done about PvP in this game... seen an influx of players returning this week and alot of them seem to be the kind that like to go around and kill people between 5-30 when they are 150+.... 
---
When they add survival mode to the game they need to add a PVE mode to the game... I would like to see a pve mode that has a smaller player limit on the server but larger base limits so people can make settlements.
---
Haha when I said “extra agility” I meant from the low health Adrenal Reaction/Bloodied/Unyielding build. Unyielding armor gives up to +3/all SPECIAL at 20% armor... per piece. So +15 to all stats (except endurance) with 5 pieces. I’ve got something like 14str (from a base of 1, and negative str mutations!), 38 Perception, 36 agility, 34 Luck, plus around 18-20 charisma and intelligence on my stealth/bloodied sniper. 
---
A watched pot never boils, my friends
---
Same here, can’t be heavy combat armour?
---
OP here, from snooping around there don't seem to be many explosive/missile perks. 
---
I intend to have this character focus on grenades and missile launchers, fat men, etc. But I will end up using other heavy weapons like miniguns and the like for when using rockets would make me off myself.
---
... Go on.
---
If you want to escape cavalier armor with similar perk. And more speed and so on.lol
---
Same here. Sometimes my mule account won't show up on the friends list of my main account. However, sometimes it will show up on one of them. I find that fully logging out and back in sometimes fixes it.
---
It is special technical data. So, that makes it techncial. Lol
---
Didn't know, anybody knows which button it does on PC?
---
Really!? Had no idea. 
---
Tbh i didn't even know you could break the door down until then...
---
you must not have BOS Heavy
---
I love how nice everyone has been. It's just such a great and refreshing experience! 
---
I'll just mark this down as another reason to move my camp closer to the Whitespring.

Might be an early XP glitch exploiter or could be someone with a chronic pain condition you just never know. There have been clinical trials that have shown playing video games is a very useful pain management tool as this kind of distraction therapy can take the edge off and reduce the need for strong pain killers over time. I don’t really pay attention to anyone else’s level though  unless it’s a low level and then il drop them some stimpacks and water

Looking through this clearly Marine armor needs a buff. Its supposed to be the next best thing to PA.
---
A burst-charging option like that would be great.  Consume partial cores to accelerate charging.  For balance, maybe we get some loss in the process but it would still be an attractive option.

When you are in your inventory, look to the bottom of the screen. You should see 'Sort' and the respective key press to change the sort order. I know it does on console, not sure if same for PC.

Heavy gun runner here: Max out Ammo Smith and Super Duper cards. I make 190 rns of .50 per batch and Super duper tends to trigger a lot so it doubles the count. Another card you'll need to max out is Stabilized ( Rank 3 = In Power Armor, Heavy Guns gain excellent accuracy and ignore 45% armor) you spend less time shooting the world and more on the target, basically you use less bullets. The trick is shoot less so you want a lot of your heavy gun perks to maximize the guns output. 
---
Ty I'm happy with doing that been using mods since quake 2 days so nothing new when it comes to having to tweak things after updates lol Just didn't want to get banned as when googling to see what Betheda's policy on them is all you get is story's of people getting banned and that 1 paragraph on Betheda's site that is not clear. 
---
The discovering never ends, I’m 600 plus hours in and only found out last week you can get to the top of the tree in tanagra town lol
---
I'm holding off on Speed Demon to see if they adjust the thirst mechanic.  I go through water too fast as it is.  Even with Class Freak maxed, it'll be hard to keep up.  I'll definitely try the Cavalier armor.

BOS is the top rank of the combat armour protection upgrade.

I want sheepsquatch to squatch me like I squatch my family.

No, your correct.

this is true
---
Thank you. I’ve only found the one so far so I’ll keep my eyes open for the other ones. 
---
My build is heavy guns and explosives, which again, is what “heavy/explosives” sounds like to me. There’s nothing (except the throwing arc perk, and that’s 1 point) that’s exclusive to grenades, and it’s got full Stabilized (which works with all the explosive launchers) as well as explosive radius and explosive damage (which again, applies to all the explosive launchers). 
---
Since you’re already going to want to be in PA to benefit from Stabilized,  you might as well take Heavy Weapon perks to go with it- they synergize extremely well. 
---
And again, is there something you think is missing from my build for an explosives focus? Ignoring what you think I’m wasting, what is missing for explosives?
---
Add me. I can help craft you some armor and might have some other pieces in my stash for you.

That would be my mistake then, since I was trying to avoid spoiling the details for myself, and while I saw that there were walkthroughs and video guides, I didn't look at them and instead saw the discussions about frustration and hopping.  I thought that the existence of a walkthrough meant that this was a new quest, so I would be the one guilty of mischaracterizing it.  Not sure what to call the thing now except that it seems to involve several locations and some obstacles that have to be overcome.

"All right, Beatrice, there was no alien. The flash of light you saw in the sky was not a UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and reflected the light from Venus."
---
That's the thing though there isn't supposed to be a clear cut build or strategy until you find the gear you are looking for if you try to spec to early on you may never run across the gear you are looking for. I honestly suggest not trying to spec until lvl 50 on your first toon.

If you have been waiting for it that long, then how is data mining the only way you know it exists?
---
Games are meant to be fun, for multiple audiences. If it isn't fun, it's failed. If the survival aspects keep casual players from exploring, it won't be fun. 
---
It's also meant to be a team game, and if your friend says "sorry, I cannot go into the nuke zone with you, I have to farm fusion cores", that isn't fun either. And when that happens, we hand our friend fusion cores, on a gold platter. This game is trying to be a lot of things to a lot of people.   
---
I hope they add a "hard" option for people who want that, because I agree that the game is easy, but I don't think they'll split the community like that.

Thanks for the response! I love the help you give, thank you so much!
---
Agreed. Too many instances of BS like "a player looked at me and ruined my immersion, I was GRIEFED". 
---
Yeah but if you're playing the game without some sort if worms, are you even really playing? 
---
In a week's time you wont have to server hop and you will get the keycards, key and quantum skin all to yourself.
---
But it is up to you if you want to hop...you really really really dont have to. Its not like its an integral item to progression.
---
There aren't many enemies with poison damage but when it hits and you have no resistance you feel it. 
---
You know that beaver pond to the east of Watoga? There's a patch of them growing there where you should be able to harvest two (or with the Green Thumb perk, 4). There's others scattered around the bog, but those are the easiest ones to locate and collect. 
---
2 of the 3 are correct. I do believe the first 1 is still griefing.  You wont change my mind either way.  
---
Thanks for this.  Is there a level requirement for all armor?  I am only level 16 so trying to figure out what my best options are for staying alive.
---
Drop landmines... like... every square inch of the streets.
---
Brewing fetch quests at least took half an hour. This will be over in 5 minutes or less. 
---
If you're constantly slapping a player that's not fighting back and doesn't have any apparent interest in fighting back, that would be griefing. Smashing camps, well, server hopping is easy enough until they decide to allow pacifist mode to extend to camps.  I agree 100% about workshops though, PVP is a part of claiming them.
---
I don't think a PvE mode is ever going to happen, however if the changes they've talked about making to pacifist happen, you'll essentially be opting into PvE by setting pacifist, because with pacifist you won't even take slap damage and no one will be able to destroy your base.
---
Yup. Any musical instrument or crafting station that gives you the option to interact, you do it and the animation snaps you into place even through a door or window.
---
And if you find yourself in a locked room that way, fast travel out to avoid getting wanted.
---
For some things, yes. Like High Volatage Hefe. Instead of +1 str and +1 chr it will give +3 str and +3 chr. It will NOT however give +45% energy weapon damage. It will just give the base +15% damage. Things like Vintage Nukashine will not be affected by Cola Nut or Party Boy because it doesn't have base SPECIAL stats or flat stats like +HP. 
---
That sounds like fun!!
---
No not really. I hadn't known that there was a BoS Heavy Combat Armor for a few days ago but the problem is. How do you get that? The Polymer is basically slightly better than the study/light BoS Conbat Armor pieces from what I know.
---
literally unplayable xdddddddd
---
If things like this weren't stored client-side, then there would be no data to mine.
---
I was stunned when I found out that you need the higher end PA just to beat the scores of regular armour.  
---
Depending on a PA chassis early on for the extra damage protection and carry weight is quite a trap to fall in to.
---
What platform?
---
XB1

Never knew raider chest DR could get so high. Thanks for your hard work guys!
---
Stap it wit the truee
---
Same here I have never found anything stronger than my 3 star metal chest and it's at 11X resistance, can't remember the exact number
---
Not much bothers me, but picking on weaker players when unprovoked pisses me off like no other.  I'm hoping PvP will eventually balance out with future changes.
---
Who's the guy that made that spreadsheet? He is offering weapons to trade/sell.

You can still eat it and get the benefit from it, but you gain no food sustenance from eating.

Lv66 on xbox and lv58 IRL.  If your ever by Alpha Site A look for a three story building, that will be my camp. I built the second floor for any player that needs it.  It has all the crafting stations, a stash box and 4 beds.  There is a brewing station on the first floor behind a keypad door.  You will need to find a way in to you it. There is also a water purifier out back.

I would love to have a BOS insignia on my Ultracite power armor

Sent u a friend request accept it an ill buy 
---
Well there could be two explanations. First is that they found a location to drop their camp on the edge of a town and built into the town area, or there is some exploit that allows them to place their camp anywhere.
---
Do you have any screenshots or more details?
---
I could certainly try something like this, but as mentioned, this game isn't meant for clear cut defined builds with cookie cutter Special and Perk sheets. 
---
Are you looking more for general advice on what you can do and viable or synergize well?
---
It does but the heavy Combat Polymer set is slightly better than the Light/sturdy   BoS combat armor.
---
Out of PA yes, but in PA I can face up to the Queen and take her full melee hits while I stab her in the face. 
---
It helps to have serendipity and autostim working though.
---
I like to get a 1000 cap bounty to bait players into PvP. I *want* high level bounty hunters on  my tail. It is exciting. Its fun. Its been advertised since launch!
---
Can you recommend amother way of getting a 1000 cap bounty? A bounty big enough to make people want to pay to fast travel to me &amp; hunt me?
---
Yes man! We will be launching few a fews hours! We started launching 30 mins ago! Probs Jew it going until 7-8pm UK time 
---
Abusing buzzwords is the new endgame.
---
Griefing has and will always be a valid form of PvP to me.
---
That being said the absolute definition of griefing : "A griefer or bad faith player is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game (trolling), using aspects of the game in unintended ways."
---
The key wording in there is "unintended ways" so I hate to break it to most of the subreddit but that means shooting you isn't griefing, even if I kill you without you fighting back as that's an intended mechanic.
---
Any prepackaged food good is not affected by Carnivore or Herbivore.  You can have either mutation and eat them.
---
So yes, a carnivore can eat dandy boy apples just like a herbivore can eat Salisbury steak.
---
This is Polymer heavy Combat Armor full set but I have never tried comparing the stats with the BoS heavy Combat Armor since I hadn't come across them yet.
---
I've seen the brawlers mod when I'm using knuckles but not when I'm using a deathclaw or moleminers gauntlets. 
---
Don’t give them ideas &gt;&gt; 
---
Have your friends set up a camp and you destroy it. Easy. 
---
In defense of that (a weak one, I’ll admit), I don’t think they actually have in-game lore telling you how to do 75% of the quest yet. The only piece of lore that I have seen anywhere is the note telling you where to find the keys (vaguely).
---
Maybe the quests from rose? I’m not sure what level it didn’t give the raider armor to me but you can try that if you havent
---
I don't think that there will be an update, everything is already in the game and probably will be just "activated" when the time comes
---
I will be on all evening 
---
you can get the plans for heavy CA from a few events or maybe even a vendor. can't remember which one. you might can buy them off one of the 2 reddit marketplaces too. hope that helps :)

Yea it is haha, I won it from a twitch giveaway 
---
Awesome I should definitely be able to make the last 1 or 2

I just thought this exact thing this morning.

Oh, yeah I don't think you found anything new here this is pretty pointless information

Smash up somebody's workshop?

[Ranger District Office](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Ranger_District_Office)

I was a hater from the beginning.  Before the beta and before the negative reviews.  No npcs, people trying to call it an mmo based on the "massive" map size rathe than on the "massive" simultaneous players,  as building that disappears when you log off.  All sounded horrible to me.  So I didn't play for the first month or so and was satisfied to see the outrage over it.  Tried it out eventually and kept playing.  It was still pretty buggy then but not nearly as bad as people made it out to be.
---
Didn't get the chance, was only going on for half an hour to sell my junk.  
---
Not sure I would have spawned back into another nuke zone though.
---
Yes. You're a heathen and you should feel bad about it. /S
---
Same me and friend was up near the water park last night he just started playing so I made another character to play with him we was around level 11 doing the quests no events going on at the time and this level 181 and 243 players showed up and killed us we repawned thinking might of been a mistake nope killed us again...there was no real reason for them to be there other than them coming to kill us... so we server hopped.
---
Slap damage? No. Constant harassment with slap damage, even after being informed  that the "victim" isn't interested?
---
That's griefing. You're literally spending your time trying to make another players' experience worse.
---
Using legit mechanics as intended, is NOT griefing. ABUSING those same mechanics, or intentionally using them to harass someone else is. 
---
i.e. Spawn camping in games is perfectly allowable though mechanics. Spawn camping and headshotting every noob as they emerge is scumbag griefing.
---
if someone wants to play the game you play? So be it. Have fun. If someone says "nah man, I'm cool the way I am, you have fun someewhere else"... then there you have it. 
---
It's very lore friendly to see less people than at launch because inevitably people would die after leaving the vault for one reason or another. Look at the others that came before us completely wiped out as far as we know. The wasteland would feel more empty and would be left with the vault dwellers good and bad that managed to survive. And the only time you see more people is when their collected at an event or settlement. Also in terms of gameplay I agree it is nice to see more people playing again. 👍🏻
---
The only thing I'd argue is using a workshop to kill a player who isn't even at the workshop, just to get some caps, is kinda shitty behavior.  I know of people who literally server hop, look for claimed workshops, and abuse that system to farm caps.  That's borderline griefing in my book.
---
I'd also include anyone who uses unkillable builds.  They can't lose... so whats the point in attacking other players other than to steal caps.  When the victim has ZERO recourse, that kinda spells greifing.
---
To each their own though, block em, server hop, and keep rolling.
---
What time is the game going down 
---
Do we have a time frame for fasnacht or is it pushed off until tomorrow?
---
Uh, wasn't the door thing fixed in this last patch?
---
Even a hint? Just the biome? Any information you'd like to know? I'm willing to barter lol.
---
R/whoosh
---
I was up close and personal, melee, Tesla rifle and shotgun, and Tesla torso so anything rushing me was automatically tagged.
---
Slap damage? Unfortunate part of being in pacifist mode that will hopefully be taken away.
---
Workshops? Suck it up, you took a workshop, you're saying you're down to PVP.
---
Destroying someone's camp, just because you can? You're griefing and an asshole.**
---
**Unless the camp is behind the golf club at Whitespring, then Hulk...smash
---
Nah, i play solo, love it.
---
It’s 180, and super duper only doubles the base value (100, so 280 if it procs)
---
Good combo
---
World loot has never respawned upon entering an area, as far as I have noticed since beta. And I don’t think it should. You should not be able to continuously farm the same area by leaving and coming back. I don’t even feel it should be that way for farming spawns (but I do farm ticks at the moonshiners shack and lumbar yard). 
---
As far as no one being around the area, with being able to fast travel, it may not seem like anyone is around, but if they could have taken the fusion cores and then fast traveled to the next. A lot of people farm them. 
---
That was the worst bit, had a shit ton of raw flux and 4 pieces of hardened mass.
---
I'll tell you the same thing I tell my co-workers:  My crystal ball is in the shop.
---
The future is all around us, waiting in moments of transition, to be born in moments of revelation. No one knows the shape of that future or where it will take us. We know only that it is always born in pain.

Under that big bridge, south side in a room, you can get lvl 15 raider PA.  You need a key that you get on top of the roller coaster at Camden Park.
---
Here's hoping!
---
That's a very good point.  Sometimes just stumbling across a weapon changes everything.  
---
Working on a second character I realized the first 20-30 level ups aren't too important.  But levels 35-50 start getting more important.  For instance, Hacker might seem important now, but that point might be better applied in Perception.  After all, hacking can usually wait.  Or, mutations need 5 Luck points...might want to plan for that.
---
Agreed. I really loathe server hopping, there's absolutely no joy to it, but there does seem far too many instances where it's a necessity.
---
It is way more fun with my friends for sure, but they don't enjoy the game as much as I do so I play solo mostly. It's still fun solo but friends really enhance the experience. 
---
By accident? You never know when you may get jumped by a random stingwing when you are up looking for a midnight snack. 
---
In Fallout 4, when we could actually decorate properly, I would stash weapons all over my hideout. Just in case. 
---
Armor weight also affects sneak.  So if you're playing a stealthy character, you probably want to stick to the lighter armors.
---
Mine was - I didn't have to move my camp or rebuild the wall/door or anything...
---
Hell yeah! Omw
---
same here
---
Gotta pump those ripper numbers up
---
....wut? \*cries tears of joy and embarrassment\*
---
Remember the displayed bounty is *half* the actual bounty.
---
It takes smashing 4 CAMPS yo get a 1000 cap bounty. On 99% of serves there wont be enough things to smash on all the workshops combined to get the kind of bounty im looking for.
---
Lol why would that be a thing? Most of these comments automatically assume it's a new change

[According to this official page, it should start on March 19th (today).](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2Pt0vzS8LLqzvSsNw3n98/inside-the-vault-fasnacht-seasonal-event-and-patch-7-preview)
---
I'm not seeing any new updates regarding when it will start in their twitter feeds...but I'm bad at twitter.
---
There's a wooden fighting arena, in the raider camp, just North/North east of the top of the world, always spawns a PA with raider parts on it and also just outside Blackwater mine often spawns raider power armor
---
Its RNG what brewing recipes you get. Just like you can get the same plans from doing workshop events, you can get duplicate recipes from Bivs daily.
---
I hope it gets delayed. Dead by Daylight is releasing a new chapter and i'm all over it.
---
I just bought this for Xbox One yesterday. I spent about 3 hours on it last night and had a great time. Much better than I was expecting. I'm looking to playing some more tonight

Haha yup it gets expensive on the materials end though.

2x the benefits with no chance of getting a disease.

Yikes, I'm level 250 and having philosophical problems with how much of my life I'm wasting in this game...
---
In all seriousness,  they probably just did the "disarm trap" glitch a ton when the game first came out.
---
Where? 
---
Yeah, it's two completely different worlds. I'm just used to toxic people by now, but seeing how nice people here can be is what surprises me
---
no response from them on twitter across all of the associated accounts
---
I know you!
---
I was wondering this as well. Guess I need to go out gathering today. 
---
I was still having the issue happen myself.
---
Been there for a VERY VERY long time. Hasn't been fixed yet.. doubt it will be fixed soon.
---
Grahm was basically my neighbour when I camped near Greg's Mining. He passed by everyday. Nowadays I live in the Ash Heap and don't see him much.
---
Seems like so many people would rather listen to garbage reviews or youtubers that dont even know how to play the game.

I’ve played since beta. The game has improved quite noticeably since then.Now that there is developer communication it seems to be running much more smoothly.

Glad you decided to join us!

What do you mean?

No, no, please don't worry -- the journey is the point, not the destination.

The enemies had raw flux on them? That only comes from nuked flora. And hardened mass is there for every player first come first serve. Always has been

I’ve not found any vendors that buy but it’s a fairly decent rate 
---
Do you know which vendor?
---
Those "unkillable" builds are extremely susceptible to automatic rifles ;) If you manage to lock on to them in VATS it's all over for them. 
---
PSN?
---
Got to love how they don't give you any sort of indication of when it's going to happen. Maybe it's getting delayed like the last one did they just haven't mentioned it yet.
---
Nice one bro
---
Lol PvP is about contesting you opponents. What's wrong with the PvP right now is you have to wait for contesters to hit you before you can do any damage. And with one shot kills your just a sitting duck. Especially one shot meele kills, it's so comical. That is getting fixed with PvP Servers. Looking forward to it. They just have to buff some OP armor sets and perk builds. And we are good to go. By the way Bethesda should definitely add some safe zones in PvP servers around the trading. 
---
Thank you ihaven't had the time to wrap my head around the armor I've been collecting/selling 
---
Upstanding West Virginian. 
---
Thanks for the offer, but I've made finding it myself my personal quest.
---
Go to a Tinker bench and under the Quest Items section you should be able to do so
---
Unkillable builds?
---
Nice Spot and Camp, very wastelandish 
---
This is my exact train of thought. Like you said, considering the model already exists for the Mark 4. I know they did a similar thing with some outfits from 4 in the atomic shop.
---
I suppose I'm just trying to think of things I would like to have in the store as I has a load of atoms and nothing I really want to spend them on right now. 
---
The burden is on the pacifist to server hop. I can SLAP them all day and it isnt griefing. 
---
They are choosing to opt out of PvP. The mechanic they were given to avoid PvP is block/severhop. 
---
Use the tools you were given. It isnt griefing.
---
Its not harassment unil i chase you to the server you hopped to. 
---
"Damn, I wish I won the lottery so I could play that much"
---
I did the weeklies in a day...how are they too daunting?
---
The only one i disagree with is 3. As i understand  (feel for to correct me if i'm incorrect) it it's an abuse of a poorly implemented mechanic. The spirit of the mechanic as I interpret it is PvP is enabled so the attacking player can claim the workshop. 
---
If the attacking player has no intention of taking the workshop or makes any serious attempt of taking the workshop and is following the defending player around map Just to keep killing them repeatedly. In my opinion I'd say that is griefing
---
&gt; Workshop PvP *Anywhere* on the map. 
---
This one is probably bug. Outside the workshop area, you are not supposed to take full damage.
---
i think it's watoga and harper's ferry.. but i do remember reading they were glitched or something about 2 patches ago. haven't tried myself so not sure
---
Yeah, they should be mad at the guy that data mined a quest. Then posted the video. That's 100% the reason the plans are going so fast
---
I thought the same thing. It all farm for the mats for alcohol and screw your build on some for atoms. Leave no time for the event that is suppose to start sometime today. 
---
You can build at the edges of a few places, flatwoods for sure. If there's a specific town/city you want to build near, just take out the place camp thing, and check the where it would be possible
---
Yeah when I dc'd,  I went directly there instead of using the transmitters
---
&gt; The thing is, the nuka cola t51 paint is a per server spawn too, but getting the key is a guarantee as long as you follow the path.
---
And it is so rage inducing to get the Quantum passkeys and code, use them, and see an empty pedistal. Start over at square 1 on another server. Again.  
---
Even making me just get a new one time code would be acceptable. but invalidating both cards on an empty chamber??? Someone needs to be kicked in the jimmy for that one.
---
Sorry I'm not trying to be a dick 
---
Hang on I have a solution. What if they added medium to long range melee weapons, say telegraph poles? Maybe a really long whip? That way even the melee folks can get involved in the watoga whack-a-bot
---
Probably involves a lot of KY jelly.
---
Yes, Fireproof is a must have perk for pvp.
---
I would like to buy acoustic instruments, marine wetsuit, and marine tactical helmet. What's that cost?
---
Usually you can’t grief during an event quest because you’re all on a team.
---
&gt; It is a pretty small window of time if you fast travel. The time between you generating a code and using the code is less than 5 minutes, depending on loading times. 
---
Time to hide out in the mansion and generate codes every time someone fast travels away.....
---
Your story makes me wonder why you had only slap damage but the only time I ever had a workshop contested the guy one-hit me. Twice. I can't seem to figure out the metrics of pvp, how much armor will help or how similar your weapon damage is when compared to game enemies... 
---
Now if only it was stioll possible to get BoS armor plans. It seems they were wiped since the last two patches. And I also never got any piece from an event. 
---
Drills and syringers are legendary loot, buddy!
---
Im allowed to get a bounty. Its a game machanic. Its encouraged. I would argue that you calling me an asshole is worse. 
---
This is the misinformation im talking about. 
---
I *use* the bounty i gain from smashing your camp for profit. 
---
You are wrong. Plain and simple. Please try to understand the game youre playing. Not the game you *wish* you were playing. 
---
Also in the Bed &amp; Breakfast nearish to Whitespring.
---
This is a special case but there is a magazine I believe that has a benefit of lower weapon crafting costs. That combined with Curator, Super Duper, Scrapper, and an intelligence bobblehead could help curb crafting costs.
---
Most of the things like this and multiplayer limitations are from trying to make an engine not designed for MMO be an MMO.
---
I'm in helvetia right now and all of them immediately just popped in
---
No one has been confirmed banned for mods. I have like 12 mods running, and i've been playing since beta.
---
If this happens I want an electrified one as well! I will run around yelling Pika...chu!
---
A griefer uses aspects of a game in unintended ways to harass other players.  
---
There's a Perk card called "Wrecking ball" that  makes you deal +120% damage to camps, there's nothing else to say.  
---
I agree. I like doing challenges because its almost like new content in a way. They give me something to do or work towards. But some of the grindy challenges just aren't fun.
---
tHIs DoESN't mAkE YOur pOST InTeREsTiNG
---
Very true
---
Y'know, that's ***exactly*** the kind of Crazy Raider-esque Wasteland Hoarder vibe I want for my camp. Nice! :D
---
There is no right answer, as it depends greatly on your build &amp; playstyle.
---
Lever Action has better per/shot damage, but Handmade has the best DPS due to rate of fire.
---
Bloodied is the most Powerful, Provided your below 40% health (about to die)
---
Two Shot is still good, as it adds 25% damage to every shot
---
Instigating Doubles the damage for the 1st shot on anything over 80% health
---
Furious Stacks an additional 6%/shot, 36% max damage, if you don't miss the same target (Best on Automatics)
---
Anti-Armor is great on enemies with High resistance, but gets no other boost besides that, and most rifles can use a piercing mag.
---
As a Stealth/Sniper Build, I prefer the Instigating/Explosive weapons for most activities, the TSE Handmade is still my weapon of choice when dealing with large numbers, or bullet sponges, and for Major Battles, (SBQ) I bring a Prime TSE 50 Cal &amp; a Furious Exp. Gatling Gun.
---
The video isnt the bad part. It's the fact that the guy data mined the steps.turning a time consuming, interesting quest into 4 fast travels....
---
Did you get it half off in Tennessee at the Walmart closing down sale?
---
One thing I've noticed is that sometimes when no legendary loot spawns, if I go into the Transfer menu for the corpse the item will show up there (but won't show if just going into the loot menu by mousing over a corpse).
---
But I have also had Legendaries with no legendary loot at all post-patch even after going back (and no drills, flares, syringers, etc..)
---
Yay! It begins
---
Yeah, i never go AFK while interacting with a vendor. 
---
In fact, I tend to take a long time at vendors - trying to be thorough :)  But when someone else walks in, I usually back out and let them have the vendor if I know I'm going to be a while.
---
"We're still preparing..." says the robot.
---
Yeah, it is harassment. You can tell yourself it isn't all day long... but it is.
---
Look, you come charging at me, guns blazing, while I'm looting a chest? All good. I'll emote "confusion", and back away.
---
You follow my ass to the next house, the next town, and the next, and the next... that's griefing, period. Go find someone into playing "your game". I'm not giving you what you want, so go find someone who will. 
---
New items in the atom shop as well! 
---
Same here
---
How did it take your 4 hours. I got it for both my characters in 7 total tries
---
What'chu mean? Thats a lot better than what a pair of boners, spoiled meat and raw fertilizer from a bitchin scorched beast. I swear those things are like the in game equivalent of my future sister in law, annoying trolls with obnoxiously hi pitched voice. 
---
There’s wasp nest in some buildings now 
---
I hate work I hate work I hate work 😫
---
Agreed I constantly seem to have more fusion cores than I need. They're hardly hard to find in either power armor or fusion generators.
---
There are no "unkillable builds" in this game... And PvP builds are few, with always the same cards...
---
Now I want to find some good vanguard's robot limbs. My current set of legendary armor grants me a good 300+ resistances at full health, pretty close to power armor levels
---
I'm in Australia, so I won't be playing till tomorrow night. Once someone does it can they let me know if it's going to be a daily or an event that can just be done over and over again. I want all those masks
---
I hope, in the future, they allow minor cliping and provide more stuff. Then we can build the ultimate junkyard. :)
---
Sometimes, it can take for the server to send the legenday item data.    
---
I get this laggy thing on a regular basis: I kill a  NPC \*\*\*, get a junk on him, and after 2-10 secs, the legendary item pops his inventory.
---
Hahahahahahaha if you were wrong it would be one thing, but your so correct. 
---
I cant even travel to sunny top anymore without multiple scorch beast raining hell as soon as I spawn 
---
That's why I was hoping to get some insight.  I have no idea what happened.  Or if I just wasn't paying attention and they were trying to fight us until they got bored from us not attacking and took the workshop to force us. 
---
I was just thinking I wanted a lever action skin like the 44
---
Same here, excited to see the behemoth was 3 star. . dropped no legendary, not even a drill or syringer.  What a let down. ..
---
Are regions isolated to separate servers?
---
This is correct.  I know my DR is 104 when I take my BoS heavy chest to 200%
---
Had this happen to me yesterday. I'd settle for an AA drill at least. 
---
LEVER RIFLE NEW SKIN ! HOLLYYYY FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
---
I agree that "griefing" is overused. I limit the term griefing to sadism; activities done for the pleasure of harming others. 
---
Since I cannot see into an attacker's mind to determine intent, I have to assume that activities that harm others without producing material benefit for one-selves are sadistically motivated, therefore griefing. Similarly, I must assume that rewarded activities are merely a response to incentives, therefore PVP. 
---
I don't have that problem because I'm eating and drinking beverages, sups and meet all the time naturally to gain the bonus effect that are very good. Take it to the next lvl.
---
The unintelligence is real.
---
They used to be doable in a day.  
---
Now to complete 1 challenge you often have complete 3 challenges out of a list of 5 options, each of which used to be a challenge on it's own.
---
I couldn't complete some because I didn't have enough recipes to make the required drinks.  I still have too few recipes - even seeing Biv daily.
---
And there are more group challenges - I'm almost always solo.
---
The point if raiding is profit...
---
There's a lever action skin available!? Is it any good?
---
Would have gotten more but my paranoid friend made us get off the road because he heard someone coming. 
---
Turned out to be a good idea in the end. 
---
I just want a full set of decent light combat armor. I have a mash up of random shit and a giant raider chest piece that would be 100% impractical in real life. 
---
get rid of all your mods, that's what I had to do
---
I will pass....you're not interested in changing your mind. You're just interested in arguing your point of view to, in your own words, "educate" us common uneducated PvE players.
---
If you’re on Xbox I can sell you some.  I think I have 500. 
---
Ah, you sound like the kinda of guy who sets up a large bounty and then hands off all your caps so you dont have to pay it in the end
---
Where is that on the map?
---
Has it dropped yet?
---
hahahahah Zilochias lmfao slayin unintelligence like saint
---
Kills legendary and waits .000025 of a second for loot to spawn and then bitches about it.
---
Here is your attention you wanted.
---
Nah you're just an asshole. Plain and simple. You're definitely not changing my mind about that
---
Yet here you are. Shall I change it for you? It's meant to imply idiocy - that to bethesda a drill is legendary loot despite there being no legendary effect, no little sound effect that plays, no modifier, and them having stated quite clearly that they 'addressed' the issue of all legendary creatures now dropping legendary loot. It's not about it being interesting. 
---
Interested in that 3 Star Black Powder Rifle! How much are you asking for it? (:
---
Heck yeah it matches the sniper uniform nicely
---
can confirm. killed a legendary yesterday with no drop.
---
Im on pc and i asked for places to find. But thanks for the offer still.
---
Neat, I was pretty close. Didnt realize metal armor was so viable though!
---
Is it dependent on how much you destroy?  Or is the bounty the same whether it's 1 wall or the whole structure?
---
New Atomic shop items including a free emblem
---
Sadly, no. Should be an update when it does is what I’m assuming. This was just for fun.  Checked my map and saw a group of people had to see for myself 
---
1 - As soon as the workshop is contested and it does not matter where you  are. If they find you on the map, one person can contest it and the other can be standing next to you (or teammates) across the map and you turn red. 
---
2 - Yes as soon as they take it over. The mechanics are a little screwy here though so don't trust it until you see they are no longer red. I've contested a workshop and the person died and did not come back. I didn't want it, I just wanted to fight so I let it go back to them. A few minutes later a nuke is dropped on Queen and that person is there red. I decide not to engage but they light me up so I return fire and kill them. They came back red despite never seeing a message that they sought revenge. That could be queen nuke zone lag though...
---
3 - Here's a few tips:
---
A - Don't use power armor, I kill those people first because I know they are squishy targets.
---
B - DR/ER doesn't mean nearly as much as damage mitigation from perks like Blocker, Dodgy and Serendipity or legendary armor affects like Assassin's, Cavalier's and Sentinel.
---
C - Never fight melees using stealth boys, especially bloodied. Accept your first death and move on. I've killed many people in PVP and as soon as the stealth boys pop off, I start spamming mine and/or bail. I never thought I'd support a nerf but stealth boys are badly in need of one. From the other side of that equation, I've killed entire teams multiple times while using them. It can be very frustrating when you're the target.
---
D - Get Berry Mentats for chameleon or the above (if you really want to stick around). That said, they are bugged occasionally with stealth boys. This still work most of the time and the enclave sells the recipe. The ingredients are readily available in the forest. I have 330 muled that I made over a couple days with minimal effort.
---
E - Staggers are the easy way to kill Assassin's/Sentinel or Assassin's Cavalier users. Depending on how quickly they can stim, I can kill most in one magazine with VATS crits. Heavy weapons and shotguns can also stagger pretty easily.
---
F - Avoid being VATS by crouching when possible. As a stealth VATS commando, I can crit many times in one 25 round magazine. My friends hear the constant crits going off over party chat and we know to concentrate fire on those targets during staggers.
---
G - If an event is going off at a workshop (eg restart a power plant), you will need to go into your pipboy and reject the quest in order to VATS anyone else around you. I learned this the hard way and thought it was a bug. It's actually a feature so you don't accidentally tag others while doing events together.
---
H - Don't assume you can easily kill someone below your level. Depending on the build and equipment you can be lethal between 40-70. We have a blooded/berserker UA guy who was one shotting people in power armor around level 40. He also dies a lot because he' a glass cannon but it shocks a lot of high level people who ignore him at their own peril. The other side of that coin is not to expect ever level 200+ can PVP. When they come at you in Excavator you know you just earned easy caps.
---
I - Many people mule caps so when they die they lose nothing. It's cheap but it happens. I killed a level 275 at least 8 times and he killed me (lvl 165) once and I lost caps in that exchange. I was too dumb to bail after the first couple kills.
---
J - Never be salty. You can make great friends with someone whose butt you just kicked or vice versa. 
---
What? What's that about me waiting for loot? That's just where I ended the clip. I didn't loot it until I went and got my wife to show here. I sat there for probably 15 seconds, left the corpse and came back - still just a drill and the junk.
---
Helvetia 
---
Has anyone gotten an event yet?
---
I had a ghoul drop 4 legendary items everytime I made my rounds at white springs.  I made 3 trips around before the server crashed. He was in the parking lot building. But 4 items everytime..
---
I was more commenting on the overall problem of server hopping for loot.
---
Did they bring the servers down first\`?
---
that would be funny if it happened randomly
---
OR
---
wake up with a bunch of scrap like you broke into a joint and looted the place.
---
This isn't only in Watoga. This is all over the place.
---
Excavator Skin!
---
50% is taxed by the game. 
---
I like having a bounty.
---
If it has a perk card for it I'd hardly call it "unintended".
---
You and I have debated some things on here before but I agree for the most part that the definition of griefing this sub uses is too liberal and in most times incorrect. 
---
They are using one word incorrectly to describe someone being an asshole. 
---
Like someone posted below the definition of griefing is using game things in unintended ways.  Most raiders don't do this.  It's as the developers intended. 
---
However, breaking someone's CAMP to build a bounty is something an asshole would do.  You might not be griefing but you're still an asshole. The majority of players don't want this even if it is what was intended by Bethesda.
---
A lot of high level players don't even engage in PVP in the endgame.  We go around helping newer players because its fun and makes us feel good.  
---
We can get caps from other things instead of growing bounties to entice other players so we can kill them 5-6 times.  PVP is lucrative, but I'd rather get my caps from grinding vendors and im level 135.
---
While what you're doing might not be griefing,  most players are still going to complain about it because in 5 minutes you can destroy what took us hours to collect.  Now that time is wasted and we have to go do it again. 
---
For obvious reasons, this is unfun. 
---
I just don't think Bethesda had a hand on the pulse of what the majority of the playerbase wanted.  They wanted to dip their hand in the cash cow of things like Fortnite and its backfired majorly. 
---
So destroying camps makes you an asshole. You're roleplaying as a raider though, and raiders are assholes. 
---
Seriously? Wait where else has 3 star legendary bots?
---
Is your user name a scrubs reference or the band? Cuz the band is amazing. 
---
Haha this happened to me in watoga last night. Nothing more rewarding than a power drill.
---
Damn it! I've been waiting for anything to get online. Hopefully it drops soon
---
Haha that's great
---
Did you own a workshop anywhere on the map?
---
You just came up with the new buzzword!  Immersive Griefing.  
---
Two options from what I've been reading:
---
* Having a high level escort you through a few runs of Whitesprings with a nuke zone active. The XP from those ghouls is still pretty good at a low level.
---
* Running every questline and event you can do.
---
* There are some food items and stuff you can get that'll give you small boosts to XP as well.
---
oh fuck this whole time i was stressin over making disease cures.
---
Brain fungus tends to grow where decomposing things are, that's crimson, and you can find a ton close together where the dumpsters are.
---
Yes this is true!  Without considering the many, many other factors that go into stealth, armor weight seems to be a pound-by-pound tradeoff so balancing armor weights with resistances is important to having a successful sneaky character. You can run naked but I suspect that point of stealth perks is to allow players to make better tradeoffs i.e. wear heavier armor. 
---
I don't know the weights for everything offhand but my guess is that most stealth characters can run ultralight sturdy armor with the right stealth perks and get a very acceptable % of max resistances while maintaining a very high level of stealth.  Maybe one could even run sturdy frame and do heavy ultralight armor. That's a smarter tradeoff IMO then running light because there might be a point at which the benefits of lighter armor don't outweigh the costs of less resistance. I know personally wearing light armor made it really hard for me to stay alive in a lot of situations.
---
Do you have 1000 caps to pay that bounty? If you do it's legit playing. If you are racking up a bounty but don't have the caps, it's griefing imo. 
---
Sausage and donuts in some of the buildings too!!! Ahhhhhh!!!!
---
Bought the Pose Pack, Nice value
---
I've had a couple explode immediately, but not every time.  During my last run through watoga, I ran  into 3 legendaries.  One didn't explode at all, one exploded well after dying (I had already looted and moved on) and the last exploded immediately after I killed it.
---
Im at work.  Can you be more descriptive 
---
If it's so rare that you've only ever found one I suppose this post is till helpful.
---
whats in it?
---
already bought the lever action skin :)
---
I am 12,000 miles away from my PS4 so can’t.  Anything good?
---
screws too
---
I’m struggling for adhesive right now, not sure about other stuff though. It’s a nightmare, I’m either running out of screws or glue 😂
---
oK tHAnk YOU 4 yoUr iNPuT oN tHiS.
---
Wow you guys thought way harder than I did about my comment, obviously. I knew I was stretching with the irony bit, but can you explain how it wasn't irony? English was never my strong suit in school, 20 years ago. Also I live in the Appalachian mountains soooo, yeah probably explains a bit to lol
---
Maybe because Bethesda didn't intend for people to borrow other's suits, end the quest and THEN try to download the plans as you were supposed to do that before even having a suit?
---
Also found an “Appalachia Freeze” cooler! Looked like the old school Igloo coolers!
---
Rofl ok ive been laughing for 10 minutes. I imagine hiding behind a bus with Professor Farnsworth giant finger poking the boom boom bots to death
---
My recent experience has been that if I kill a legendary among a group of other kills, often the legendary drop won't appear in the inventory of the actual kill but will instead show up in the inventory of one of the other random kills at the same site. Odd, stupid, but in my case, predictable.
---
I have really been wondering about Trapper lately for a stealth sniper. The only thing that really messes with me are the occasional unavoidable rad exposure in places like glassed cavern.  Can you mod trapper with ultralight?
---
can someone please upload some screenshots for those at work, all im seeing is text of how cool items are
---
Im at max caps from raiding. I make 5k caps in less than 3 hours...
---
Nope. Good on them.
---
Can't wait! Can't participate until about 9:30 - 10:00. 
---
Ah kk, I’m level 126 never found this place 
---
You missed the best armour in the game, pillows attached to your nipples using car wheel clamps
---
Hmmm... something productive to do While AFK
---
If you're on xbox msg me.  I've got around 30 in my stash that I honestly don't need.  I'll sell some for cheap.
---
PM me i can help you
---
I hope they hand out donuts...oh wait that's fastnacht day...dammit
---
Learn the game before you say ignorant shit here.

I'm working on a video for my bloodied heavy weapons build - basically the best dps you can do in the game while also remaining relatively safe.

The build is here:

It spawns in the world. Try the park range headquarters in the cranberry bog.
---
Do you know how many Atoms it costs?
---
This never happens to me after the most recent patch 
---
^^ 
---
Yes, help us wage slaves out people! 
---
Old Man Summer Mask, a pose bundle, paint job for the Excavator Power Armor and Wooden Inlay Paint for Lever Action (looks pretty nice)
---
I can respect that.
---
I agree, some kind of heads up would be nice. 
---
I know your house.  Orbital's incoming.
---
I don't think it benefits from 1 handed or two handed perks. Only general melee and general damage perks.
---
You are now tagged as "evil rat bastard" :-)
---
All of this could have been fixed by having the plans in an instanced container.
---
Then technically anything is ok and none of it is griefing. See how stupid that sounds, even chasing people to other servers is ok.    
---
Causing grief to a player by means of destruction or verbal abuse is what I would call griefing.  Destroying a persons camp, just for the sake of attaining a high bounty, to get people to engage in PVP is greifing.  Most people don't want to participate in that.  And forcing others to participate by destroying their CAMP is griefing.  Sorry, you wont change my mind.  SO you are right there is nothing left for you to say. bye
---
&gt;ng the servers down f
---
No - servers have been up all day

How is this still a thing?? How hard is it to chance one database entry?

800.

What about when somebody smashes my camp because I refuse to trade with them?

That mask is disturbing, I want it.

Okay. Thanks!

I'd collected a load of flora while I was killing stuff then couldn't get any hardened mass to craft it with.

Cool!

That’s okay! Now you’ll know just in time for the parade!

Question 1: PvP starts the second someone start taking over. That apply to the contester or his entire team.
---
Good news everyone I've invented a solution to the exploding bots. Careful though you'll have bender quaking in his shiny metal ass
---
👍Nice pose bundle👍 I like the 2 thumbs up pose
---
I'm glad too!!

Are the lever or excavator paints limited time only?
---

interesting... I'll have to try that out.
---
I've run into a few that one shot you but no dmg can be done to them after 30% or so health.  I've always used big slow hits though, never automatic.
---
wage slave checking in, will upvote for screenshots of new content.
---
Yes.
---
Thank you for the update!
---
Do you think we will get an update to start the event we have to download?
---
1. Open PVP occurs the moment they pay to contest.
---
2. It should take you out of PVP mode. I have seen many times in the past people respawning, running into the workshop, and unable to contest anymore. Something might have changed with the most recent patch, however. I have noticed many many people running right back into the workshops and dying immediately. Usually I check the map to see if they respawned nearby or sought revenge, but they have not been showing up lately.
---
3. I do not know of any guides. My personal advice would be to save a safe room schematic which protects your fast travel mat and build it immediately upon taking a workshop. Also try to max out the budget without using your own supplies. There have been times where I did not PVP people because it cost 100 caps to contest and they only awarded 80 caps. Crouch a lot too. When crouched, you do not show up on the map and cannot be targeted by Vats unless they shoot you first. Typically, I rush to a workshop when I see a high level player sitting in there.
---
4. It is hard to say which is best. It depends on your build and the situation. I use weightless stuff now so I can remain invisible with my chameleon mutation. Not being shot at all works for me.
---
36hours??? You still have dial up???

I sent you a friend request, I reckon it's either "Rolnik" or  "Nagz"
---
Wow youve farmed a lot
---
Didn't mean to imply that it wasn't, sorry of it came off that way.
---
I'm assuming it's probably a reference to old sulphur springs having a reputation for being "healing waters", that's clever :D
---
Doing the quests offers a good amount of XP. Its basically designed to get you to 50.
---
The other way I seem to level up the most is a nuked WS run over and over. This obviously only works if the sever is busy with people coming and going  ghouls will respawn fairly quickly. If not you would need to pick 2 or 3 good spots and run them back to back a bunch. 
---
Watoga/surroundings is another run itself with endless XP.
---
I like DANGER and I stand up and no one is around. Game knows danger when it sees it
---
you sir are a damn hero!  that lever action is by far hype worthy
---
Get a hazmat suit.  
---
Craft a bunch of Molotov cocktails. 
---
Wait for Whitespring to get nuked.  
---
Turn on Passive. 
---
Follow a group of high levels (Presumably the ones who nuked it) and lob Molotoves like crazy.  
---
No annoying explosive body bouncing, tags everything.
---
What are the cap costs for the excavator paint and lever action skin? 
---
I am in Helevetia and a Mr handy and decorations Spawned
---
the alpine horn item always has a mannequin on it its so weird i just bought it and its really quiet 
---
Lol.  I didn't realize something like that makes the game "literally unplayable". 
---
no i was just exploring then bam i instanly died...
---
False. The game takes half... The displayed bounty is half what is lost on death.
---
Raiders are also the richest players. We are not limited to 1400 caps/day.
---
We dont need to wipe. We do it when we wanna switch gears or be able to look at the map. But its out of necessity not because we are gaming the system for caps.
---
So far I have found a holotape and a note about the parade 
---
this was very helpful thank you

The parks generally have a lot of toys - Tyler County Dirt Track is a good low level on the mid NW side of the map.
---
I found a way to mark drops. Anytime I drop some goodies near Flatwoods, I throw a vertibot signal grenade to call the attention of anyone in the area. The smoke is the same color as the one emitted by supply drop caches.
---
800 atoms for the excavator &amp; 500 atoms for the lever paint.
---
What’s the best bar mod for the chainsaw to get the most damage possible?
---
Yeah I just used lvl 50 as an example because that's when you can wield the max lvl gear but you are right about 35 or so it does start to become more concrete 
---
Does it really take a few minutes for a legendary item to spawn in? 
---
900 hours dude posted [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2jqxa/leveling_tips_for_newreturning_players/) yesterday.
---
I never glitched for xp. I am level 210+ now. I am level 200+ for last three months. I ceased exping because I don't profit from exping anymore, and it makes upkeep of myhabit of organised PvP (where your opponents are your friends) much more expensive  When I was exping - and I wasn't using any glitches, just farming mobs efficiently - I was making around 10-15 levels daily. Afaik, the exp needed for next level doesnt change significantly when comparing level 150-151 to 950-951. Means that anybody who concentrates purely on grinding exp, spending average 4h daily since the game launched, should be high above 600. More into 900.
---
When I see a character on level 600 I am thinking to myself mostly: what for. The activity that yields greatest profit for time spent - trading - gives no exp.
---
There's nothing in the game that requires server hopping whatsoever.   
---
It's 100% on you; quit blaming developers for your own lack of self-control.
---
Not sure about ultra-lite... I have custom for legs for sprinting into battle since I'm unarmed.  Have padded for chest for explosives and trying to unlock (if available) brawling for arms. 
---
Thanks for posting. I'm spending some atoms today 👍🏼 
---
My camp is an immersive bar and restaurant complete with a surprise punji board maze. Players that don't like it are griefing experience! 
---
Lmao wage slave
---
but yyyyyyyyy thooooooo.
---
Lol if you can make the item yourself and it has no legendary modifier why on earth would it be considered a legendary? I can't make a drill but I have made many syringers...
---
Done this so many times. It is fun 😈
---
That's a falsehood theres no way to kill someone unless they are engaged in pvp
---
Server hop at Watoga
---
Nobody has to server hop. You're just being obnoxious and entitled.
---
I feel u lol I won’t be home till 5:30 ugh
---
Indeed, it works on camps too, and it's this way from the Beta.  
---
Jesteś Polakiem?
---
No, Problem :)
---
PS4 sort is L3, lots of good options including sort by "spoil".
---
Been on the anthem sub eh?
---
Not something I'd do personally. Not all that surprising though
---
Those jerks are gonna get real world cash for atoms out of me, aren't they? Excavator paint job, mask, and lever action paint all in one day? How dare they.
---
Instigating only works when the target is all full health right?
---
The idea is to just output as much DPS as possible, it will mitigate whatever counter measures they have.
---
I agree, it seems really hard to just get the key to the Dome itself. I wouldn't mind jumping from server to server to find the plans, but its even harder to line up all the right things just to get the final key. Oh well.
---
Yeah it's for leather, I'll gladly provide that for you. What will it cost me besides that &amp; what time are you online? EU here, it's 17.30 for me atm.
---
Well, its in the game now ○•○
---
No, he's suggesting you learn to be more patient and accept that you can't always have everything instantly handed to you. Nobody ever suggested you "wanted less play time." That's literally just words you made up on your own.
---
r/woosh 
---
Haven't played, haven't seen the sub. Why? do they have hot tubs cuz that could be a deal-sealer
---
The game doesn't take half while you build up your bounty and after you die if you have no caps.  And any good player PvE or PvP is not limited to only 1400 caps a day......
---
As hard as to write 'change' and not 'chance'
---
I got wreaked hard doing the same mission, about your level. My 4th try I caught the tail end of some higher lvl players making a loot run so I tagged along behind them until the cleared everything out then I snatch and grabbed that sucker and RAN. Ghouls have always been lvll 68 through there for me so I feel your pain. Its REALLY fun after a nuke because they are all glowing and a lot harder to kill.
---
Nooooooooooooo. Why did you have to say this???? It’s probably gonna get patched now 
---
Server chasing is against the terms of service. 
---
You are absolutely wrong. Its player vs player. 
---
If we were playing basketball. You decided to ignore the rules of the game by only using your feet. You are intentionally opting out of using your hands. When i dribble with my hands... Am i griefing you?
---
You are griefing yourself by being ignorant the the game mechanics. Being upset is not a justifiable behavior. Getting mad or personally upset when i smash your camp is the toxic behavior. Do not reinforce it. 
---
Thats what this post is about. 
---
I'm a full blown PvP, I go after douchbags and people who take workshops purely for a fast travel marker, bounties obviously and teams who bully solo players and fuck I'm good at it, but you sir... You are just an asshole. 
---
There there are forums to find pvp so if someone doesn't retaliate leave them be. As for profiting off your own bounty that's utter bullshit, you can't unless you have a team who bullies solo players who just want to play Fallout. I can only hope your on Xbox, so I can molest you. 
---
Just run like hell when you kill them if you're using melee
---
Well, that escalated quickly!
---
Basically just spawn in Watoga and run a lap of the city. Change servers, repeat. It's probably one of the more consistent routes because there are a large number of bots, and they are neutral if you completed the quest there, so you can skip the ones that aren't relevant. 
---
[I got drunk and made a video some time ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333tT7nqY8k), if you want a more detailed look at the route itself.
---
Be warned that since last week's update they explode INSTANTLY when you kill them, so if you are melee, be sure to have some defensives going or you'll get nuked by each one.
---
As usual is up to personal taste. You may want to look into this, however, if you find yourself away from your ps4 often. May not help at the moment, but worth a shot down the road.
---
Glad I could help you learn something - and you demonstrated its proper use, albeit in a dickish fashion... Mission accomplished! I hope your day improves to the point where you don't feel like lashing out at people for whatever reason : )  
---
well thats strange then? i just died and it said someone killed me and it took caps from me also maybe lag? i was shooting mobs/enemies maybe a stray bullet? anycase thats strange
---
Techncially speaking, is it wrong?
---
Idk I don’t think it’s a bug, as all the other water fountains give you diseases but this specific one takes them away. On top of that it’s specifically named sulphur water fountain, so I’m certain it’s intended.
---
No, that's the thing. You don't actually respect anyone else's opinion -- you don't even respect Bethesda's intentions for the game. You're demanding that it be catered to you, because you're unwilling to play the game the way it was intended to do so..... all while you're not even DOING the quest you're complaining about.    
---
It's 100% self-righteousness.  Nobody cares that you're impatient and lazy. We care that you're trying to change the game for everyone else, or declare things as "bugs" that are not bugs, because you're impatient and lazy.
---
Lol nothing new!
---
What is this event all about and where do we go to complete it ?
---
800/500. u/Norsefoolen was kind enough to post [screencaps](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2zavy/check_atom_store_now/eivzfb4/) of all the new stuff.
---
my condolences
---
Or just have some basic self control and don't do it.
---
Lmao no do not get that trash dumpster. but someone on that sub had a “do this or the grabbits get it” (they are harmless little bunny things) and BioWare didn’t respond I’m time and the guy went around killing all of them, it was hilarious. I thought your post was referring to that post! Lol 
---
Do you have pacifist enabled? If not a stray bullet will notify someone you're attacking them and allow them to shoot back. But unless engaged you only get slap damage
---
So... uh .. pictures?
---
 It was more a question to expand on your point than an actual question. 
---
Right? How dare they! (*buys it all anyways*)
---
And I know, didn't scroll far enough to the right to see it, my bad 😅
---
Just watch the Noclip documentary about Fallout 76, Todd Howard's interviews and so on.  
---
They wanted a PvE/PvP softcore survival game from the start, destroying camps it's always been intended gameplay.  
---
You can use whatever definition of "griefer" you like, but it's not the one on the wiki.  
---
This is a pointless debate ,speaking as a raider you will never convince anyone who does not role play that the post apocalyptic world will be full of anything  other than circlejerking betas living in peace.the only option is to have pve and pvp servers .it's not hard.every other game has two Server types.i have no problem with people who want to play with no conflict ,you do you.but if the game is pvp that's on Bethesda not on rp raiders.
---
I always thought it was just my slow internet (3-9mbs) not showing anything 
---
White springs, WesTek, Watoga. Uranium fever and Scorched Events. Rinse and repeat. 
---
One of my favourite pastimes in the game; bringing creepy encounters to other players (without griefing)
---
Just to follow up on this, you were dead right. Server hopping here spawns 3 Snallygasters reliably and each run nets about 10-15 asbestos. You spawn behind a tree and 8/10 times they won't see you before you have a chance to stealth (the 9th time they were dead when I spawned, probably because I got put back in a previous world. The 10th time I died to an invisible snallygaster before I could finish loading). All in all I scored about 100 asbestos in an hour.
---
**Other good locations for farming if you happen to be there:**
---
**Sugar Grove** \- the control room with the assaultron in it has a shelf in the back with cigarette cartons
---
**Whitesprings Bunker** \- in the command wing with all the desks and the big map, just before the vendor room. Many of these desks have undamaged cigarette packs, which contain higher asbestos content than regular cigarette packs. As a bonus I also have found up to 3 BoS technical data in these desks at a time and there are about a dozen fans here too.

That's not true at all. You can still die through slap damage. That's one of the ways you become wanted. 
---
I've ran into a few exploding Major Gutsy outside of Watoga including the Mutant Lab and Spruce Grove?
---
That's awesome haha 
---
FINALLY!!! 800 atoms. Not too bad.
---
If only we could sell the damned things. I have a million disease cures that I will never use. Let us sell them. 
---
Yeah dude details!? Where is it? How did you get it? Whats it look like? Lol
---
Well, World of Warcraft has 21 playable races with two genders each and while some of them share basically the same character model, most of them have a pretty unique and distinct overall appearence - i.g. how big the shoulder armor pieces are. Some races have bulky hooves, some angled legs, some have an elongated head, some have long pointy ears, tusks or horns. The undeads' lower legs and lower arms are skeletal. Some races are very short, others tall, some have a slumped posture, others a straight back. Some helmets show hair and remove beards, others show beards but remove hair and still others show neither hair nor beards - or show both. Plus, there are many non-playable races which share the same equipment system and thus also require adjustment.
---
Unlike Fallout 76, WoW has hundreds upon hundreds of items with unique models. Sure, these models have a lower polycount but especially the newer items are quite intricate. Still, this doesn't change the fact that WoW found a way to have many different races wear many different items.
---
Am I comparing apples and oranges here?
---
Praise the Holy Moler, can you dig?
---
Nuking The Whitespring while geared for glowing ghouls is a good combo of adrenaline rush and legendary farming since like every third bloated glowing one drops legendaries. Even just walking around during the day can produce at least a couple of legendary charred ones.
---
Uranium Fever will have a number of level 40 legendary mole miners which is fine if you don't mind a bunch of crap 1\* legendaries stunted at level 35/40.
---
West Tek will usually have one or two but honestly that's more trouble than it's worth.
---
Horde events will usually have a legendary boss even if it's just a level 18 mirelurk or a level 21 radrat.
---
And of course there's SBQ whose fight seems to have been fixed since the last patch.
---
There are others but uh I gotta keep some secrets for myself.
---
We had an old school arcade open in the area a few years ago, complete with about 100 vintage machines. My kids love going to visit for an afternoon, but it is definitely an antique curiosity for them. ;)
---
I can't imagine that going well.  Cars tend to blow up around me.  I make sure to test that they are working.  
---
BOOM - "That one works!"
---
i did not know that was an option how can you turn it on? :) sounds like something i want on
---
I used to do that all the time.  It has been about 50 levels or so since I hung out in the top of the world area and I *still* have aluminum from my daily runs to the ski resort.
---
I hope to see it tonight! Plan to collect one of each. :)
---
Ok.. I'll be on a few minutes. I'll be off at 10am Pacific 
---
We are REBUILDING Appalachia, are we not? And a drill is a very handy tool. Now, if we could only find some screws....
---
I get the lag nowadays. Loading times are same-y for me.
---
I feel that is worse than the insult. Not even acknowledging you like you are not worth the insult.
---
To answer your question, yes you can report people. I probably wouldn't do it for that tho.
---
I can do 2000 caps for the radium rifle 
---
Atom store 800 atoms I’d say blue and red one sec I’ll get low definition low quality photos 
---
What if you woke up in a random bed somewhere. 
---
Bow bar against high armour targets (most of them), Long bow bar VS low armour targets.
---
Id done the math on this month's ago but am a whore who doesnt share info lol 
---
I'm logging in now. I'll let you know in a minute. I'll be ok till 10 am pacific
---
I get legendaries maybe 1 in 5 legendary enemies. Also never got a legendary above 1 star. Over 60h in the game
---
My mind is instantly drawn to the welfare state, and how my wife and I bust our asses at work yet can never seem to get ahead due to the crushing taxes and fees that pay for it.
---
Logically I recognize that these players could all be disabled vets, or retired firefighters, or some other noble yet tragic person who was a stalwart benefit to society.
---
Then I hear their voice and change my bet to bitter incel.
---
thanks i heard there was no option too did they add it in recently or did i hear wrong? 
---
I an extreme lag whenever I spawn in, too.
---
Got the worst non drill legendary drop last night... EVER.
---
+30% damage to ghouls, Gama gun......
---
I have never seen a ballcap before in the game. WHAT!?
---
No worries. If you go to setting and then game theres an option to turn it off. Dont worry I didnt realise until I was around level 30 and wondered how people just kept killing me
---
Run? They blow instantly now. Ha run
---
I may have a few hundred. I'll be on Tonite. I'll message you. 
---
And clients. Lots of clients. My favorite is the Bethesda launcher.
---
1) God mode is not a thing.
---
2) Turn on pacifist and don't fight back. You'll take almost no damage if you're not fighting back (which triggers PVP)
---
3) Block and server hop
---
4) Right-click their icon on the map and choose "report" if you *really* want to, but killing is part of the game so unless they were being really harassing (racist, homophobic, etc) on the mic absolutely nothing will happen. Even if they were being harassing, no way Bethesda will ban for a single report. They might keep a list and if someone passes a threshold do something, but don't hold your breath. Their actions were an intended in-game behavior.
---
I have a serious problem with your first suggestion.   It needs to work for alcohol too! :-P
---
Still TSE. 
---
People don't realize how utterly beyond everything TSE was before the Nerf. It quadrupled the damage of a weapon.
---
Also when you play the instruments in town, it sounds like a new song? 
---
Sounds good. I'm online as well right now.
---
Ok so I guess my comment was kind of a falsehood too but if you're going to stand there for 20 mins and let someone shoot you you should probably realise you're about to die
---
I’ll take 2000, no man I’m sorry I only have plans for automatic and normal
---
we need shogun armour!
---
The decorations are up but no event yet
---
Gauss man?  Do you charge much?
---
Ok, my gt is ojDJJD
---
"Fallout 76 was my game budget for the year... Gonna get my moneys worth." 
---
I have not seen one legendary in Watoga since Patch 7. Maybe its just bad luck for me.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Drill_(Fallout_76)
---
I can't tell if you'r messing with me or not, but I can't seem to find anything about them being considered legendary. 
---
Please tell me it’s not time limited. No way I’d be able to farm 400 atoms within a day 😪
---
Yes. You are not justified in your "feeling of greif".
---
You are not entitled to something that isnt in the game. A true pacifist mode. 
---
I would argue that i get harassed over the mic daily by players who are upset i killed them or wreck their base. Cursed at, yelled at, lectured etc. 
---
Why must i be subjected to such am abuse for playing the PvP game i payed for? Im spreading awareness. Learn the PvP mechanics. Learn how to protect yourself from raiders.
---
Why should i feel bad or guilty about something im *allowed and encouraged* to do??
---
Will the game require an update?
---
okay randoms on the sever told me when i re-spawned else were about "it might be god mode" thanks will block them and move on :)
---
Shooting flames like the chainsaw, or steady flames like the shishkebab? I don't care; I'd be thrilled with either.
---
Thanks for this!  I'll definitely try the safe room and maxing the budget.  I never have a bounty so I'm not sure how many caps the reward is.  
---
Why didn't I think of that!? Legendary in its capacity for CONstruction! 
---
I have not seen it but it looks like I'll have to actually kill the squirrels to show Bethesda I'm serious haha the bar has been set high
---
Plus there's a bot that says they need a bit more time to prepare for Faschnaht.
---
I don't think so. Most probably tomorrow
---
thanks! :) yeah im just about level 30 too will be sure to turn it on right away :)
---
Fuck C.A.M.P. jails! 
---
[https://imgur.com/Uxq4qtL](https://imgur.com/Uxq4qtL)
---
Awesome advice!  Thank you.  I'll be sure to start sneaking round. 
---
wait but you are able to buy atom on XBONE in japan? How??? Can you show to me, it does not show as option for me, plesae screenshot
---
I'm on board. 
---
Please see above.
---
Having the same here as well since last patch, def a game/server issue nothing to do with your comp.
---
they have been working on the bugs related to loading screens (like hanging and double loadings creens in the past) for a while now, looks like the most recent fix caused this behaviour.
---
No
---
how many poses?
---
No worries man what platform you on? I have some level 30 gear I dont want could help you out
---
Best be geared up for fireproof and adamantium cuz the Watoga protectron bois have a 50/50 chance to splode on impact now. Even taking them out from middle distance can cause significant owwies. Oh and now if you cause a little too much robo-carnage they'll send a horde of colonel gutsys after you and those boys do not play. Honestly that all just make farming Watoga bots that much more funner.
---
No problem.
---
Sorry boss, I feel the plague coming on.
---
I know, I get sick every Tuesday. Weird, huh? I'm sure I'll get better (checks roadmap) May 24th.
---
Doing free gold trimming rune Armour, just meet me in the wildy.
---
I'm on Xbox. My username is Sangumagic. If you want you could add me on Xbox and you could craft them
---
I don’t think it is
---
If only everyone shared your sentiment
---
Looking online it seems like trapper has lower base weights than marine but a pretty even trade-off of less ER for more RR. Still the reduced weight on the pieces (5 for the chest) would be attractive but not sure what it would be in the buttressed form.  It's GOT to be easier to craft and scrap than marine armor though.
---
I'm not saying that and i have never seen anyone do a comparison of these two things so far.
---
It's dependent on how much you destroy.
---
The perk card doesnt say CAMPS, it specifically says workshops, the perk card even shows the workshop station.  So I would say it is still unintended, as the card doesn't say what he is claiming in any way.  Just because it works that way, also doesn't reinforce that its intended.
---
Looks like sausages are around too. Everything has the Fasnacht prefix attached. 
---
LMAO
---
Great looking C.A.M.P. But technically it's not from increased budget, they reduced budget costs on some items. :) 
---
Almost= not killed 
---
That gun is hilarious to use if you want to troll people farming Whitesping.  Just shoot the ghouls and keep them at full health.
---
No problem. Mind holding it till like 3:15 PM EST? I'm currently in class rn and won't be out till then. I'll pay extra caps to hold it if need be, I'v been looking for a good radium rifle for so long lol 
---
Im good but thank you for the offer i really appreciate the kind offer :)
---
300 caps
---
It was deleted nice
---
Yeah i have tons of caps... I dont know what your talking about. 
---
I dont want the bankruptcy penalty! (-50% pvp dmg)
---
He’s essential so he cannot be killed
---
Fixed my bad
---
He was standing in a fissure site one time. He is unkillable. His health may change, but death does not happen.
---
Yes. Started with patch 7.
---
Ok I’ll try and hold it till then 
---
I'm there again now, the while scene has changed! But the master of ceramonies says it's still not ready. 
---
No worries mate happy hunting
---
Its their duty to server hop. Use the tools you were given to opt out. 
---
Still looks great, though.  Nice choice!
---
Hey you on PS4? What’s your psn? 
---
He's like Preston Garvey. Wait...
---
Lol. Todd Howard wants you to suffer I guess. It’s probably a mistake on their part, but drills and syringers are on the legendary loot drop table 
---
I've gotten blood tic tequila sunrise and blood tic tequila margarita... but cant make it until I know how to make blood tic tequila  lol!! 
---
Don’t think it is
---
Helvetia is gonna get swarmed, so good luck :)
---
ahh okay bc a legendary 3 star big robot thingy with fast guns lowered his hp to like 10%
---
Fallout 76. Atom Shop
---
I am correct. You refusing to debate only reinforces my point.
---
I think what they could easily do is lock the category for the stashes. So have separate stashes that are all connected to the main stash but are locked to a certain category for use. IE. Ammo Stash, Armor Stash, Junk Stash. 
---
Or is it really in the game in America
---
My bad fixed it 
---
The title said nothing about comparing heavy to sturdy, it was very misleading.
---
It’s live right now 
---
I had this issue. I was trying to do it on my bench at my camp. I had to go to the bench assigned to the quest. With the diamond next to it on the map to repair it
---
Don’t know how I missed that, thanks 
---
you too! :)
---
Man that brings me back
---
Awesome. As much as i want to jump on that or the stove, I guess I’ll prioritize the limited time stuff 
---
Hes wrong its coming today dont worry decorations are already up if it wasn't coming bethesda would've told us before today came just like they did with the first update. Plus the fasnacht robot that starts the event is there already.
---
I've never seen it either
---
That's bullshit. They've had all the time in the fucking world, we were supposed to get vault raids in January, and they just keep postponing and postponing content that we've all patiently been waiting on, and personally I'm tired of having my dreams shit on because Bethesda can't get anything right. What's next? Survivals getting delayed until 2020? 
---
There is no benefit to destroying another players camp other than "fun". If you're having fun by destroying the hard work of someone else despite having no incentive... You're griefing. I admit that it's become a buzzword like "sweaty" or "bot" from the land of fork knife but destroying bases is 100% griefing. The PVP is fine. 
---
Workshop, i would agree, I actually did in my original post.  Camp, no.  The perk card you are claiming is there to aid in that, doesnt say Camps, it says workshops, even shows the workshop on the card itself.  And a perk card working incorrectly is hardly what I would call anything being intended.  As there are many perk cards that still dont work. 
---
Yup. I got the Lead Champagne Bellini.  Can't make the Lead Champagne that it calls for.
---
Pics? I'm at work and hoping the atom shop stuff is better then last weeks lol 
---
Dont remember exactly Not online arm but i think 4:pip boy, sit, walk and wave 
---
Actually never mind it's up already starting 
---
The non-sarcastic answer: When the bans started coming down for duplicating, the number of people claiming innocence was quite high, and the number of those people who then through their own admission or research into previous posts revealed their guilt was incredibly high. The end result is that people who were banned were assumed to be guilty.
---
Glorf here is (in)famous "900 Hour Guy." Argument over their guilt or non-guilt hit reddit level furor a while back, and this being reddit, well, changing people's minds are like pulling teeth out of a deathclaw. A living level 98 albino chameleon deathclaw. With two crippled arms, a crippled leg, and a pipe pistol with one bullet (we believe in you, Mama Murphy!)
---
They're back an playing again with the same account (as far as we can know here on the internet), so whatever the cause, it obviously wasn't all that bad. But, again, this is Reddit, so... rabble rabble rabble!
---
lmao
---
Nuclear material will drop from uranium ore or any glowing enemies
---
It's here hard to find though 
---
I have 31 coal from farting around Ash Heap.
---
Never got changed back from the nerf.
---
I have 32 if you need a few
---
YOOOOOOOOOO that's awesome. The Alp Horn! I have one of those in real life, my father used to run a Swiss Colony store and when it closed he still had all the goofy shit they used to decorate the place. After about 20 years I ended up with the alp horn. My wife hates it. 
---
Good one, nice.
---
Isn’t part of the lore that the coal ran out? So they used more aggressive methods to get other materials.
---
It is a great distraction but it doesn't work wonders on pain management, I'm more than willing to put in 10 hours a day but my wife has other ideas.  
---
Do you think she'd buy the "it's medicinal" line?
---
I always assumed that in foreign countries that's what they called black titanium.  Guys telling me he has recipes that call for one and the other. 
---
The game says others can initiate PvP with you if you claim a workshop. It doesn't specify "at the workshop. "
---
Don't think there's a need to get so upset. Come on it's just a game. Plus the event is still happening today. 
---
Yeah, give griefers a little atom bomb to blow up in your camp. No way they'll go for that big boom.
---
The PA itself or paint for it? 
---
The horn dont work, not a great start.
---
was a horse armor joke skippy
---
Why should it be a bug? Where did you read that outside the workshop area you shouldn't take full damage?
---
If you claim a Workshop, the owner get's flagged fo PvP (everywhere he is), it's that simple.
---
That's irritating... oh well. I'll take that over the game not crashing or spawning un-targetable mobs under my base that shoot it through the ground like TF2, I suppose. 
---
250 caps.
---
Finally something worth my atoms!
---
7
---

So you posted video proof that Grahm is unkillable in defense of his possibly being killable?
---
Bro chill its already started I'm walking in it right now you just gotta wait for the event to start. The robot will always say that when the event isn't running. Just like other events or uranium fever robot says they are fixing

It’s easy to suggest there are healthier ways to spend their time and be a part of real society. But I have never been in those shoes so I guess I really don’t know.
---
That's what it says, but my experience is that the game considers anything over around 80% to be full health, I can almost always 1 shot a level 68 Super Mutant that's over 80%, but if they are already down to 75% it takes 2-3 shots with an Instigating Exp. Lever Action.

Depending on the other legendary perks, that gun could sell for a couple of grand as a gimmick weapon. I've seen a few sold as a curiosity.

no, i just wantet to know if he was killable and hear people's awnsers. that's all

Im experiencing phantom enemies. Wandered into Fort Defiance to see my full hp go to 90% rads in the span of a few seconds. I unloaded at the ground with my explosive TS LMG Right before I died, they loaded in -- 5 charred ghouls beating me up like I owed them money. They took 0 DMG.

Griefing: continuing to harass other players after they have let it be known that they are not interested in PVP.  Your list is a subset of that.  
---
Therefore, continued slap damage is griefing because the other person is not entering PVP.  That's the reason that Bethesda made it that way.  They did not take into account those that would continue slap damage until it kills the non-participant.  This is something that they have stated that they will change soon - to make slap damage non-fatal.
---
You answered your own question:
---
## "For the love of Atom"
---
Thats why. 
---
Grief - noun - "The multifaceted response to loss" - Wikipedia.
---
Griefing - verb - "The act of intentionally inducing grief in another" - Me
---
According to Dr. Don Vaughn, PhD, our brains do not separate games from reality. In essence, when you smash someone's camp, you have physically induced the sensation of loss in their brain. Neurologically similar if not identical to smashing their personal possessions. So, you smashing my camp for whatever reason is intentionally inducing grief. By definition. How people handle that grief is varied, but the second of the 5 stages is anger. Hence we get rage quitting. Great article on NBC News called "Why board games bring out the worst of us". Check it out. Applicable to video games.
---
So anything you do to induce loss is by my definition griefing. We're free to redefine it as a community, but you wrecking people's camps for bounties is inducing grief and therefore griefing. Slap damage is meh, unless you kill me. Then that's inducing grief. Workshops are similar, but by engaging in a zero-sum game (only one of us can have the workshop) I invite that grief to an extent. If I'm across the map and don't care to defend it but you come kill me anyways, that seems not right but a discussion for another thread.
---
I see I'm not the only one who will have those two in a couple of hour... 
---
I picked up 60 ish...have no idea where I got it, I just know i have it
---
This. Still sounds like a bug if we actively have to wait that long to get our legendary drop from a kill. 
---
That is the ultimate guide. Wow 
---
There’s a fundamental reality that the more damage you do per hit, the better a LOT of things get. Focus on upping your damage. There’s a reason Bloodied builds are so popular; even if you don’t go all in with a 20% health build, Adrenal Reaction gives a decent bonus around 50% health, and I think Bloodied weapons are pretty comparable to things like Anti Armor at that point too (the lower you go, though, the vastly more powerful you can ramp up. I think I’m sitting around 500 ish damage per bullet with my bloodied 1* Gatling gun at 20%? I reaaallly want a bloodied explosive Gatling or 50cal though.)
---
Also, I assume you are using Stabilized and are in Power Armor? Stabilized is such a keystone ability for heavy weapons I can’t ever recommend using them without Stabilized and thus PA

the TNT dome key 7 was not a quest, the plans are not a quest reward, they are a loot drop, the Overseer's Journey can't be completed yet, server hopping has nothing to do with that, you don't need to server hop to find a holo from her, a friend could take a holo right in front of you and you would still be able to grab the holo if you need it.  there is literally no quest in your log that requires server hopping, also how does one person connecting to or disconnecting from a server at all affect server stability?  If it did how is that any different from a person just logging in and then out because they got a call or something?  or literally anyone when they log into a server and then out when they are done...  connecting to and disconnecting from a server has nothing to do with server stability, and duration spent on a server has nothing to do with server stability, so no, server hopping will not affect a server's stability.

Ive found a spot you could extract unrefined coal from, unfortunatly dont remember where
---
Yeah when I downloaded it, i had to wait for like four separate updates to download, which would get smaller after each download, I had to use my LAN to play it same day 
---
Oh hell and a lever action wrap.....I might actually have to buy atoms.
---
Someone get this kid a juice box
---
He'll hit a knee and take a breather, sure. But no, he cannot be killed.
---
i have to upload it to my onedrive and then download it, so that could take a while, that's why
---
Well, you cannot blow the horn yourself in-game, there is a mannequin instead. Kind of a bummer.
---
man i hope we can get netflix in our camps
---
The Contractor perk also just says workshops. You think it’s unintended that it works on Camps too?
---
Point always has been that you are fighting over workshop, that is why in that area defender and attacker gets slap damage removed. 
---
Chobowan hit me up me and my buddies will help you for sure
---
You can go there during uranium fever and just tag enemies. Failing that you're looking for blast radius and rad poker board games or biometric scanners when you're out scavenging. Or look for uranium ore. Or if youre on ps4 I'll just give you sime
---
Those “unkillable” builds are probably assassin sentinel users. You crit a headshot and it ignores sentinel mitigation. It’s the easiest PvP build to kill
---
Hijacking this. There have been numerous posts on here and your forums about dailies bring broken across the board since the latest update. The only daily I ever get now is the ones from Biv. I've seen no response from Bethesda about this. Are you all aware of this?
---
Same with the Contractor card, though. Just says workshops, works on CAMPS
---
i thinkits pretty much everyone, when i first load into a world i have learned to stay put for about 30 seconds until the world totally loads

Awesome! I have just enough caps for the PA paint, LE skin, and the poses at once.

I actually always wondered how Rose came to be.  Is there in-game lore that outlines this?  I've never found it.  I always knew/thought that rosalyn/rose were related, but never knew how she came to be.

Wrong.

You shoukd server hop. I ahve a bloody buzzblade i kill pacifists with SLAP dmg. If your overencombered or afk. Im gonna get you and take your junk. Im allowed to do so. Use the tools you were given. Block me and fast travel or server hop. Otherwise you are cattle for the wolves.

3\* ghoul last night dropped a quad salvaged assaultron head....as I understand it, don't the assaultron heads just load whatever ammo you put in them?

Quad ammo capacity on it just seemed such a "laugh's on you!" moment.
---
Goes well with my two star assassin rolling pin.
---
Bloodied dragon 2 shots them
---
I think so
---
On my way! 
---
r/wooooooooooooosh
---
I wasn't really thinking about How to do a Bloodied build, for example.  But along the lines of what new players can expect as the levels build.
---
As a new player I thought level 150 was SO much more powerful than level 80.  Turns out, more levels just give you more options (and more time for random drops).   In fact, I had no clue what a Bloodied Build was, or any of the others.  I was just playing with the little info I had.  What the video would focus on may take some time to think through.  
---
(and then it all further complicates as Bethesda makes changes to weapons, etc.)
---
Do others feel new players could use a better overview of how this game evolves for the player and what options they may encounter?
---
Don't know if this happens to anybody else, but other than legendaries not dropping from creatures there's a more shitty thing with exploding robots.
---
Sometimes the legendary robots explode and that explosion either makes the model dissapear, or it pushes it underground. Whichever one it is, no body to loot.
---
(They sometimes also just fly away from the explosion so you have to look carefully. I know that happens, this is not what I'm talking about)
---
After the last update or two I seem to be contracting diseases nonstop.
---
How many atoms is it? I'm at work and can't check. 
---
Who determines what is "abusing" the game mechanics that Bethesda put in place? What is abuse vs. use?
---
Let's also remember that this is a video game. Words like harassment carry a lot of weight in the real world. A toon in a game is not real life. All online games have service agreements to clear this kind of thing up.
---
Has to be worth a try, VR is apparently the best but you could always promise to sit with yr nose pressed to the screen for the same effect if that clinches the deal lol, there’s a few bits published online, here’s a link to one study overview that you could try to buy you a little more time in the game, especially with event week being limited time, here’s the link:

Keep your bowels in check in the ash heap it's bad enough there as it is
---
Well, it looks like the purpose of the card is to destroy every item a player has built (workshop or not).  
---
If you use it to destroy someone's camp it makes more sense that using it to destroy something in a workshop (why would you do that? Just claim it).
---
Anyway, perk card or not, in this game you can destroy how many camps you like, and if you are not in PvP with that player, you get a bounty (as intended).  
---
These are the rules, you don't have to like them.  
---
Oh how I wish you were doing this during my play hours. I'd love to just kill the queen over and over harvesting plans.
---
I'm shining baseballs behind Watoga. Meet me in the alleyway of the Mayor's office.

The Master of Ceremonies has arrived in Helvetia and decorations are being spread throughout the town! The Fasnacht event will begin about 2 hours from now.

Thank you.

It starts in about two hours :)
---
I saw pictures of the wrap, it's the only weapon paint I've seen that I like for this game. 
---
One of my most fun experiences under level 50 was the first time a couple guys showed up to smash my camp. There were deaths on both sides  and before long they dipped. 
---
Camps are relatively inexpensive to fix except Decon showers and gardens. Just because it took hours to make doesn't mean that's being lost. It takes a handful of common materials to fix, usually.  
---
I have a few coal and I have no idea how I even got it

Way at the bottom of the savage divide there a spiky pit that’s a workshop. You can set up 3 uranium extractors and an acid extractor

Yup. I’m on most evenings eastern time

Right....

Spoiled fruit :-( 
---
Lol this is ridiculous! Is player vs player. 
---
Rules and reality are not built around how you feel. If you feel grief its because you refuse to acknowledge the brutal game mechanics. 
---
Root cause is you, not me. You are griefing yourself. Your the griefer! Lol
---
I've got 3 or so videos of legendary kills not dropping a legendary post patch.
---
Sorry having a issue with the ingame chat can only hear on psn chat. Feel free to message me if Iyou wanted anything else i had. Thanks for your business.

Seems like your character has the Overly Generous perk maxed out.

Fack that, today is probably the only time I'll even get to do it
---
The Master of Ceremonies is preparing the town for the event this week. Fasnacht Parade will be available about 2 hours from now (3pm ET / 8pm UTC)
---
What event?
---
Oh, I don't bother testing it a second time.  Once is enough.
---
Well, how about a **Fusion Core Recycler** instead?
---
The way it could work is as follows:
---
* Each time you burn through a fusion core, you get a "Depleted Fusion Core" junk item that weighs 3.0 and can be scrapped for (2) plastic and (2) nuclear waste. These items do not get scrapped by "Scrap All Junk" at workbenches.  
---
* The same goes for Ultracite Fusion Cores, except you get a "Depleted Ultracite Fusion Core".  
---
* The daily quests "Ecological Balance" and "Waste Not" as well as the event "Fertile Soil" can now drop a "Fusion Core Recycler" C.A.M.P. object plan. God damn hippies.  
---
* Building a recycler requires stable flux. A *lot* of stable flux. You might want to consider getting the Contractor perk.  
---
* Once you have your recycler up and running, you can use it like any other workbench. The recycler grants access to new, cheaper recipes for Fusion Cores and Ultracite Fusion Cores; instead of using flux to craft, recycled Fusion Cores use Depleted Fusion Cores, nuclear waste, and a few units of Purified Water ([Wait, what?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water#Production)) and Ultracite scrap for Ultracite cores.  
---
* While recycled Fusion Cores are significantly cheaper to make than fresh Fusion Cores, they also hold less power, and are only ever produced with 75% charge.  
---
The idea is that this would require a big upfront investment for a big long-term payoff.
---
Its weirdly satisfying. 
---
Talking about misnomers - and paraphrasing one of my favourite characters - I don't think toxic means what you think it means.
---
You are however responsible for your own actions.
---
If you incite me into PvP and I refuse and you choose to keep inciting me the onus is on you.
---
If you see me as a device for your own entertainment, that is on you too.
---
You cannot defer that responsibility to Bethesda's promises, environmental factors or design choices; the responsibility for your own actions falls squarely on your shoulders.
---
You do have a choice and with choices come consequences. You are not here to have your mind changed, you are here to relinquish responsibility and be told that is OK to do so, and anything that does not fall along those lines you deem toxic.
---
I don’t understand the logic behind this, the fusion generator uses a fusion core as power, throwing a fusion core in there to charge would at the very least cut the amount of power you would get for your base, and would reasonably deplete the core powering your generator, so you’re charging a fusion core just to replace the one in your generator, but that’s if Bethesda would even care about the realism 
---
800 if I am correct (can't see the price anymore)
---
If you’re able to draw PvP by jumping in front of shots it’s because they have pacifist off. You can’t jump in front of pacifist enabled shots to pull aggro 
---
Activate pacifist mode and no one can hurt you. Most are friendly in any case. 
---
There is a coal resource just west of Charleston Landfill where the road meets the railroad. You can also build a nest little hobo camp or troll under the bridge kind of thing here. 
---
There are some Fasnacht donuts in the Restaurant kitchen now. They don't spoil either!
---
Just found some on the ground yesterday for the first time. REALLY HARD TO SPOT! blends into the rock structures really well. 
---
Thanks for you business.  Sorry about the in game chat issue. Feel free to message  me if you wanted anything else. Thanks again.
---
They wouldn’t be cheaper, they want you to have to walk to extend the grind. So caps would be the same, or nearly so. 
---
Most of the non-bug stuff wrong with this game comes from “extending the grind”
---
Oh come on why so late i was hop8ng i could play today 
---
Limited time?  Which of the 2 excavator skins is out?
---
Weight, healz?
---
Would you consider a melee player who can exploit the Slap Damage mechanic despite another player being in Passive Mod, hunting other farming solo players down and killing them for materials a griefer? 
---
Go to whitesprings and you can actually HEAL the ghouls, its a great trolling weapon, I have one myself. And I use it to heal up the ghouls when people are farming them, I then use wasteland whisperer to get them pacified if they come for me, and we rush on together as a pack to kill the humans fighting my ghoul buddies. 
---
Good ol’ days
---
Ok let's just set things straight.....most players do not engage in pvp nor want to engage in pvp because of DUPED weapons.  Running around with your tse shotty one shotting lower levels is just ridiculous. Arguing that you're playing the game the way it was intended is BS if you're using obv duped weapons and assassins armor that u traded for. I would absolutely love to do pvp way more often but I dont run a one shot build so basically i can't. Pvp is intended and encouraged but a lot of us dont have the build or the duped weapons to survive more than one second. Is that really enjoyable for pvp ppl? One shotgun shell or one all rise swing and that's it??? Come on. Maybe if you tried using regular weapons ppl wouldn't hate pvpers so much and refer to them as griefers. Also if someone doesnt engage u when u slap them, PISS OFF. Following someone around for a half hour or more is def griefing
---
Its live
---
... look up the definition of Pacifist, please. 
---
And that’s not true anyway. 
---
You should, um, consider lowering you charisma?
---
Secret agent perk makes it last longer. 
---
I honestly haven't encountered it yet so it's news to me. Time to move all my workbenches inboard at CAMP.
---
No, destroying someones camp that they built through their own time spent and materials spent that has no intention of engaging in PvP is the toxic behavior.  Having "fun" at someone elses expense is the toxic behavior.  Someone having to spend more of their time, which may be limited depending on your schedule, to stop what you are doing to either fix your camp and/or switch servers.  And to add to that, now you have to spend time gathering more materials to replace the ones you just lost.  Being upset about that is quite justifiable behavior.  
---
Its live just wait for your server to get it 
---
Thanks! I was starting to worry that parade was going to be delayed. 
---
Haha, no need. I was also expecting a tiny patch to activate the new event. Glad they're doing it this way though, less down time.
---
Did they add ultracite paint?
---
It will be live in 2 hours according to bethesda
---
Just got word that the quest will start at 3pm est 
---
Let's be real it probably is 
---
I'm in the same boat, I'm excited to start seeing what people get as loot
---
Same here!!
---
Got a link to it?
---
And if they're shooting at a mob, it's pretty clear they're not shooting you.  So jumping in front of the mob is clearly an intent to harass someone, regardless of the devs putting in a switch to thwart you.
---
Heck, that switch exists because of the griefing caused by not having that switch.
---
It will begin at 3pm ET
---
You can profit off holding bounty. I do it all the time, just not with 1000 cap bounties.

Nope, in about 2 hours according to another post

Knowing Bethesda there’s a good chance it will 
---
.... did you look at the roadmap on the website? They’re already doing that.
---
You're right, I am angry and I'm probably projecting. I'm angry because instead of this cool paintjob being a reward for clever work and puzzle solving it's just a merit badge for server hopping.  Even if someone puts the pieces together the reward for it means nothing now.  Makes me sad and angry and yeah, I'm acting like a dick about it because it makes me more sad and angry that so few people realize what they've lost by having things "solved" in this way.
---
Well that just sucks for me then lol
---
I'll give you 1000 for the plan 
---
Nah want caps and already have my ultra cite modded out
---
Why? People should have no life and spend their time refreshing pages and re-starting games
---
Where? Nothing happening yet - just a bunch of balloons and ribbons - but nothing to actually do :)
---
Pacifist only means you can't accidentally damage another player, or their belongings.
---
**Does not** mean you can't be hurt by other players.
---
One other humbling tidbit... Assassin's Sent armor does not make you unkillable. I finally found the last two pieces for my hodgepodge set and used it on my level 88 shotgun alt. The very first guy I fought (bloodied unarmed) one shot me 3 times straight until I realized what an idiot I was. I wasn't moving but I was shooting him point blank with an exploding shotgun which wasn't doing any damage to me but was causing a stagger... derp.  It was a 264 cap lesson in switching weapons up close and always using fireproof. 
---
Sorry ya'll, I'm on PC. 
---
I am on Xbox 
---
And repair them!
---
This guy u/Thelonewanderer said it's going live for everyone at the same time. He's from Australia so it's probably going to be later in the day 
---
The ultracite plan?
---
0.01 wt with perk cards, 5 rads, 25 hp, 18% food
---
Fasnacht sausage as well!

Yeah why not.

They only do slap damage? Which is next to nothing.

That's the skin I want most for it so I'll still get it then.  Thanks!

I’ll give it to ya for 3000 
---
Xbox 1 :( 
---
yay
---
I mean like times of the day
---
Seems more realistic that the generator would actually drain a core.  Kinda like putting a battery into a device, gota switch them out occasionally.  
---
dude, breaking someones camp is griefing at the highest level PROVE ME WRONG
---
Sentry bot?
---
I overall agree with this; but I miss server hopping for plans. It was a lot better server hopping 500 times for a rare recipe than paying 10x markup on some plans. I've been stuck at sub 1000 caps forever, and plans I want are actually more difficult to get. At least for me. Time was a resource I had; I have had no luck grinding caps.
---
Yeh I'll get to join back by then!
---
Every new content update already has dates for it. Just go to the content update roadmap for 2019 they even talk about a dlc that could contain dlcs called wastelanders and another DLC in summer called nuclear winter. And March 26 survival mode those are only some of the many things they talk about so go read it Nowwwwww
---
You are being stubburn and entitled the minute you think you can stay and be immune to my attacks. 
---
The burden is on you to use the tools given to avoid me. Block/server hop.  
---
If you dont, im justified in continuing my assault. You can only be upset at yourself if your upset when i finally slap you to death when you are rushed by ghouls.
---
No I wouldnt agree that its whats the purpose of the card is,  It ony says workshops, and since that is a defined PvP area, it makes more sense that it is only for workshops.  Destroying items in their workshop to aid in capturing it makes far more sense,  destroying turrets or generators that are running those turrets, is an aid to your survival.  It makes sense it that regard.  
---
Yeah, you are fighting over a workshop.  
---
You have that workshop, and I want it, now we are enemies.
---
The moment I decide to take what is yours, we can kill each other wherever we are.  
---
Q
---
I want to take a ride
---
Yes, I do
---
I don't know why, but for some reason Bethesda opted out of the material mods for PA in 76, on top of not having legendary effects.  The lack of these 2 things make PA pretty sub par vs. normal armor when you get to the end game.
---
Also in the magazine rack in the tattoo parlor upstairs. Although I’ve had it glitch where I couldn’t “touch” the magazine
---
Where did you find the time?
---
I mean the like estimated hour of the day.
---
All my atom poi ts will be spent today lol.  I need that wood inlay for my rifle and a red stove!!!
---
No thanks. Thank you for considering the offer. Good luck with the sale 
---
I think they mean like, what time of the day its slated to release. And I dont entirely disagree; I assumed March 19th meant like, midnight, or 9 AM, or something; but it’s 1 PM and still no event as far as I can tell. I’m not ANGRY about it, but I am annoyed bc I cancelled something just to play the parade for a bit before I have to go to work and its looking like i wont get to.
---
Aaaajjj dude that's creepy. Makes me hesitate to log in tonight 😕
---
A Bethesda employee commented on my post
---
pffft. Techncialities.
---
Check the Mixed drinks category in the brewing station. If it doesn't appear, you don't know any mixed drink recipe yet.
---
Yess
---
Yeah I’m not upset it just would be helpful 
---
Not bad at all!
---
Source?
---
They’re not exactly rare. I’m guessing a 1/5-1/10 drop chance, although I’ve only run dailies ~ 16 times now (Alts)
---
I suspect impatient people with money to burn WANT IT NOW and are willing to pay for it
---
Anyone have the fasnacht old man summer mask? I feel like those two will go well together what with the red tones.
---
In consideration for those of us who like to plan our day more than 2 hours in advance, would you mind making announcements like these 24 hours in advance?
---
Bethesda comment on my recent post
---
There's a cooler that looks a lot like a stash box in the red house near the bridge. Fasnacht sausages spawn in that kitchen. Fasnacht donuts spawn in Freja's Haus (yellow house with name near the same bridge.  The honey house with bees is over the little bridge between the two. There's a "Fasnacht Robots" note you can read, it doesn't seem to do anything.  You can kick the red globes with plus signs on them around for makeshift kickball while you wait (I'm admittedly easily entertained.) That's all I've seen so far.
---
Unless you pick the wrong lock, own a workshop, or have a teammate do so.
---
Slap damage is still damage. 
---
Ah ok well they're your options then. You could try the market place and see if anyone has any for sale but the board games shouldn't be too hard to find 
---
Had to switch servers a few times. Try and join now 
---
How long will it last? Asking for the est people who work normal time jobs 
---
I think you mean "Now its all C IAN SEE"!!
---
I got a drill also last night. So I feel you brother. 
---
I dunno about other low levels, but i come running with my prototype hazmat everytime im on my lowbie and see a nuke.   Easily get 2-3 levels per nuke.  Just run around tagging shit with any gun you can find, let the 50+ players do all the heavy lifting = )
---
That's part of the reason I don't mine the lead and prefer to use my camp and an extractor. It's just swapping one scarce resource for another.
---
Extractor paint that's literally anything less ugly than the default? Sign me tf up.
---
Ok
---
Nice I got the nuka awhile ago when it was really rare so I got it first try
---
Sorry to everyone who has to sit in a queue! WE NEED PRIVATE SERVERS!
---
damn, i taste salt.
---
I will add u as soon as possible 
---
Well said. 
---
Just some friendly advice, 2mm electromagnetic cartridges are very easy to make.
---
A few of the patches have features that havnt been totally patched.
---
I did play fallout 4 but never got the dlcs
---
please link.
---
Instantly if its an option. I saw Morgantown get nuked multiple times on the Nukashine launch day lmao
---
Thanks, this is awesome!
---
Positive I didn't drop it or sell it. Why would I like lol?
---
I had the steadfast muffled/shadowed combat armor chest dissappear on me way back in the level 30 days. That was devastating at the time... 
---
Absolutely not. Any time I see someone with a low bounty I go chase them around with a chainsaw also. As long as you guard their junk for them after you’re good.
---
Sounds good!
---
It will be available for one week, until 6 a.m. EDT on March 26. 
---
Fighting over workshop mean you fight in workshop area, not millions years away from it. It makes no sense fighting outside workshop area where you can't claim the workshop.
---
Why was the post deleted. I seek pvp knowledge
---
hVm4n_5h13Ld  I am also down to assist.
---
Alright I'll be on later
---
Oh cool , thanks!
---
If your sense of taste is anything like your power of perception, we may need video proof of the salt. 
---
Thanks for the reply keep up with the good work.
---
Wrecking ball
---
0.o
---
nope, it spawns in at the same time for everybody 
---
Gaully mine (behind slocum joes in the Forest) is the only place I've found it so far.
---
Haven't poked around to see what it can be used for yet, so hasnt been high on my look for list.
---
There is no possible justification to your actions other than 'because I want to'.
---
I do sincerely hope that this is a 'game thing' and not a reflection of your outlook on life in general.
---
The Master of Ceremonies has arrived...

Board games have nuclear material. There's a bunch at The Whitesprings Hotel.
---
damn, thank you. now it's just fucking bitter
---
I’m excited, I just wish I had another friend to go to the parade with because the one I play with 90% of the time just seems to not care about Wild Appalachia at all so I’ll probably have to do the event alone 
---
Video or didn't happen. :) 
---
It's at 3pm. One of the community managers just responded in another thread
---
Chainsaws aren’t hard to find, the real struggle is the flaming mod for them.
---
Dang i have classes until 4:20 EST
---
Ugh ok ya got me 1500 and ya have a deal
---
So tell me, are you using the Contractor card to build your camp?   
---
Because it says:  
---
 "Crafting workshop items now costs 50% fewer materials. "
---
I hope you are not abusing this perk...  
---
Noted, didn't want OP to be under the impression that pacifist = immune to all damage.
---
Seems to be a common misconception?
---
5$ for a mask? Damn 
---
Yes, sometimes you can circle back and find that the body has a legendary afterall.  Doesn't change the fact that there is a delay in loot spawn that effectively means you dont get your legendary some times.  It may be 3 seconds, 30 seconds, 3 minutes, or 30 minutes.  I personally am not waiting around for loot to spawn on a 1\* lvl 42 ghoul.  If I can't see it in 5 seconds, I am going to keep moving on.  3\* and SBQ I am likely to wait a while longer.  
---
It's still a broken mechanic, and needs to be fixed.  
---
Heck yes. I'll look soon. Is it just one and is it easy to get?
---
Camp McClintock was always picked clean when I needed it the most, so I went through houses in the towns and snatched up all the toy cars I could find. Pepper mills (not shakers) give a couple of screws apiece, so don't skip the kitchens. Hot plates are handy because they give you copper as well. I always made my way up to Prickett's Fort because I recall there being a decent number of tongs. Any office building will have typewriters. Typewriters bleed screws. Arktos Pharma is a good place to check, as are the Charleston Herald building and the Charleston Capitol (if you can take a steady stream of level 5 supermutants).
---
It's all good!  I understand, that's why I haven't watched that video yet.  I try to play organically and not do the "best farming methods" etc.
---
Oh sweet. It’d be nice to know a little earlier tho
---
I did that from lvl30 -lvl33...and now 100 lvls later I still feel like a pos for doing it..
---
thats the agility perk he was refering to.
---
There is a Covert Operations magazine that makes it last 50% longer so thats 9. I dont know if there is a way to make them last even longer
---
It was bound to happen.  Make the challenges more tedious + Make the free Atoms harder to acquire = Incentivize players to spend real money to buy Atoms.

.04 weight

I am carnivore, so that food % is prob different for non-carnivore???

You do realize you have like 5 different options to deal with that that don’t involve clogging up the report system with non-actionable offenses right?
---
&gt; Note: Wood armor is not listed because it is ~~uncraftable~~ garbage.
---
FTFY
---
&gt; To call out a spelling error with grammatical errors = priceless.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; The spelling error is not stopping you **form** playing so the game is not unplayable, therefore the word literally is not used correctly.
---
&gt; The double periods are not necessary at the end of the sentence.
---
lol
---
I know...
---
I HATE feeling guilty or hurting peoples feelings because they dont understand the game mechanics
---
I was hoping this thread would raise some awareness that we are a constant.
---
All players should understand the PvP mechanics. They should be aware of how to run/block/severhop. They have no right to be pissed at us or make us feel bad for doing something we are both allowed and encouraged to do!
---
Actually, I dont use the perk at all since I dont capture workshops often. So.....
---
How can you not consider destroying a players CAMP griefing? Correct me if I’m wrong but you gain nothing from it except a bounty
---
What people dont seem to understand is that every bullshit item could have been a cool item. Dont you want cool BOS, Enclave, Raider and Responder stuff instead of my little pony stuff? Every hour the developers spent on  princess beds and simular items is an hour they could have spent on bringing us black excavator paints and simular items.
---
what time zone?
---
Yeah waiting in queue.
---
I've seen it too, buddy, I've seen it too.  You're not crazy.  It happens often enough that I worry it's going to happen to each and every one when it explodes.  
---
Yes, the explosion tosses the ragdoll around (annoying enough), but sometimes....just SOMETIMES....it will absolutely explode into nothingness.  Gone.  Forever.  I assume it explodes in such a way that it's clipping into the ground or a wall or something else that you can't get to ti.
---
How about instead of this, something that lets you siphon energy between fusion cores, thus the production of fusion core energy can remain the same yet they'd be easier to manage.
---
The black one, and it's only 800 atoms, so it's kinda on the cheaper side. 
---
Ahh thanks!
---
Welp, there goes about 2000 of my barely earned atoms.
---
I legitimately questioned your sincerity in your original post and questioned where to engage with a self-labeled troll. I opted to post neuroscience research that helps shed light on a universal response to gaming. 
---
Where I die to a mythical deathclaw or PvP, the sensation of loss is the same. 
---
Cheers.
---
Apparently it does not in 76.
---
But won’t you agree it’s very close? To immune? There’s been rumors about people stacking explosive bobble heads and doing enough damage to kill, but afaik its not been confirmed. I should have been more precise in my first post, of course :) 
---
There’s datamined stuff showing the option for your camp to appear on the map along with your player vending machine
---
I’ll do 1500
---
Probably Todd. or a Dev
---
Just bow down and hope they let you go on your way
---
I remember in FO4 The quest to get the custom paint jobs it just became a matter of caps cost.
---
I haven’t been inside the atom store so if there are new paint jobs available I wasn’t aware
---
Just hopped online. Gt Staticchmbr1
---
Okay my gt is MILKMONST3R626. I’m on atm
---
Yup, I sometimes get extra ammo or a few stimpacks, but they generally do drop legendaries, but not always. 
---
I'm the opposite. I can mitigate carry weight with consumables (and a minimal loadout), but you can't mitigate damage resistance, short of stimpacks.
---
Est or cst and can i ask how you know?
---
I can confirm 2 handed melee perks benefit the weapon. I’ll try to put a vid together if people want.
---
"I enjoy destroying the work of others, but I get really upset when they say they don't like me."
---
Nah 15 levels is per whole damn day, I took 4h daily average as something that actually could happen, but it includes both days spent grinding and days spent offline
---
What exploit are you talking about?
---
FINALLY, BE GONE UGLY YELLOW
---
What are your prices like?
---
Only 800? Well that's a relief. 
---
Ooooh more from eating ghouls and the like? I like the sound of that
---
You're right about slap damage. If you happen to become wanted, or take a workshop, slap damage no longer applies. Anyone can kill you pretty much at will, at that point.
---
Reported!
---
Unsuspecting low lvls with bounties :P
---
3pm EST, confirmed by devs.
---
If you’re on Xbox I could change your xo1 into quantum if you’d like
---
lol go go power raiders!
---
Again... you're "allowed" to spawn camp in games, too. Doesn't mean you're not a dick for it. Doesn't mean  you're not harassing people.
---
And stop acting like playing a "raider" in a fucking video game makes you a badass. "Wolves"... lol. 
---
Bring back Jumpin Jive, was there in the beta
---
3pm eastern in real life time?
---
Lmao okay buddy. Doesn't change the fact that I'm right. Have fun endlessly reporting people because they call you out ;)
---
Honestly I'm trying to work through exactly why I'm so upset, because you're right it doesn't affect me directly.
---
I do still feel like I've had an experience stolen from me though.
---
It feels as if everyone that I'm talking to thinks that the whole point of the game is acquiring all the loot, as fast as possible, as easy as possible, without caring how they get it.  
---
Like those those rare people who think that the point of watching a movie or reading a book is to find out what happens, and they go around sharing the big reveal with everyone they see, thinking that they are doing people a favor. "Oh my God, Snape kills Dumbledore!" "Bruce Willis was dead the whole movie!"
---
So all of these people showing off their Quantum armor is people walking around with their spoilers, and now even people who figure it out for real know the ending.  Even if I find the right quest and decipher all the clues, I'm going to go through the quest knowing the ending, knowing the prize, and all the sense of discovery robbed.  Which is my fault for reading the posts here, granted. I just wish I could have that experience because it seems like that would have been fun. Oh well.
---
The craziest thing here is there is no padded, biocomm, pneumatic, or most importantly dense data here on this spreadsheet. Where are the scout armor/wood armor references. This spreadsheet seems more like some body trying to get traction on a post in order to get more people to trade him what they want 🤭
---
This is my new desktop wallpaper thx mate!
---
Plague Walker FTW
---
The community managers have replied in other threads, it starts in 2 hours at 3pm EST and lasts until the 26th at 6am
---
Yup. I see low level players complain about “griefers” attacking them when they have secured a workshop all the time. Lol
---
I’m not the biggest fan of PvP by taking a workshop across the map, but I can’t imagine people prefer I go to “defend...” events to “help,” immediately cap their workshop, and kill them.
---
End of the day, PvP is only fun when you win and that’s why people think it’s unfair. They wouldn’t be complaining about “griefers” if they were actually able to kill their aggressors.
---
Yes, just not level 50 ones :(
---
I can craft both for you at max durability if you provide the materials (or the cost of them) plus a small tip in materials on whatever I am short on (currently screws and nuclear materials). IGN: jchamlin
---
Contractor and Wrecking Ball are bugged and not working as intended? I don't think so, but it could be, we'll see.  
---
The point is that destroying camps it's intended behaviour, it's an asshole move, but it's not griefing (if you are using the classic definition of the term).  
---
Never seen those kind of eyelashes before, must be the nuclear winter.
---
It could just be a static model, not the same as the ones you can blow up
---
If it helps, I have little to do, wife out of town, and short work days this week. I will make up for your hours.
---
Abuse is exactly what I described. You know when you're harassing other players. Everyone knows when it happens... but everyone argues it when it comes to conversations like these.
---
it's disingenuous to pretend otherwise. We ALL know when the line gets crossed.
---
"Slap damage" in this game was designed for one reason... as a signal to other players that you want to engage in a fight. It was meant to allow them to choose to engage or not.
---
If you choose to follow a player, and use slap damage to either kill them or, or force them to hop servers... you're an asshole. Period.
---
Addressed to in my reply to my other reply.  But even if I find the quest organically now, I'll realize at some point where it's all leading, and people have been so careless with putting spoiler tags on stuff, that I can never have that exploration and discovery experience properly.  Which I guess just means I should stop reading posts on this sub at all, which sucks because there's a lot of other worthwhile information to be had that doesn't spoil everything. Oh well.
---
From what I understand, only the owner of the camp can move things and teammates can set things down. I believe you can move what you have built, but you can not move just anything in there.
---
He can only move items he's built. 
---
What makes cars with fins, picket fences, poodle skirts and tommy guns silly? Its part of the 50s era. Crayon PA paints is in my opinion not, that is just a waste of developer man-hours that could have been used better. There is a big difference between humour and being silly. Fallout 76 has alot of great humour, princess beds and crayon paints aint one of them.
---
Good point. There's an aspen grove located in Utah which supposedly has been cloning itself for almost 80,000 years.
---
I'd prefer "the interloper" to not be something supernatural, though. No alien, no ghost, no evil spirit, no transdimensional demigod, no mad scientist's experiment, no reckless corporation... just nature doing its thing - with or without us humans. And if humans happen to get in the way - nature should use 'em for sustenance or whatever. That's WAY scarier than yet another cliché plot contrivance...
---
Glad i saved up the atoms...
---
Crazy idea, make them so they don't blow up in the first place. 
---
Yeah, so another hour and a half basically.
---
I also can craft and fully mod t60... also on pc.
---
If down the road your looking to add that jet pack, calibrated shocks or targeting HUD 😃
---
[Bethesda comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2zu37/whats_the_deal_with_this_event/) 
---
Excellent. Done and done when I get home.
---
when I lvl 200 decides to clap my lvl 40 bootycheeks I call it griefing.
---
Thanks much. Might farm a few to scrap now.
---
Hah. It's fun. Wait til someone goes into a building, find a window to peek in. Hope they see you. Wait on top of a hill as they explore a house. Rush to the next closest location, and stand on the roof. Follow them just close enough, just far enough.. .hide behind trees and cars and peek around corners.
---
No masks, though, I put a ton of effort into character creation... it's all damage and makeup and features.
---
I am a PA melee tank. I am a new man upon exiting the suit.
---
Hi Valseek - Groggnak here - Yes That Groggnak (Hubris Comics has been spelling my name with 1 G for far too long).
---
If I'm at work (spinning around in a circle with my ax) until about 6pm today - will I need to wait until the next day to try out the new event? 
---
Love, Groggnak
---
Mine is similar but I lose the clown outfit and just go with the mask and my tighty whities
---
Lower right corner of the spreadsheet. Same reason wood isn't included.
---
Useless for you. Otherwise not useless at all. 
---
Do you know how often it can be done? Once a day, once an hour? Does server hopping make a difference for when it happens?
---
I don't ever even see anyone walking around in T-60 armor. I've got a calibrated shocks for a T-60 that I want to give away but never find anyone who looks like they could use it.
---
it varies depending on what you build. I would say look at the type of gear you mostly use and keep about 200 to 300 of it on hand and maybe 50 of anything else you might need or play with.
---
also look up things you will want for example I like deep pocket mods but didnt realize gold was needed so didnt have any on hand when I got them.
---
Anything the owner builds can be moved and edited ONLY by the owner. Guests can edit and move things they place only. The owner can also move, edit, or store anything placed by guests. 
---
Says you’re offline. Send inv?
---
Just follow the overseer journey and you will meet people!
---
Like I said. You're not interested in understanding an opinion of what is good vs bad fun that isn't your own. I am not interested in banging my head against your self righteousness and superiority complex. I don't need to be educated on how I should have fun playing a game. Good luck with your crusade to rid the wasteland of responders.
---
Too bad they did not go black with radiation-green highlights like moleminers.
---
Guess what, the masks and outfits are part of the parade. Google it.
---
I get a bounty which leads to more PvP and more caps/junk
---
There is a direct benefit. I get to kill bounty hunters!
---
Does this event populate randomly? I've been to the town a few times and pushed through a bunch of low level scorched but never seen the quest. Does it pop up like a normal public event or do you have to be there for it to show on the quest? 
---
Dude when I saw your video I brushed out laughing it so funny and it a we’ll made video I going to sign in my YouTube account and give your video a like 
---
but you can just FT...
---
Yup, just gotta server hop around the higher level areas for them (I looked in Watoga (on top of the high school, the are where the crashed vertibird is at near the shopping plaza, behind the rank 3 locked door in the transit hub, and on top of Watoga Emergency Services). I also recommend checking out Survey Camp Alpha, Forward Station Delta, Firebase Major and Firebase LT (doesn't hurt to check Camp Venture while you're at it).
---
There a spot up north/middle with a junk and lead pile next to each other. That is the most beneficial place I have found.  There is a resource map floating around on this reddit page somewhere. That should help you decide where to go.
---
As far as the crop fertility, I believe that anywhere you plant them, they all have the same timer on them before being able to harvest them.
---
Is the parade a one time thing or will it happen again ? I'd like to see it but work.
---
How is it 5$?
---
I sell most Mods &amp; Plans for about 75% of their list price (some even less), except for the very rare &amp; sought after ones, and even on those, never more than double the list price, and I give away free common recipes with plan purchases.
---
I’ll be on right now for about an hour or 2
---
Yeah I love the excavator PA, but the 'duck' paint job will be happily replaced!
---
You asked for a survival roleplaying game.
---
You are pretending it's ok to do what you want because it's a function of that survival role playing game.
---
The ability to transport yourself to different world or to create a magic shield to stop you interacting is not an available choice in the world you are roleplaying in, only a function of the game that facilitates it.
---
Expecting people to utilise game functions to ensure in game RP experiences is a bit shitty and removes any immersion.
---
That’s smart but yo be honest a fridge system would be cool 
---
So you’re basicly a ultramarine terminator now
---
I agree, I love that song. It would fit in.
---
It will be available for a week until March 26th, but that’s all I know 
---

---
The Master of Ceremonies is making some final preparations for this week's Fasnacht festivities in Helvetia. He should be wrapping up soon, and the event will begin a little later today! (3 p.m. EDT / 8 p.m. UTC)
---
Workshops are a gimmick to do PvP: you take a place that generates resources, but there are others people competing to have it.  
---
You want what I have? Now we are in PvP.  
---
If it was a bug, Bethesda would have fixed it a long time ago with all these posts where people cry about it.
---
Follow the main questline.
---
Well hey, if you want a defective car, then sure...
---
Not always, as the unkillable builds vary.  The one I was using to counter Raiders was put together so that only the 2 least used damage types could get through it, Radiation and Poison.  However, it was too slow to level and became boring real quick, so I scrapped it for a Glass Cannon(that I'll scrap if they ever buff Plague Walker and Chameleon).
---
If your looking for the better armor which this spreadsheet is extremely helpful with. Why does it matter if its crafted or not?
---
Inv me I’ll still get it
---
The only time I saw him he was “legendary *** insult bot” and he kept saying stuff like “hold on” and “give me a second” (I don’t recall his exact wordage) in between long pauses. I stood there for several minutes of this before I killed him. I think I got an exterminators leather shoulder (something super forgettable), so maybe that was the legendary insult?
---
I'm pretty sure there's a PC mod that does it, but in many cases, I could sort by the *total* weight of items.
---
Paging u/CommonMisspellingBot
---
Build at whitespring with plenty of guns faceing the club house. Everyone will praise you! 😈

I thought contractor was the opposite. Says CAMPs but also works with Workshops.

---
No you don't; your ego does. 
---
Thank you I was told 4pm I've deleted the post 
---
Currently playing solo and having a fine time. It allows me to focus on the game and I don't have to rush. I've encountered a few people and mainly they've been doing their own thing. Or a group of us ended up doing an event together and then going on their away after it was done.

This is beginning and I guess on my way to middle content. End game I think you'll need groups.
---
Cue the apology for calling the woman a ghoul...
---
So in one month of play you got to over level 200, and in the 3 months since you've just cleared 10. That totally checks out. What do you do log in and stand in one spot for an hour then log back out?
---
Aren't only 2 active?
---
Get off reddit for a day or some shit 
---
I dont really mind the event, what i have a problem with is a bunch of silly masks being in the game and players running around with them looking like clowns. I prefer if the majority of characters in the game look like traditional Fallout characters, not like bobbleheads.
---
I'm pretty sure there has been at least one time when "You've recovered from radworms" and "You've contracted radworms" displayed almost simultaneously on my screen. 
---
No actually you sir are a liar. Also lay off the dude the event was to start today and they were obviously not ready for it hence the delay on nukashine. The trolls are already rampant and anyone telling this dude to chill is either ne of those said trolls that have every intention of messing with people while doing the event or your just a moron. I don’t care about the comments on your toxic forum as anyone in their right mind would be annoyed seeing as how balloons show up two hours early.
---
I've had many camps. You should move to the location nearest to the resources you need the most of. Eventually you'll be rolling in said junk. Then move again, then again. It's just life in Appalachia.
---
Yes they do. 
---
However it seems like they are a nightmare to find. Was recently trying to complete my level 50 T60 set, it was the right leg that took forever to find. But I found it. 
---
If you can go into Watoga unhindered then this is probably the best place to look. There are 6 sets of power armour there, all the T series. However it can still take time - I either found t51 or t60 with anything but a right leg. But I persevered and got it.
---
Alternatively you could see if another player would trade you or make you one if they have the plans. 
---
Well I’m going to go get a extended blade ripper and see how that works for me now that you put that image in my head 
---
Yeah it's frustrating, had that happen yesterday with regards to a legendary mole rat. 
---
No stringer, no drill, just junk, no legendary. Waited a bit, looted the junk and the body disappeared.
---
Yep, this cost a friend and I quite few caps working out.
---
Also, check the map to make sure no one else is doing this.  Had a couple times where someone stopped by cabin before we got back.
---
Thank you! \^.\^
---
so is the mask unattainable during the parade or am i given the option to pay for it for early access?
---
It's actually only 1:31 right now est so it starts in an hour and a half ?
---
Also waiting lol
---
I think they may have a very real addiction, which is something you sometimes hear about in places like South Korea.
---
"I'd prefer "the interloper" to not be something supernatural", That's partly why I think it's just mutated Aspen's. 
---
Dang I can't wait to get off work. Keep em coming 
---
If you dont like PvP, and you dont care if you lose the workshop, then perhaps the easiest way is to server hop.
---
No kidding, I've been trying to replace my lvl 25 deep pocketed heavy raider chest for ages, now I see why I haven't found a replacement.
---
Greifing is unsolicited PvP. Continuing to smashing another players CAMP if they're not willing to engage is greifing.
---
I can't be 100% sure but, my best guess is that another player transferred junk/unwanted weapons and other items to a meat pile.  From your perspective it looked like a loot drop off the enemy but, it was essentially a paper bag.
---
Things like hardened mass and irradiated fluids in a nuke zone are first come first serve and always has been as far as I'm aware.
---
Haha XD
---
I'm in the game, tp to me
---

The festivities are still being prepared. but everything is decorated!

but where's the fun in that?

Is Tank Killer not applying to energy weapons my ego or something not working as intended?

It's your mods/custom ini
---
Why would you kill him? He hasn't hurt anyone. He's a gentle soul, wandering the wasteland like the rest of us. What kind of monster are you?
---
Why apologise lol 
---
I have no clue yet. I’m assuming it will be an event so maybe pop up like the regular events. But we will see. I’m sorry I don’t have a clear answer though 
---
Hey,
---
I love helping out new players. I can help you with some low level gear to help you get a small head start, a few tips on gear and junk to keep your eyes open for, perk cards/mutation information and serve as a bit of a guide to useful locations for farming important junk and events. Would also be happy to provide some ammo and chems to take the edge of the wasteland off.
---
Feel free to add me:

I'm on most evenings around 530-6 central time. Tonight is a grind night for me, so after a little gear crafting for you I'd have to be out after that. Always happy to field questions anytime you have them.
---
It's new and will begin today at 3:00pm Eastern Time (-5 GMT) according to Bethesda community managers.
---
Vader is Luke’s father. 
---
Not noticed clipping errors myself on fast travel, they only thing I noticed is there's now a noticeable pause when you load in after a fast travel.
---
Then stay off the internet. No one forces you to click and read topics about stuff you don't want spoiled.
---
It will begin today at 3:00pm Eastern Time (-5 GMT) according to Bethesda community managers.
---
If it's a good resource you're going to be jumping servers to find an opening. Junk piles are the best hands down as they get you a whole load of all types of junk. A spot I loved was just south of the trainyard by the airport right by the rail overpass. Great spot for crops up top and a junk piles below.
---
This would be amazing. I double check everything is still there like every twenty minutes. It would be a real anxiety killer
---
Atleast i got my Excacator PA paint, that makes me happy.
---
I'm sitting here, in helvetia playing the tuba till I get kicked out of town/server. I'll be a part of this holiday if it kills me.
---
This is a red herring with the semantix of the card. It doesn't necessarily follow either way just because the card is described in a certain way.
---
I use a power hammer. Even tho VATS says I have a 95% chance to hit it is more like a 75% chance. 1 out of 4 attacks miss. VATS also bugs out and I get a 0% chance indicator even tho I’m right in front of the enemy, this is happening a lot. If I’m not using VATS and I’m face to face with an enemy I will miss a lot, not due to skill(some misses might be me sucking) but the hammer just goes through the enemy.
---
So....... I finally found all the plans for Marine Armor (except head gear if there is one?). Went back to craft it, when I went to craft every piece there was lvl50 greyed out as i did not have the balistic fiber needed or the plastic, after farming the mats needed i went back to craft but lvl50 was no longer showing??? This happened in a since with crafting the last piece of my protype X-01 power armor piece, I couldn't craft the final armor piece, after a bit of time I found out the last piece had to be crafted in the Enclave Bunker.
---
As it says though- they are unsupported. If you come on here after an update screaming at Bethesda for screwing up your game, you're gonna get ass blasted to downvote city. If you come here taking responsibility for modding your game though, people will be likely to help. 
---
While I agree that the term is too liberally used, I think we also have to acknowledge some realities. 
---
There are clearly two kinds of players in this game—those who want no holds barred PvP and those who don’t. Until there are separate servers—and we already know PvP is coming—we have to coexist. 
---
This means that neither type of player gets everything they want—both need to compromise in order to have an enjoyable experience, at least for now. No one player is more entitled to fun than another. 
---
If you’re a PvE player and someone attacks you, either engage, or don’t. Ideally, get on your mic and tell them you’re just not interested. Also, don’t take workshops and expect to avoid PvP.
---
If you’re a PvP player and someone clearly isn’t interested in your kind of fun, then leave them alone. Instead of leveling bases to build a bounty, break stuff that isn’t hard to replace—leave the decon arches and workbenches alone, you get the same 10 cap bounty for a wall as you do for a fusion generator. 
---
Eventually (hopefully) we’ll all be able to have the experience we want, but until then we need to find some middle ground. Refusing to do that has nothing to do with game mechanics and everything to do with a total disregard for the other human beings who all play the game and make it viable. 
---
Seriously I don't get these people that complain about data miners. If you want to not have spoilers don't go on the internet and for sure dont go on a sub reddit that is all about the subject you don't want spoiled . Same with people who don't watch a movie or show on day one then browse the internet 5 min after it shows. People are going to talk about it. It's up to you as the person not wanting spoils to avoid the spoils. 
---
I did say an overabundance of slapstick. It has been gallows humor since the start. Most of those things are references to other post-apoc or pop culture nerddom at the time. 
---
The overarching narrative is so dark it absolutely needs gallows humor to get through it. The story is as dark as it gets man.
---
Bees, man, bees.
---
Collect that beeswax for the event.
---
I can paint that t60 armor with BOS paint for 250 caps if u want
---
Thank ya! 
---
I’m with you!! 
---
They is loads of people here I hope you do manage to get in 👍
---
Xbox?
---
Doing any more of this later? Id be up for it. 
---
Its clear that the developers intended forcing PvP via CAMP destruction as a fun little feature. See the wrecking ball PERK card.
---
Bethesda commented on reversing that decision by making changes to the pacifist setting. Pacifist may soon mean you cannot be harmed &amp; your CAMP cannot be damaged.
---
Becoming WANTED to attract bounty hunters was something intended by Bethesda. You need a high bounty to make the trip worth a bounty hunters time. The only way to rack up a worth while bounty is to wreck an entire CAMP.
---
Changes will be made. PvP players will be segregated. Unwanted PvP is going to be even scarcer than it is now
---
But is it really greifing? Maybe its not about you... Maybe the CAMP wrecking crew is seeking out PvP... By design. As advertised by Bethesda.
---
PvP players are stuck with you until survival drops. Just like you are stuck with them. Its not fun to be lectured after I smash your base, take your junk, and farm you for caps. Im just playing the game i was sold. I want to be attacking PvP willing players. Its boring attacking people that just log out or get salty.
---
The point is... Bethesda knows you want a true pacifist mode. They also sold me a PvP survival game. They cant give you true Pacifist mode until after they launch survival mode. Otherwise they would just be removing PvP entirely.
---
Just give it a month or 2 and its going to change. I dont consider it greifing unless its personal or the attacker is chasing you across servers.
---
TLDR: Its by design but its getting changed.
---
That's what I've been doing Lol, had some sniper practice 
---
Not the bees ahhhhhh
---
They added it in last weeks update. You pull up the map or social menu, click the player and there will be a report player option with various reasons for reporting. 
---
$$$$$$$$$
---
Let's be honest - none of the structures in the Nuka-Shine update feel like they were built with multiple players in mind.  Narrow hallways, blind corners, basically asking for trouble. 
---
just server hop the dome and keep checking it. Even if the door is open the plan may still spawn for you. I had been server hopping to see if the door was locked before trying to get the keys and I found an open door totally clean except for the plan, and I know others have as well.   I ended up getting the keys to unlock the door a few hours after I already had the plan.
---
"accidentaly"
---
Because some people don't save/have atoms on hand to use....although with 4 days to grind it should be possible 
---
One Violent Night
---
I prefer parties with beer and booze not pony rides and bouncing castles. And that is the same i expect from the game.
---
NNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOO!
---
No he fucking isn't stawp!
---
I've crafted 50+ and havent had it proc once so far. 
---
Will moving the goal posts to deflect from your denial of game mechanics help soothe that aching ego?
---
But but.. It's got a picture of a ballistic rifle ON THE CARD. By your logic, that means it shouldn't work on energy weapons. I guess that means it ain't broken, Columbo. 
---
or dropped
---
I'm pretty sure he meant " On the other hand." 
---
That was the case in FO4, I believe. I’ve heard Dataminers have determined 5%/hit capping at 30% in FO76
---
then turn pacifist off and fight the raiders as part of your RP. 
---
You have 2 choices...
---
To destroy the scorched virus that escaped one of their downed ships.
---
If you do whitespring with a friend, you can log out, and log in to make ghoul respawn
---
??
---
Do you know if there will be an update? (Just to double check as well 8pm GMT?) 
---
Try a password reset or post a ticket.
---
I think those were FO4 Numbers; I’ve heard 5%hit/30% cap for 76
---
says WORKSHOPS on that perk
---
LOL THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT
---
&gt; (3pm ET / 8pm UTC) 
---
These aren't the same :p
---
ET = EDT currently, which is UTC-4
---
Can’t wait!!
---
Like I said, guilty conscience!
---
Thanks man. We need some new and interesting content and I was just brainstorming. 
---
Oh man almost time for the parade!!! 
---
It might work like you can get his health bar to zero but not actually kill him, I haven’t tried to flex on him myself 
---
That's where I've been checking.  Haven't been server hopping though.  I'll keep at it - thanks!
---
Someday. Someday
---
Playing fall out 76 in current year. But yeah it’s in the agricultural center.
---
How does it not "fit the fallout world" when it's literally something from the real world area depicted in the game?   
---
You have a very skewed understanding of what Fallout is, if you think this event is bullshit. Sorry man, I feel bad for you.
---
I would rather it be Jeff Goldbloom. 
---
Probably be doing a few more hours man 
---
yea its a great pic for sure
---
If it makes you feel any better, my xbox does the same...
---
Needless to say, if WS was nuked, I would've server hopped. lol
---
I've been making the rounds at Watoga, although I don't think I have checked the top of the high school yet.  I'll have to add the firebases and survey camps to my rotation to see if that helps.  Thanks!
---
TLDR:  I think that any efforts the community can make to destigmatize PvP would be beneficial, while trying to find ways to shore up the mechanics that extract fun from the game. What follows is my perspective on the circumstances in question found within this post and others. Take from it what you will.
---
Slapping someone that clearly isn't interested in PvP makes you an antagonist. The world is overflowing with them. Scorched don't stop hitting you until you kill them or run away far enough. The same could be said for players. If you want antagonists of either kind to stop hitting you, either ask them to stop (and many of the more reasonable PvP-centric will, while Scorched will hiss and hit you again) or leave the world (for players, block them first). 
---
Building a CAMP and expecting it to shine on unmolested is entitlement at best given the rule set we've been provided with. Scorched will raze your CAMP to the ground if you don't defend it. Nothing less should be expected of PC antagonists. You have to repair it either way. If you want your CAMP to be safe from antagonists, take over a different structure and stop making obviously shiny expensive multi-story targets that are begging for attention. Squat in an indestructible static house and drop the necessary workbenches nearby. You are not entitled to a SIMs experience in FO76, or even Fallout 4. Things that are built are made to be broken.
---
Claiming a workshop is, like it or not, putting yourself on the map as a target worth contesting. In a world where the Vault 76 residents are at the top of the food chain, this should be the most obvious. To be fair, while I think that full pvp damage outside a workshop makes for some crappy surprises, particularly when you consider team mechanics and flagging those outside the workshop while another person contests it (cowardly AF, imo), inviting such a contest should keep you on your toes. If you were unprepared to be contested or killed and claimed a workshop anyway, that just sounds like a bad decision on your part. 
---
If you are grouped with someone that enters into any of these circumstances and you get killed as a result, also on you.
---
If someone is being mean to you in area chat, you have grounds to report them for harassment. There is no room in this game for verbal abuse, and there is no mechanic to support it. While you can mute people, there are terms of service that need to be respected. This is the closest to griefing that I believe can be clearly identified as such. I don't see much in the way of disagreement here. Goading and trash-talking can be safely ignored if the report function isn't providing the coverage sought after. Area chat can also be disabled in entirety, at one's discretion. 
---
Exploiting mutations to trigger PvP is borderline, and something that Bethesda should address mechanically. Reflect damage behaves strangely in player scenarios, and the game would be better off without them as a potential complication, imo.
---
Standing in front of someone firing and hoping they will go red is pretty lame, but has little impact if the other person is a pacifist other than making the killing of NPCs more frustrating. Not really much that can be done about this besides ignoring them or leaving the world. By the same token, while I don't like that pacifists can spot and observe while in the safety of another group while I'm actively engaged with a team they're helping, there isn't much that can be done about it. There is no such thing as a fair fight in FO76.
---
You may notice that 'Leave the world' is presented as a common option, which could lead you to believe that all of these tactics are meant to drive you OUT. This is not the case, as invitations to pvp are attempts to interact with other players in meaningful ways. They don't generally want you to leave, much as they want you to fight and die. If you don't appreciate the invitation and would just as soon like to move on without it, the exit you've been granted to depart any situation is a click away. Otherwise, Bethesda needs to offer PvE-only servers. 
---
It may also sound like I'm justifying the practices that make someone out to be an asshole. I am in no way refuting the behavioral issues that people have within the confines of the play space. We also are not obligated to engage with them in any way. Sometimes I will dance with them, other times I have stuff to do that involves me carrying junk or caps I don't want to lose, or social interactions I'd just as soon carry out uninterrupted (trades, for example). In those instances, my preference takes priority and I will take the opportunity Bethesda gave me to choose my own experience with a clean exit. 
---
I'm not a Raider. I don't actually partake in a lot of CAMP smashing outside of Whitespring Golf Club turret platforms, and while I'll snatch up a Bounty if I feel like it, I don't even bother getting one myself to bait potential hunters. I do, however, see the value in these tactics and options and don't see them as problems in of themselves. If you take the bait, you're just another fish for the fryer -- and raiders are nothing if not hungry.
---
Playing fallout 76 in 2019. But yeah it’s in the agricultural center. Not sure if the spawns are still the same since then.
---
Where do you get the plans to craft t60?  I've done some light googling, but never came up with the answer.
---
I love destroying vehicles.  I regularly shoot vehicles just to see and hear the boom.
---
I would love this!
---
Blowing up a C.A.M.P. does not make a player a griefer. 
---
I like the idea but what do cigars have to do with anything? 
---
500
---
Lvl 75+ 
---
its kind of bad game design to do this to people, making us server hop, unfortunate choice on bethsofts part
---
good luck, hope you get it!
---
Right, but I gotta be able to survive a shot or know what to look for.  I don't want to server hop everytime someone comes by. If I understand PvP, I can be better prepared to survive long enough to bounce. 
---
Wow.  
---
I have been playing since Day One and didn't know this.
---
Has it always been there from "birth" or has it been added in an update?
---
I'd absolutely prefer cavalier for a melee build. My only real issue is that I still get 1-2 shot in power armor, so making a power armor + pain train build to stagger an assn/sent player doesn't really work unless they miss.
---
Haha I doubt they were too concerned 
---
I may hit you up on this.  I actually have tons of screws and I believe a decent amount of nuclear material.  
---
If you see a friend request from Jaffo, that's me.  Thanks!
---
Tldr?
---
Nope. At least, not according to The description on Nukes&amp;Dragons. I can’t log on right now and double-verify in game.
---
There isn't a terminal entry or holotape that *explicitly* lays it out for you, IIRC, but Rose's comments as you run through her quests are enough to make the implication fairly obvious (even if the ski trip holotape next to Rose wasn't enough on its own).
---
Thanks for the correction!
---
Yep, just bought it and realized that. What a bummer. Still cool though
---
Armor piercing shells are a thing, it's not something that laser rifles should have.
---
No. Don't get rid of water fountain..  Be happy to keep a water fountain that cures our diseases.
---
Unfortunately, no.  If rebuilding is a concern, you're still best off building one of those dorky single-foundation CAMPs.
---
Although you can use those metal poles under Stairs to contextualize it.  That's what I did. :)
---
yeah it seems it is pretty difficult as people have been asking for this for months now
---
also, make it not scrap bundled resources when you hit scrap all
---
Been sitting in Helvetia chatting up with a bunch of people who came by, great to see some community excitement again 
---
Objectivity is lost with you.

There is no grey here. Its really black and white. 
---
Since when do i have to consider other players feelings in an online game? Its rated  MA, Raiding is part of the game. 
---
There is no philosophical discussion to be had. Sure im "bad" in game. But its a friggin game man. Im "playing bad". Im allowed to. Im trying to help people understand the game better so they dont drag their feelings onto a hot mic when i kill them. 
---
Im actually doing a good thing here on reddit! Im trying to be helpful!
---
Keep the insults coming tho. They are a constructive..
---
Yeah...these days arcades are just curiosities.  Our home arcade doesn't get played much.   The fun was building it more than anything.  However, there is an entire gaming subculture of folks who go for high scores and such.  
---
Back in the day the arcades were literally the only 'electronic gaming' thing out there....at least in the era before Atari and such.  
---
Arguing the semantix of the card is a red herring. Even if the card existed or not, there's still damage to other players CAMPs. If it was unintend, then there would be no damage at all (like with vendors).
---
Greifing is continued/relentless unsolicited PvP. Continuing to smashing another players CAMP if they're not willing to engage is greifing.
---
I found one just the other day in the Ash Heap. It actually had both legs. Was either at Mt. Blair station, Mt. Blair, on on the tracks East of Lewisburg Station. 
---
Sorry I can't remember exactly which one it was, but since it's so randomized, it probably would help anyways. 
---
Bruce Willis was a ghost the whole time
---
&gt; The majority of players don't want this even if it is what was intended by Bethesda.
---
Source? I see this stated frequently, but all I can see is a vocal group of players on this subreddit acting like their opinion on this is established fact. 
---
You can complain about spoilers, I'll just prance around in my fancy quantum armor paint.

Sulfur isn’t really known for its disease curing effects, it’s really only used to alleviate symptoms of the common cold. I always got the vibe that Sulfur was a company that made that water fountain. Straaaaange

Yesterday and today he didnt give me a recipe...sad face
---
We are talking about broken perk cards, how am I moving the goalposts again?  Workshops are not camps.   It also says rifles, not ballistic rifles.  Also all Anti armor perks dont effect Energy Weapons,  So does that mean its still not broken?   
---
Can't wait to get home and get this.  I wonder if I can go home sick...  You think the boss'll buy my having a sudden onset of Acute Excavator Fever?
---
for my gun user i built my base near a lead extractor as i was using a lot of lead to make bullets
---
Previous Bethesda answers say they are working on it. No timeline.
---
How interesting, is this time just the specific first event or was there specific times for each event? 
---
There was a Nerf to XP gains on enemies a few updates ago. Now leveling is hella slow.
---
Your only abusing yourself by being stubburn..if you wanna cry victim of abuse for me following you for 5 minutes b4 i kill you..  
---
Its entirely your fault. I never harassed you. You could block and server hop during the first 20 seconds... 
---
You are also wrong. Im sorry but this is not harassment. 
---
Ouu nice. I was wondering what those metal poles were for.

That sounds like a nice spot, I'll keep an eye out for it once I wander up there. Thank you!
---
&gt; Griefing is **using in-game mechanics** to harass people.
---
This is not true. Greifing is simply harassing. Harassing is a continued/relentless unsolicited action.
---
The real argument this thread really touches on is the definition/line of harassment. But that a totally different sociological beast.
---
Definitely is. Glad you get why I posted this :) love seeing a big group of people come together for an event like this 
---
dam, just saw this! guess i missed it
---
1: Lead is really handy, junk is nice. You find a lot of nuclear material later, so I'd rather be on a lead node than nuke. 
---
This thread has a map of resource nodes, if you're interested. I used the lead spot between  White Powder winter sports and Top of the World for quite a while. It's still in the Forest, so it was lower level spawns, and didn't get attacked that often.

---
2: Each area has a "verdant season" sometimes, and plants will produce more during that season. The seasons seem randomly set, but someone else might know more about how long they run or whatev. The issue with plants, water purifiers, etc, is that they don't keep getting whatever they make, you have to harvest them often. So your mutfruit will only output so much per hour, and if you don't harvest every time, it wont make more. I can't remember how much it's supposed to output, but you should be able to hover over it and see. Having a farm at camp is nice, but to really get quantities of stuff you need to get it from the world, too. Make sure you're running the Good with Salt perk, that will help food in your inventory last longer. 
---
We are dropping 5 more on her! Next nuke is happening now! If you wanna jump in that’s cool but the world may be full dude 
---
They can actually. Just checked my recipes and i have it.
---
No worries didn't know about them either till my friends told me ( was looking for a max level t60 right arm) but Max level legs for t60 do exist. No problem!
---
This argument is really about harassment. NOT greifing. At what point is harassment harassment? One "SLAP" in 76 is not harassment. It's a challenge. Continued "slaps" is harassment.
---
If you're not after something OP then you shouldn't have a problem trading for caps and back again. The issue with trading OP gear is that it's a pain moving 20k+ caps around when characters have a 25k limit.
---
Would they be the first perk card to be bugged and not working as intended?  No far from it.
---
I dont agree that destroying Camps is intended behavior at all, workshops yes as it is a defined pvp area, camps no.  I guess that is where we will have to agree to disagree.
---
They can? Oh I didnt know that
---
Fissure prime dude. All the ferns, they’re everywhere and especially at the base of trees. Since the update they have a more pronounced purple glow and are very easy to find.

I'm having the same issues with a baseball bat. I start to hit enemies, I hear it connect, see blood splatter from them, but no hp lost from them. It will take anywhere between 1-3 extra hits for it to start registering. on PC btw. 
---
I often get scared when they sound over 17. It might be because I'm a MINOR minor. A little bit under 13.
---
Thanks and some wake up hicks
---
damn looks like ill have to do it at 9 after i'm finished with work.
---
At early levels I made sure to be near crop spawns so I wouldn't have to worry about hunger so much. If you get the razorgrain soup recipe, it's great because it fills thirst and hunger. I would setup around Morgantown 
---
Still pretty sad that they added the skin
---
No they haven’t they have delayed and delayed they are notoriously lazy coders and that is the reason the game is in the shape it is now. Really looking forward to seeing all the trolls trying to kill people during the parade today I’ll be there to drop your asses
---
Unfortunately its a farmed item now. I was damn lucky to get mine first try. When we went after my buddies plan it took us at least 60 hops between us with 2 sets of keys to find another.
---
And then we stopped because we're not greedy dicks.

There ya go!
---
Damn, just scrapped all but my X-01 PA for stash space. Had a full set of each with doubles where a custom paint was available.
---
3* always drop 1* for me. Usually wooden armor. 
---
As long as the first and last letters of a word are the same, and all the middle letters are correct (but don't have to be in the right order) your brain can read it corrcelty. 
---
Hopefully i can get through the queue!
---
'I go after douchbags and people who take workshops purely for a fast travel marker, bounties obviously and teams who bully solo players and fuck I'm good '  
---
...so attacking whoever YOU want is just fine  
---
There might be some missing math. Does the Explosive component count as a separate “hit” for Damage Reduction purposes? That could either lower its effectiveness (if it does) or raise it (if it’s considered part of the same hit). A separate, 20 damage hit against someone with 300 armor is barely going to tickle. Anything that increases the single-hit damage has a disproportionate effect due to higher damage acting as some degree of armor piercing. Two 150 damage hits will do more actual health damage (against an armored foe) than 3 100 damage hits. 
---
Oh, and if you get the Scrapper perk (I'm not sure what level that unlocks but I think it's early?), you get a LOT more steel when you scrap weapons. So like, if you normally get 4, you get like 20. It's super helpful early on to get enough steel to make ammo, and repair guns and such.
---
That's much less encouraging haha. Yeah I'll have to test it later to find out for sure.
---
This is great work, I've saved it for later. Although I can't really use just plain armour without legendaries on because the ledge bonuses far outweigh the basic extra damage resistance, I have almost completed my set of Reinforced (red) Heavy Combat Armour to role play as a Fire Breather or just a fireman.
---
When/if they allow us to upgrade the heavy/medium/light quality of armour, perhaps with the Legendary Vendor thing, this chart will be of _extra_ use
---
I've done this so many times haha. We need an "I'm sorry, I'm a dingus." Emote for us panicked game players.  
---
Launch on the queen and only kill adds
---
How is it immersion breaking if it's literally a real-world holiday translated into the game?
---
I switch worlds every 3 nukes so if you can’t get in message me on Xbox and I’ll invite you when I get in a new server 
---
great, thanks 
---
So why do Anti Armor Laser rifles and Plasma Guns exist in the game if the perk doesn't work for them?  You mean to tell me there are broken perks in this game?  
---
that explains it , thanks
---
fair enough
---
I have a bloody .50cal but would take a serious caps offer for me to get rid of it as it's my only heavy that I use for the queen only. 
---
Distant Thunder will drop PA plans, but 90% of the time you just get T-60 Motion Assist Servos again. Best method might be doing treasure maps in Cranberry Bog, but you'd be incredibly lucky to get all the parts without trading.
---
I'm usually able to craft \~150 .308 bullets before I log off every night, but they disappear pretty quickly and I end up using my fire axe and pipe revolver "sniper" more than I'd like. I have rank 2 Scrounger but it seems like I get way more fusion cells, 10mm, and .38 ammo, than .308.
---
Thanks! Removing my custom .ini fixed the problem. 
---
im still getting the "not prepared yet" message from the master of ceremonies, its 17:56 uk time :/
---
Does it have reduced weight bro? 
---
This is excellent!
---
yeah, that's a huge problem with proof readers, but thanks to dyslexia a read by spelling words out and missed that entirely.
---
its 7, it even says on it and has them all listed.
---
Feeling your pain bud :( 
---
This looks like fun. Shame it is 7am and I'm on a bus to work 😣
---
Its only harassment if i chase you to a new server or say something vulgar over the mic. 
---
...well I can definitely show you a higher level   
---
If I give you 100 Wood and Steel to fix your shit shack will you stop crying? 
---
I'm waiting for the black one. :) 
---
It's not. Just need to revamp the idea. Say keeping an enemy near the area. Like draw in an enemy and build around it. 
---
Downside is the CAMP owner will not be able to FT out.
---
...one click fix
---
Mothership zeta was a crappy dlc. Let’s not bring it back 
---
Source:  no one participating in servers im in. If you're looking for a link to statistics I obviously don't have one.  You can tell most people aren't interested because they don't participate
---
I think I know exactly where you're talking about. A huge group of ghouls spotted me from the road below when I was harvesting it. That seems more central too to make fast traveling cheaper. My current C.A.M.P.'s location also means I run more places to keep my costs down. Thanks!
---
If its not then its not meant to be on sale lmao
---
Yep, and even when the home consoles launched, they were still social in a way. I had the neighborhood Atari. Another kid had the neighborhood Intellivision. And yet a 3rd had a Colecovision. So all the kids would rotate between those three homes during the summer.
---
Yeah well, game mechanics working as intended. 
---
We constantly look for other 4man high level groups (found a few this week, some kicked the hell out of us lol), but even after many server hops on the nightly they are hard to come by in the wild. Not from a lack of interest or trying though. 
---
🤷🏼‍♂️
---
There was an old glitch where this was true. It isn’t anymore 
---
Does this event only happen once a day? Like if I’m not there at 3PM EST will I have missed it for the day?
---
I hope not! :(
---
How did you paint your gun, I have that option in my workbench but i have never seen a paint plan before, do I get them from somewhere else than normal plans

copy and pasted straight off their page.
---
I hope Bethesda sees what this is doing to the community and continue releasing content like this, player interaction is the thing that will keep this game alive 
---
The pieces were all drops. I'm currently building a Unyielding build..
---
Theres one on a dude in the Frat house too!
---
It really has.  I wish I didn't listen to the negative reviews. YouTubers were just lying etc etc I'm level 9 and this game is pretty great
---
hurr durr internet tough guy, actually 12 year old kid in real life 
---
your failed flex is funny though
---
good thing is soon you and your kind will have your own pvp servers so you can all circle jerk each other.
---
problem solved!
---
What page? Link?
---
Oh good it’s not just me
---
I'll have to check when I get home. I'm thinking it was a VATs and not weight. 
---
At 20 to 40 adhesive farm was a must for me.  Around level 40 I started finding enough scavenging (mostly from duct tape) that I didn’t need the farm.  I don’t know your play style. Wade airport (se of flat wood) has a good stock of junk and anglers west of the water park and Grafton) drop quite a bit as well.
---
you're the problem, pvp damage is level-scaled btw
---
You do you, I feel you should play how you want, if you are a Raider (I feel you are) then be a Raider. 
---
Though people in real life yell at raiders and thieves (and let's be honest Raiders ARE Thieves) so I really don't feel this as a toxic behavior. As a player of RUST this is generally your only recourse when you get stomped anyways.
---
That being said I play a more responders role as I don't like stealing or bullying (as most IG Raiders do, whether that is NPC raiders from other games or PC raiders from this one). 
---
Instead of insulting you (as I understand you find enjoyment in feeling powerful, and get excited knowing people are hunting for you in a game of cat and mouse for caps) I would ask for your IGN so I can add you to my block list and we can both play it the way we like!
---
I got a level 1 assassins wooden chest peice the other day....
---
Wait there’s a Lever Action Rifle skin in the atom shop!?!?!?  
---
Try server hopping Watoga. 
---
Wake up with your arm underneath a super mutant or ghoul corpse.
---
Does this only happen once a day? If I miss it at 8 UTC have I missed it for the day?
---
Vendors around watoga have them al the time. But I personally got a lot of mine from trading. 
---
If this gets you try to unsee all the left hand scanners on the right side of doors.
---
editted for information.
---
It's a good 1000 points less than most paints too
---
This is the one at the north West of the map I take it.
---
Pretty sure it’s always been there
---
I'm gonna nuke the site.
---
on my way
---
The generals steakhouse also has a lot of violet and crimson, and some cobalt, yellowcake, and fluorescent in the garden behind it. I got 120 raw crimson and violet, and 30 raw cobalt, yellowcake, and fluorescent.
---
shoulda traded, bro
---
And hire an interior decorator quick, because DAMN
---
Disclaimer: this is just my explanation of my thought process, and could entirely be wrong:
---
I would guess they're separated, since if you look at something like the Gauss Rifle, or Radium Rifle, they list damages as separate. Leading me to just consider them like 
---
* A- Ballistic Damage
---
* B- Energy Damage
---
* C- Radiation Damage
---
* D- Fire/Explosive damage and so on
---
So my assumption was they hit as separate chunks where every 'hit' is [A=100, B=0, C=0,D=20...], where each piece gets adjusted separately. That factors in the separate resistances per-piece of the damage.
---
It's also why things like "armor piercing" are useless for Energy weapons, because it's only factored into the Ballistic calculation and resistances.
---
Never have I nuked that far north of prime. Gotta try this sometime.
---
Well despite being in Passive, melee damage can easily break through you health the same way TSE did before it was nerfed. If I'm in Passive Move this means I currently prefer to play in PVE. To break through Passive and kill someone defeats the purpose of the Passive option entirely and those who do know it. That is griefing. 
---
Let's not forget the griefers who intentionally build turret camps in while springs in order to antagonize players into breaking these camp in turn flagging said player as Wanted.
---
There are griefers and most are intentionally assholes.
---
I actually witnessed a guy plug in his mic to apologise in the frat house he was pretty formal about it
---
Me and most people went into expected to play solo, and solo is a great way to play the game but it's so easy to meet new people and the community is really great and not toxic (unlike most games)
---
Now... Thats an idea.... Mwuhahahha
---
Why would i have to consider neuroscience to play a videogame. Im allowed to be a raider. 
---
How someone else interprets my actions is entirely based on their understanding of in game mechanics. The best thing i can do is explain how it works and what is allower by bethesda.
---
The more they know. The less they feel griefed!
---
I'll stop by 
---
Darn 
---
This is going to be me in a couple decades. 
---
Anyone who got the game expecting complete protection from other players was under a grave misapprehension.  
---
Drinking your own product might be a cause.
---
PvP is broken as fuck
---
Thanks pal although it is not the grandest thing to bare witness.
---
Well, the Devs removed explosive energy weapons from the loot table because energy weapons don't shoot projectlies that can explode (this is what they said).
---
Anti-armor it's just a random legendary mod, maybe someday they'll remove it.
---
Where is Helvetia on the map? 
---
Dude, I get it... you're a "wolf among sheep". You're a total badass. You are death incarnate. Whatever you gotta tell yourself to feel good about yourself, man. 
---
But, there a ton of players, into the playstyle of your game. You slap them, and it's on. So... go play with them. The fact you choose to do it to players who want nothing to do with it, is what makes you an asshole. Period.
---
Justify it all you wish. Literally nothing, despite your bait and switch thread title, will sway you. At no point have you said, "ya know, I see it from your point of view... I can use these mechanics to play the game I want with people who share my viewpoint, while allowing others to enjoy the game in their own way". You fail to see why forcing players to have to log off and restart their game, JUST TO AVOID HAVING TO PLAY WITH YOU, might be causing other players grief. Which is the LITERAL definition of griefing.
---
You have in this game, in the form of slap damage, a mechanic that allows players to notify other players that they wish to engage in PvP, and allows them to agree or disagree to PvP.
---
The fact you choose to chase players and use miniscule amounts of damage to kill them, or chase them off server, is not justification.
---
But, soon... you will have a 100% PvP game, in survival mode. and all your problems will disappear.
---
But my gut says you won't stick to survival mode... that you'll play vanilla 76, because *you enjoy abusing mechanics to harass other players*. You know it's true, I have little patience for childish arguments, and disingenuous philosophy.
---
AWOL armaments has a guaranteed 3-star end boss, but that's probably in the category of "more trouble than it's worth", unless you can kill level 52 gutsies very efficiently.
---
One hour to go before the Festivities begin! No update required, btw.
---
It also says “steal” when you shoot down a cargo drone, I’m not sure if those are bound or just random 
---
Just joined
---
The only lead node I've found so far is the one by the reactor, I believe, so I'll keep an eye out for the one you mentioned.  
---
My water purifiers seem to work just fine. I'll come back to my C.A.M.P. after clearing out an area and they'll each have 2 water waiting, but the plants rarely seem to have anything. And I don't think I've seen the Good with Salt perk pop up yet, but I'm sure there are plenty others I've yet to see as well. Thank you for the info!
---
Bought the game on sale for $17.00 totally worth it at that price point. 
---
Not right now.  You can just use them as posts underneath the floating floor to make it look like it has some connection to the ground.
---
Crouching only avoids cats until you’re hit with free aim. As a melee I shoot the ground near them once, switch to melee, and cats them.
---
A Tesla is also a great counter to stealth boy melees. 
---
Snape kills Dumbledore 
---
Do you remember which bench it was? There’s no marker for me for some reason
---
Thank you! Finally someone understands me!
---
No i just feel bad for them. I like playing the bad boy but imma good man!
---
No worries there, I don't play to often but I enjoy those who get into the atmosphere of the game.
---
That looks like the new paint job from the Atom Shop.
---
Had that same problem last night 
---
Would sort of nullify some perk cards such as the one that lets you harvest twice as much vegetation 
---
Lvl 125 50 year old here. If y'all see me and need something, just let me know. 
---
I just went straight to the Dome, server hopped and got it on my fourth try. Door was open/unlocked each time too!
---
I think that's an unpopular opinion. To each their own but everyone I know loved it. 
---
You probably hit it.  They don't like that.  
---
That's the exact outfit I typically run. It terrifies people. Really going to collect all these masks
---
It’s easier to just find a node with it and set up a camp there. You can find 6 veins in black water mine though
---
Not just me thinking 50 in a day is a bit excessive, especially when this is the second or third time weve had to do it this week
---
In the Forest North-Northwest of Sutton. Lil ol Swiss themed village.
---
Helvita , the bots will tell u what to do when u get there 👍 plus everyone on the map will be there lol
---
no, go away
---
Or maybe it would upgrade their effect. For example, what about using Exc PA arms combined with this idea on the pickaxe? Mining miracle
---
&gt; I saw Morgantown get nuked multiple times on the Nukashine launch day lmao
---
I was one of the first people back on my server after the patch, so as soon as I completed the quest I went and dropped a nuke on the 15-20 other people who were working on it. Watching them scatter was fucking hilarious, and worth the salty messages I received.
---
Wash was killed by Reavers.
---
Yes, the razorgrain soup is amazing! I'm sure it's anecdotal, but it seems like it lasts longer than other foods too.
---
Power armor will always be the inferior choice for a lot of stuff until they give us legendary pieces.  Hopefully coming someday, and they remove those useless Wood pieces from the drop tables.  The only real reason to continue running power armor is for serious nuke zones (Scorched Earth) and Stabilized for heavy gunners.  Whitesprings nukes are easy enough to do with just a hazmat suit and the right mix of perks/mutations.
---
So tell me, do you really belive that the fact that Camps are destructible by other players is a huge bug that no one ever fixed?
---
I'm level 79 and still try to avoid them
---
Maybe we just have different views and we don’t need to use appeal to popular opinion arguments. 
---
You should randomly get a rare traffic cone. 
---
Got in...dam that was smoooth. I'll follow you as long as i can ..or til i run out of ultracite ammo
---
Thanks for the update.  I was having fun popping the balloons when I went to check out the crowds of people already there waiting, I love the interactive details like that.  
---
Xbox crashed...ugh
---
Just tell me when and I'll be right over. As I'm of out to farm some metal.
---
Concur
---
I believe that this outdoor bar can be found in the trees up on the hill just north of Grafton.
---
Hey man mind I steal this and add it to my FO76 Google Docs? :) 
---
I'm asking the same to my self 
---
I camped outside the Vault Tech farm by Flatwoods and farmed the robots and loot inside.  Easy with melee, decent mob respawn  rate.  The only thing better (that I found) is a workshop. 
---
Should be up and running in about... 48 minutes from now. (Should be...)
---
Server hop or crouch and fast travel away. Ive had to fast travel away a few times. Most, if not all, wont memorize your name. Stay hidden for a while just in case.
---
Nice one dude. Will be switching worlds after the next nuke! 
---
I’m still holding! :) I’ll wait! 
---
I was being facetious, I know there isn't an actual source. I just think it's a bit presumptuous and obnoxious how folks on here state their opinion as fact and say that the majority of players agree with them based on nothing but their own anecdotal experiences.
---
I've only had a workshop attacked by a group of players with incredibly powerful legendary gear (sentinel assassin) who proceeded to kill me and destroy everything I built all of one time since release. Regardless, I don't just assume that's everyone's experience.
---
Its literally a full server of scorched queen fighters with a long que to get in. Pretty sure its just you.
---
The real place Whitespring Resort is based on is built around a sulphur hot spring that people thought was good for your health.  So that water fountain is the “healthy” water people came there for!
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greenbrier
---
is it time for me to burn my cash? oh yah.
---
Robots at Whitesprings have a hive mind. Hit one and they will hate you forever. You must quit and reload for them to be neutral again.
---
Yeah, I was pretty sure this was going to be the case as I move from zone to zone. Just wanting to know if I should keep watch for specific resources more than others.
---
Neat place for low level players. tons of gears, screws and a giant wood stack there. i used to keep camp just north of it so i can supply run while i waited for friends.
---
I had the same problem with my Brahmin and for a while I was having to pop disease cures like smarties while using my instigating fire axe (double damage if enemy full health).because the plague walker was clipping their health just enough to render my fire axe nothing special anymore, best thing I did was clear my mutations till it was gone, me and my moo are best buddies again now lol
---
&gt; Blowing up a C.A.M.P. does not make a player a griefer.
---
Poor word choice on my part. I'm still in Minecraft mindset half the time. Absolutely correct; the game even gave me a darned perk card out of one of the packs to make me better at blowing up C.A.M.P.s. 
---
Awesome, I am gonna give some tweaks a go now and see if I can finally get this thing to a playable state.
---
Hes on the bridge in helvetia. (Across the river from horizons rest if you havnt found it yet.)
---
But its not up yet, when spoken to he wishes you a good day and says the festivities arent ready yet.
---
Insane down there! I've been on many queen runs, but this group is insane! &gt;5 minutes a kill!
---
That's why I said to each their own.
---
Didn't they say they were changing eventually so pacifist mode takes no damage?  I thought I'd heard that but could easily be wrong.  
---
Thanks 
---
knowing bethesda they DID fix it but then posted an older version of the update where they didnt change the value...
---
either that or they forgot to hit save changes &gt;.&gt;
---
Is is the blue paint from the poster? 
---
If you have any interest in PvP I highly recommend investing in the Overly Generous perk and pairing it with an over-repaired handy blade. 
---
I had my C.A.M.P in that same spot for over 100 levels. The junk extractor for me is the best resource for my C.A.M.P you will get screws, springs, gears, and etc.  The workshop at Poseidon power plant has resources for lead and nuclear material as soon as you hit level 25 get yourself the excavator power armor then head over to lucky hole mine a few server hops and I have 600-800 lead. You will need acid to break down the ore which can be tricky I get mine from Yao Guai by the mountain side b&amp;b 12 acid a server hop and they always spawn.
---
thanks, was searching south of Grafton, will try there
---
Yea man 
---
Sometimes. I was able to add things but not remove it. However my friend could do what she wanted with it
---
I think the pikaxe one is actually already in place. Just have it equipped when you click on the ore.
---
Bought the lever action skin. I really want a shiny pump action skin now.
---
 I really wish they would just separate the servers into purely PVE and purely PVP.  
---
Feeling lucky to be off work at 1. 
---
They just didn’t design it that way, but hopefully an adjustment is made there to even the playing field.
---
Though they did design it so that if a teammate initiated pvp with a player, and the damage is returned, the whole team is now flagged. 
---
Unbeknownst to the rest of our team, a teammate of ours shoots at a player only to find he was immediately eliminated by him. We didn’t know what happened as the fella tracked and shot the rest of us each one at a time. Was a pretty funny way to be made aware of the mechanic. 
---
No.  You should still be able to be murdered. 
---
No Idea, the parade has not started yet.
---
You know brother! We still got another 3 nukes to come after this nuke in a minute! I’ll be switching worlds again after this nuke though! Message me on Xbox and I can invite you 
---
Oh i had a pickaxe but also never noticed this. So, i just would like to apply this to more things
---
I've received the Greek letters plan 3 times. *sad face*
---
On the bright side, I got the Red Any Lager on the first day, and that +50 carry weight is worth hunting down ants.
---
Its towards the left side of the toxic valley, bordering into the Forrest region. Look near the farm there and the mountains. 
---
^^^^ ✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼
---
how long is it offered for? is it limited time? 
---
Does anyone know how often you can repeat it?
---
What is ws? 
---
Me too! Level 103. At my age, instead of fighting with people I would rather build my camp.  Last night I built a barn with a full blown basketball court on the side.  It was that or watch Wheel Of Fortune with the wife.  : )
---
Spoilage!? Literal game changer.
---
I sent you a friend request,  same name as here. I have cards and will launch if tapped to run one!
---
as many times as you want
---
How does that work if each player gets unique loot?
---
welcome to the wasteland
---
ive been through both sides of that nightmare, buying a house and now trying to sell one
---
good luck and glad to hear you found a way to escape that stress for a bit
---
Was talking w/ a 115 earlier today.  
---
Told me if you server hop, likely will not get the plan because one of the door/key codes will change/is different on each server.
---
ergo, you have to pick up all the keys, access the domes, and open the door on the same server.
---
Agreed, it is a SURVIVAL game. People can be harmful or helpful, don't trust everyone
---
 Pm’ed you
---
Rookie numbers
---
While I agree with the sentiment, I think it could be presented better: there should simply be little to no reward for server hopping.
---
They've already started with Vendor inventories.  That's definitely helpful
---
For things that are not supposed to be rare, like main-story quests, this would be spawning enough of whatever is necessary so that people can get the job done without hopping around.
---
For things that are meant to be rare, make them rare on a per-user basis.  One possible example, off the top of my head here: any time I check an ammo can, there could be a 1% chance that some unique quest item type thing will spawn, and start a chain to unlock a rare paint job .. something like that.  And this roll can only take place once per day.  The first ammo can you check rolls the chance, and if it comes up negative, you're blocked for 24 hours.  Server hopping doesn't reset the chance, so there's no benefit.
---
It could even work like the Prize-Bot that shows up every so often.  Just a global whatever % chance, and when he shows up, it actually gives you something good (or a hint of something good to start a quest chain for something good)
---
I may have to reinstall just to buy this paint 
---
IDK if it's just me but it takes about 30 seconds for my CAMP to spawn and another 10 for the building to completely appear.
---
I'm sure they're working on it. The radio's been gone since a couple days into the beta and the last update finally added it back.
---
I want those balloons (and the ones from Vault 76, and the ones one the lemonade stand) for decorating my camp for festive events!  Put them in the Atom Store!
---
/u/Ladydevann
---
Is it a limited time paint or a permanent addition 
---
I don't know... Didn't static make the Hindenburg blow up? 
---
;)
---
Enraged Grafton vanished for me yesterday as well.
---
Happy parade too man god bless you and this community
---
Whitespring
---
My downloads run faster if I close open applications. I believe there's network prioritization at work, and an open game throttles background traffic.

last night i had the strangest thing happen, both myself and my teammate got 1 shot by a lvl 80
---
we hadnt taken any workshops, we hadnt started any pvp
---
we were in whitesprings and the guy just came up while we were repairing our weapons and killed us with a supersledge
---
bam, that was it
---
then the guy messaged us both in shock, saying he didnt think he was going to kills us, and then dropped us ton of loot
---
so something very strange happened there
---
must be the European spelling
---
Hi all, this is something we're actively working to support and will share more info on this as soon as we have it.
---
ok... why?
---
The only part that’s going to suck is not being able to tell my Excavator and my X01 in inventory anymore.
---
The important thing is moral choice. Evil has to exist along with good, in order that moral choice may operate. Life is sustained by the grinding opposition of moral entities. 
---
only 2 per character btw
---
Upvote for outstanding use of reddit instead of going to google.
---
Ohhhh I'm excited to get home and start this quest!
---
[One can be at the Pleasant Valley station, under a skeleton laying on two suitcases on the loading platform.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sack_hood_(Fallout_76)).
---
Had a 2 star eneny drop a 1 star armor yesterday, so it's a till broken. My guess it's try to give incompatible effects to the same item and then one supersedes the other.
---
Nah it's Fallout, a lot of people go solo and Bethseda knows that. Nothing personal, but if I could play without any of you that would just be great, but I'll take ignoring yall for now. 
---
Depends on how pvp is initiated. If no bounties are present then it’s how many levels you have completed on your player, half awarded to your killer and half is eaten by Beth. 
---
Example 1. A level 250 tired to fight you and you kill them, you get 125c and 125c evaporates. 
---
Example 2. A level 250 has a 10cap bounty and you kill them, you get awarded 5 caps. 
---
Example 3. A level 15 has a 10cap bounty and you kill them, you again only get 5caps.
---
Example 4. You claim a bench and flag pvp on the current level 250 player that owns it, you kill them and receive 125caps. 
---
Hope this helps give perspective. 
---
That's 48 mines, by my calculations.
---
Get any Sledge/Axe with 40% faster swing speed. 
---
Tremendously better than All Rise.
---
All Rise is the perfect level 30 weapon. Bad for level 50+ as there’s many options at 50.
---
I did that numbnuts, 2/3 of the links are broke or they only include 1 kind of PA.    
---
You guys aren't very good at pleasing your fan base.
---
No. It is a permanent item
---
I scrapped a full chess set and several robot figurines I was saving for the inevitable "decorate my shit" update.... Woe is me.
---
So then play one of the other Fallouts
---
This would be fair if they weren't working on a distinct Survival mode, separate from the main game (I think the main game is called Adventure mode, iirc)
---
Pacifist should be fixed in Adventure and removed in Survival.
---
I'm assuming its on a cooldown timer though
---
The only reason I'm still in T51 is b/c I dont have one of the T60 legs.  
---
Granted, I could put one of my extra T51 legs on the 60 frame, but you know....
---
I like the idea of this if it were in tandem with individuals being able to be part of larger groups such as a collective of raiders or enclave etc
---
Phoenix has all the mods, but I don't think any vendor sells the plans for the actual armor. 
---
*Puny humans
---
fixed that for ya
---
This is a bit annoying, since i avoid alcohol and chems as much as i can.
---
Ahh okay thanks 
---
I would argue that asshole=griefer in this context.  
---
Slap and no response- move on. No one cares. Slap for 30 minutes while using 'come on' emote? Asshole griefer. Similar variations apply. If they do not want to participate and you try to force it you are griefing. Period. End of discussion.
---
Yeah that's what I meant. 
---
Yes it is rare. I spent a few hours server hopping for a friend until I found it.
---
Ah dang it there go my atoms
---
&gt; This is a toxic point of view. 
---
No, anyone that thinks any of that is OK is toxic.
---
It's a bit much to expect compensation for a bug related to free content. Expecting bug free (as possible) content in the future? More understandable. 
---
Thanks  sure I'll add you
---
I rock T-60 all the time (unless I'm over encumbered), and I'm also shocked at how few people use it.  It's pretty friggin durable, and if it does break it only requires steel, plastic, and (I think) some aluminum to repair. 
---
I used to play this one when I hosted Saturday morning shows on KWYR 1260. Great tune, love to have it in the game
---
Trust me I share your frustration. Last night I found a beautiful spot to set up my camp and a nice place to also put and extractor on a lead deposit. In the process of building a new building I ran out of concrete so I fast traveled to Flatwoods to pick up my normal few concrete scraps but they were all taken so I visited the local vendor and purchased one  concrete bulk. Afterwards, I also purchased the same from a couple of other vendors. When doing so I became over weight. Normally I'd have on my power armor but as luck has it for some reason I'm going through one fusion core per game play now...go figure so, I took a chance and unloaded some somewhat important items in a suitcase that was off to the side with all the intentions of coming back to hopefully pick up the 200 rubber scrap, 500 bulked cloth and some other scrap that I usually use to sell daily since I'm trying to save up for mutations that cost almost 4,000 caps. Not a ridiculous price considering caps are real easy to come by in the game. ( Yeah right)  So right after I unloaded the scrap into the suitcase the server stopped responding. I lost all of that suitcased scrap. Nice, right? Wait though it gets better. I logged back in to the game and fast traveled to the Whitesprings bunker where I thought hey maybe its a good idea if I just spend the 311 caps on a fusion core so I could carry the extra weight around. Apparently, little did I know while inside the loading screen someone had launched a nuke in the area that I was headed too so the minute the game spawned me there...I died. What did I drop? Yep you guessed it 250 caps worth of concrete scrap!  I was pissed however, no problem  I'll just respawn there and grab my little brown bag.... nope can't respawn in an area in the blast zone,said the game. So I respawned as close as I could and low and behold the game respawned me directly under a ScorchBeast and in sight of all of his beastly friends too. I died....three times and relized that I lost all of that concrete scrap, caps, time etc. etc. So yeah...I understand your frustrations. 
---
I'm not sure anything is really missing per say, I'm gonna have to switch around the party perks because I don't have friends to play with. I hadn't really planned on using power armor (personal preference) but seeing stabilized makes me think that it may just be necessary.
---
I personally think it looks like a pretty good base to go off of, then again I'm still pretty new to 76 so
---
To quote myself:
---
&gt;It doesn't matter that the developer put a way to run away into the game.  \[...\]  If you are trying to harass them to the point they use the run away mechanic, you are griefing.
---
Oh my!  I gameshare with my buddy just to play this, then ended up buying it for my other buddy in canada so he could play with us.  Super fun!
---
Holy jesus. Newsflash- entitled dickwad keeps digging even after reaching rock bottom.
---
Same here, everything spawns in peice by peice too
---
Interesting.  I haven't paid close enough attention.  I've scrapped lots of stuff and have gotten "shadowed" but I've never paid attention to what as I only use BoS combat armor.
---
I still find legendaries dropping one-stars, but since they aren't affixed w a star on their name, they won't count for my Officer on Deck commendations.
---
Thanks man. Sucks I can't get that loot though.
---
It'd be a real shame if someone were to drop a nuke... 
---
You heard correct. They are also wanting to extend that benefit to your CAMP.
---
I had to go run an errand. You guys done?
---
enjoy your bolstering wood leg
---
A wise man once said:
---
&gt;No.
---
It's already easy enough to avoid being murdered if you don't engage.  All you leaf-eaters should stop whining about mean raiders in a post-apocalyptic hellscape and quit asking for further hand-holding from Bethesda.
---
If you're not using in-game mechanics, you're "just" harassing someone.  Griefing is in the context of a game and thus requires game mechanics.
---
Damn, well looks like I'll be hopping more
---
Lots of junk to be had.....
---
Yeah, we won't know the specifics for another half hour or so.
---
İ tried server hoping but Failed to find the Event
---
\^ Me too \^
---
Where the hell is helvetia??
---
Lol me too!
---
No we are dropping 3 more after this one. Will be going into new server after this nuke 
---
Is it worth it?? 
---
You can buy them at the raider vendor in sunnytop.
---
I've seen all all versions there at different intervals.
---
so u mean zealots? so a legendary weapon with zealots will do +30% damage to scorched AND mole miners??
---
Ahh okay thank you. 
---
Apparently you don't realize that "run away mechanic" does not literally require the person to run away.  It could even be in the form of a switch that disables PVP.
---
"They don't get to make me feel bad because I mad them feel bad."
---
What level are you? This quest gives you an AWESOME reward that will be leveled to your character. Getting a low level version of the All Rise is a real waste. But I can help you either way. 
---
The way I saw them making a separate mode was because of so many people whining that others could kill them without fighting back. H*ck, even in Minecraft there is PvP in the game. 
---
Pacifist is there to prevent you from accidentally starting a fight with someone bigger when in a raid (such as SBQ). It doesn't need "fixed." It does what it should 
---
Sunnytop? Will keep that in mind
---
I've run a couple of people thru that quest bud. I might not be able to get on tonight but I could help you tomorrow unless u get a quicker offer 
---
Lol.. I’m not sorry you are clearly making a stupid assumption on your jump-to-conclusions mat over there. I primarily solo pvp most of my hours played, group pvp is a separate activity. Guess being smart  and playing by the rules means I think lowly of myself?
---
Thanks for the attempted public shaming I hope it made you feel elite for the  2 seconds it took you to type that out.
---
More than happy to go 1:1 anytime. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Sensible game design is something still creeping up on Fallout 76. Give it a few more years.
---
Best comment!
---
It doesn’t start for another 30 minutes. 
---
Okay, I'll watch for the friend request. The materials cost of crafting PA parts is really cheap. Much faster and cheaper to to craft than to hop around looking for a lucky spawn. :)
---
It also sells the assault gas mask 
---
This is what I intend to put in trading forums. Look good? Feedback is appreciated
---
Looking for a good SMG/AR with a respectable modifier nothing op or super rare. I have the following. I can also trade for other none rare stuff like good CAMP plans.

I'll only trade people with established Reddit accounts. I have very little caps on me so I won't be expecting it as a fail safe. I can reserve an item till I have more caps for a safer trade if requested. 
---
Aren't starred legendary creatures supposed to drop loot of the same star level? 
---
If it helps, the excavator armor and the lever action appearance are not short sale items
---
Like pacifist mode? That’s something we have in game. Or do you mean block? We also have that in game. 
---
You’re just getting overrun by Scorch Beast and Security Bots. I recommend a lot of Stims and Med-X. Also if you’re a Melee Build drugs Psycho will work great. I finished it solo. 
---
By Sutton 
---
Step 1: Wait until 3pm EST.
---
Step 2: ????
---
Step 3: Fasnacht!
---
 Try staying in the elevator in sneak mode. Open the door every so often and toss some nades. And use VATs to shoot out their thrusters. 
---
I put a comment detailing what I intend to post. Check it out and let know what you think please 
---
Thx bud
---
[Comment in another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2z6rk/balloons_in_helvetia/eiw45mh/?context=1000) by u/Valseek said it's about another half hour off. 3pm EDT/7pm UTC
---
It's not that rare.  It's just new.
---
Would have been, minus the data mining...
---
I’ve accidentally hit one when fighting some super mutants on the perimeter of the course to the south.  I went through the fence up the hill went into sneak until it said I was hidden.  I waited a few minutes and when I went back they no longer attacked on sight.  This was a month ago so things might have changed wouldn’t hurt to try so you don’t loose the loot.  
---
You’re showing as offline. Can’t join your game. 
---
What Platform are you on? 
---
I keep 2-3 characters in the level 5-10 range to help new players. I just kind of let them lead the way and tag along, help kill things(Much more fun than getting "help" from a level 88 where they just murder everything), give them small tips, and hopefully they have an awesome first/near first experience. 
---
İts can be Done i wish Bethesda make's such basic thing
---
Like I've got the patience to go through another couple weeks of challenges. I need them NAO!
---
Ah yes. You are one of those toxic “superior personality disorder” type of people. You ruin the game. Many of the people who play Fallout 76 are kind and gentle people, and then there are people like you who like to harass others through a game. It really shows that you have a lack of respect for others. 
---
awesome, thank you!
---
I'll try that if it happens again. Thanks! :D
---
Just bought 2 Hunter's Coats so I'm broke ATM. I won't be in expecting cash as a fail safe for now. I'll rely on players with established Reddit accounts 
---
There should be a manual shake weight-powered device we can use to charge cores while players walk around.
---
I don't think extremely high DR/ER matter all that much. There is definitely diminishing returns after 300 or so. Haven't done any experiments but I feel like having % reductions are far more valuable than straight DR/ER. So beyond dodgy (30), lone wanderer (20), and nerd rage (20), you can add cavalier/sentinal as well as the -Slayer pieces. Blocker/fireproof are great as well as serendipity.
---
I've tanked SBQ plenty of times with about 350/350 and about 40hp. Radiation and poison get me more than physical/energy damage. Nothing in the game gives me much issue. For PVP, DR/ER don't matter at all.
---
I kind of see your point, but I honestly don't think that giving someone a level 1 BOS rifle and a set of level 1 leather armor is going to accelerate their progress too much.  If they don't want it they can sell it for all I care.
---
The broken PvP 
---
Arguably, step 2: FASNACHT Step 3: ??? Step 4: new rare masks
---
Yeah. How do yours spawn? Maybe it's a mechanic. Mine is turret, generator, appliances/stations, walls/foundation.
---
New theory. We can now make booze. Drinking Booze gets you Wasted we are the Wastelanders.
---
You see it's not an expansion it's a prediction.
---
Oh, ok then.
---
Is it out for a few hours? Is the event being reaselaed in 2 hours? I’m confused.
---
It's also fun to place some sneaky frag mines near the water fountain...
---
Oh man I have found memories of that song. 
---
When I was younger I heard it over at my grandfather's house playing on his radio.
---
Both of our first names were John.
---
He said if I liked it that much I could have a copy, so he sat me down and helped me record it onto a Cassette tape. He passed a few years back but I still have that cassette tape with Big bad John and a few other golden oldies.
---
It's funny I just thought of this idea instantly after reading the title of the sub. I guess that makes it a common sense solution but that's running a little low nowadays 
---
I have seen this before "Sorry I hit you I thought you were a ghoul" Then the abuser states I feel terrible about what I did it was a accident and you can't stop thinking about her this is going to end bad. I hope she gets smart and hits you upside the head with an instigating super sledge before you end up accidentally killing her. ( Hopefully I did not upset the PC police)
---
TLDR #2: The community is the most overlooked solution to many problems because there is so much focus on the experience as an individual. What the game mechanics cannot provide, allies can and WILL act as a buffer and in many cases a legitimate solution to aggression. Make friends with bloodthirsty players that align to your sense of ethics.
---
The best counter to perceived Player antagonists is other player antagonists. I guarantee a that any pacifist in this thread could secure the IGN of multiple players that are ITCHING to test their aim on a CAMP smasher. In-fact, they would likely be grateful and swoop in any time you asked for protection. (Might sound like a racket, but it IS a wasteland scenario we're dealing with, here)
---
Hear me out... Anecdotally, I have plenty of friends that play this game the same way they played FO4, laden with junk, carry perks abound, stuffed to the brim with caps and generally appearing as a pack Brahmin to potential raiders. Those same people will not hesitate to reach out to me (I consider myself a High-Threat Responder), or other people that I play with that enjoy PvP. What generally transpires next is the actual contest. Maybe the antagonist finds they bit off more than they could chew and leaves, whining about our gear or cheating. Maybe they call in even more friends to try to level the playing field or get an advantage. 
---
Regardless, this has 2 major effects on the experience of my friendly loot pinata. They retain zero attention of the aggressors if they don't engage. They can spectate if they like (bloodthirsty voyeurs they tend to be), or they can leave and carry on. 
---
The second effect being that the aggressors are getting exactly what they asked for, and people like myself that enjoy the tug-of-war are given a chance to play the game we want.
---
It's because they copied the Marine armor description straight from FO4, without realizing how much they nerfed it.
---
Pretty much the same as yours
---
There you have it.
---
You expect people to change m their RP choice, while using the in game mechanic to match your opinion, or use the game functions to limit their RP experience to match your opinion.
---
You are simply an arrogant person who thinks their opinion of what a game experience is objectively correct.
---
You misuse game mechanics to harass people into pvp against their RP wishes.
---
You are a griefer.
---
Also a dick.
---
Let me explain this again since you didn’t read my comment.....sigh. I said I’ll be there to drop anyone trying to trick noobs into pvp during he event or goin around shooting people trying to have fun. Now if that isn’t more easily explained to you then hope is lost. I’m not toxic pvp is toxic, Reddit is toxic, people siding with trolls (seemingly you) are toxic. Please do enjoy today’s festivities as that’s all I and most people want. Also please do a favor and read the post really well next time.
---
WANT
---
Gotcha. Makes sense because the water purifiers still have dents in them they just look freshly painted
---
And you are right about the stealth being a factor. Sometimes if you surprise an assaultron it goes hostile. I've had it happen a few times.
---
So u either caught it with a stray bullet. Some area of effect damage like grenades. Or u surprised it.
---
Nervous picky darn robots 
---
Some people watch TV all day but will tell you you are wasting your time playing games.
---
Kinda neat to see your base build section by section. Like having a cutaway diagram of your base. Takes forever. Noticed an indicator they are checkpointing a bunch of somethings. Could this be the cause?
---
r/quityourbullshit
---
I think it might be that one.
---
I am level 224. Most of my friends are lower than 100. I don't like PvP, am always in pacifist mode, and I really don't like the fact that I lose so many caps when all I am doing is visiting a friend's camp to use a stash box.
---
I was trading with a level 75 last night, some guy came in and killed us both without a second thought. When I hit ignore and reloaded, he killed me before I even managed to spawn completely.
---
I agree that people overuse the word griefing but I disagree that destroying a camp is not griefing. Bethesda specifically marketed the camp destruction mechanic as an *anti-griefing* feature before the game was released. The idea being that if camps couldn't be destroyed players would use it to trap other players inside indestructible buildings.
---
This obviously turned into the exact opposite of what they (say they) intended. I think their admission of this and the plan to remove camp destruction for players in pacifist mode tells you everything you need to know.
---
I fully expect Wastelander to be the debut of non robot/super mutant NPC. 
---
My current theory, is that we will likely see a former responder or person who had family in the responders return to WV after finding out that someone has been accessing Responder training and such. 
---
People have speculated about the BoS and such, but the Responders is a fresh new faction for Bethesda to explore, and I think they will likely lean that way. 
---
I also expect it to be the debut of the first "settlement" type place. Likely set up by this returning responder and a few random. It may be located on the main map, but it may also be more like destiny's tower. 
---
You nailed it, directly north of the Grafton train station marker about level with the top of the water tower image on the map
---
It's beautiful. :o
---
Bout damn time. Thanks for the update OP
---
It is very soloable, with very few exceptions. If you have (or make) a friend, a duo can do damn near anything. 
---
If you are patient, you can do anything alone. It will just take a long time to clear a silo or take down the queen.
---
&gt; When I'm on the level up screen, it will not allow me to select any strength card from the deck because I've already allocated 15 points to the category.
---
Sure it will. It won't let you allocate any more points, but you can still pick a card from any stat. Go to the level up screen, pick a SPECIAL point (let's say AGI), and then when the perk card selection comes up you can use the filter buttons (LB/RB on xbox) to switch from the AGI cards to the STR cards and pick on of those.
---
Straight to insults, rather than actual discussion, noted, and filed under "no valid opinion that holds up to scrutiny". Got it.
---
My behavior is a constant known part of the game. Its a feature therefor it cannot be toxic. 
---
Do you think people are entitled to verbally harass raiders who destroyed their base, stole Junk or killed them?
---
They shouldn't be afraid of altering the map or making even permanent changes. 
---
I don't know, and for your second question the event is released in 20 minutes. 
---
Dude, he's level 16. The level 40 glowing mole miners would wreck him. For that matter, unless there's a high level player in the area, it'll probably only spawn the lower level miners anyway. 
---
and yet, a large portion of the community believes it does.
---
Why is your money worth more than theirs?
---
After all that, I went back to that DMV with mayhem on my mind.
---
Be glad of respawns, newbies.   I wreaked terrible vengeance apon that unholy relic of the old world. 
---
A mere nuclear apocalypse was far too lienent for the sins committed there.
---
That's my wife. If I sat on the couch and watched TV instead then it would be acceptable
---
Yeah I know that. I realized it right after creating the comment.
---
I die as a result of PvP far more often than I kill the other player, yet I still actively seek it out.  
---
PvP is only fun when you win?  Perhaps for sore losers.
---
Is this a one-off time-limited thing? If I'm not online in the next hour am I going to miss my only chance? 
---
I have to prepare for the midterms, and they last through the whole event... make those masks rain for me friends.
---
Like I don’t want the event to be on only once per day...
---
i think its closer to 20 hours or so
---
Been like this since patch 6
---
For me it has always been 12 hours, who knows maybe they changed it today!
---
thank you, i was googling what it looks like i'm at work! lol
---
r/oopsdidntmeanto
---
They should give a notification that there’s new stuff in the shop on main menu or something then because if it’s seriously a one day thing how are people even have enough time to buy it
---
Players can still cause the destruction of a camp outside of PvP.  You can lead mobs into someone’s camp then stealth.  The mobs don’t always switch aggro to the camp items, but they will sometimes.
---
I hadn't noticed anyone mention it and the plans had been buried in my stash somewhere lol.
---
I got kicked from the server 3 times at the end of it
---
I only feel guilty when they get upset over the mic... Sometimes they are super mad and its just akward... Cauwe im trying to bait them further to gain caps... They clearly are having a bad time. 
---
Come on man, you know theres raiders running around these parts! 
---
I would prefer if every player knew and understood the mechanics, risk and what is allowed.
---
I dont think im quite at the full 12 just yet, ill try to remember to update this to confirm
---
If I remember right, I read that in an upcoming update they're gonna allow players to to rank up in a sense to "prestige" once they reach a certain rank. Hopefully this will do the Specials reset. But the "prestige" will give bonuses as well. Exactly what, no idea yet. 
---
Yesterday I did one at 11am and there was another one available around 9pm. It reset in less than 12 hours. However, now it is almost 18 hours later and he still doesn't have a new quest for me yet. So... I have absolutely no idea. 
---
I'll be on in 4 hours or so. PM me your GT and I'll hook you up. I have the perk that repairs power armor to 200% durability and the one that greatly reduces repair costs, so you can just give me your chassis for a couple minutes and I can pimp it out for you.  I haven't used raider in 100+ levels, so I'm not sure which mods I could add, but I'll see what I can do.
---
Also, if Uranium Fever is running I'll help you with that. All you have to do is stand in a safe spot and tag the enemies while I mop them up. You'll get more nuclear material, gears, and other crap than you can carry, including 3 legendary items.
---
It’s a neat place. Glad you found it again!
---
Thanks Kingsmokeyyy
---
I gain PvP access to bounty hunters and other players i kill for junk and caps. Its how i farm
---
Also remember to server hop at least once to register the reset! Always helps me!
---
Neato
---
Shotgun and rifle build 
---
Scrap every gun you find in early game 
---
Do it solo. Baddies scale to the players inside; I first ran it at level 16 for the Order of Mysteries questline, then farmed it 25-30 while getting screws so I could make and scrap handmade and lever action rifles for mods. Didn't run into level 46 assaultrons or 52 gutsies until I did the enclave questline in the late 40s. Skip the soup and go straight to the dessert. At your level, a level 30 robobrain that you can snipe from the room above and to the right of the main chamber should be the big baddie for Sugar Grove. He literally just blows smoke; VATS through it.
---
No profit?!?
---
Nah, I use workshops for gathering materials and Yeh I kill people who steal from then or try and take them from me. 
---
Using it for fast travel is bollocks lol, I don't take them if there being used to farm. 
---
I don't go around following people until they retaliate, using slap damage, destroying someone's base because it's just there or stopping the responder vendor bot spawn. 
---
The guys posting clearly states he's a dick, I just made a point that there is no need and that if he wants real PvP it's out there, I get together with numerous pvp players without having to go around pissing people off. 
---
You are clearly salty for some reason.
---
Now imagine doing that quest back at release when the server crashed every 10 minutes. 
---
I suppose that’s fair enough 
---
You’re welcome 😊 
---
Now with 100% less school bus
---
I'm not able to right this moment, a few  chores 
---
I’ve wasted soooo much plastic like this
---
flatwoods
---
That's not a very safe paint color to be using in a dark mine expect to recieve an OSHA violation.
---
Because finagling janky, limited roofing tile options into the semblance of a proper roof builds character! 
---
And *don't* get me started on how some roofing tiles hang over the wall edge, and how some are flush!
---
I I understand now, it draws people to you. That said if I was drawn to someone I'd get that bounty, the only way people profit from a bounty is having a shit player come after them.
---
Literally have just been walking along minding my own business and been one shot, multiple times.
---
Thread was meant to define griefing and explain mechanics to players constantly suprised about how pvp works and whats allowed. 
---
Not "this guys an ass megathread"
---
Your comments are not contributing, they are only making thr knowledge gap wider creating more grief for the pve community!
---
Cue the "ALL FRAT GUYS ARE ALCOHOLIC, RAPIST, WOMEN BEATERS" brigade
---
There were a lot of early posts that weren't tagged as spoilers with images.  It took mods a while to get it under control, and as a result of clicking a post that wasn't marked as a spoiler I had already read the general location of the plans and how it had been done.  
---
I'm not asking people never to ever talk about it. Just be kind about putting a spoiler tag and not putting and key into in the title.
---
Could be that one of you have that mutation that does a tiny amount of area damage while diseased. That counts as initiating PvP iirc.
---
The end of the world is nigh. Oh no. 
---
Or maybe someday they will fix it to work as intended
---
It is. That's why I'm asking.
---
Loving this new paint, tbh I havnt got excavator PA only because i hated it's original colour scheme lol.
---
This new paint is seriously making me think of getting it now lol
---
So he can get off killing people who want to ignore him.
---
So I should just accept that because many people feel I'm wrong that my opinion about something that belongs to none of us is less valid than theirs? No! I'm going to share my opinion because my opinion on this matter is worth just as much as any of theirs, including your own.
---
I’m sadly still working on fully getting the stupid power armor 😞
---
Kinda still like the yellow better, would love to see some green millitary colors. 
---
Just got components for my new rig, so ill be working on that, but I could probs throw something together. don't have many of the mods as I don't run PA. But if someone wants to help me gather the numbers, I can organize em.
---
PSA:
---
This is a fetch quest, for the parade to start, we need to find the robots, but each of the robots has tasks for us to complete before they will join the parade:
---
Hello Tourists. I am the Gleeful Butcher. I make the sausages and then march in the Fasnacht Parade, in that order.
---
I must finish one task before starting the other. I need small animal intestines to complete the sausages.
---
Fasnacht Lanterns are unique, hand crafted items. Until I am restocked with beeswax from the Honey Haus hives, I cannot march. Will you help?
---
Intruder alert. Invading bees have robbed the hives. They must be destroyed. The parade cannot begin until destruction is confirmed.
---
Eggs required. Last known good location by stream. *bzzt* Standing by to resume Parade March protocol when count is valid.
---
Merry Fasnacht to you. Do you have a donation of wood for the bonfire? I cannot march in the parade until we have a good size pile. It's tradition.
---
I need old Fasnacht steins from Helvetia town to analyze so I can replace corrupt data and complete my data set. Retrieval of steins is requested.
---
You are now authorized to decorate this room for the Fasnacht festivities. Select from the four decoration boxes.
---
I can craft it for you..?
---
Considering all the other bugs in the game..... Are you honestly going to say its not a possibility?   
---
You're not contributing any good, dude. All you're doing is sharing how much of an ass you are. Being wanted and having a bounty, and then trying to bait players, just makes you a giant fucking asshole. You're not cool, you're an asshole. You're the problem. Just because it's in the game, doesn't mean it's "encouraged" dumbass. You're a griefer and an asshole. Deal with it.
---
Good to hear
---
Really?!
---
It just adds them to your crafting list and doesn't give a note (likely so people can't farm them on multiple characters and sell them)
---
Most people in this game are shitty at PvP and don’t understand that most PvE builds will get destroyed by a basic PvP build. Those people feed you caps when you have a bounty
---
But how to build the Alpine Horn?!?
---
I can't find it in my CAMP build menus. :-(
---
Still waiting on more weapon skins...
---
Seriously, 2 is insufficient.
---
Watoga spawns of PA include the locked room in the transit center, the floor of the civic center, the roof of the high school, and the crashed vertibird in the center of town. There probably are other spots that I can't recall. 
---
Just because its a feature doesnt mean it cant be toxic.......  
---
Should people send them freshly baked cookies instead?   
---
Other instruments are under "chairs" - maybe "wind instruments" with that poor lonely tuba? At work so I can't check myself.
---
It really depends on what sort or build you’re going for.
---
Do you want to carry a lot? Run fast? do a lot of damage? If so rifle or melee? But what about sneak or mutations? 
---
If I were you I would check out a couple perk build planners on google and see what you like the best. 
---
There are a lot of different play styles and you will be giving up one thing for another in the end. 
---
I run two characters with the exact opposite builds depending on what I’m feeling. 
---
Thanks,I try that out.l probably respond with the result 
---
But where do you find it?
---
I believe I need like 20 more screws and I should have everything thing I need! It just been such a grind lol 
---
Oh wow. Thats so freaking nice. I´m on Xbox one. 
---
You can absolutely share your opinion, but expect to be questioned on it. As it stands... you didn't answer me.
---
Those who enjoy the PvP are getting an entire game mode catering to them. Why is it such an affront to you that the other vast number of players want slight tweaks to the way things are now?
---
Happy to donate if you’re on PC - have plenty of screws
---
Yeah, to be clear, that’s more an end-goal combat perk loadout, I’m on PC and I use Perk Loadout manager so I’ve got a bunch of different cards I quickswap based on what I’m doing; the build I linked is my general combat build. At lower levels you may want to use something like Luck of the Draw to reduce your repair frequency (at my level/damage output I don’t have to repair often, and am swimming in materials to repair with if I do) and maybe go 5/5 Gunsmith and forgo Nerd Rage, for similar reasons. 
---
That it’s a data mined cheat, my bud got it and was said he felt dirty about it, was curious.
---
I check it every day just in case
---
Where do I get it?
---
How is power armor inferior in pve?
---
Whelp.
---
I'm going to be buying some ATOMS tonight.
---
/r/nocontext
---
What time would you be on at and also my gamer tag is “ItsMajoraMask” and also are you a Xbox player
---
I’m shocked at how friendly this games playerbase is. 26 hours in and I’ve only pvp‘d once and had my base smashed once 
---
SO I tested out some ini tweaks and my game now looks pretty gross BUT it runs A LOT better. Kinda annoying how I can play FO4 on Ultra (minus shadows which are high) and I gotta tweak this game to have lower settings than are intended BUT WHATEVER I can finally now (maybe) play this game again!
---
I finally got it thanks for the advice 
---
Depends on what you're hoping for the end game. Focus on one style you like the most, don't try to be a  jack of all trades.
---
For PvE it's hard to mess up too badly. I didn't give it much thought for the first 40 levels, but I wasn't fully specced how I wanted until 70. 
---
Worst comes to worse, you can always change it after 50. I just started to change my build again.
---
I'm on pc aswell! Its about time I play with others haha.. I'll add you up
---
Leave it to Bethesda to screw up a lookup table. That is the most basic thing you learn in programming. It's usually somewhere around the second or third assignment, if it isn't included in an advanced "Hello World" program on day one. 
---
This was much easier solo than on a team. I helped a friend do this quest for a better level All Rise and the number of gutsy spawns was intense. 
---
It seems that Drills &amp; Syringers are still part of the legendary pool, not to mention the Legendary Ghouls at WS that drop only a Bobby pin &amp; Wonder Glue, after 4 of those in a row I server hopped.
---
It would be nice if it told us what number we are in the queue. 
---
I’m with you. It takes away from the game knowing you can’t be hurt by other players. 
---
Because I very much enjoy the game as it is now. I don't want to do a strictly PvP mode where it's just who farmed the best legendaries, and I don't want a wuss mode where everyone skips along and holds hands. I think they have a good balance of it as it is now.
---
If your lucky enough to find the random encounter with the Mr. Handy lemonade stand, he sells the lemonade and hard lemonade recipes.
---
You need both and lots of vodka.  The hard lemonade is a mixed drink.
---
I got a level 45 two shot sub machine gun from one of the ghouls (not a legendary) at the Whitesprings Gold Club yesterday
---
Put a brick wall door down with a foundation on either side and the you would be able to place another one down on the other side, and then just turn them both to a normal wall creating the interior wall. (If it hasn't been  patched)
---
I know. Its a pain in the ass! We need private servers 
---
Im stoked for survival! 
---
I didnt setup the game mechanics. Bethesda did. 
---
This unfortunate rift in the community where you feel justified being a jerk (and i do as well) is 100% caused by the way Bethesda rolled out PvP.
---
We disagree, but the fact that i can do these things without fear of a ban proves its part of the game and an intended mechanic.
---
Server hopping is the tool they gave you. 
---
I made this thread because i wanted more folks not to be upset. Obviously i dont enjoy causing misery. I enjoy pvp, raider RP, (other roleplay as well) and playing this game. I wanted to pvp on this engine for years!
---
Kind of a weird fantasy scenario you got going there. Ive met the type that you describe tho. They definitely exist but they arent me!
---
I stand with OP on this 
---
Definitely 
---
Wasn’t an even cooler (subjective I know) all black skin data mined..?
---
J47.
---
Processing.
---
A server browser would help tremendously.
---
I would also like to know
---
I just don't see the need personally, considering you can farm 12 cores every 15 minutes from the power plants, which take very little effort to take and hold.
---
Thank you.
---
Forever
---
ugh what a horrible thing to do to someone
---
If you really wanted to murder someone, you could kite an enemy to them, and let the enemy deal the remaining 5%. It’s unlikely, sure, but the people who are insistent on murder would prefer the challenge. 
---
YOU do. and many others don't. I'm here asking you why you think it's a fun mechanic to follow an unwilling player, slapping them until they die, or chasing them off server... is a "good balance". 
---
I have never heard an argument other than "cuz I think it's fun to do it" from anyone who supports the "way things are". 
---
Plastic and acid are the only "rare" junk, and even they're pretty farmable.
---
I killed a whitesprings legendary ghoul last night. Initial loot was just the standard random junk item. I walked around the corner to  check for more, came back about 30 seconds later and he had a legendary item on him. It appears legendaries can lag in spawning even if other loot shows first .
---
I’d pick up everything that’s scrappable for materials and mods.
---
heeeell yeahh
---
i had marsupial and speed demon, my teammate has talons..
---
and im sure we were both diseased with radworms, we always have radworms it seems
---
You'll have a full pvp server in a week. Just go there if you want to murder / be murdered constantly.
---
Same, tried it last night.
---
You're welcome.   We gotta help each other out while we're stuck at work. 
---
Not sure, but definitely seen legendaries "switch" corpses.  Could be glitch, but I've seen them bend over and loot corpses.
---
Welcome
---
is this the only one available? i dont like this one with red, i want the black one
---
You should be able to activate the horn to play sound, however it seems the volume is currently turned a bit too low. We're going to get that fixed up!
---
You are a beast
---
This game doesn't have a lot of end game, helping them skip the early game with rewards better than the quests doesn't help someone much. Early game is more or less the only part of this game that there is actual challenge or strong story or anything, why help people get through it as fast as possible to get to the "grind nuke launches 8 hours a day' part of the game? 
---
Thanks but I have already started making a set! I got the paint yesterday
---
There's another suit on the building next to the civic center that I access by going up the fire escape and crossing over.  It's not far from one of the radar dishes that you have to align for the Enclave.
---
I've seen the place get nuked because of that quest, lol.
---
That's fine, take it to the pvp server and you'll have the traditional survival game experience. Not saying that as an insult or anything - I'll be on it too.
---
Ok thank also what time would you be on and do you play on Xbox and my gamer tag is “ItsMajoraMask”
---
Then play on pvp server in 7 days.
---
You can also stand behind the elevator and they can’t target you if you stand in the right spot.
---
Except it's not.
---
Is it?
---
I was originally going to caption this “ when me and the boys get to group poop”
---
Yeah my gf has one from yesterday.
---
Yes they are in the game 
---
Not for me yet
---
Have fun and get some mutations.  The luck perk cards class freak and starched jeans are vital to using them.
---
Also, get on the market so you can get an idea of the game economy and what’s valuable.
---
I would like to not scrap certain items when I scrap all. Like the trifold American flag. Sometimes I mistakenly pick one up and don't realize it when I scrap it.
---
Have to relog for quest. 
---
Not for us yet
---
See but if there is a reset you should be able to keep your current perk cards and rank them up as well
---
No it’s not. One original guy data mined it but I found it on YouTube. I datamined nothing and it’s easy for everyone to get
---
What about a charging station that could very slowly charge cores (requiring large amounts of power, 100's perhaps), that required that you put in a core to remove a core.
---
Doing this would allow you to have player camps serve as supply posts in the wilderness. You can stop in and grab a fresh core, but you have to put one in to charge....that way players don't just run around the world stealing charging cores and giving more reasons for visiting other players bases.
---
Players could build camps as outposts, with multiple charging stations, player vending, brewing etc. etc. Could make it a bit more social as you find your favourite outposts to visit.
---
REEE
---
Cannot thank Smokey enough I've hit a few with him today. Top lad
---
Yeah, the master of ceremonies hasn't been made aware yet. Chilling with him and taking some pics while I wait.
---
Because at it's core, it is a survivor game. Go out, try to scavange, try not to die. That is why it is fun. If I want to, and I have, I can be on the side of the environment and destroy people. That said I've also been destroyed by other people. If they keep following me around then I can block them, I've done that too, so they can't find me. It doesn't seem unbalanced to me.
---
How is it a bad argument to say "I like this game the way it is because it is fun"? If you don't like a game then don't play. Simple.
---
Yeah, I have a bloodied with limb damage. It is a beast. 
---
Not yet
---
Still waiting
---
It’s not starting for me and this guy how did it start 
---
I have a hunters explosive hunting rifle. Got it 60 levels ago at whitesprings
---
Lmao I got this outta of a defense and thought I was gonna get a clarinet(I play clarinet) and i checked and got a tuba. The tuba is fine but I wanted something else.
---
Finalllllly some excavator paint AND it's cheap. Hopefully that will be a trend. 1800 caps for skins is a literally to pricey for me
---
you can pop the ballons just outside Vault 76 as well
---
They should add a sound when it all completely spawns. Like wood sticking together or whatever your building is made of.
---
Still not starting
---
Can confirm. Just found a 2 Star Legendary Hunting Rifle
---
Is "armor" only defined in relation to Damage Resistance? Wouldn't Anti Armor on energy weapons relate to the energy resistances?
---
Yea i said the same thing. I was like its weird how i havent seen a radstorm at all in this game. I then fast travel and a radstorm appears and im sitting there like wtf. Shit reads minds now!? Bethesda on another level. 
---
For those wondering but not yet in front of the game, i bought and crafted the new skins for the Power Armor &amp; The Lever Action Rifle.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaB0wfelAV0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaB0wfelAV0)
---
Thank you for this!
---
I shoot people at the scorchbeast queen event and I always say "Sorry my bad" even though they can't hear me but I would be happy with a sorry emote 
---
It's only from ore, mostly in Ash Heap. There are a few nodes for it if you're willing to move CAMP to one.
---
What about screws? They're pretty rare
---
The only reason I don't want to go to full out PvP serves is said best by a different redditer, I can't remember who though. But PvP is about killing them before they respond. I don't know if they'll balance it, but right now it doesn't matter how much DR I have, I'm still getting one-shot by people who farm and buy those OP legendaries. 
---
Can you dm me a pic of it on the map? 
---
&gt;Like what sort of perks to invest in
---
That depends on what kind of build you're going for. [This site](https://nukesdragons.com/) has a build tool that allows you to pick all your perks/specials and then gives you a roadmap of which perks you should pick at each level along the way. One thing for sure, when you hit level 4 be sure to pick Green Thumb from the perception tree. It doubles the amount of any plant life you harvest, which will go along way to keeping you well fed and healed until you have a nice stockpile of stimpacks.
---
Speaking of healing, one of the recipes you know right off the bat is Healing Salve, which only requires 1 soot flower, one bloodleaf, and some boiled water, and it has the same healing power as a Stimpack.  If you start at the overseer's camp and head south along the river you'll find a bunch of bloodleaf. When you get to the end of the stream, turn right and follow the dried up river bed. You'll find more blood leaf, glowing fungus (great for making soup), and soot flowers. When you get to the bridge, climb back up to the road and follow it back to Flatwoods gathering more soot flower on the way. Oh, and harvest some logs along the way. With any luck you should have enough materials to make 30+ healing salves. 
---
&gt;what should I do after the first couple overseer quests
---
I would follow the responder questline until you finish the quest at the airport. After that, do every event you can find in the forest. Most of them only take a couple minutes, and reward you with an assortment of chems, junk, plans, and occasionally legendary items. The Leader of the Pack event is guaranteed to have at least 1 (sometimes 3) legendary wolves.
---
Also, once you get to level 8-10, keep your eyes out for the Powering up Poseidon event to trigger. It'll take about 30 minutes the first few times since the building is kind of a maze, but you're guaranteed to learn generator plans the first 3 times you complete it. Getting a nuclear generator for your camp ASAP should be a priority because it'll power everything you need and uses a lot less budget than 5-10 small generators.
---
&gt;what’s the best build
---
Melee is OP at high levels, but any build is viable with the right combo of perks and gear. My character is specced for melee and shotguns, which is convenient because the perks for both are all in the strength tree, so I can swap cards in an out based on what I'm doing and go full melee, full shotgunner, or a hybrid of both.
---
&gt;how to build a good base
---
That's up to you, but I'd suggest placing your camp on a resource node. [This map](https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png) shows all the nodes, so pick one that you want to harvest and build there.  As a low level player, junk for crafting will probably be your biggest concern, so I'd suggest finding a junk pile somewhere near Flatwoods and building there. You automatically learn the plans for whatever extractor you need, and you can find it in the resource tab of the build menu. 
---
&gt;how to join the enclave
---
You have to go to a certain location in the Mire and fight 2-3 death claws in order to get the access card you'll need. I'd hold off until at least level 25 unless you've got someone to assist you.
---
Also, you can find level 15 Raider Power Armor at severla different locations in the forest. [Check here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_chassis#Power_armor_locations) if you want to know where. PA isn't a necessity, but it does make you less squishy, and the carry weight bonus is nice.
---
Just saw it on my server, but crashed while fast traveling to Helvetia. Now event on new server. 
---
Thanks bro haha
---
I kept seeing a loading screen mentioning that the Whitespring was known for its southern style and sulfur springs. I guess it finally makes sense now. 
---
Nice one bro 
---
I'd give you 1k for the Instigating double barrel, but I'm not on until later. Furious minigun should sell since the patch, and some of the instigating/AA/Bloodied stuff should have takers at 500-1k.
---
What you're asking for would normally sell for &lt;1k caps depending on weapon and modifier. A bloodied handmade is the top end of the one-star ARs at about 2k.
---
thanks a lot dude ! 
---
I'm french, but studied abroad in Sosnowiec for 6 month. As I come from a farm, some guy called me Rolnik, and it sounded cool so I kept it as a username. 
---
Saddly I had a hard time speaking polish. I mostly remember "poprosze piwo" and "dzekuje" :p
---
Depends on which one you’re talking about
---
Yeah no I get it,  the guy who data mined it put it on YouTube and everyone got it.  I just hadn’t decided if I was gonna grab since the info was gathered in a less than scrupulous manner and not as intended.  At this point though seems like it’s universally pretty spoiled so why not? My friend had to jump servers for like an hour so I guess that’s a challenge anyway.  It does look sweet!
---
I got Plague Walker so I don’t mind getting diseases anymore. 
---
Any way to get a pic?
---
Got them in a random container somewhere I think, but it is that long since I got them that I have forgotten to be honest.
---
best legendaries that always drop legendaries are the legendary wolves at whitesprings, it’s pretty good loot too, well atleast in my experience i guess.
---
Is it start at 3pm or what ? 
---
Relog!
---
I'm getting a lot of drops, but it's like all 1 star junk. I honestly can't even recall the least time I found a 3 star. It feels like a month or more. And I play a decent amount.
---
:O YESS Neet gun!
---
By your standard, why is it griefing to destroy someone’s camp outside of Morgantown, but acceptable to destroy a camp by the clubhouse at Whitesprings?  Do you not see the double-standard?
---
Plain and simple:  if I don’t like someone’s camp, I will accept the risk of attacking it.  
---
I won’t destroy it repeatedly; if the player travels to their base and engages, PvP on!  
---
If they don’t fight, I move on after doing the damage I want.  
---
If they hop servers, I never follow.  Not my style, and not worth my time.
---
If they complain to me, I tell them the wastelands are a rough place.
---
If I move on and they continue to send me messages, I report any abusive or harassing communication.
---
I’ve encountered camps where players hide punji boards in the grass and weeds.  If walking near your camp causes me damage, I will return the favor.
---
I hear that, I usually get on to do my dailies
---
Boooo
---
Yeah I didn’t feel guilt since it’s not cheated into the game and is free to answer your question 
---
It should be. I'm doing it now. 
---
I’m doing exactly the same thing.. master of ceremonies says come back soon, but I’m just gonna keep poking him and listening to his sausage jokes
---
Springs are far harder to come by. I've got over 500 held.
---
Hit whitesprings resort, tons of toys and fans.
---
Sugar groves has quite a few fans (and a shitload of clipsboard for springs.
---
Iirc scrapper perk gives screws from quite a few guns too.
---
I'm 305 on my main with a lvl 111 alt and a new 44 that will replace my main (retiring him as a crafter / mule). I wouldn't even say that I played a ton (I only have 330 hours played so far and I took a month off while the dupes and exploits were running rampant). However, I play VERY efficiently. Even 900 hours guy doesn't play as efficiently as I do (though he has a LOT of great knowledge and tips). In short: Two accounts, nuke whitesprings, park mule on server, rejoin mule over and over clearing out whitesprings as fast as you can (usually 7-9 minutes for a full WS clear). Ridiculous amounts of exp and legendaries. Point being, you definitely don't need to exp glitch. 
---
I think I've had 3 legendaries drop a legendary item for me since release.
---
Saw it fast travelled and in the process it ended I got nothing 
---
Yeah, somebody went through about 100 rounds of 5.56 popping every balloon he saw. Not me though, obviously. I'm not a child. And nobody saw me do it.
---
Welcome! 
---
And for the rest of your questions you can continue the  overseers quest which will take you all over Appalachia.   The biggest part of this game is exploration. There are probably still secrets people haven’t even figured out yet. This will also give you new quests. 
---
As for the Enclave you will need to wonder over to the right side of the map to the abandoned waste dump. 
---
Search around inside till you find some bodies and go from there. 
---
2080ti here and yes, but using DDU fixed it.
---
I'm sorry I didn't notice copying messed up my post. The Gauss is just double barrel. All of the above are 1 star except the fire axe.  
---
Hi! As you mentioned, Patch 7 should have fixed an issue that could prevent legendary enemies from dropping legendary items. Sounds like this bug may still be happening. I'm looking into this to find out more about what's happening there and will share details as soon as we have them.
---
&gt; You are not entitled to a SIMs experience in FO76, *or even Fallout 4.*
---
Gotta disagree with you here. At this point, it's totally possible to have a SIMs like experience in Fallout 4 with the right mods.
---
Did it get nerfed or kited to prevent folks from farming legendary?
---
Does this apply when someone nukes WS?
---
Haven’t been over to WS after nuking. Just grinding 
---
My build is a power armor melee build (lvl 45). I frequently run out of adhesive, so I’ll make sure to check at the airport
---
If the feature is perceived as toxic then its Bethesda who is to blame. 
---
Not the customers who purchased a pvp survival fallout game looking forward to playing and enjoying pvp survival. 
---
It aint right that i have to take the heat. So what can i do?
---
Well, i can do my best to let people know what im doing, how Im doing it, how to avoid it. Thats all i can do. Im not changing the way i play but i can be a resource for understanding the pvp mechanics a little better. Maybe that will help people be more chill about raiders... That my line of thinking anyway.
---
I knew i was walking into a hornets nest when i made this post. 
---
Looking like they lied 
---
Yep it was no clue when it comes out tho.  I’m waiting for the prototype Ultracite paint
---
For 800 it’s definitely worth it! Been waiting for Excavator Paint for so long! 
---
I've never actually got any kind of screws by scrapping guns. Do you need high intelligence or something? Most of the time scrapper just increases the steel output. Do screws drop only on high level weapons?
---
Than you misunderstanding then.
---
Try quitting and logging back in

Lolz I asked the same thing awhile back but got downvoted meh
---
Again, giving players the ability to thwart griefing does not mean you are not griefing.  It means you are being unsuccessful at griefing.
---
And under this particular mechanic, you're still harming the other player.  The bullets don't pass through you, so you're tanking for the mob that can then kill the other player for you.
---
Wasn't explosive effect dropped from 100% to a 45% damage boost? 
---
You are worth whatever your level is.
---
?
---
Grind =/= Challenge
---
i'm pretty annoyed that their claims of fixing missed attacks upon entering VATS are, in fact, the opposite of reality, and now my chance to hit upon entering VATS just sits at 0% for a while, now. sometimes exiting and re-entering VATS fixes it, sometimes not. with my crit-focused build, it's kinda hell.
---
I might just be conflating from fo4. I just usually mash spacebar without looking these days (I run mods thats show what scrap junk turns into, and the mod that prevents scrapping equipped/favorites.)
---
Its a prime now too.
---
50% more to scorched, 20% less to everything else
---
Exllosive
---
+30% to animals 
---
Armor piercing mods.
---
How long does this event last? I want to collect them all :)
---
"HEY YOU, GET DOWN YOU AIN'T NO CAT!"
---
I've scrapped and picked up shadowed on something as well, it just wasnt leather limbs. I could be unlucky though.
---
Ah well, I'll just keep playing. I'm bound to figure it out at some point. :)
---
I have a heated rocket bball bat (lvl 50) with a lvl 2 slugger perk and the one that makes you swing faster. That usually works but sometimes if they are tougher I take a psychobuff and that does the job
---
Well, they nerfed automatic critical hits and called it an exploit, so anything is possible.
---
Maybe scratch that???? Lowered the shadow distance and resolution next to see what that would do and now the game runs worse?????
---
Changing the rules to fit your desired style of play is an option. So is cheating in that respect. The default settlements can and will be attacked by mobs. Not sure what you're disagreeing with, here.
---
Gotcha- I was almost super excited haha. Oh well!
---
Bloodied has not been nerfed. Adrenal is working correctly now and not over buffing which it was between the second last patch and the latest. 
---
It sounds like you weren’t controlling your variables. You were comparing Sturdy BOS Combat with Heavy Polymer Combat. 
---
That’s not a worthwhile comparison. 
---
That’s like saying “my reinforced level 50 combat armor has better armor than my Polymer level 20 combat armor!”.... like, yeah, that’s expected 
---
I'm bad at explaining things buy I'll try. It's basically just a long note that has 3 different pitches. And since it comes with the mannequin attached to it you dont get to blow it so theres no new animation. But I still like having it
---
Yeah yeah i know. Your not happy bethesda made a pvp enabled game and apperently im an ass for playing the game differently than you.
---
I honestly think the way your speaking to me is worse than anything ive done in game.
---
Why cant i use the features of the game to its fullest? I like the challenge, i like the heart pounding risk. Im not interested i picking flowers in nuke zones with you guys. 
---
You can always server hop. I dont understand your anger. I also think you are ovjectively wrong. I've never griefed anyone imo.
---
k
---
My point is, separate PvP servers and modified Pacifist effects won’t end griefing;  PvE servers will just have griefing without PvP’ers able to come to the rescue to assist with the true griefer.
---
You done right by us with this one Bethesda! I may no longer rock the excavator set, but loads (see what I did there) of people can be happy with this price point. 
---
You fucker😂
---
Well i'll try and test it myself. Perhaps something can drop screws. Usually i have enough but as soon as i try and craft a bunch of weapons to scrap them for mods i start running low. 
---
I meant I take workshops from people who hold them purely for fast travel, not so I can use it for fast travel. 
---
I regret purchasing it. I can't blow into it myself and you can barely hear it. 
---
I’ll join message my gt TeamKillTyrant 
---
you gotta go in the settings to do it. I discovered this a while ago
---
I wish they’d let the community vote on a permanent change. I’d love to see top of the world cleaned up and used as a played hub. 
---
The only difference is the color,  maybe red has to be bought a blue is free..?
---
Haha I know right. 
---
My sister uses T-60 bc of the BoS paint jobs. 😄
---
🤣
---
I like you.
---
Time to get your parade on, because the Fasnacht event is now live until 6:00 a.m. EDT / 10:00 a.m. UTC on March 26!
---
A furious drill that added +1 to damage per hit could be devastating if they calculated it like that
---
Yeah, the bounty that you get when you attack one is also a bug.
---
Same exact error code as before? Numbers and everything? Maybe you tried to login at the very same time they were turning on the new DLC today.
---
i bought it as soon as i saw it with my pocket full of atoms.  It looks great and I am super glad Bethesda listens!
---
The sound of bricks smashing onto concrete
---
Adrenal has been fixed. It was broken two patches ago and was over buffing, but it was corrected in the last patch.
---
Nothing fast travel can’t fix lol 
---
Can we make it so that we only contract one disease per login? Like mutations? 
---
I seem to contract diseases like they are going out of style. 
---
Yeah it’s been 20 hours for me, I tested it the other day and it was basically 20 hours to the minute.
---
Rambo?
---
Just finished the event, got the owl mask
---
lol ill take my chances with different pve/pvp servers
---
im sure it will be much better with out the griefers
---
Well I went on and did a bunch of other quests leveled a bunch and went back to it, and it worked and I found the bloom hah! 
---
\[spoiler\] About the parade event ending.
---
&gt;!A legendary sloth spawned at the end of our parade. I'd politely suggest tagging legendaries and letting other people get a hit in on them.!&lt;
---
You only can get that once. You need to do events for the rest
---
Have QoS or bandwidth shaping on your router?
---
Not a server issue as I'm on a 16Mb connection and usually see ~2MBps download. So its using all of my bandwidth.
---
Got close to the end and got disconnected :) I’m dying inside 
---
They never have
---
Don’t feed the Yao Guai.
---
Diseased converts up the legendary in the name
---
How often does this happen per day? I'm at work!
---
I hope it was someones pack mules
---
I didn't even know legendaries were meant to drop legendary items until I read this... They never seem to. 
---
Why do you need a team? Everything is level 5 its easy as watching paint dry.
---
I hate pvp and the pvp mechanics in this game, but I have to admit, you are right. That fear of the unknown gives the game a little excitement. The areas I frequent, I know what spawns there and at what levels. I know when to switch my guns for what I'll be fighting. The random player element keeps me alert and on my toes and gives variety.
---
Will the donuts turn into yellow cake?
---
Game not joinable your offline
---
I think the patch is working as intended, it’s the drop table that needs fixing; eg I’m pretty sure Non-Legendary Drills are still on there
---
Bethesda is trolling dupers ! LOVE IT ! 
---
Awesome! I hope that still works when I try it tonight!
---
You made my day - I was sure you're Polish, since 'rolnik' is farmer in polish and no other language. And looks like you've learned one of the most importand words - how to order a beer and thank for it! If you'll need help in F76 do not hesitate to ask - we'll figure something out ;)
---
Come join our faction were all looking forward to this event https://discord.gg/dKWSKd
---
True
---
I'll redownload it and hit you up fam!
---
Also: Let us scrap Legendary items, BUT make it so that scrapping a Legendary will guarantee a recipe unlock if you have any remaining left unlearned - to include the weapon/armor recipe itself.
---
Wait fr? But.. But they showed a mega sloth?? Maybe itll get harder as it goes??
---
How you get it to start the robot keeps saying it's not ready 
---
They should add an option to weapon, armor, and maybe power armor workbenches called Legendary. This option would let you add the "Unscrappable" legendary prefix to any non-legendary items. :) You could also remove th "unscrappable" legendary effect only. Or maybe they'll work that into the upcoming Legendary reroll / vendor system? Would be cool.
---
Nice wave of stuff. Definitely will pick up the Alpine Horn, and might get those weapon and armor paint jobs.
---
But what I’m REALLY waiting for are the Prepper Trapper outfits and Travel Sticker Pip-Boy. Both of those couldn’t work better for my character.
---
Probably will, but a way to kill players is still integral to regular gameplay. Imagine not being able to kill a player who is destroying your base!
---
Science breaks all the rules
---
I've had the "rare" weapons drop from legendary creatures instead of actual legendary gear a few times. Drills, crossbow, Tesla rifle. Pretty annoying. The creatures weren't the Boss creatures that should drop the rare stuff either; this felt like it was given _instead_
---
Couple of posts up.
---
And don't get me wrong, I go around with pacifist mode on because I don't want to initiate the PvP... Usually... But I do enjoy that it is there and sometimes I choose to go or not to go to areas based on people being there
---
Nice. I need to make an account for discord but you can tell me om reddit when you do it. Just dm me.
---
Can you fix Biv too... He's way to quiet. Especially when there's 5 or 6 other people in that little room.
---
Drops from census violence 
---
I do think im objectivly correct. I am absolutely allowed to play the way i do. 
---
I shouldn't have to feel guilty about it either. You guys need to learn the rules and adjust. 
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148
---
Sounds good man!
---
The event is on a one-hour timer from the last time it was started in that world. For example, if it takes you 20 minutes to complete, it should be available again after another 40 minutes. 
---
There should be a few of us on 
---
Well... What did you do to deserve the ban?
---
If the ban was because you did something and are guilty as charged then you deserve to be banned as long as they want you to be.
---
Don't cheat.
---
Had like 3 honey beasts throughout my first. Font think we had a single player under 100 though
---
Thank you so much, that is really helpful, God bless!
---
Kill super mutants. 
---
This pretty much encompasses my experience with this game as a whole. I got kicked 5 minutes later lol
---
It’s very unfortunate the thread was deleted.  The truth is hard for many players to accept.  When separate PvP servers are created, PvE players will still encounter actual griefers that aren’t shooting or slapping them.  Their camps will still be attacked, just in different ways.  The difference is nobody will come to their rescue because PvP won’t be allowed.
---
I fucking wish someone did that on my server. That would be so much fun, imagine all the glowing enemies!
---
What level are you? People are getting fog crawlers and death claws.
---
I mean. There was one. He died in moments. 
---
You 100% are allowed to play the way you do, which is like a knob head.
---
We are 100% allowed to call you a griefer and a knob head.
---
You just need to learn the rules of reddit and adjust.

OSHA has heard and acknowledge this concern will be giving a citation to Hornwright Mining Company. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.
---
Sorry I got full fast entire server was at the place :/ 
---
There a is a boss, but you really want other people for the set up tasks
---
Crashed as i fought a legendary sloth. Didnt get to finish the event. Kind of a bummer
---
What I've read it'll be available for a week. Can't wait to go home too and collect masks
---
Level 64
---
Ours was a mix from 240 to 14. I feel bad for the lower levels but they got masks too.
---
Un lootable for my Team 
---
My first thought this morning was "someone's gonna nuke the parade". Don't be sorry, it's brilliant.
---
Midwestern brotherhood power armor
---
The secret to Mr. Gutsys is a technique I like to call: Shoot them in the dick. By which I meat target their thrusters and go to town and they'll be scrap metal in no time. It also helps to bring any Troubleshooter legendary weapons if you've got them. Power Armor is a must. And a good heavy weapon appropriately perked would be a good idea (No energy weapons tho. They don't do squat against robots.)
---
That wooden inlay paint is noiiice
---
Wow. Ok. Sick. Thanks!
---
How was it?
---
I’m at sunnytop station now and there’s a sack hood with hoses and a sack hood with straps, for $8 each, so I don’t think they’re rare, you just need to look in raider shops
---
Lalalalalalalala. BOS 4 eva!!! 
---
Hmu my psn is viv198222. Might not be on today but tmrw for sure
---
I've been playing since bata, i dont recall any servers dropping every 10 minutes
---
It’s known as the enclave power armor from fallout 3 now
---
[https://youtu.be/Z-1ik3S6Ct4](https://youtu.be/Z-1ik3S6Ct4)
---
LOL first event on EU server failed.
---
Can some one please explain where do i get the meat in there. 
---
What's that look like?
---
The event is on a one-hour timer from the last time it was started in that world. So, if it takes you 30 minutes to complete, it should be available again after another 30 minutes.
---
Well considering my current character goal is essentially to become the Blair Witch I'm not judging. Now if I could only find the damn halloween witch outfit...
---
They call the numbers and that's the names of the ghouls coming at you... LOL
---
Ah, my CAMP is gonna get nuked...
---
Damn
---
Same happened to me, feels bad.
---
There's a beekeper one outaide the honey hous. You gotta kill honey beasts to make hin go.
---
My guess Would be one per hour so next one in 25 min i guess
---
Excellent! Thankyou!
---
I got a fasnacht beret and soldier mask
---
Yes! We're going to crank up Biv's volume with an upcoming patch.
---
Dont know. Just did it once. Got a mask and confetti plans.
---
Waiting to see if it repeats.
---
Joining
---
Its annoying as fuck
---
It’s annoying but oh well.
---
same.. glitched in a position you could just walk through
---
I just did it, and basically the entire server was there. Benefits of new content 
---
Griefers are not solely tied to PvP, don’t you get that?  If anything, the griefing will become worse on a PvE server.
---
Two items from the parade I’ve seen 
---
Ours turned to plasma goo and was unlootable too
---
Aww damn, I ran in that place like 4 times but didn’t even see him
---
From the event or random spawn?
---
Nooo those are the gas mask kind, the one i have is a full face mask that has no stats at all
---
They'll always drop _some_ thing. The problem is it appears drills and syringers seem to be loaded into the legendary loot list RNG and to my knowledge neither has any legendary variant.
---
Alright.
---
Thanks val
---
Are you sure? Because I haven't done any Enclave events, and I'm at 5/10 commendations. I've killed one scorchbeast, and the rest were from legendaries I fought during Uranium Fever. I guess it only counts legendaries w stars; kinda dumb that this game includes legendaries without stars (ie "diseased" or other suffixes)
---
Owl Mask 
---
https://i.imgur.com/RQ7wKoj.jpg
---
I have run into this issue also.
---
Not sure, finished it, server hopped, then didn't see it again yet
---
Yup, as many users have been mentioning since beta, drills, syringers and 1*only wood armor.  Not to mention the gun types that don't have proper legendary versions.   Not sure why these additional items weren't addressed when the flare gun was removed from the legendary drop table.  Seems like one of two things needs to happen:  1) Remove drills and syringers entirely, and restrict 1* wood armor to 1* enemies; or 2)Add legendary drills and syringers, and create 2* and 3* wood armor variants.  It's so simple, it boggles the mind how it's still an issue.  Would literally take a few minutes to fix in xEdit.
---
He was out front, in the road. You may have been running in through the back.
---
Cool my dude
---
How did you get 2 masks ?
---
I got mine from the Event, there's a random spawn for a Mask? 
---
Honey bot is the one your missed
---
Yeh I've played since then and have no recollection of this either....
---
legendary mega sloth at end
---
Any word on the Camden Park Daily Quests not activating for many, many people? Including myself? :( 
---
This quest got a lot pf hate, but I LOVED it. It was hilarious and didnt take itself seriously, but at the same time was a seriously accurate representation lol
---
Just looked it up, no there isn't anything. Just shoot em in the head.
---
same i thought the mannequin was a reference for scale but no hes tacked on it for no reason let me activate the horn not this plastic loser
---
I'm thinking it fires at the same time accross all servers. Totally untested theory though
---
Dunno why this got downvoted, it's kinda true LOL. Doesn't mean the event is bad!
---
I got a mask and a mask plan but I can't seem to find were the mask is in the armour bench
---
I've gotten an owl and witch mask so far.  Also balloon and ribbon plans.
---
By bonfire one do you mean the candlemaker one? Cuz if not there may be more than 5 and which 5 you need ti get are random.
---
Idk it's why i asked.
---
Run around the area looking for squirrels to kill then collect intestines from their loot, 12 needed in total.
---
The mine where the uranium event is.
---
Theres like 15 ore nodes in the first cave area. Ill make a video when I get my new rig put together.
---
Yup. And it wasn’t stealth. The patch notes say they reverted Adrenal Reaction’s damage formula to pre-patch 6 levels (IE patch 5 and before)
---
I assure you if it was a guy instead he still would have spooked me into getting hit a few times LOL.
---
This is a misundersranding of pacifist mode. It doesnt protect you from me. It doesnt guarantee your saftey. 
---
It simply means YOU cannot hurt other players. It is not an end all be all immunity blanket. You still have to escape me before i SLAP you to death. I would suggest block/server hop. 
---
Its not griefing to kill pacifists.
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b31mm1/does_anyone_know_how_often_the_new_event_can/eiwhxp3/) is a comment from a community manager about the timing of the event. 
---
800 atoms for a paint on a PA that everyone uses, that price alone made me buy it. Hope they keep that price point in mind, very reasonable.
---
Dang sorry to hear. 
---
I dont recall that one. We had one where you had to collect 10 honey fron beehives so that he could make candles.
---
nope, it wont
---
if you cant level my base, and you cant kill me for no reason, ill be a happy camper
---
i mean, have fun kiting enemies into a base to get your griefing fix mate
---
but i think ill block you as you seem to be hell bent on being an ass in game under the guise of "its not griefing!!!! its pvp!!!"
---
Got the owl mask. Event was awesome, loads of people there. Marching music was damn funny.

Straight up Oktoberfest in March, BEER AND SAUSAGE!
---
You wanna play together I'm on PlayStation at tessiesgametime
---
I got a mask and a hat, but no plans
---
Yes, since last week's patch.  Combat Knife here -- vats makes it even worse. 
---
I do feel like it's something to do with server lag though, as it's not *all* *the time,* but often enough that it's frustrating as all hell.
---
Okay! I joined a server that was just starting to escort the parade. I got the toothy man mask 
---
I'm really excited about the cooler. Hoping it means we can storage food without it spoiling (as quickly, at least).
---
Not in the head gear?
---
You want the devs to sit down and recode the game because you wasn't paying attention? That seems reasonable.
---
From the event
---
I nuked the Fasnacht parade and its made it very difficult, in fact we just failed it because theres no small animals nearby now... whoops
---
Completed the event. 
---
Had to find 5 protections dotted around the town and complete a task for each so they’d go line up in the street. All were fairly simple grab/deliver tasks. No markets for the items they were asking for though. 
---
After this, escorted them around the town. 1 wave of radtoads, 1 wave of super mutants (with suiciders), then when we hit the church - legendary Megasloth. 
---
Went down too fast for me to see the level.  
---
I got a Witch Mask and Flagpole plans. 
---
I was only able to get it with one legendary and 9 events... But that was like 4 patches ago so who knows...
---
No I checked each section and just can't find it
---
It's going to take a long time for me to redownload this, I'll send you a request in the meantime 
---
If Fallout with coop is what you wanted, this event nails it.
---
I don't know, that's just what dropped. Im assuming rewards depend on how many robots are alive by the end
---
whats the beret look like
---
Are you in a group and using Strange in Numbers?
---
It’s not your bloody weapon, they haven’t changed. But patch 7 corrected Adrenal Reaction’s  damage values back to pre patch 6 values, however, the bug with Strange in Numbers and Adrenal Reaction that arrived in patch 6 is still present; namely, in a group, using SiN, but far from teammates? Adrenal/SiN can actually apply negative damage, or simply completely neutralize and do nothing at all. 
---
Rewards so far:  
---
Recepie for fasnacht lanterns  
---
A mask of a giant.  
---
Nope, all of the robots were alive and there were 20 people
---
'It's funny because it's true' kind of moment.
---
Probably for the new sausage recipes 
---
Oh you have settings set to where I can do send you a request, send me PSN: Gamecreator2002
---
Neat! The Bonfire effigy sounds really cool.
---
Have you learned the plan yet?
---
Not the same. The one without straps and hoses isn't a gas mask and is rare. It's sold by raider vendors for cheap but it's worth a lot on the player market.
---
Someone nuked Helvetia just before the event started on my server. No mobs spawned. No little animals either. Event failed. 
---
Which system are you playing on?
---
Yes it was and old man mask or something like that
---
PlayStation 4
---
I actually got a drill dropped for the first time ever just today. Usually it doesn't happen to me though i was fighting quite a few legendaries.
---
So I'm going to go out on a limb and say you popped on today for the parade and haven't actually played since the last patch. Trust me, if bloodied was nerfed in the patch you wouldn't be the first one noticing and pointing it out a week later.
---
Rewards -
---
Fasnacht Witch Mask
---
Plan: Fasnacht Snow Flake Decoration
---
You wanna play together I'm at tessiesgametime
---
swing speed knife and martial artist works bette bud
---
all of them after next tuesday
---
This has happened to me too
---
It's an orange and white checkered beret. I'll try to upload a pic.
---
Lol, probably! We had:
---
Collect 50 wood for a bonfire out front the church
---
Collect 20 eggs from the creek
---
Collect 10 stein mugs
---
Play music with the Music Bot
---
The last we were unable to locate but it seems like it was probably the bee hive one
---
ps4 and 2 handed meele
---
Sort of true. But Bethesda themselves said that some items are “exceedingly rare”
---
I think I just ruined a lot of people (including my own) first ever attempt at the parade :P
---
Hard to tell the dark color: is it black or blue?
---
They are got one Plan 
---
I got Fashnacht balloons that sit on the ground, similar to the ones you can find in Helvetia, and the owl mask. I love this event. 
---
Thanks for the reply to the community concerns. I just wanted to point out that there is indeed a bug where legendary enemies may not drop any item at all from the legendary table on top of the possiblility of a non-legendady drill and syringer, along with a bug where Wood armor can never be more than 1 star. 
---
I'm pretty sure that's correct. We had one robot blow up and I ended up with the bonfire plan and witches mask. 
---
It crash when i push a button when it says “push a button to start” (seeing for 0,5 sec corrupted save data)
---
There was a Bethesda post on someone elses thread that said they are looking into the low volume issue.
---
The only time I remember this happening was when people tried to launch all the nukes at once in a small area and it crashed the world a few times. ...But that also wasn't nearly as often as "every 10 minutes" lol.
---
We had:
---
-collect honey for candlemaker
---
-kill honeybeasts
---
-collect eggs
---
-collect steins
---
-play music
---
You don't benefit from damage reduction legendary pieces (assassin's/sentinel/cavalier/etc), there are no explosive mitigation mods (no dense/padded options).  The only thing for damage reduction on power armor is Emergency Protocols, which only is of benefit at low health.  SPECIAL boosts are very limited from power armor too, just underarmor and some +1 STR pieces will increase your melee non-PA damage easily past your PA melee damage.  No strong unarmed weapons to use in power armor with Talons mutation either.
---
Awesome! Can't wait.
---
Yes, and it doesnt lower that either
---
Don't know yet
---
The mask should be in ur clothing items
---
Youve hit the event twice?
---
Was there someone in patriot T-51 with an LMG shooting the sloth? If so, that was me, and the sloth was only level forty IIRC.  
---
While I also feel the woes of the DMV, but being a resident of California I learned of the wonder that is the CA DMV App, that allows you to schedule advanced appointments easily and skip the whole line. It’s a godsend.

---
Just to let you know, the Fasnacht confetti has a terrible glitching texture.
---
Just did event, an hour earlier than posted time for some reason. So much fun, a bunch of us all together completing objectives around Helvetia.
---
I don't want to spoil anything tbh, but enjoy it, this is an event you will need to repeat a good dozen or more times to stand a chance at getting all the plans available.
---
 First try, we apparently failed for unknown reasons. https://youtu.be/0-XdAVT5Zbc
---
Garrahan. Hornwright were the bad guys with the robots.
---
I got a plan for one of the lanterns from the event.
---
There was a Win10 update that caused lag in 3d games during mouse movement.  Trying installing all your Win10 updates.  This seems to have solved some of my lag issues.
---
No mask, no plan. At least the shitty quest that made FO76's engine choke due to the amount of players present only took a few minutes of doing fuck all.  
---
I expected little but am still underwhelmed.
---
There's a download throttle in the launcher settings. Check that it's uncapped.
---
🙄🙄🤣🤣🤣🤣😲😲
---
That would make sense. Any idea if someone’s found a world spawn for it or if it’s an event reward?
---
Gotta make sure it doesn't get as powerful as melee. /s
---
65 yrs old and been a Fallout Fan since the first game. As others have said, the only issue I find by being older is that melee gets too fast to respond successfully. So I am a stealth/sniper build. I also find that I’m too slow when trading for the younger folks. 
---
Suggestion for playing with older players: Use a microphone so we can talk to you. It’s a much better way to communicate until the game gives us text messaging.
---
I have the same problem! But I play on PC.

I tried to fast travel to the new event, and then crashed. Nothing to worry about, it's not my first in Fallout 76. But now, every time I try to run the game, it crashes! I can't even go through the “push a button to start”.
---
it is
---
I mean you can just get it for free at the crashed space station...
---
I thought the stealthboy mk3 lasted 3-4 minutes on its own, not 90 seconds. 
---
I got over it pretty fast, it was just kind of a bummer LOL. It just sucked that I'm level 12 and they were level 150-200+ so I couldn't even do anything about it haha.
---
But heck yeah that would/will be helpful, I hope!!!
---
(Also thanks!)
---
Delete your cache. You will lose your photos but no save data will be lost.
---
&gt;Not sure what you're disagreeing with, here.
---
I just didn't understand why you said people were "not entitled" to a SIMS like experience? Why wouldn't they be?
---
I paid good money for the game, the game was specifically made to be modified in whichever fashion I want, and it's single player so there's nobody I'll be imposing on.
---
By that logic, I'm *completely* entitled to a SIMs like experience if I want one.
---
"When i wasn't paying attention". you can't even accidentally auto scrap it. you manually went to mods and clicked on calibrated shocks and confirmed you wanted to scrap it... while i do agree we should be able to lock items from being dropped/scrapped, your justification is null. 
---
Nice, I like it!
---
Same with my server... :(
---
Server hop just finished one got witch mask n a plan n hopped into another   almost done n got the owl mask n another plan 
---
I saw a post earlier about new notes and food out there, but did not specify if it was a recipe
---
I’ve just loaded my TS Gatling today from stash and noticed the difference. 
---
Yeah. Hopped once and nothing. The server crashed. Relogged again and went right in. However got the exact same reward as the first time. 
---
Its Online
---
It was the new parade I nuked
---
3 one of those a suicide wave and a boss ( legendary )waves of enemies , seems that everyone got different masks 
---
not entirely true [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aovxuc/helvetia\_faschnacht\_masks\_in\_fallout\_76/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aovxuc/helvetia_faschnacht_masks_in_fallout_76/)
---
It was a load of people gathering for the parade
---
They start preparing for the event as soon as one ends, so I guess, not long. I heard somewhere it's once an hour real time.
---
This is the only solution I know of.
---
Got a Witch Mask and a [Fasnacht Beret](https://imgur.com/a/0oCG0OY)!
---
Not everyone who purchased the game wants that,  but again, you are only thinking about yourself and your fun.  Thats why what you are doing is called griefing.  Your playstyle is causing others grief, you know this and its your intention. And now you are upset when people call you out for it
---
Be more chill about raiders?  That close to the dumbest thing I have heard.  Your intent in the game is to case others grief by killing them and destroy property, and you want them to think about how it makes you feel when they call you names and talk bad about you on the posts?   
---
You chose that "lifestyle" in the game, you deal with the consequences.  If you are a toxic asshole in the game, then you deserve to be treated as a toxic asshole.   
---
probably the first three mask on the list I would guess just based on looks that is and the fact that no one had those ones when everyone got their reward 
---

You can close it up with these two wall pieces and a flat roof. 
---
Awesome anything cool
---
Jup Server hopping works. Got 2 masks and 2 plans
---
Sweet but i havent seen it. My buddy uses a combar knife ill test it tonight. Over repaired buzzblades are beast.
---
 Im 2handed tho. I dont wanna change the way i play or chase meta builds. Otherwise id be using a guantlet build. Swing speed is king!
---
I will confess that I am not great at interpreting modern hieroglyphics... translation, please?
---
I will try to gather some info this weekend using my Weapons Vendor Character, since he is only level 2 with no weapons enhancing perks or mutations, all non legendary weapons will display only base damage for him.
---
RNG is a bitch my friend
---
everyone wants the Gjallahorn, not everyone is gonna get the gjallahorn
---
Was waiting for reviews like this. Good thing I didn't buy it.
---
How if i crash at the start of the menu? I’ve delete the game to reinstall this maybe all of nothing after playing since the beta 
---
It is not canon tho. Would be pretty lore breaking
---
Holy crap thank you for this. 
---
I use full trapper for the fashion
---
I got a witch mask and plans for the Helvetia banner. I also learned that I have been pronouncing Helvetia wrong... 
---
That's still not a comprehensive list necessarily
---
Kudos !!! Couldn't have done better myself
---
I love you for saying that. yes that will be your official detail :D
---
Very true actually. I’ve noticed that they always take the carpet adjustment approach which saves them time and money but often mess up what was working. 
---
I am a PC user so I don't know much. Try contacting one of the community managers.
---
Is the red and blue Excavator paint available too?
---
Since my new build no one, melee or ranged has one shot me.
---
Can't talk, too busy getting masks
---
They said the rewards depend on how many robots survive
---
The new limited time event literally dropped an hour ago dude, get the masks and new decore while you can
---
What's your group makeup?
---
My guess is it might be whoever gets to the event area first. If a low level does theyll be low.
---
I see this being quite griefable  
---
We exist. Its known that we exist. We raid. 
---
How are you getting griefed? I dont understand. Are you griefed when a scortchbeast kills you also?
---
Manage your expectations please. Its a rated MA game. Are you mature enough to realize some of us view other players as enemies?  Im just out killing people to make junk and caps!
---
I'd love to use it but I went straight to X-01 because it was so much easier to get, which seems a little backwards. I guess that's why I so rarely see T-60s. 
---
New content is being added every week, which started two weeks ago and will continue upto May, which will constitute the first DLC. Two more DLC are to be added this year.
---
Its the most comprehensive list out there so its probably the best answer to give.
---
Never underestimate the willingness of people to pay someone to do something for them
---
Consider it a list of the best *craftable* armor sets, then.
---
Problem solved.
---
Where?
---
We just finished one and all went well, no marchers lost, and failed with no reason...
---
lol pretty much
---
It will probably affect their durability though.
---
Have you tried it using the perk card that triples the effects of alcohol?
---
FYI people are running into griefer issues with folks nuking helvetia and preventing completion of the event
---
Quick question are you on ps4?
---
Ah lol. Thats funny. 
---
Not for stealth builds. For stealth it is GOD!
---
I disagree. In fact you're misunderstanding Pacifist. At it's currently state and until the PVP servers are up, the slap damage on Pacifist Mode Slap Damage is an oversight and broken. So you mean to tell me there's a mode where if I check it I can no longer hurt other players BUT they can still hurt or kill me? That's absolutely nonsensical.
---
While we're at it, let's further break down Slap Damage. It was already explained by Todd Howard himself in several interviews that Slap Damage is a form of initiating PVP but it takes such a miniscule amount of damage that it's inconsequential unless you initiate PVP by attacking back. It's a way of combating griefing which he specifically stated. That's the mechanic. If you're able to break through Slap Damage and kill another player this means it's broken. And if a player is fully aware of this exploit and uses it to kill other players not willing to PVP then he/she is griefing plain and simple.
---
Anything that forces a PVE player jump servers simply because you feel the need to be an asshole makes you a griefer. 
---
The RNG giveth, and the RNG taketh away.
---
Nope just playing solo and never used Strange In Numbers. If it was related to Adrenal, it would have buffed TS at the same time prior to latest patch, so at given HT value the ratio between bloodied and TS should remain the same no matter what Adrenal does. Now that ratio is reversed after the latest patch. 
---
Love this idea...  I've done this before.
---
We will see the Overseer as well. I mean we have to.
---
I guess I should look into luck of the draw then, especially for explosives I assume. The character is about level 11-12 right now I think. Currently just trying to find quick ways to power level to get him to 20 to be around my first 
---
Oh, okay. Where’s your list? Did you make one? I don’t see it here. 
---
Lol awesome
---
Thanks you so much ! I will tell PS4 Fallout76 fan in JAPAN ! Sincerity.
---
I got a plan for a pile of confetti 😑
---
In the Fallout Universe, OSHA stands for "Oh Shit Hire Another"
---
Pretty sure we all did learn that lol
---
Same, holding my atoms for now.

All pvp is rewarded with caps and junk

I just saw some livestream going up on YouTube 😀

YES SPEND MORE MONEY.
---
Just today I burned up 15 cores all between 5-20% lol, cleaning up my sash and saw all that shit like ok time to burn through these wastes of space. Ran around like a mad man for half hour did the trick lol
---
I sure hope so.  Having an 8 to 5 day job sometimes sucks for timed events 
---
Yes, I used to server hop and farm technical data for getting the shielded enclave plans and then sell them for 5k a piece to people who didn't want to do it themselves . Good way to make 25k in one day.
---
The sound is a bug it’ll be louder once it’s fixed

Second time around I got an owl mask and a garland plan.

---
Try uninstalling and reinstalling it works for me
---
Dang that's harsh but admittedly hilarious. Hope you are able to get your masks! 
---
I can see the memes already\~
---
True but these are a 100% guaranteed drop at the space station
---
Missile launchers and auto grenades do break pretty fast, sadly. I’m not sure how effective Luck of the Draw is with them, haven’t noticed. 
---
What platform are you on? If on PC, I can share 15% xp in group perk cards, and make 5% xp food; add in sleeping regularly and that’s a 25% xp bonus :)
---
Sadly nobody in the session did however it was a funny ride I’ll admit.
---
Is there a Appalachia pd on xbox 
---
If you're on XB1 I'll trade anytime
---
I am speaking purely from the product as it was delivered at retail + DLC content. What the community decides to add afterwards isn't really a counterpoint, imo. At that point it's not even the same experience. I am not making moral judgments on whether someone alters a single-player game. It's not even a point I'm considering relevant to a discussion about the connections between PvP and the mechanics of the playfield.
---
hahahaha!!! got it :) thanks.
---
Just because my opinion doesn't match yours doesn't invalidate it lmao. File it up your ass.
---
You are talking about being mature, yet your in game lifestyle is anything but.  You ask me to manage my expectations but dont understand why people might not enjoy it when you do the things you do in the game to them.    
---
The only correct statement you have made so far is that "I don't understand",  which is correct, you obviously don't.  
---
I know the double barrel shotgun has one. I've yet to find one for the pump action.
---
True, but some people can’t fight through the super mutants without a higher level teammate. For example, when I was level 12, a level 119 took me there. I died a lot, and didn’t even find the suit.
---
I feel like she offed herself...
---
Ooo congrats! The owl mask is my favorite. :)
---
I was thinking of doing something similar, but it just gets to be a huge pain in the ass to double check mods on a per-weapon basis.
---
I'm thinking I'll put a table together of all weapons, and just in my daily adventures before scrapping anything I'll cross check the table - make sure mods are all removed / basic parts then send it to a lower level alt to get the raw numbers.
---
Time consuming but ultimately would work well enough.
---

I have my camp a fart away from a T-45/60 spawning location, so pretty much anytime I head to my camp its a free mostly full core.  Between those and the regular found/looted ones around the world I always have more than I will ever need, and that's using Power Armor just  about non stop\~  
---
Give it a few days, then im sure someone will do a poll/survey to ask what masks they got. Then we can determine the rarity
---
It’s not a bug lol
---
Get that thing a wired connection, get some patch leads from the store. Will shave hours off the download time, even with bad internet
---
did u see the lever action inlaids?!?!?
---
You can get bounties from attacking workshops...
---
I have two T-60 Calibrated Shocks I was going to sell, if that's what you lost.
---
There was none as we couldnt get the event to start properly since I killed all the small animals in the area, we didnt get the 12 intestines and the event failed
---
Power drill reduces cost on building
---
There is one that appears that’s a new suit and helmet as well, forgot where I got it though...
---
We had about 20 players from level 75-200+. Honey beasts, suicide muties and a legendary megasloth spawned.
---
Never said it did. But I did imply that your approach marks you as a childish tough-guy little shit. You want to debate opinions, happy to do it... wanna spew insults like a keyboard warrior in lieu of discussion? So be it.
---
I saw someone else say that earlier, and it gave me the idea... so if anything its their fault
---
"You damn kids, get off my lawn!" … :pushes launch button:
---
Behind the golf club at Whitespring = an asshole who's trying to hog the XP and loot from ghouls cause they always have turret towers.
---
A camp placed literally anywhere else = a player minding their own business and not being in the way of anyone or anything
---
There's your difference, nitwit
---
That's the revive 20 players right? I'll help you if you help me
---
Someones obviously super salty and downvoted all of these comments, lol, who nuked their parade?
---
I hope they keep the promise of no humans, however they can be smart alicks about it and just say they are synths and I'll be fine with it
---
Hate people like that! If I dont want to sell something to someone, I just cancel the request. No need to back out 😑
---
Tried it again. Event bugged. Parade stopped at the sign you can put your face into for a picture. 
---
No waves spawned, whole group of people scouring the area for any stray spawns and nothing. Event timed out. 
---
https://youtu.be/iZxc0BkJ4NY
---
Loads of fun :)
---
Try ushering out a Nuclear Winter dickheads, mwuhahaha
---
:( nevermind
---
I see viking lodge pics
---
Same. We had an army of radtoads, several honey beasts, wave after wave of suiciders, THEN a legendary megasloth
---
Was it the most fun event ever? Not exactly, but it was fun to see people grouping up and working together to make Faschnacht happen
---
has to be 20 different players
---
Please write the system. Things like that help with bug reporting.
---
yea no problem
---
+karma 
---
God damn that sucks
---
Wow and 800 atoms to top it off.
---
I dig that.
---
oh well, we have a week (maybe 2 weeks?) to do this event, I'm sure this wont hurt too many butts....
---
There is a "leave world" option already. But I don't think their intention is for folks to server hop to grind for rare items instead of playing the game straight. jmo
---
TF3
---
F#$% this is where the plastic has been going? Dammit
---
1 hour apart from each others even if you finish early
---
i got the owl mask 
---
Its improved greatly from release imo. I play daily for the most part, And ive truly been enjoying it! My time spent on this game has definitely increased from BETA/Day 1.
---
So, why ya’ll making patch notes about bugs you don’t even understand? 
---
You can’t fix an issue unless you know what’s causing it and when you claim to fix it then get caught being wrong y’all at Bethesda just look dumb. 
---
Looks ugly AF
---
So... wait. You don't enjoy the idea of being killed by people you can't kill, so you don't like the idea of a full PvP server... but the idea of slapping someone to death who has no hope of beating you in a fight is perfectly ok? I'm confused. Am I misinterpreting this?
---
Sent friend
---
There nothing there
---
Thanks for sharing! Picked up the plans for hard and standard lemonade!
---
I’ve not even got a first parade yet
---
What’s on the atom shop related to this?  I’m out of town til Saturday hope I don’t miss any good items.
---
My first thought, after seeing the whole server gather up i was like hmmm... which silo? But my friends had to jump in the parade and we weren't teamed up and since they run bloodied they wouldn't be liking the constant rads.
---
Yeah just got my second 
---
Dickhead
---
Its my favorite thing.
---
I just left a server where someone had nuked Helvetia. Seems like a waste of a nuke.
---
Thanks! Looks great!
---
ok
---
Crashing too... 
---
No, it doesn’t. Myself and another person did this one and Good Grief just between the two of us. FYI.
---
I used a critical hit in VATS and it worked.
---
Just when I thought I had come to grips with functional alcoholism, FO76 threw me a new challenge.
---
Yeah I edited the link. You should see it now.
---
Was very much a waste, the guy said he knew what would happen of him nuking the event. A top tier cunt.
---
I am on PC and I would very much appreciate that, it would be a huge  help.
---
Now I've just gotta find a good power leveling method because questing doesn't seem to give you much of anything and Whitesprings is always either packed or I take way too much rad damage without the meds to cure it
---
These are great suggestions folks, thanks.! And thanks for the upvotes.  
---
One more I thought of is the security door we see in the world and it’s exterior terminal.  We would need the door, the terminal, and that interior button that opens an closes the door.  Have it come all as one wall section with the terminal mounted on the outside and the button on the inside.  I think since we don’t have a powered door for the metal walls, it makes sense to use this setup for that wall set.
---
I'm waiting for the event to occur again cause that's the one mask I really want. The Owl Mask looks so cool.
---
All can see I. The i goes after "see"
---
Yup lol
---
Here too :(
---
I’m hopping. On my 3rd. 
---
Lack of mic conversation in trades might be the issue. or lack of trade encounter emotes...  Maybe an animation that makes it clear that you're in the process. 
---
Yea, on BIV there should been some dialog like normally you have on NPCs. Or at least disable the "Interact" prompt after I have already interacted with it, so that I don't have to rape it. And then the quests itself are problematic. Few days ago had recipe where I had server hop almost hour to find ingredient. 
---
Parade itself aint that bad, but the rewards are so meaningless. Those masks look too garbage to wear. I would hang them on my camp to show that I  participated in event but no option for that.
---
Did anyone else run into a problem where local critters weren't spawning for a while? One of the tasks, to collect intestines from animals for sausages, is impossible to complete quickly if the animals don't spawn in. Took about 10 minutes for the critters to appear, then the robots were too slow for our group to complete the event. Kind of broken if that happens even remotely consistently for the next week.
---
Good luck! report back with the tweaks you applied!
---
Nuked masks would be a neat twist though. 
---
Considering how quickly a day cycles it kinda is excessive. 
---
There definitely should be a visible timer somewhere for this event. So you can at least have an idea of when it’s going to start. After you’ve joined a world.
---
I have a theory from couple of people I tried to trade with.
---
I have to hit R2 to switch sides and R1 to change category.. and if they time it right and back out of the trade I end up shooting or bashing them accidentally. Then they kill me for the caps.
---
I'm having the same issue, and seems I'm not the only one. I have no idea what to do.
---
I also had a 3 star not drop a legendary the other day (after patch 7). My friend and I were clearing the Watoga Emergency Services building. There was a 3 star Glowing One that spawned at the normal spawn location. We both got a tag and killed it. It dropped a full inventory, but did not drop a legendary for either one of us. We waited around about 5 minutes. I even came back after doing some other stuff in the Watoga area, it still had nothing. I have killed many (read: a shit ton) of legendaries since the patch and this was the only issue I had with legendary creatures not droping legendary loot.
---
Note: it did not drop a drill or any other known non-legendary item on the legendary drop table. It DID however have odd plans (for both of us) on it, though I can't remember what the plans were but they were not something I would expect to drop on a glowing one.
---
As a former resident of CA, I'm glad for you.  Some of us dealt with the DMV there before they had an app...hell, before there *were* apps.  Be very, very glad you were born in a post-paper DMV world.
---
Loved it! Got the toothy mask, but I LOVE the beret!
---
Found it, deleted original comment -- but for those who're looking: It's under "Floor Decorations." Uh-huh.
---
I’ll be on in a min GT is MILKMONST3R626
---
Same. Rad toads, Super Mutant Suiciders, and a Legendary Slothie.
---
Yea, a guy had no mic and told me to msg him on Reddit so I was going between trying to message him and get what he wanted out of stash, and he says “Dude are you going to trade or what I want to get back to the game”. Excuse me for trying to do 3 things at once since you don’t have a mic.
---
Couldn’t agree more with you but we needed the intestines to donate, which since no animals spawn in the nuked zone, made it a lot harder for everybody in the event.
---
Need people join now parade about to start xbox zartu
---
Overly generous works the best the more rads u have yourself aswell. 
---
I got the Witch mask. Will grind all day tomorrow to learn more. I'm excited for CAMP plans.
---
I think you're an asshole if you did that.
---
Same here, game was working perfectly yesterday, today only crashes after "Press a key" message.
---
Sent a ticket already :/
---
You're still an asshole.
---
Oh yeah, I only take the power plants if I want to farm like 400+ cores for use in gatling laser, but I haven't had cause to use that because there's no armor pen for energy weapons and.. yeah, tons of reasons. Hopefully that changes soon! Still though, I think the gatling laser dps is pretty low compared to gatling plasma / .50 cal.
---
Your best bet is to server hop or use stealth to get past them without fighting. Chameleon armour pieces or a stealth boy can be useful. 
---
I have several Vendor Characters with Shops that include workbenches, Stash Boxes, used to include Rad Showers open to all, but unfortunately there are a lot of A$$hats in the game that derive some sort of pleasure from destroying these things.
---
All my vendor Characters are low level, so initiating PVP is obviously not there motive, and most have a friend standing by to quickly remove their bounty, which leads to the conclusion that they are simply "Shit for brains, Low Life Scum".
---
After losing 4 rad Showers to this same scenario, I have stopped providing them, even when I do kill them and collect a bounty (if they even have the caps to cover it) it is not enough to cover the cost of repairs.
---
I hope this changes soon so true Fallout fans can enjoy the game without worrying about this.
---
I agree to an extent. What you find fun isn't necessarily fun for others. Slap damage is broken. If I'm in Passive Mod (meaning I do NOT care to PVP) and someone simple melees through both Passive and Slap damage just to kill me and take my materials, that's makes for a shitty experience. Fun experience for the player griefing but shitty for the one one the receiving end just minding his/her business.
---
Great idea, I like it
---
On third one rn lol 
---
LMFAO 
---
And you decided to be an asshole with it.  Congratulations, you demonstrated you have the worst traits of humanity.
---
That doesn't make it "broken" though
---
If anything they are trying to discourage that activity, not make it easier. 
---
I played for a good three hours yesterday doing the brewing quest, on a well populated server without any crashes, texture freakouts or disconnects.  Things have improved, I'll say that much, and new things are starting to roll out.  The future looks bright, all things considered.
---
Did u get it the first time 
---
Well, if they add extremely rare items in extremely rare encounters, they should add that to make it easier. When I tried to get the hunter’s longcoat, I tried for what, 6 days for... 6 or 7 hours and I couldn’t get it. They should add it to make it possible for “normals” that just enjoy playing the game and wants to get that cool piece.
---
Minor thing that needs tweaking: The CAMP party streamers don't attach quite straight, so the nails on the right-hand side (when facing said streamers) stick through the back of the wall.
---
But I GOT MY OWL MASK ON THE FIRST TRY, so I can't really complain! =P
---
I'm uninstalling the game and installing it again ("only" will take an hour). I'll update any new info.
---
verrrrry carefully....
---
Ffs  I met the robot saying it's not ready so I closed the application thinking it starts tomorrow. 
---
Shut up and take my atoms!
---
But again, if they add extremely rare outfits I’m extremely rare encounters, they should add it.
---
Elder Maxon must have got his coat from somewhere IF it existed before him, so it could make sense :)
---
In the PvP world, with no balances, it's just one-shot after one-shot. With slap, I can evade/fast travel/engage/hop. I have options
---
Well, I know what I'm doing when I get home tonight.
---
I saw it start at various times on various servers, so just wait for it to kick off. Looks like it fails if any bot dies, we had 1/5 die and got no rewards.
---
For real. A guy came up to me wanting to trade. No mic. So I quickly browsed his inventory and saw nothing I wanted. Looked over and saw he had requested radaway. Okay I'll just give him a 100 for free. Was setting the quantity and adjusting the price to zero when he backed out and started shooting. You be impatient you miss out bud.
---
I need this bad. Friends quit playing and all my spare junk is stuck on an alt. 
---
Doubtful to happen. Bethesda has moved more toward reducing the benefits of server hopping. 
---
The point of rare stuff is that they are rare......
---
How long did it take to get that build, though?
---
At least it wasn't a Power Fist.
---
He said good day!
---
Invite me
---
Go to your game on the dashboard, press start, and select the option to uninstall.
---
Which one? Where?
---
You have to for the overseers  boyfriend
---
same here...
---
You can play solo. It's still a classic fallout game. Just consider other players to be the NPCs. Some are nice, some are dicks, some will totally ignore you.
---
That was amazing
---
They didn't say they are going to change, they just sayd they thinking about it.
---
ill be on later today and want to buy a few add me, moonsbro 
---
Same. Another trip to RobCo is in order. At least those robot models will now be forever part of my X01, so not a total waste...
---
Just log off, an log back in. That fixed it for me.
---
No, it does start today. It's available every hour.

I’m fortunate indeed. I’m 24 now so I’ve had my fair share of DMV runs, some before I knew the app was a thing. That being said I feel sorry for all those people who had to suffer through it before apps or computers, or those like my dad (an “old fashioned” Mexican man from a small town in Mexico) who refuse to use technology because he doesn’t want to learn how to use it lol. The DMV will forever be notorious.

Stand at the back of the tennis courts, on the far end from the clubhouse, looking back in the general direction of the fire station. Slightly to the left you'll see a golden dome, supported by pillars (not a solid wall), surrounded by flowers &amp; landscaping. That's the gazebo.
---
Me too, it`s so sad. :(
---
It's inside one of the houses, one near the door and another at a top corner, one more in a side room on the floor.
---
Was just wondering who would be the edgy cool kid to do this just to grief people. Thanks for confirming that misanthopy is the correct view to have.
---
Aids
---
**Literarily unplayable*
---
I would reccomend bethesda make a guaranteed spawn for all animals in different sections of the world 
---
Added, thanks!  I should be on most of the day.
---
Thats what ive been doing but it looks weird with the walls i have on the interior. 
---

Server hopping it's the fourth time for me
---
I have 3 toothy man masks
---
It's painful
---
Lol go back in about half an hour and you should catch the third parade.
---
Hey dude, whats the outfit called u are wearing?
---
Nobody joined after 10-15min and we failed eventually :oof:
---
Really fun! Truly what coop means in this game!
---
My in game lifestyle is a fantasy raider. Thats what i paid for. 
---
It in no way extends to how i treat people outside fo76. 
---
I know they dont enjoy it! That why im here.  Im trying to reach out. Give advice on avoiding raiders and explain its not psrsonal, its not griefing and its a very profitable totally legit playstyle. More people should be raiding!
---
Go into sneak and while [HIDDEN], shoot something.
---
What types of power armor can it be painted on?
---
I love Fastnacht donuts, used to call them fuzz nuts as a kid
---
Wanne trade with witch mask on PC 
---
The cool down timer is set to one hour after the last time the event was started on that server. 
---
Are you familiar with biases?
---
Was fun and casual had a legendary at the end of the event(low lvl ofc) and got the Old Tooth Man mask. Other guys got Owl mask and Witch mask. 
---
Love how many people show up. 
---
Nah performance on the PS4 is quite bad but I heard the Pro runs it well.
---
same
---
The Boss at the end tends to be unlootable because of the damage dump every on puts on it, the game has a disagreement with itself over where it ended up,
---
Just be glad servers don't crash every 15 minutes anymore. Took me about 3 hours over 2 days to finish that one. It wasn't funny after the third crash.
---
I played with almost 20 other people and got a witch mask.
---
The one legendary creature that showed up, it was a megasloth, didn't even drop anything. All you could do was stare at its cold corpse laying on the ground. 
---
It was kind of fun but also a little bit ridiculous.
---
Was anything high level other than the playerS?
---
Saw that coming...
---
No not really
---
Can the bots be damaged by players?
---

---
I had something like that in mind (or at least something similar until now, blocker is a really good idea to play 15 strength)
---
A little more stable and comes with cannibal 2 &lt;3
---
And yes, definilty gonna go for the mutations once the skillcards unlock for me :)
---
Sure, my ign is georgyfurs
---
Thank you for the response in this thread. It has been suggested many times, but the simple solution to this problem would be that the star rating of legendary creature determines the drop. 
---
I have got toothy. Giant, a baret, and an effigy 
---
I have a slim and it works well.
---
This has become one of my favorite quests in all the fallout series. Absolutely hilarious 
---
Did you really feel like teamwork was necessary? To me it felt like a cheap illusion of team work. 
---
For $20 I can get the new horn, mask, rifle skin AND excavator paint?
---
Kudos Bethesda. Hope this is a general trend, 1800 point PA skins are just too damn high 
---
Sorry I’ve been out the loop of Fo76 for a while now, where / how do you get this coat ^^ ? 
---
People are server hopping. If you're unlucky you can play hours and hours without finding any.
---
Its almost as if there are nukes in the game given to players to use at their will, and a big group of people gathered up
---
Now do it with pocketed and weightless
---
I'm sure there are. I just haven't come across any yet.
---
That's funny
---
The Philippi Battlefield right?
---
Send request
---
Luckily i got to hit the legendary sloth. got a legendary piece of level 25 armor. Some people there didn't have a chance to hit it because it died as soon as it spawned.
---
That's good then. I don't play on a console so it's mostly what I have heard and seen from other people's gameplays.
---
I think your right, a little salty, but right
---
This is griefing i can support. Have an upvote and a fresh nuclear keycard on me.
---
Yeah I was happy about the stove and oversized horn of Gondor. 
---
Excavator. 
---
Yeah, I guess I meant NW not NE
---
That may be it :/ they've probably just seperated the weapons.  A shame but good to know. Guess i'll just use Aerodynamic for now.
---
i play it on the ps4 pro and it runs like trash lol only doing it for the easy platinum trophy after getting the game for 10 bucks
---
By the way, I know this, but you can’t find the Union Hat/Kepi there
---
Its the april fools edition flip back a page its the game infarcer or what ever they call it, just satire not real
---
I’ve gotten like 4 owls. At least people seem happy when I drop them lol. 
---
Sorry, everyone. That was me.
---
". So you mean to tell me there's a mode where if I check it I can no longer hurt other players BUT they can still hurt or kill me"
---
 -  YES thats currently how Pacifist mode works. It's by design. Bad design but design non the less.
---
It's was originally a joke made by parody site. Did game informer seriously make an article on that? LOL.
---
I kind of does. The way Slap Damage was explained by Todd Howard was that the damage received is so inconsequential that the player on the receiving end can simply ignore them and go about their business if they choose not to return damage and initiate PVP. This was a way to combat griefing. As it works currently you can easily melt away someone's health with melee despite level or in Passive. There's nothing really stopping a melee griefing from simply finding PVE players and griefing for loot. It's pretty broken. It's the same recurring situation people complained about a few months back where TSE griefers were one shot slap damaging players.
---
Its like people forget that this is the first game Bethesda has made online
---
Because its not real lmfao
---
How important is ER over DR?  What percentage of the game is ER vs DR?
---
I found brother hood of steel arms the other day in the watoga or the train yard. I can't remember which. I'm on ps4. All i needed are legs and helmet ( if they exist)
---
I’ve been fooled
---
The clothes existed before the factions. 
---
NCR jackets were not Taylor made specifically for the NCR, a group of people starting the NCR probably found some old pre war jackets and stuck NCR emblems on them. Same for the Gunners the re purposed old US military clothing and stuck gunners emblems on them.
---
" Oh these clothes didn't exist before the DLC " 
---
It's like theres a secret Taylor in the wastes making new Clothes specifically for every new fallout &amp; its DLC, it's just bad logic.
---
 Its perfectly logical to have the clothes just not the faction Emblems.
---
LOL
---
I thought you could find both union and confederate uniforms and hats there as well as the civil war dress, suit and hat.
---
Im just imagining a legendary landing at some level 10s feet 3 miles down the road
---
Its like they combined technical and special together. Techncial
---
I have played on both xbox and ps4 and had about the same amount of bugs on both. I am also one of the rare few that has hardly had an issue with bugs. 
---
Did not run into this, but based on your post, it seems the event requires different things!
---
When I did it we were never required to collect intestines from any animals - only Beeswax, Old Sterniers, and Radtoad eggs.
---
We also had to play music with a bot and decorate a room.
---
With you saying that, it makes me happy to find the event can be different!
---
"unless you initiate PVP by attacking back"
---
 - Thats called baiting. Im trying to bait players into PvP. Its paet of the game. I may bait you by SLAPing you, destroying your CAMP or SLAPing a lower level you are hanging out with. 
---
Oh, yeah. It's very much the new thing right now so people are jumping on it lol I want to get every mask.
---
its for the parade
---
It was actually u/Zartu1
---
It's common practice in virtually every game with a favorite feature; that marking it as such precludes it's destruction or sale. It's not like he's asking for something unreasonable.
---
Yesss!!
---
Are you trying to say it’s dark as a dungeon, way down in the mine?
---
Blasphemy, the DR on excavator is a joke.
---
Well, that’s the thing. People will spend a long time trying to farm for that item and then make the economy very unbalanced. I tried to farm for the responder bot, for its clothes, and I couldn’t get what I wanted. I would’ve spent thousands of caps on a single outfit, making me spend hours just walking to a bridge, killing enemies, server hop, repeat. In a game that the coolest outfits you get by server hopping, Bethesda should make it easier on the casual players.
---
I will accept your keycard, and put it with the other 9 I have in stock
---
It's now going on
---
r/theydidthemath
---
Do you still play on PS4?
---
I have mever wanted to murder a robot more than doing that quest.
---
So each BT headphones I try actually has two sound profiles. I have this issue when I pick stereo instead of handsfree. It just sucks because stereo sounds so much better.
---
I'm not going to argue that melee as a whole is not OP... It is... But I still don't feel the slap system is "broken."
---
What is a toaster wifi?
---
It looks more to me like a mutation that offers a Charisma boost at the expense of being permanently over-encumbered...
---
Here's my build:

https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f333a8e&amp;d=sq2s32sr2sb2s22pe2cu0ce0ir2ip2s72la2l71ls2lt2e31a04l32cr0ic3eu0&amp;w=c52sg2sy2p10pa0p80p90ii0ia0if2s12im1ik0i50iq2ie2in1ih2id2ij2i61i30i44i71at1a12lm2lf0lq0lb2eh2&amp;n=Bloodied%20Heavy%20Gunner
---
I sit at 19% HP constantly in t-51b power armor (600+ DR / ER), with 81% rads and emergency protocols active at all times. I don't see a point in having explosive mitigation for pve. Cars exploding, rockets, SBQ attacks - they're all very minimal health loss. I can stand next to a car exploding at 19% HP and not really notice the damage. My 1 star bloodied gatling gun one shots bloated glowing ones, max level super mutants, and kills tougher enemies in short order. For the absolute toughest things I use a bloodied.50 cal MG. Without Revenant I'm hitting 490 damage per shot with the .50 cal. WIth revenant that goes quite a bit higher, but obviously I only really use that for SBQ fight. An unarmed Unyielding bloody meat hook melee build (ultra glass cannon) would do more dps (I'm aware that you can push up to 5K damage per swing), but you'd probably want someone like me around to cripple the queen while also doing the best ranged dps possible. If I ever find a max level bloodied meat hook I'll probably go that route. I think I can just swap out my heavy cards for it. At that point though you just pray that you don't get hit... or I suppose if you have full unyielding / sentinel (so pricey, I have no idea how people afford this stuff considering each piece is worth a BE handmade, unless they duped or have duper friends), you can take a hit (I think?) as long as you recover before getting staggered.
---
But yeah between the t-15b and emergency protocols, if I die, it's because I was in la-la land. Have plenty of time to use a diluted stimpack, which... I get so many stimpacks and purified water I don't know what to do with it all, even if I constantly slam  diluted stims. For farming nuked whitesprings (which I do a lot - nuke it, park mule account there, rejoin over and over and clear it for 2-3 hours straight) my gatling gun / .50 cal is just straight up faster. Not because it's more dps, but because I can one shot bloated glowing ones with them and they fire faster than a medium swing speed weapon, even with 40% SS. Especially true for the golf club clears.I run in there, take a shot at each of the big rooms, run to door, and park about 4 feet away. Then it's time to activate the meat grinder. It's over in 30 seconds or less.
---
Aside from the agility.. not sure how I'd really benefit from the extra stats. Health isn't really an issue. Strength is nice for carry weight but so are calibrated shocks. Perception would do nothing for me (I don't use VATS). Charisma.. I so rarely visit vendors. I have an unyielding set for that purpose though, if I want to buy stuff. Same goes for int. Nice for crafting, but I can cap my crafting bonus from int pretty easy. Agility is nice, but I rarely ever run out of AP. Luck doesn't affect much. Sure those SPECIAL stats look nice on paper but... what are they actually going to do for me? I can't see a benefit. Am I missing something?
---
If your point is that unyielding/sentinel is better for a melee build vs. the queen once she lands or that assn/sentinel is the best for pvp.. yes that's true. However, I do very competent damage vs SBQ (9 shots per second doing ~650 damage per shot), and I'm the one that gets her to land and stay landed through crippling.
---
...*turns on game*
---
What console?
---
I'll buy marsupial..  
---
Psn - omnisentinel
---
Thx i am at my 3 round 
---
I'd quite like the horn without the mannequin though.
---
Me
---
I have Soldier 
---
It's not I've had a legendary enemie not drop a  legendary weapon aswell.
---
A lot of great items today, all reasonably priced. I even want that stove—it will be the first CAMP item I have bought.   The lever and excavator skins are mandatory.  And I will likely pick up that green coat for my character as well since her sequined dress got blood all over it. 
---
I got the monster. I was happy until I saw someone with a badass eagle mask. 
---
Anyone with a minigun can check if it works for them? 
---
Ok just looked at a couple of other weapons including LMG and handmade, the difference is the same, at low health the TS outperforms Bloodied by slightly less than 20%. Looks like a global adjustment to the Bloodied’s function curve, not just the Gatling or heavy, but also applies to rifle. Anyone who has both versions of the same weapon could you check and see if yours are the same? 
---
What system?
---
Lol they got you!
---
I play on ps4 pro and it runs well. No crashes in weeks.
---
You too? It every time crashes after the 2nd tone of the main menu music. I tried to update my graphics driver, delete the windows cache, repair over the laucher and disable the Nvidia overlay. Nothing worked for me.   
---
To my specs: i use the shadow gaming pc (that you stream).   
---
No matter if i press the any key, don't press it or let it start in the background, it crashes at the same. Also the only thing that i changed manually in the config files is the motion blur.  
---
Maybe this helps to find something that might cause this problem.   
---
Man, and I just bought the warband paint yesterday, this new one would look much better too.
---
Oh well, you live and you learn
---
Jury rigged with a Pre-War Toaster, 3 screws, 1 Adhesive, 2 Copper and 1 Broken Router.
---
Woooooooosh
---
I don't blame you - I want it all to MATCH!
---
help me out, im on ps4 :(
---
I run PS4 and have had no material issues since the February patch.  
---
I liked that quest line. I did it twice and couldn’t help but laugh at the humor. I wish they would go back to adding more humor like that. Maybe not exactly like that but dark and quirky humor. I loved the past fallouts because you’d end up running into the most random stuff. 
---
😂💀
---
OMG..... you mean I was meant to do this in the game??? 
---
Right now I need the 3 gears to repair it.
---
Its basically telling you to play new vegas
---
I've fallen twice while trying to get to the top of that tree and I'm not ready to go back up again. 
---
User name checks out.
---
Not hard. As a software developer, 168 hrs/week and 86400 seconds/day are burned into my brain. Completely useless in the grand scheme of things, but any reference to hours per week triggers instamath in my poor addled head.
---
It makes no sense 
---
I joined a lobby where Helvetia was nuked and it ruined the event. The little animals you have to kill didn’t spawn.
---
You can disable the motion blur? That's something Im gonna do when it's working again.
---
Perhaps it's punishment for server hopping?
---
I got the witch one.
---
I'll mention this over to the Dev's. Thanks for the post!
---
Sure, except the moment you go through the BS of actually fixing the plant so you can power up the core generator *and* capture the workbench, some 190+ comes along and takes it from you. So usually the core generators sit unclaimed for hours at a time, because nobody wants to waste all that play time. 
---
fuckin eagle mask what?
---
Me need
---
I have witch and toothyman
---
Tattered field jacket
---
That's how you perceive it to be if you happen to enjoy griefing. The idea of intentionally disarming yourself and giving other players an edge is a silly concept. In order for you to even return fire you have to go into the option menu and switch it off. Don't be silly. If it was intentional by design then Bethesda wouldn't be planning on removing Slap Damage from Passive in a future update.
---
Look, I understand your perspective. If I enjoyed griefing (and I clearly don't) I'm sure I would create a post such as this one and somehow defend these actions.
---
No.
---
crafted one just to be sure. Lvl 35 minigun damage before drink 33. after, also 33. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news
---
Look, this may seem extreme, but I think you need to murder your sister. It's called an honor killing, it's legal in some countries just probably not yours.
---
yes
---
I got fed up and quit half way through thinking I'd pick up where I left off later, it reset the whole thing 🥺
---
**Ron Howard:** In fact, they had not. Meanwhile, Lucille Bluth was faced with a difficult decision at Yellow Sandy's Still.
---
This is pretty much exactly what happens to me. One thing that I noticed was that discord shows that I play Fallout 76 until it crashes. Yesterday and the days before it didn't.
---
Mine also had a megaslothbut the second it died it froze
---
I’m not paying for those
---
Just got it !
---
There’s an eagle?!
---
Bummer... Thanks! 
---
Soldier twice, owl once
---
Good effort
---
I kind've need that old man summer mask
---
I have soldier and owl so far, really want the devil mask.
---
“Been doing this my my 4 man team.. especially if it’s a high level player who had workshops claimed” 
---
Your wording implies teaming; pvping with your 4 man team against a singular high level player who owns workshops. I didn’t assume anything you clearly stated it out. I don’t have a problem with the PvP mechanics I just think teaming is weak. Next time state your point clearer if you don’t want people to call you out for what is obviously a teaming scenario. 
---
How is that unplayable? Annoying, yes, but there are many more bugs in this game making it unplayable. Like the inability to actually finish daily quests for one. 
---
I'd rather this not be a priority when the game is actually unplayable for a lot of people, and not because of an annoying grammatical error that does nothing to the coding..
---
Wait a second, your game crashed, correct? Why would you blame it on your WiFi when game crashing is caused by the game? It would have been your WiFi if the game disconnected rather than closing. 
---
I’ve gotten the witch mask and the soldier mask. Still trying to get the owl mask
---
When are you going to add Pipers Red Trench Coat ? :) 
---
Soon , Later , Never ? 
---
Just finished it. Pretty good event.
---
Do you wanna be on a team im getting internet tomorrow so yeah
---
There is a small house at the very NE corner of Whitespring golf course. Take the back stairs up to the rooftop patio. You can snipe from there, either killing one or two, while drawing the rest to you and hop over onto the lattice roof and shotgun any Ghouls that come up the stairs, out of their reach (ghouls don't carry weapons). Then creep out onto the course to trigger more, sneak/retreat back and kill more. 
---
I got 5-10 per trip and have killed 8/10 unruly golfers using this technique as a level 25, non PA character.
---
Nope. Just fixed. It used to have a glitch that applied a multiplier effect based on Thursday and hunger. Now it doesn't. Now it does what it should do, which is give you a maximum 50% boost in damage rather than a multi hundred %.
---
About to be looking for my 5th. 🤣
---
Yes, they did a fantastic job capturing the agony.
---
Wait. I knew it cures rads, but it also cures diseases?
---
...
---
*Then why the fuck am I wasting Disease Cures every time I catch Rattle Hands*?!
---
I know part of that is because of the quest and part was because there was a bug that would reset your progress and make you go through the whole ordeal again. Funny enough the only friend of mine to get that bug works at the DMV.
---
I’ve gotten a legendary twice from it and one time it froze. 
---
Soldier is looking to be most common XD
---
I saw a dev comment that said it becomes available again an hour after a player starts the event, so if you start the event, then take 26 minutes to complete it, it should be available in 34 minutes.
---
Thanks for posting this. Just FYI, consistent with your observations:
---
Some of us old geeks — I'm 61 — have been gamers for a very long time. I started playing, and then writing, computer games in BASIC and Fortran IV on UT-Austin's gigantic time-sharing mainframe in 1975, eventually earning a minor in computer science based on an attack sub simulator I wrote. I was gaming on PCs by the early 1980s, and played one of the first true MMORPGs, [Underlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underlight), by 1998. That led in turn to playing EverQuest (in which I became a volunteer Senior Guide, basically an in-game customer service representative), which led to WoW, which as a divorced dad I played with my two sons for several years during the 2000s. Cooperating and collaborating with other games comes very, very naturally to folks with that kind of background. :D
---
It's like a dark / faded metallic blue.
---
I got one! When I spoke to the Master of Ceremonies while wearing it, he said “Aren’t you too tall for a Napoleon?”
---
I actually came back after the dlc and honestly, if you find other people to play with, this game is hilarious.
---
Also...I'm trying to harvest some random crops near morton....I see the press 'x' to harvest and the label goes 'grayish' as if there's some action happening but I don't get anything...
---
Is this a bug?
---
I did not pay for that, I paid for a co-op Fallout experience with friends.  Did I expect there to be people acting as raiders? Yes.  Does that stop them from being assholes and griefers? Absolutely not.   
---
You can claim its not personal, but when people have a limited amount of time to play games, and you ruin their time by destroying what they built or steal what they gathered, it makes it personal.  It is as valid of a reaction as you can get.   So stop fooling yourself its not personal, you just want to feel better about being an asshole,  well guess what, you dont get that.
---
I make just as much money as a Trader as most do as a Raider.  
---
You may want to be on the receiving end of that one to see how broken it is. I'm level 148 with modded PA and some level 80+ shithead in a space suit almost killed me while I was farming in Pacifist mode. It's not working as intended. If it we're Bethesda wouldn't be looking into removing Slap Damage from that mode entirely.
---
Yeah I didn’t realize it had the mannequin until after I bought it. 
---
Lol obviously.
---
Just got the toothy man mask love it 
---
For clarification, it’s an hour between each time the event starts.
---
In what restaurant?
---
Why would you fix the plant when you can just put down a fusion generator for so cheap? Just use contractor perk and it costs almost nothing. If someone is in full assn/sentinel and tries to take it purely for pvp, yeah, you're screwed. Those people are really rare though.
---
Just FYI, low level players aren't really at any disadvantage in pvp. I fought a lvl 90 last as level 35 and won with ease. I fear low level players  when I'm on my 300. It's 300 caps if I lose, and they get a massive damage boost due to the level difference. Gear and builds definitely make a difference though.
---
Same problem here
---
Do a search for "Powerline Ethernet Adapter". Use a set of these to make a physical connection between the router and machine using the electrical wiring in your house. It isn't a terribly fast connection but fast enough to run a game AND it's a stable link that doesn't rely on clear wifi to function.
---
So funny story if you go the the Military base before Ft. Defiance you can get recruited how ever you can NOT get the Military ID before Recruitment Blues starts. You can however stand in line at the DMV forever, but the special ghoul never spawns.
---
Same here Xbox here lol seems like this will be my only drop my buddy got two different ones 
---
Got 4 in before I had to go to class. Toothy, Witch, Giant, Toothy. One of the guys got a sweet looking beret I want.
---
What level is the content? Is it appropriate for the area, or scaling, or level 50+?
---
Witch owl owl soldier
---
I definitely think it’s doable. But I doubt you will find a server without other people doing the event. I’ve done it a couple times and there’s usually a ton of people. 
---
Yes that is what I said 
---
I typically play alone but I don't mind teaming up, it may actually make the I am become death quest easier. I'm pretty busy during the week so on week days I'm on between 8-10pm est. but Friday night through sunday morning I play a lot.
---
I've been on the receiving end of melee... And won against people higher and lower level than me. I've also lost. I use a no pa rifle build. I don't know what each of their builds were, nor could I, but don't assume I haven't faced it just because I don't agree with you
---
Dang, now i want a beret
---
&gt;\&gt;circlejerking betas living in peace  
---
&gt;hahaha you got me laughing thumbs up
---
You can transfer everything but caps by yourself but it’s a little risky. 
---
What do you mean dude? 
---
Crit hit in vats did it for me
---
PC.
---
I’m on Pro it’s much better now. Several patches ago it crashed every 30 min when I used targeting HUD for PA. 
---
There's gonna be a group there whether you want them to be or not to be honest.
---
Toasters have WiFi now? Lmao! :)
---
Yeah not worth the risk in my opinion..my luck server will crash.. bye bye hours of farming material and random shit lol.
---
My main was on Fennin Ro, the original test server, and I was a senior guide on Rodcet Nife.
---
Hi, thanks for the report and sorry you're running into this crash. We're investigating now and looking into a fix as soon as we can.
---
Yeah I understood, but I thought adding the “from each time the event starts” part might help anyone who’s confused.
---
given one specific part of the parade, doing it solo with all bots alive my be a bit hard....use the one time I have done it (so far) was just highly unlucky with mob rolls. &gt;!damn suicidal super mutants!&lt;
---
We have a few lower levels with us that are fine :) 
---
Mostly level appropriate!
---
The waves of enemies tend to be level 5 radtoads, level 10 supermutant suiciders, and then a level 35 or so legendary supersloth.
---
You should be fine!
---
Toothy twice 
---
4 so far. So many people are server hopping it keeps forcing new ones open.
---
Hi all, thanks for your reports about this. We're investigating this crash right now and looking into a fix. 
---
Ahem. Some of us were old enough to buy our own Atari consoles for Pong.
---
Welcome to the game. I’m also new ish, been playing for nearly 2 weeks. I’m addicted to it, probably the slowest leveller in the game because I love wandering about and avoiding quests haha.
---
Thanks I wasn’t aware of this.
---
Nice tip. I assume those are instanced to your character, so it's a once per day thing?
---
Yes please ^^^^ 😅🙏👩‍🚀😘
---
Thanks for the reply! There are some more people in this sub having the same issue. 
---
false, needs to be done through vats
---
Thanks for the queen kills. I was in the last 3 or 4 of them. I appreciate it 
---
Taming and pacifying are different things. You can pacify lots of things that you cant tame, including scorched beasts and robots
---
Is the witch mask the long nosed green goblin looking one? 
---
If so I’ll trade you an owl one. 
---
Thanks for your reports! We're investigating this crash now and looking into a fix. Will let you know as soon as we are able to address it.
---
Hey so powering up events power up power boxes all over their region at substations and the like.

---
What about mr house?
---
Get a level 15 fire axe, scrap fire axes until you get the fire axe spikes. Get in Power armor. Use power attacks. Enjoy being overpowered because melee is still way too strong. I was 2 shotting lvl 62 charred feral ghouls with this method at level 15.
---
Second time around: Got the Owl Mask and the plans for the Lantern Poles!
---
If I'm not mistaken there *were* several changes to the map in the last update? Minor ones, but changes. The "unnamed" vault comes to mind.
---
It’s a great plug-and-play fix that I continue to use (house layout issues)
---
Well shit.   I’d definitely help but no xbox
---
Whats your gamertag?
---
The trading is kinda poorly done if you don’t have a mic. In my shop I have bright neon letters spelling out “3 FREE PLANS HERE” with an arrow pointing to my character. You’d be surprised to see how many people have no clue how to follow directions. Either they don’t request anything and sit there for 5 minutes. Or they request all the plans they don’t have which slows down the entire process (because as I’m decreasing caps to 0, when another plan is requested it moves the curser and I have to start over). It’s frustrating. 
---
Xbox works fine enough. Anyways, it's basically the same code for the game on other platforms so issues usually exist on all at the same time.
---
Thanks for your help!!
---
How long does it take to get the gunsmith 3 perk? That’s all I want... currently level 23 and all the perks I’ve had so far are jive. I do have one gunsmith perk tho...
---
Also, my plan for the day is pretty much hanging around in Helvetia all day long to get as many of the masks as possible. 
---
Also Bethesda realism: I'd like to spend my time exploring West Virginia, but I actually have to spend my commuting between my house and various work sites working for caps, acquiring food and water since thirst and hunger decrease at increasingly fast rates with every patch, commuting to job sites to grab fusion cores because Bethesda nerfed everything so badly that I need power armor to go anywhere of interest, etc. This is a shitty walking and working simulator.
---
Mr. House comes in third, DMV nots are first, followed by the Think Tank.
---
It happens 1 hour after the completion of the previous parade.  So not exactly on the hour, given that it takes 10-20 minutes to complete. 
---
No way. Slap damage is bad enough and there is almost no death penalty already
---
MTWNA90
---
I got witch soldier soldier
---
Sorry, could have been more clear.
---
Do you make sure to have someone with a Syringer and a Cryolator?
---
How many melee?
---
How many in VATS crippling wings?
---
I ask because she seems much harder now for pick up groups. I imagine you have a core group that can take her down by themselves easily and that allows you to pick up additional people.
---
I just posted a question about Bloodied being nerfed. My bloodied guns (Gatling, LMG, handmade) used to do way more damage than their two-shot cousins. Not any more. At 20 percent health the TS still outperforms Bloodied so there’s no reason for keeping health low any more since the benefit is nerfed.
---
If it was related to AR, it would affect TS too so Bloodied should still outperform TS, nope now TS is better no matter what Adrenal is doing. 
---
Thanks for the quick reply, awaiting the fix so we can start collecting masks :D
---
yours? so I know who to be expecting
---
Yeah! I have the giant and the witch so far. Also plans! Keep an eye on your notes because I’ve also unlocked some Fasnacht building plans
---
goat mask is april 9 for shear terror
---
All of the complaints for this game and Anthem and The Division, well a majority of the games coming out within the last 5 or so years. Has made me realize how perfect Borderlands 2 was and how well handled it was by Gearbox.
---
It was a complete game upon release and felt fully fleshed out. A person could easily put 50+ hours into the vanilla game and be happy. Unlike a lot of AAA titles as of late.
---
They didn't nerf the game to death. They fixed a few of the op gear combinations, but if the gear worked with the skills how it was supposed to then they left it alone. The Division was notorious about nerfing builds.
---
The drop rates felt right. Legendaries dropped with regularity. If you were farming for a particular legendary it seemed like it never took more than 5 hours. If you were looking for that perfect legendary it took longer but its supposed to. 
---
The world was extremely fleshed out and superbly well written. The dialogue was on point. The main bad guy was funny but ruthless. The side missions added the the world and wasn't just extra missions for xp.
---
And the dlc.... oh my God all of the dlc. Every one of the story dlc's felt like an other whole game. And the the non story extra content added to the gameplay in a made the game that much better.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love and play the games we complain about but man was Borderlands 2 perfect.
---
Relax and take them one at a time. You'll level up extremely fast. Try to bottle neck them. Like white springs over by the pick up our by the window. I used to fight level 50 pluses when I was level 20. Just have to stay calm and learn their patterns. Like in the Wendigo cave there is a point they won't cross so bottle neck them there
---
Or server hop. And find lower levels
---
Yeah. What platform
---
Compiling stuff here :)

Unless your worried some jerk is gonna steal the stuff your trying to transfer so if you need anything in particular transferred I can help 
---
Yes but just for folks know, they can server hop to have new event in a different server. 
---
AFAIK none of the new alcohols are affected by the perk card. 
---
You know you could have fast traveled out of there.
---
Fair enough. I just didn't want you to be stuck with openings in your roof in case you didn't know about these pieces.
---
Lol ty man
---
I would really like this, as I just built my camp near some large trees, and their branches stick through the concrete walls. I can put stuff over the smaller trees outside to stop this, but there's 1 big tree that I can't deal with.
---
What's your IGN? I'm Tazier. Won't be on tonight though, I've got class. 
---
DAMMIT i need my goat mask
---
ThePhychoGamer
---
Has anybody ever encountered the death camp oven C.A.M.P?
---
No. Sneak criticals works too. I did it without vats. Just shot a hostile protectron with my Pipe revolver using only the sight, no vats, and the objective completed. 
---
Make sure your inventory is not being "sorted"
---
I should be on tomorrow around 3-5pm
---
I’ll buy for caps if Xbox. How much?
---
I dunno if you'll read this, but in a few of my farming spots I've killed regular crowned enemies that on occasion drop legendary items, not sure if that's intended or not though.
---
I’m on PS4. 
---
I just imagined a "smart" toaster that you can activate from your phone to have fresh toast as you get home from work.
---
That's a fire waiting to happen.
---
Dude! It's toaster oven wi-fi... Of \**course*\* it's to blame!
---
5 months of waiting for a low level event.  Awesome. 
---
Thx
---
Any human NPCs would be a great addition 
---
It runs great on my PS4..
---
Ok, what you just described is how the mechanic is supposed to work, not how some are using it. Your topic is about griefing and how they misuse the term and I'm explaining that more often that's not always the case. When you talk about baiting players with slap damage, slap their low level friend or even break their CAMP, sure that's perfectly fine and part of the mechanic. But when a player breaks through the Pacifist Mode and Slap KILLS the player within seconds that's absolutely not and you know this. You can't simply justify an exploit just to fit your narrative.
---
I had a blast
---
Do i smell a kickstarter or is that just burnt toast.
---
Same here I'm on ps4 and the game keep crash at launch my friends too
---
Connection I mean
---
Exactly :) 
---
&gt;	Helvetica
---
Minor thing: There’s no “C” in Helvetia, unlike the font. 
---
Preach
---
I totally agree. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. The flight to Tunisia is booked as we speak.
---
I noticed that when sorting by weight if you have multiple items with the same weight they still jump around when selling stuff, annoying to say the least
---
Thanks! I don't mind if other people are doing it at the same time, and we end up doing it "together". I just didn't want to have to be on a team to do so. 
---
I don't want those spying drones in my property. I have the American right to shoot them down!
---
Does that mean you'll be selling your bloodied heavies? Interested in trading? I have a TSE .50 cal that I'd trade for a BE or Bloody + fire rate on any of the following: Gatling Plasma, .50 Cal MG.
---
&gt; It happens 1 hour after the completion of the previous parade. So not exactly on the hour, given that it takes 10-20 minutes to complete.
---
1 hour from the *start* of the prior event, not the end.
---
It depends on your TV. No kidding. I have Xbox One X and PS4 Pro and had to tweak the settings on the 4K TV for both. Make sure you have a 4k HDMI cable running.
---
Could see something like a building set going for a pretty penny after this event 
---
Have you got any aluminum for sale
---
Drills are joke.. from devs.. obviously
---
i only use it to kill pacifist if they engage then i switch to something else its better because you can vats lunge with it i only use martial artist to swing it faster if youre on xbox i can give you one for started such a great thread with all these salty scrubs
---
That's just awesome! Come my ghoul brethren, WE FEAST!
---
Yeah even unsorted it jumps to 1st thing I sold since patch. 
---
Most people don't farm stuff, though, It is the few. It just seems like a large percentage because it is so skewed on here. 
---
I had one event where 1 or 2 died, we received rewards. 
---
Theyre actually pretty decent food too 0% disease and 35 food.
---
I know they said the removed syringers from legendary loot table but had a 3 star watoga robot drop it.
---
Don't be sorry, you did it for science and it had to be done.
---
Results plz, tho.
---
I really need to pay more attention to what Special I add to haha. Level 23 and im a little random I think.  Only one Lucky, 4 intelligence, but couldn't tell you what the rest are.
---
Just did it again and got my Owl mask. One that failed the marchers just stopped short maybe quest wasn't fully loaded, but iis a blast.
---
Agreed the yellow is cooler.
---
The plot thickens 
---
They need to fix the AI first..... These thing crash into everything and can't seem to do much other than than go straight (and even then they glitch out).  It would be cool to use a mounted gun but I doubt I'd ever hit anything with the way they fly!  I've often wondered why we can't use the vertibot signal grenades to call one to pick us up just like fallout 4 (this wouldn't require you to rebuild it if it gets destroyed)
---
You are evil.
---
bless
---
Ha wait till you find the post of a guy who did exactly that
---
That’s a shame. Xbox here. Thanks though
---
Happened to me on multiple legendaries yesterday.. Some of them where even multi stared, but after I killed them and tried to loot them (checked there inventories multiple times, even ran around and killed more enemies and then came back to the same dead legendary to see if it had loaded an item) I found nothing. Like I said it happened multiple times, like 3 or 4 legendaries for me with no drop in an 3 hour play session. 
---
• Giddyup Buttercup (Gear x3)
---
 • Giddyup Buttercup Back Leg (Gear x2)
---
 • Giddyyp Buttercup Front Leg (Gear x2)
---
Something seems odd about their count on these. I guess either the front legs or back legs grow a gear when you rip them off. 
---
No prob mate, good luck on your hunt
---
Yes someone already posted a picture of that haha.
---
Sorry for grammar mistakes, i'm not english. I hope it will help you
---
Karma
---
Lol right
---
It’s all sold sorry
---
Isn't Fasnacht supposed to be a limited event? The stations already in game could maybe have some Fasnacht music during the running of the event.
---
Doesn't work for me.
---
In your camp workshop: try scrolling over from the mothman poster. 
---
You can also make razorgrain flour now
---
I'm not sure you're understanding my point. I'm not talking about a simply initiated PVP battle that you both agreed to participate in. I'm talking about someone on Pacifist Mode and Slap Killed in a matter of seconds. It defeats the purpose of not only Pacifist Mode by Slap Damage as well. This is the reason Bethesda is not only creating a PVP server but removing Slap Damage from Pacifist Mod entire. They're aware it's broken.
---
If I'm in Pacifist Mode and don't care to PVP and someone decides to melee slap damage the hell out of my health I have to quickly jump into my setting and turn off Pacifist in order to even initiate PVP damage in return. I have to do this all while my health bar is melting away. If you don't think it's broken then we'll just have to agree to disagree.
---
I nuked it. It was terrible.
---
Thanks bro not so fast yet 😃 I’m still trying to figure out whether they intentionally stealth-nerfed bloodied or it’s just another item they need to fix in a future patch. 
---
And everyone wonders how self-radicalism starts....
---
I hope so. When I saw it in the shop I immediately thought of the ricola commercials and had to buy it. So yeah I was pretty disappointed after I used it lol
---
Me and a friend have exactly the same problem
---
I'm not sure but it seems to activate when it starts getting closer to night in game.
---
It didn't provide "a new event" or anything like that?
---
Are you using mods or a custom ini file?
---
A patch made a new bug? In fallout 76? This cant be! 
---
I'm pretty much staying in Helvetia all day long to get everything I can. So far got the Owl Mask, Witch Mask, Fasnacht Donut Recipe, and Fasnacht Pole Lantern Recipe.
---
There are definitely different tasks to complete. I've seen intestines for the sausage maker, eggs for the baker, beeswax for the candle maker, playing music for the singer, collecting wood for the bonfire, and collecting beer steins. Not sure how many more there may be, but those are the ones I've seen.
---
I remember a time when our cable connection would cut out whenever the microwave or hairdryer was used. The cable guy said it was due to impedance and put in a cable splitter. That did the trick for us. 
---
This is hilarious. Lol
---
Thx man
---
$8 for 10 seconds of paint bucket tool.
---
I guess Bethesda missed a chance once again
---
Thank you.  I misunderstood a previous post.  Not speaking from experience.  Waiting for it to start now. 
---
Proooffff???
---
Thanks but not the issue
---
Just server hop till you find one, done 4 now 
---
Yeah. I run solo and I just did it together with a handful of strangers. I don't use mic either so it's not really necessary to engage with the others unless you absolutely have to.
---
I think that Fusion cores can't be recharged because of the decay process. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZsaaturR6E&amp;t=52s) the stripping of the molecule changes the state, thats why they blow up when ejected with that one perk in FO:4. So 'recharging' doesn't seem the way Bethesda would go. BUT 'refilling by replacing' is definitely possible, though you would need to hold the pressure while cycling out the waste. Or it go off like a nuke and you would have to dispose of the waste.  
---
How about a quest to gather ingredients (that green plasma)
---
coming out the fissures. Though it would have to be a site location to 'refill' it. Because a crafting station would theoretically be to small so you'd need a factory.
---
Ok how about a daily quest from the military base bot to deliver supplies to a research wing but you find that supplies are to old. So the research bot sends you out with a device to find acceptable replacement and it leads you to the fissures. You gather material fight a beast or whatever, bring the materials back. Maybe also some black steel to replace the lining. And you pay a very very very caps for the work. And thats how you 'refill' the Cores.
---
I mean, not incorrect, but it didn't go over my head. Problem with these "I meant it to be sarcastic" posts is that Bethesda still sees this crap that gets upvoted to high heavens and then continues to ignore the actual issues in the game. While they have improved a lot, there is still way too many actual bugs that make the game unplayable to joke about this and not expect other players to get annoyed. 
---
But like great call out dude. 
---
Psn add sent
---
Okay msg me when u have some 
---
Gotten the Witch Mask and Soldier mask so far
---
Go to settings &gt; audio &gt; chat and turn up the volume. There is a bug that randomly sets it at zero, making it impossible to hear anyone. Can happen midgame. It's new. Thought they might fix it today. 
---
No, so far I have harvested all beehives 3 times. Kinda seems that they are respawning the beeswax after each event. 
---
You have to wait at least 30/40 minutes and it starts again
---
Well shit. Lol
---

You should provide proof as anyone can claim they lost something they may never have had to begin with
---
If it won’t let you place the poster, go to the train stations. Most of them have it posted on a wall
---
Is it bright orange?
---
I havent done it once and Ive been to like 8 servers
---
Damn, sorry man. Hope you get it figured out!
---
JOIN THE BOS JOIN THE BOS JOIN THE BOS JOIN THE BOS JOIN THE BOS JOIN THE BOS JOIN THE BOS JOIN THE BOS JOIN THE BOS JOIN THE BOS JOIN THE BOS JOIN THE BOS
---
That’s a strange palette, was it inspired by the ultracite PA? But still way better than school bus for sure. 
---
It resets every hour, so find one with the event and just stay on that one for an hour 
---
Oh I think I saw you haha
---
umm ya please read or look at the pic
---
I haven't heard anything sadly
---
What no you can’t do that it starts on all servers
---
Maybe try to join someone that you know for sure has a poster at their camp? I’m assuming you’ve restarted the game/computer after you updated it, right?
---
Nothing interesting, kinda ruined the event
---
I started doing it, bugged it out completely, had to redo from scratch, when I finally obtained TNT dome key and went there, it was open and completely unlooted. Lol.
---
Raw. Raw never chnages.
---
Destroying camps does not award caps or junk. 
---
Quick everybody say it
---
I do play as an evil villain
---
Do you know why I love this? It proves that marine is not the best. Now everyone can finally shut up about that damn load screen.
---
Have the green (Gaint) would you trade it for owl ? PSN Azkiin
---
You’re a monster!
---
Just server hop I have done it like 5 time
---
oh ya its been a week since the patch.  I just cant see the poster in game not sure why
---
Or the part where the Giddyup Buttercup has FOUR legs 4 X 2 = 8 
---
Stop bringing logic and reason into this FO76 conversation, lol. 
---
Maybe could be something they implement in later events. :)
---
Not off work till midnight 😭
---
I'll trade a witch for the owl. also on ps4
---
My advice is: Go to Helvetia, walk around, pop balloons, play some tunes, say hi to your neighbors and eventually the parade will start. It seems to take about 15 minutes or so to complete so I'd guesstimate the parade resets every half an hour or so.
---
Played it in juiceheads server and it was interesting, the last part when everything spawned was cool but I wish the levels were better in all of it, everyone vaporized the enemies with their op weapons. The part where you gather supplies was a nice change but most of it gets done within a minute which isn't a bad thing but it would be nice to have contributed a little more. All in all it was nice, especially because it brought what seemed like the whole server to it.
---
Can you explain more on that, suchas how or what way wood armor is superior for stealth builds. Would chameleon wood armor be superior to other types of chameleon armor? I'm still figuring out a lot of the nuances to FO76 and hadn't heard anything good about wood armor until reading your post right now. At any rate thank you for any infos you're willing to share on it!!
---
God I sure hope so! I was thinking that too when I saw it.
---
If true. That sucks you should have a chance to prove you can play by the rules. What did you destroy? What platform?
---
Your using a 6 day old account so you really have no reason to be honest. However I'll asume your being honest. Mainly because your post was very low sodium.
---
FYI the only people who can help you are Bethesda. So my questions are out of pure curiosity.
---
Maybe so but it's a bit different when they clearly said they wasn't paying attention. Is accountabilty not a thing anymore?
---
Totally agree. ESP considering all other events has a ridiculous amount of time. I find this event the only one that short change you on the timer. 
---
Also a rifle build. I use a bloodied pickaxe w/ sharp mod. I only have 3 points in STR and the axe works just fine for me. 
---
I lurked at the back of the line to be honest, let the level 100s take care of the suicider lol.
---
Blade of Bastet... and I have an anti-scorched something or other. I'll have to check when I get home. Loved my serrated Machete for ages.
---
Booo I was about to ask what platform - I’m on PC. I was gonna pop over and meet you at the shelter door with a care package.  I’ve been doing that lately for new peeps, modded machette, some useful plans and a modded pistol. 
---
Oh well. 😉
---
This is why I play this game :) Very funny
---
It wasnt fair what bethesda did to you. They didnt deliver on an optional PvP, coop experience as you wanted. 
---
It wasnt fair to me either they didn't deliver a PvP experience as promised. 
---
They under delivered on both fronts creating the chaos we see here. We both feel justified. Neither of us are breaking the rules. Hopefully survival mode makes it better for both of us.
---
I didnt want this thread to be an argument on what constitutes griefers or what constitutes an "asshole". It turned into a shit show. (Although im objectively correct, nothing i do is griefing) you just validated my existance when you said "did i know there are raiders? YES"
---
This sub shouldnt be hiding and downvoting raiders like we are a dirty secret. We should be clear about what raiders can and cannot do, how to use the pacifist toolkit to limit any damage raiders do and explain/defend that raiders are an *intended feature*
---
I wanted to spread awareness on how i play so those who wanna opt out use their toolkit correctly to limit the grief (caused by a lack of understanding of the mechanics, and ignoring that this is a pvp game). I stand by that ive never griefed anyone and im allowed to have my raider playstyle.
---
This whole " i KnOw YoU GeT oFf On CaUsiNg GrIef" crap is pure fantasy. Not true at all. Sure ive met people like that .. But not me ima stand up guy 👍
---
This thread went the wrong direction. The pve crowd is so angry and hostile they cant help but to get in their own way, remain willingly ignorant and limit knowledge on how to avaoid raiders. 
---
We are no secret. Our existance is just as legit as your trader existance. Its something you have to deal with.  Why not spread awareness and kindly answer questions on how to deal with raiders? We arent griefing we are part of fallout. And we are pretty darn proud of our playstyle.. Its fun and rewarding. You should try it tonight!
---
No .. You guys are so butthurt you would rather argue and name call. (Honestly ive been combative as well in this thread...  srry bout that!)
---
Did you get banned for having 100,000+ items or going on the dev room?
---
How much damage are you doing with full health vs 10-20% health?
---
IT WAS YOUUUU
---
I made the account on here just to try to get ahold of Bethesda and figure stuff out 6 days ago. I didn't use the account cuz they armband me and next thing you know I'm rehband and I destroyed everything.I was like two hundred thousand pounds overweight and I couldn't trade with anyone or anything. So I couldn't drop anything or trade so I had to destroy it
---
I literally posted this exact thing 5 minutes ago. Could you of not waited atleast an hour before copying my post 
---
I didn't get my mask the second time I ran it. Kinda bummed but this is around long enough that I'll hopefully be able to run it a bunch more
---
hmmm I played earlier today. All fine...now it stopped working. I just crash to Desktop the moment I hit a key in the "hit any key to play" screen. Whats fucking wrong? Is there a log to send?
---
Fasnacht Soldier Mask: Aren't you a little tall for a Napoleon?
---
Fasnacht Owl Mask: Don't fly away just yet!  Fasnach is coming!
---
Yeah it would be good to store meat, vegetables and fruits in it so they never spoil
---
I could just imagine all the bugs with the train 
---
Try to set the launcher language to english
---
Less loading screens will always be good.
---
However I don’t think this one will save much loading time.
---
Pop a herbivore serum.  I recall leveling up and having carnivore and losing it without taking rad away.  99% sure because I contracted herbivore and they cancelled out.  Can usually pick up a serum for 200 caps which shouldn’t break the bank.
---
The reinstall doesn’t work ty for all and sayonara 
---
Some Rus (15-30) canot to play the game.Crash on main menu.Re-dowload,kill forder Fallout 76 not help.
---
Unfortunately it breaks the new quest. You can't complete it when the area is nuked.
---
I feel they should do things like this but have it be that the "quests" be completed x amount of times befor the event ends or something then its added globally 
---
Interesting. I've been wearing Heavy Combat Chest + Heavy Leather Limbs forever. I had been scrapping Combat Arms to get the BOS mod (no luck). I think I might stop. I have BOS for Combat Chest (got it from a quest, probably the Tech Data hand-in).
---
Typically, If I need Rad Resist, I'll either pop a Rad-X or jump into some power armour.
---
Also: I'm not sure, but I think +Int can alter these numbers a bit? I gotta pop some Berry Mentats, and some Brain food (SB Brain/Brain Fungus) and test.
---
You wanted them built at CAMPs this is just for the signal grenades and transport, wouldn't even have a mounted gun
---
Did you delete your fallout76custom.ini file?
---
I start two events before I start two events, and then I start two more.  
---
Just collect from a lake or other body of water. Rapid pushing the collect button will rapid collect
---
Run from the truth, but you can’t escape it.
---
Hmm, interesting. How much damage does it do?

I feel your pain, but just 3000 myself.  Hopefully get home in time Saturday to pick up the mask.
---
Im on PC with a controller
---
Sorry dude about my behaviour haha
---
Not on rn, is it limited time?
---
Okay I viewed back my footage and I think it was you at site bravo who launched it. Curse you.

Not sure how to post the gallery but these are all the items currently in the Atom Shop. 
---
I did launch from Bravo yes...
---
I'm Italian, I can't access too.
---
For my sneaky snipey build I have a 3\* combat knife that'll take out just about anything I can sneak up on. But it makes a terrible weapon for swarms so I've got a 2\* Grognak's Axe and an All Rise that seem to be a bit more effective, provided I can switch in the right perk cards. But honestly my preferred crowd control weapon is my Vampire's Flaming Plasma rifle. Melts ghouls like no one's business and buffs my health to boot.
---
I've found that one to be mostly luck... lucky enough to have radtoads spawning like mad? Then you're good. Other times... not a hope in hell.
---
What are the uranium extraction legendaries?
---
You on XB1?
---
Y o u .
---
Yeah saw that during trading as well.
---
They might have banned you and then made you part of the unban wave on accident and then re-banned you. A few friends I play with were unbanned and they are still playing right now. You won’t get a response on here. Your sure best way would be to put a ticket in and be descriptive as you can on the ticket. 
---
Your good, just think it's a great idea I'd love to bring attention to 👍🏻👍🏻
---
this
---
You should be able to, my uncle bought a disc copy of the EU version of No Mans Sky and we still played it together, however he didn’t have access to his load from the US copy 
---
It's problem from Bethesda servers or launther
---
LOL, There goes all my atoms.. I bought the Red Stove as well!
---
So whats this footage you have?
---
Yep. Pop a Rad-X and have at it.
---
At least it cooks better than my toaster oven. 
---
I've done it 3 times already and I got the same mask every time, that being said is the witch mask common?  
---
The Skrulls are the good guys 
---
If you can find an Instigating ski sword I  would go with that. 
---
I fell that on a real level. But a nuclear apocalypse was sufficient for me especially since I nuked the DMV area as soon as I could launch nukes regularly. 
---
Does not work for me.
---
I’m on Xbox 😞. Thanks for the offer though!!
---
They still drop a Drill. 
---
Patch 7 didn't work.
---
Currently on my pc which I’ll have to get tomorrow cause I’m out for now 
---
I have not got mask plans. I have been getting s mssk and sometimes a plan but it decorations for your camp
---
Sorry I really fucking hated this quest because I had to do it three ass times.
---
Tony Stark is becomes villain and dies at the end 
---
Maybe bot but it would be more convenient for transferring items and what not 
---
&gt;3* Fat Man lands at their feet.
---
&gt;Mini-nuke falls out of Fat Man.
---
&gt;**THOOOM**-back to title screen.
---
Wow that's kind evil on the part of whoever dropped that nuke...
---
...guess I know what I'm nuking tonight!
---
The Mole Miner Supervisors from the "Uranium Fever" event  
---
And agreed, theres always that one or two dudes using TSE 1 shotting them
---
Tried
---
Than you for the idea. 
---
But it Doesn’t work
---
Patch day no play 😅 
---
I guess we all going to wait tomorrow
---
Yeah. I'm avoiding using my strong weapons for this Event so everyone gets a shot in. I limited myself to my Black Power Pistol and nothing else. 
---
I'm currently just camping out in Helvetia for the day so I won't miss when the Event starts. I got nothing better to do, and there's a few people in my server with the same idea.
---
I'm having the same problem :( 
---
&gt;The difference is nobody will come to their rescue because PvP won’t be allowed.
---
If this actually happened regularly, there wouldn't be nearly as many complaints.
---
Uranium fever event
---
Yes I was stoked about my TS gatling. Modded it out with true charging and true receiver. Am very disappointed. At that fire rate it needs to do 300 dam at least. 
---
I have noticed this as well. Diseased enemies occasionally drop a legendary item. I think when the enemy names are too long it (sometimes) just cuts the star off at the end of the name. So the enemy actually is a legendary enemy. You can notice their health bar refill. 
---
I got the giant twice. Am aiming for the owl one.
---
Strange, it worked for me and couple friends (on ps4 too) 
---
Despite all my time playing FO4/76 I've never actually tried this. Does it really heal up ghouls? I know I have a Furious Radium Rifle I've used on them, but the ballistic damage always did more than the radiation so I never noticed. 
---
Says something about nose growing too big because of liyng with mask from fort defiance
---
Still at work myself, another 4 hours until I can try and convince my wife it's game night ;)
---
Vaults house around 500 people iirc so who knows
---
I recently moved my camp near a small lake/pond in the forest region and I've yet to have any enemies spawn there. I think it's because it's right near a location that usually spawns enemies that's just far enough that they don't automatically wander over to me.
---
A pacifist is someone who believes that violence is wrong and refuses to take part.  Google it.
---
1) That does not exclude violence from being acted upon them/you.
---
2)  If you really want to play the Pacifist, you would drop all of your weapons and avoid attacking anything.
---
They patched spawning in that previously you could move around before everything had loaded. Then you would snap back once done. Now it slows you down while continuing to load which you see as lag.
---
Give it to hornwright to sabotage a product and then resell it with a new painjob
---
same on PC, i had hoped that they fixed it on the hotfix when fixing nuke timers but nah
---
 I agree, but how I can provide proof for something that happen for second, I must record everything. By the way one of the weapon i lost was "all Rise", everyone has this weapon,but my weapon disappear from my inventory.
---
I'm just glad I've been earning more atoms than I spent! 
---
Seen alot of requests to lock weapons at vendors to prevent accidental spam sell , seems like this will work
---
 And you stole his toys. ;(
---
Wouldnt be self sufficient be the ultimate reward though ?
---
Good luck getting the one(s) you want.   
---
Several things were added for sure, including underground areas from the trailer! And random events also seemed to get a few new additions, so I think it's safe to say that Appalachia will change atleast a bit with every update 
---
Lol where do you go to start that quest line? Sounds amusing. 
---
Wait it’s not stupid. It will give a worldwide notification when it’s starting up so then go over
---
Hey Brain, JWCIII here. I think it's lag. It's possible that it's server lag but I personally suspect client lag. Like I know you play with people from all over the globe, same as me, and I notice it a lot more on players I know are from another continent but are likely playing with and joining friends on NA servers. Not much to be done really. I just deal lethal and swap targets, usually they drop dead a few seconds later.
---
Just server hop 
---
Same here from France. No luck. The game is crashing after the first click on menu
---
Ash heap. Its on the trees. 
---
How do you pronounce it? I was guessing hell-vay-sha and I wanna see if I have 1 IQ or 2 IQs
---
When does it restart after finishing?
---
After inspection it might have been an owl. 
---
You can't handle conflict in a video game or an internet message board lol. Go play Little Big Planet,  that might be more your speed.
---
me too
---
And sometimes they only drop one bio! 
---
Welch is where I went. Check the trees.
---
They would need to add the ability to eject if they did. Otherwise people would shoot you down every time and they wouldn't be worth using if you know you will die
---
Looks like it.  I have 3 witches, 2 owls, 1 soldier, and 1 giant.
---
.99 cent value meal. Like mine. Lol
---
Awesome! I look forward to meeting you
---
I think it's pretty much anything that used to be restricted to ground now. I was finally able to put that Red Rocket on my roof and make the C.A.M.P. I always wanted!
---
The only plans u can get are for your camp
---
Server hop i have done it like 6 times
---
Cool, armor seems more balanced now. Except raider still sucks!
---
Wow... people are d-bags. Figured they would make it a safe zone like Vault 76 for this reason. 
---
Atom shop for 800
---
My very 1st launch.  
---
Ok i just did a quick test and found out Bloodied effect is actually Gone. The only thing affecting Bloodied weapon is now Adrenal Reaction. Bloodied itself is not working. 
---
I have three different Gatlings, they are the Bloodied, Hunter’s and also two-shot. At ANY health the TS outperforms the Bloodied and Hunter’s by about 20%. The Bloodied and Hunter’s are consistently the same. 
---
Hope others can look at theirs too to see whether this is a real issue or just my system. 
---
Only in Workshops, there's a mat under like the farthest right tab for it, but I don't think there are any that work for Camps
---
Should we add our drops here? Got a witch mask and streamers plan
---
same. no luck. European server (france) on PC.
---
Same problem here, it crashes at "Please stand by" logo
---
Around 150 at half health out of PA
---
Aww, somebody's cranky.
---
Thanks for the confirmation. I'll file a bug report to Bethesda. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.
---
That sucks, I began investing in party boy because of the dlc. The buffed carry weight is great tho, and it doesn't increase the Int penalty
---
Hey there, have you [filled out a support ticket](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) yet? 
---
So they do give a server wife notice when it starts huh? 
---
That happens sometimes in Whitesprings when I'm scanning the ground from dead ghouls, you see feet and immediately strike, only to realize it's a person.  I just go back about my way picking up loot.  If they want to PvP then I'm pretty much dead.  Happens all the time vice versa as well, especially since I'm melee and others may be gun/shotgun.  If they keep shooting me after all the ghouls are dead then I know they're actually PvP'ing me.
---
If it like the balloons near vaut 76, we can pop them bare hand.
---
Put on a Hazmat suit (or PA &amp; Rad-X if you don't have a Hazmat yet) and you can just spam the collect button on rivers, ponds, etc. There's no animation so you can collect as fast as you can hit the button 👍
---
&gt;Recipe: Fasnacht Donuts

😯
---
I was helping a low level buddy of mine do that event to try to get him some good legendaries for when he turned 40. Some level 240 kept oneshotting everything, I sent him a message asking him to let my buddy tag the legendaries but he just gave the thumbs down emoji. We followed him home and wrecked his base once he left. Not my proudest moment but if we can’t have an actual karma system then I guess I’ll have to do it myself. 
---
Sorry that you are salty bro.
---
Hey, why don't you go take a walk and get some fresh air? Looks like you need it.
---
That’s not available until April 1st
---
You sound a little tickled, friendo. 
---
GILF ❤️
---
Glad u like it :) I too think its pretty nce. Got giants mask twice and owls once. 
---
I only realized this when i was dumping some booze into my stash to free up weight and it was all showing up in my fermenter, but without the check mark that denoted that it was assigned to said fermenter. 
---
Yeah I got 1 giant mask  :) had lotta fun
---
No, helmet says “clean space helmet” and suit says “clean spacesuit” 
---
The orange one I think is from the atom shop...
---
I know you probably can't answer this directly, but blink once if you guys get a bonus every time someone hops to a different server.
---
I want it all.
---
And i want it now.
---
Lol.
---
just like everyone else  in this thread right? we all just dont get it? you my friend, are a lost cause
---
if you want to be an asshole in game, do it!
---
we all know you will anyway
---
have a beautiful day, you are now blocked as there is no need to surround myself with people like you, life is too short!
---
im sure you will respond with another rude or snarky reply, luckily, ill never have to see another of your posts
---
Ouch lol 😂
---
You can buy them also from the roaming responder trader that appears outside of Charleston station...
---
I’ll take a look. 
---
That’s cool. I got 3 legendary leather chest pieces in 2 hours. THREE LEGENDARY LEATHER CHEST PIECES. Now all of my chests are covered.
---
Oh god, my brother and boyfriend went through this bug. They were furious to have to do it over and over. Meanwhile, girl is over here laughing up a storm as I'd finished it already.
---
I just got a fasnacht beret! Perfect! 
---
Yeah good point, I was misreading that as "back legs" and "front legs." Like you get two at once. That's even worse!
---
Good. Ruining other people's experience is the only thing left to do. 
---
If you over-repair melee weapons they get an extra bonus to dmg, and that little bump can actually make V. Fast category melee weapons great for swatting vermin. I recommend a Ripper (BuzzBlade &amp; Chainsaw are too heavy, Drill gets a tad too weak as the bonus drops off). Especially with the Vampire or Furious perk 👍
---
Well shit my on a cliff and I spawn on the very edge
---
Well if they fixed the dupe glitch i must be perm banned, cause i still cant access my account, and still havnt recieved any response to my support ticket. Trying to be patient but it seems like the people who whined the most got unbanned. Bout to start spammong them until i get a response. 
---
Some people are simply too dumb to realize they should be sharing when there are others. I’ve run into several occasions when one person one-shot the Legendaries and others gave him the Thumbs-down, he responded with ‘???’ and keep one-shotting the rest. Many low-IQ players in the game world just like in the real world. 
---
You assumed plenty when you attacked me as a person and tired to put words in my mouth by publicly stating how I think or feel. That’s textbook shit.
---
I spoke to help be informative, to help generate awareness of how to avoid the current mechanics people are suffering from. The more awareness, the longer it goes on, the more it’s talked about... the more likely and faster they are to alter or rebalance these issues. 
---
You chose to take this opportunity as exposure and used it to start talking shit to a stranger all on your own accord. You don’t know me or what I do with my time outside of a teeny tiny piece of insight you read in a chat box.  Funny how people try painting pictures of you or try putting words in your mouth on the internet. Never a lack of that shit here. 
---
Would certainly allow them to be more viable to keep around. I like the tools and recycled household objects. It's my dream to get a vampire attack speed rolling pin.
---
Yeah there's a vendor in the whitespirngs building that sells loads. 
---
It's the red and black. The all black datamined one isn't out yet. If they hit me with that and 4 horsemen at the same time they're going to get real money out of me, damn it!
---
7 days. Only 165 chance left now.  
---
Did you find the new asshat armor?
---
Just kinda disappointed because I hoped they will actually try to improve the game. Been playing since release lvl 125. 
---
And it's just a neverending cycle of promises lies and disappointments.
---
Quality of this is in my opinion a joke as I wrote up there
---
Keep server hopping 
---
No unfortunately not yet.
---
At least not in game 
---
You are subjectively correct, your personal perspective is what is making you feel you are correct in that what you are doing is not causing grief to other.  When the Objective truth is that you are in fact causing others grief. You can stand by and make claims like that all you want, but if you continue to attack players that have no interest in PvP and destroy their camp, you are in fact a griefer.  The argument that they can leave if they don't want it works just as well against you, as you can leave if they aren't interested.  
---
You are a raider, you aren't a stand up guy, quite the opposite in fact actually.  Validating your existence doesn't take away that you are in fact griefing and an asshole.  
---
The problem is, you don't want people to hate you for being an asshole, well that's not how this works.  People don't think I'm an asshole in game because I don't do things like destroy other peoples CAMPs, steal their workshops or even pick up their dropped loot if they die regardless of reason.  
---
And no, I'm not an asshole, so no I wont try it.  Sorry
---
Maybe impact only [pc] users
---
First time, had a great time.  Helpful people told me what to expect and do.  Second time was good, til server crashed when I was trying to loot the end boss right before I got rewards.. :(
---
Ya same here man, it friggin blows. If you move the camp device within your camp it'll move the spawn point a bit, but it takes a lotta trial and error, and your camp device will probably be in a weirdass spot.
---
Yeah, and I've had people try to slap me down, through melee, that I turned and killed. I get what your saying, I just disagree with your conclusion
---
I'm glad they're still pumping out high fashion, too. I'm in love with the vintage outfit.
---
First time, had a great time.  Helpful people told me what to expect and  do.  Second time was good, til server crashed when I was trying to loot  the end boss right before I got rewards.. :( 
---
Bloodied booze build I've been making whiskey in batches of 55 for that sweet +6 strength. If i didn't happen to have the build that has me doing this anyways, I'd probably be pretty pissed too.
---
Sir Smokey what ammo you used I’ve assisted twice on your gatherings and I got an ammo gift 🎁 
---
I use ultracite.50cal dude 
---
It wasn't realistic because each time you returned to the robot you didn't need to take a new ticket
---
Well, I don't know what to tell you. At least they are trying to add new content and are working to keep the game as stable as possible.
---
The fact that you don't like that content is another issue entirely.
---
Seems to happen every hour on the nick of the clock on my sever I assisted twice 
---
I picked up a  3\* Vampires Combat Knife/ +50% Limb Damage/ Take 15% Less Damage While Blocking. It is death on wheels to anything, and I have no perk cards for melee. Super fast and it heals you so I can do a Whitesprings run with just that knife.
---
Now you're being silly. I know what Pacifist means as well as most with a highschool education. It's used as a naming convention and not supposed to be taken literally. That's just a flawed argument. When I open the Atomic Shop I don't expect my items to be radiated. Pacifist is merely creative naming by Bethesda for a mode that does not wish to participate in PVP. You're simply playing a game of semantics at this point.
---
my must hear sound is Bubbles, "Nuka Oh-Ron-ge"
---
I was thinking this just the other day.  I remove all the event notifications from my screen so I usually still notice it, but it sure would be nice to have a real notification just for your camp being attacked.  
---
Spotify it share it ;)
---
In your honest opinion. Are disappearing models ok in a 60$ game? Do you think that adding 1 event after 3 months of disaster is ok?
---
Ew. Under 50 1 star? Miss me with that casual shit. 
---
PC. Genuine bummer we cannot battle with clicks instead of words. 😂
---
They also did not fix the 'Over Encumbered, Sprinting will Drain AP' message at log in. I still get it about 25% of the time.
---
all rise + lever action rifle gets me through the day
---
This is a really fun event. Chance for rare loot, and being able to play with others. 
---
The entire Wild Appalachia DLC is being spread out, and it has some awesome things to look forward to, this is just the beginning along with the brewing stuff. 
---
Hoping over
---
That alone will keep me from buying it. 
---
I did it on pc and worked fine (maybe i works only in italy) 
---
If you can use ethernet instead of wireless on PS4 it will save you hours.
---
It clearly is okay to me since I don't throw a tantrum about it, yes.
---
Would I love RDR2 levels of animation? Of course, who wouldn't. But I understand the limitations.
---
About the other, you are acting as if this is the only thing they have done in three months. And that's just false.
---
r/circlejerk
---
If you really got any excuse for this except for saying that I'm salty feel free to discuss
---
Sounds like I’ll get it then! Cheers folks 
---
I killed 2 three star legendaries and both only dropped 1 stars. I just thought that patch hadn't hit yet. 
---
Yes,  i got a drill from a 3* the other day.   Not even a * drill...
---
Be sure to drop it as the event goes on for full satisfaction ;P
---
It's not just 76, every Fallout since 3 has done that.
---
Yeah I should have server hopped when I joined and saw a Nuke zone over the event but figured it was worth a shot. 
---
Searched for intestines until the event failed :(
---
Add me on Xbox as well
---
What else? 
---
Bugfixes and they TRIED to resolve stability issues. And what are the limitations? Them using an outdated engine since Oblivion?
---
Lol bro that screen name is pretty suspect
---
Millions of items. Almost 2 month bann. Then unbanned yesterday. Just to be banned today
---
Idk. "Rare" actually means things. Continue your grind I guess. No reason they need to make it easy for you, or to make them drop as often as legendary wood armor. 
---
io ho avuto il tuo stesso problema, prova ad analizzare e riparare. Io ho fatto così ed ha risolto, impostandomi il gioco in inglese
---
I live in a poorly laid out and old apartment and one room is basically a Faraday Cage...no wifi, no cell service, no nothing. Powerline adapters are the only reason I didn't move yet.
---
Makes me sad I lost that 3* bloodied meat hook I once found - had swing speed and +1 something on it too.
---
If you're in that part of the Nukashine quest, the location is highlighted.
---
Not too bad 
---
It's like an hour after you do it. You have to be in the same lobby tho.
---
Seems like an odd decision to spawn the enemies in the same spots each time, only a matter of time before people start camping the spawn spots and not following the robots.
---
My question is do you get rarer masks for more kills?
---
This post alone is going to ensure people nuke the event
---
No, i finished but i want to make more
---
That’s why. Millions of items was a perm ban. 100,000 items was a suspension.
---
If you're on PC, the Better Inventory mod is essential. You can see the total weight of each group of items in each tab, filter each tab (e.g., Armor has sub filters for clothing, armor, armor - chest, armor - left arm, etc.; Aid has food, water, chems, player-created food, player-created water items, etc.). This functionality should have been the game from day one, except Bethesda still doesn't know how to create a user-friendly UI that works with a controller. Thank goodness for modders.
---
Sure thing ! Thanks mate !
---
I thought that shit was hilarious.
---
Good answer better than my lol
---
I unlocked a plan but can't for the life of me figure out what it was. I've looked through the camp plans and they all show locked, any ideas because I can't seem to remember what it was called.
---
know if millions of weight but hundreds of thousands of items. I never duped anyting I had stuff given to me by The Duprees though to hold onto. They sent me a notification of the items and said that I would be unbanned in a future update
---
Who's the quest giver on this one?  I completely missed it, I think, I don't remember it at all.
---
Yeah thats what happened to my First account  :/
---
Like you said, launch was a disaster of bugs. I am glad that they started to work on those *and* server stability, while at the same time planning and developing entirely new content.
---
About engines, you are about to get schooled. Did you know that Rockstar has used the same engine they used for Table Tennis in RDR2? Not only that, they have used that engine in **all** their games. Do you know why? Because it's not about ditching and engine and starting a new one every 4 years or so; it's about updating that engine. If you are trying to say that Oblivion and Fallout 76 use the same engine version, well, that again is false.
---
Attacking a camp has been known to provoke PvP, thereby awarding caps and sometimes junk via loot.
---
Ummm... if you dont believe me then that's on you. 
---
I want this so bad. Bethesda please make it happen
---
Hey man you still have any 3* 2 handed melee weapons or explosive two shot shotgun?
---
There are two nuka cola machines along the power armiur farming route in watoga. I often find some there.
---
Is teamwork necessary for ANY event in Fallout 76? No, but it's more fun with people -- plus faster as you can divide up the work.
---
I'm at not millions of items millions and weight I was carrying a lot of really heavy stuff for other people so I probably had like a total of like 200,000 items on me that need a destroyed
---
Sounds like all your bad deeds as a raider are weighing heavy on your mind, it’s okay buddy there’s still time to repent and join the responders. Help make this wasteland great again. Didn’t mean to #trigger you but if you can’t take a little heat go back to workshop PvPing with your raider team. 
---
The scenario the OP was talking about was a 2v1 and then you mentioned your “4 man team” and how y’all do the same thing to a (singular) “high lvl player who owns multiple workshops”. Please be more clear with your words and the context in which you use them if you don’t want to be called out as weak for teaming, simple as that. 
---
Accusing me of looking for exposure when you were basically talking about all your great deeds is pretty funny to me, ironic much? 
---
Update new rewards: Fasnacht Toothy Man Mask and Plan: Fasnacht Party Streamers
---
Agreed I’ve got a Mac but I don’t think it could handle this game. 
---
Just make them fall out when it explodes, and always wear power armor.
---
It’s just an event. Not sure how often it comes. It’s near Helvita in the forest on the map. The event comes up for you no matter where you are on the map, like the scorched earth quest. It’s not too difficult
---
Try train stations. Anywhere theres a nuka machine. The nuka plant. Idk of any places that spawn multiples at once. Over by the flatwoods motel. Theres a machine by the pool and to the left is a house that sometimes spawns one in the fridge on the porch.
---
Go to the little putt putt behind white springs. Takes like a min to collect 100 dirty water, then go boil. 
---
I still have the super sledge dude
---
You can leave the event, kill some rabbits and swuirrels and collect them then bring them back to the event
---
I noticed balloons were not synced. I told a guy we can shoot balloons and he shot at the ground where a balloon used to be.
---
A bumble bee.
---
What are the legendaries 
---
But how do you know it wasn't a guy with a girl character?
---
I don’t know why you are so salty. It is an event based on real life events. I think it is cool to see them bring real stuff from West Virginia into the game. If you don’t like it don’t play. 
---
But Creation engine is not good for multiplayer games. If you ever had any coding experience involving it you would know that it just cant process many players at once (thats why Skyrim multiplayer mods are in pre-alpha state since 2011). 
---
Also apparently they aren't doing a great job because 20% of the timeline SBQ crashes the server.
---
 R* engine is really adaptive so you can use it for any project and they are updating it so much that the only thing is the same is the name. 
---
It’s executioners super sledge with swing speed and 15% less damage when blocking 
---
I'd *heard* about this mythical fountain, but I've never seen it in any of my Whitesprings runs.
---
Thanks to OP, I actually have an idea of where to look now.
---
Has this been proven? I've only seen one post and he seemed to think it wasn't penetrating the ER because it's labeled as "Anti-Armor". And Armor only being for ballistic DR.
---
100% agree and the code is already there from fallout 4
---
Lmao, in which Fallout game was there 'beer and booze'? Fallout has always been a silly franchise, OP.
---
If you are gonna do the Fasnacht event, make sure you don’t get the butcher protectron 
---
One time per hour serverwise. The time resets when the event spawns. So if it takes you 20 minutes to complete it. You will have to wait 40 until the next one spawns on that paticular server.
---
If someone contests your workshop, does their gamer info and that of their teammate(s) show up RED or YELLOW? If you crouch are you HIDDEN/DETECTED or CAUTION/DANGER?
---
You may not know someone contested your workshop but should at least know they pose a threat.
---
The legendary sloth at the end shows they need to beef up scaling for event bosses. It goes down so quick it can be difficult for some players to get a hit in.
---
Ah, sorry. I tried several vendors in Whitesprings, including the bot near the dining room. None of them carried it. All the ones I've found to date have been random, though some were in Nuka vending machines.
---
Will you and other players acknowledge that the following are two separate requests?
---
1) I don’t want to PvP
---
2) I don’t want to be griefed.
---
Are there assholes in this game?  Certainly.  Will separate PvP servers or an invincible mode for Pacifists remove the assholes from PvE servers?  No, there are other ways to cause grief, and those griefers will rejoice that other players can no longer kill them.
---
Big facts
---
50 cal is the wayyyyy to go I have like 3 different types lol 
---
İt is extremly rare i think
---
Also, in case you didn't know, you get new recipes each time you encounter a new foodstuff (pick a new plant, kill a new beast), and there are plenty of recipes scattered around Appalachia. When I was new I found a recipe in nearly every new camp/town/home location I visited. 
---
My instigating pipe wrench is already the ideal mole ratio whacker; it would be great if it also reduced construction costs.
---
And I get to go to the DMV not once, but twice this month.
---
If you never hear from me again fellow survivors, it is because the MO DMV ate me.
---
Nuke Charleston in my name. ❤️
---
I already submitted my ticket but I thought I would crosspost here as well, I just got done with the event however  I was unable to interact with any of the subquest other than killing creatures and other spawns. I did not get any rewards such as mask or recipes. The event also did not show up on my pip-boy,nor was there any indication as to what I needed to do.  
---
Bubbles in Whitespring resort usually has some. Walk around the outside of Whitesprings until you find the putting green (not the clubhouse) and enter Whitesprings through the side doors there, and you're there.
---
Love this post! 
---
Not that i know of
---
Haha I have 2! They are great for SBQ 
---
If i remember correctly there is a nuka cola bot, have you checked her, shes in whitespring
---
Ah, was wondering that, thank you!
---
Glad you're having a good time, Gramps.  Enjoy the Old Country Buffet ;-)
---
Complaining about having to use a blocking feature in-game but relying on a blocking feature in reddit: Priceless!
---
Enjoy the parade! It's good fun and the masks are great. I'm a 48 yo whipper snapper😂😂
---
Thanks for the offer mate but you should sell them. I lost them for my x01 so im back in my excavator now. 
---
Could have been! I was just referring to the character.
---
Yea I knew about 
---
Wood armor has a single mod which you find during the main questline. The mod can be applied to any wood armor piece and improves stealth a lot.
---
Anyone know if we can earn this mask in the parade?
---
Fly me closer, I want to hit it with my sword.
---
I liked how destiny did this.
---
I still play borderlands 2! Awesome!
---
"Pulls scrap metal out of leg"
---
LET'S PARTY PEOPLE
---
Much immersion.
---
Might be a recipie, its a donut one in there also for the event.
---
Some friends and I have been having random items drop from our inventory without even entering the pip-boy. If you catch it fast enough you can double back and look for a bag.
---
Currently I risk it big on containers in the world. Joining on people who could log off at any moment
---
Very cool! I'll be sure to drop some gifts off if I ever encounter this in my travels.
---
That just semantix. It could very well be referencing ER in the code.
---
Nothing special, just expressing a feel of "cool, funny, strange" 
---
It's to put animal intestines in during the event, but mabey we will one day :)
---
It does happen quite often, in my experience.
---
I’m disappointed and sorry to say but he’s right. This quest is a joke. I mean cmon... I love playing the game, I love exploring, I love trading and I won’t stop playing anytime soon but this... this is some low effort shit right here. And you can downvote him or me to oblivion but if you do, please explain why you think this is a good quest and why you think it was worth the wait.
---
It is but when you’ve been grinding for hours to get stuff that you then have to individually scrap so you don’t end up scrapping your bulk. Its easily done if you forget to move from the inventory tab to junk. 
---
I run a Lever Action and 10mm side arm with revolutionary sword. It’s pretty good. 
---
Oh god please don't make that a thing.
---
I use a Furious Explosive and a TSE seems to do the trick 👌 but ya deff have to keep up with that ammo. 
---
I almost built there but Greg's stupid shop wouldn't let me get code enough to build in the spot I wanted
---
And with the start of this Event, I can't login any more :/
---
Played for hours today and boom, game crashed and have to wait for an answer of the support team :/
---
I’m pretty sure I’ve counted 12 different ones so far between 4 of us 
---
Lvl 113, just completed this today. I have only been lucky to find them exiting the White springs station heading due west into that first set of buildings. Scour those buildings over and over looking for mobs under level 10
---
Nothing special, just expressing a feel of "cool, funny,.." 
---
I started that and was Midway when the servers disconnected.  Lost my mind.
---
Yes! But I think this is how our future fridge looks like 
---
I would keep that mask, out of all the rewards people been talking about so far, you the only one i seen that has it
---
There was a Watoga quest and an Overseer quest that could enter conditions where they could not be completed without server hopping or awaiting server resets.  That has nothing to do with me.
---
Saw a rifle gaming vid where after nuking, it spawned mega mutants outside and glowing goulville inside at a Whitesprings scale
---
You know you don’t have to spend your time playing a game that you don’t like right..?
---
This is the best comment, no matter what comes after this
---
Honestly, patience. It friggin sucks. I recommend just doing a lap of the place whenever you're there, it's really not a priority of a quest. They basically just spawn there pretty much randomly sometimes, and the presence of high lvl players or a recent nuke tends to spawn higher lvl enemies instead of the lvl 9 unruly golfers you're hunting for.
---
If it's really taking too long, try checking the bottom floor of the club building, sometimes there'll be a couple hiding down there that the other players have missed in their farming efforts. Also check the buildings along the row of housing. If you find a nice empty WS with nobody around on the server, you should be able to smash through the Quest in one lap, but if anyone else snags those kills first it'll be on your list for a long while.
---
Says who, you? You get to determine what's "Fallout"? 
---
What do you call "Wang Dang Atomic Doodle", or whatever that quest was? A well thought out and clever joke, or literally a half-hour sex joke that paid some good caps.
---
You're taking issue with optional cosmetic upgrades because you're too cool for them. There are plenty of things in the base game to suit your generic view of the apocalypse. I agree, more spiky bits and bloodied bodies on pikes should be available, along with classics like Cage Armour and the Welding Mask. But why should that get rid of my Inspector costume and Mothman Statue? For every dark, brooding player in the past games, there was one running around naked/in a dress and shooting junk at mutants or beating up old lady raiders.
---
Yeah and sorry for acting like a jerk in my post. I got angry
---
I am not going to stop playing too but I really really hope they will improve upcoming quests
---
Mows down the ghouls at whitesprings and they run right into it haha. Best part is I don’t even need to use a bullet (I’m a ranged build)
---
Thank you for the wonderful idea.
---
The kitchen in whitesprings vendor hall always has alot 
---
See his comment above.
---
Agreed!
---
Yes as this last guest stated, it must be the really low level ones.
---
I have a really low level character I can try to help you with. Xbox
---
I think it's to reduce lag, enemies have a timer or something then they die on their own? Mabey, just a theory.
---
Any if the knives with Furious, or Instigating usually pull their weight in sticky spots.
---
It’s not a quest. It’s an event. It’s got about as much substance as all the other events. Yes, we all want the bigger content drops. But this was all outlined in the roadmap. There should be no surprises with this.
---
what paint you want?
---
ive got the initiate one
---
FT. Defiance
---
You know that I like the game but not the direction it is going?
---
So todays report so far - lots of grognak axes of all varieties! Also a bloodied .50cal machine gun but sadly it was only a level 35 dtrop but still..its a worthy gun if i get it primed up..ive decided that two shot explosive guns are a liability, dont get me wrong, i still want one but hey ho!
---
Furious knife was pretty good today but my number one priority os now finding the x01 jet pack mod..approaching 100 hrs and nothing from MODUS yet :) 
---
My melee build is looking sweet but then again when i read some of the numbers been generated by other builds with sentinel armour..it puts it into perspective..
---
Is it me or are legendary deathskull radscorpions as rare as trump telling the truth? :) 
---
Today has been a respawn day of yao guai and radscorpions at whitesprings, chucked in with a few tasty level 91 deathclaws..trouble is, the loot they drop is poor. 
---
Looks more like a Skin for a Stash Box, like the ones in the Atom Shop
---
AMEN! What a brilliantly designed mission!! I laughed through every painful minute 
---
Being able to rejoin the same server as your alt character IS the BIGGEST glitch in the game.
---
Lol how are they two separate requests? You're not making any sense. If I don't want to PVP obviously I don't want to be griefed. You're proving my point why Pacifist and Slap Damage is broken. If I don't want to PVP and clearly I do not with both active there should be no reason those should be exploited for a loot kill. However if are on a PVP server or take over Workshop and complain about being griefed then you are just dumb. 
---
Are you thinking of the Gauss Rifle?
---
If you make a pump at your camp, you can take a drink from it (to start the stream) and then spam the stream to get the dirty water. Much faster than pumping it each time for one water. 
---
Well, without being too spoiler-y I'll just say that it's a very good simulation of a quaint little small town celebration. There's music and games and tasks to do. There's guides who'll tell you about the history. And then when the preparations are complete the parade begins. And the revelries will, uh, draw the attention of the folks from the neighboring communities and the local wildlife might get a bit agitated but in the end it's fun for all ages from 3 to 300 and at the end everyone gets a free mask to take home. (I got an owl, yay!)
---
I picture our characters everytime we log off doing the Weecl-It Ralph thing but everything we do in game hits them like it would a real person....
---
This morning my guy got to eat an entire stack of 150 spoiled meat and 200 bottles of vodka... topped by nukagrape and a single cranberry. 
---
Which is exactly what happens if you quit halfway through when dealing with the DMV in real life.
---
What about this is a surprise though? We knew this was just an event. All the events are pretty small.
---
I agree, I want the bigger content to drop too. But this was all on the roadmap exactly like this. 
---
have to agree, i am a bit disappointed with bethesda too
---
Please tell me the stupid fucking robots there die in the blast
---
They reduced the condition damage but not nearly enough. They still break way too dast
---
Ya actually, surprised we haven't seen a data-mine of them all by now 🤔
---
Hi on ps4 crashes
---
check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
My issue with PvP is the "Time to Kill". 
---
I would probably participate and enjoy PvP dueling if it was some prolonged fight where I had to spend some ammo, drugs and aid, had to take some hits, had to use cover, had a chance for some of my builds procs to happen.
---
By instead it's either a single critical hit or a single melee swing and it's done. It's boring, there's nothing great about that PvP. If I play competitive PvP (and I do in Overwatch), I want footsie battles.
---
Compiling information here :) [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2zu7a/event_parade_details_post_them_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) 
---
I know what you mean by slow.  I tried playing FPS with my boys and they could headshot me by the time I could visually locate them and begin to aim.   And I am otherwise very dexterous.  
---
Oh, i appreciate it. 
---
Players can't destroy in game objects but they can destroy another player's camp objects.
---
Do you think camp destruction would decrease if players had to allocate perk points towards camp damage?
---
"For PVP, DR/ER don't matter"
---
ARE YOU SERIOUS???
---
If that's true, it's exceptionally stupid/piss poor game design - WTAF?!??
---
Thanks you very much! Loved your camp with the overpass!
---
I figured it was my breath doing them in
---
Blow off the head you can loot body parts after they come off
---
I can help u transfer. If u help me in mine when i need it.
---
The OP's body only includes the raw data, but I've found the person.
---
Nuka cola plant has several. One on the assembly line, one in the tasting center with the booths, one in a locked cage, and so on 
---
Yeah, I feel itd be more acurate to look towards the fridges in town. Some act like they have inventories.
---
Does it look like I care about spoilers when I make a post asking for literally any specific details people have been able to glean?
---
Well yes but that's not what this post's about. People want the devs to rewrite code so they can mindless spam the sell/scrap button without watching what they're doing. Entirely different issue from what you're on about. Totally agree with your point by the way.
---
The Red Rocket Mega Stop! Several Nuka Cola machines there, I usually collect three or four quantums every time I run through the place. 
---
      If you mean the PS4 itself is crashing then the way I had to resolve this was completely uninstalling and reinstalling the game, but that was back during beta.
---
     If it is the game that is crashing, try resetting your router. I was so angry one time because I had tried for an hour to get on and the game kept crashing every time I tried to play.   When I finally though to try another game to see if that would connect to the server I got a system message about an unstable network connection. After I reset the router FO worked just fine. 
---
I actually less concerned about Bethesda patching away server hopping as an exploit to gather caps or junk, since they seemed to work on patching that before addressing bigger threats to the game economy. If people want to server hop to gather some extra lead or to find a plan, I don't see that as having been such a problem.  I primarily object to any condition where hopping may be the only way such as with a broken quest. Maybe what I would have done with plans is instead of opening all plans all the time, was to just make them less rare, or have plan rarity based on charisma or bartering perk cards.
---
Geforce experience is setting me to ultra across the board as well. Which totally works fine right until the scorchbeast queen. It is like all the TSE effects just grind me to a halt.
---
Pray to RNGesus, betrothed your first born to the Dark Lord, sacrifice a lesser animal to Kali, and cross your fingers. That's what did it for me. Easily level 100 before this finished for me.
---
Exactly. They already have fridge models, why use a cooler box?
---
In-game vending will make your camp visible on the map as a fast travel destination, according to data mining of the vending machines. 
---
Players can allocate perk points to increase damage.... but for players like me who dont want the PvP experience, but still want to trade I dont want to set my camp as a target
---
So wholesome &lt;3 
---
What poses do we get? Would it be ones we don’t have already or is it random?  
---
But how would you make it into armor? Cut it?
---
WHO THE HELL KNOWS HOW TO CUT?
---
I bluescreen every time I try to log, I can consider it a ps4 crashing? Thank you for your reply
---
Fast travel to Welch station. From there go to the overseer's house. Behind it on the hill should be 3 blight. Travel about 1 to 200 yards west of there (head towards the big tree) there is should be another 3 or 4 bunches there. You are looking for a golden mushroom.
---
I don't think I am competent to judge if an engine is good for multiplayer or not. I'm not a developer. And by the way you talk, I assume you aren't either. So why don't we let them do their job, since they are the ones who *know* how to do it?
---
Talk to the master of ceremony. 
---
It's hourly, it's pretty easy cause it's in the forest but it's cute and you get a limited time to get mask and a plan if you finish the event well. :)
---
They’re adding weapon racks. They said on Inside the Vault.
---
I appreciate that it's a nice simple event with cosmetic rewards. We will have to see if the design holds for the future, but it seems that they implement new quests and events without making them grindy as hell. With the brewer quest I was expecting a runaround and hoop jumping for the daily recipie quest, but you just get the recipe the second you talk to him. As a bonus you can make the beer and give it to Biv for XP, items, and caps, but you don't have to.
---
This goes against all existing multiplayer design. To keep players playing you make them grind for an arbitrary amount of time for miniscule rewards. Fallout 76 doesn't do this, and so far with the updates they have completely avoided it. 
---
It will be interesting to see if this works out for them because I like not having to grind standing, special currencies, and whatever else so I have a .01% chance of getting a sword that lets me do .001% extra damage. I don't feel like I'm missing out when I'm not playing Fallout 76 so I can play at my own pace.
---
If it is the effigy, check under the campfire section.
---
All armor has both ballistic DR and energy DR, why wouldn't it affect both?
---
But would that mean I can place them in my camp and put guns on them
---
I got so mad when I discovered you can’t kill those robots 
---
I did some coding back in a day (mods and shitty games). 
---
And discussion is not who knows better. It should be why doesnt it work well?
---
Not sure, I am at 8/10 with a level 30 character.
---
I enter at the NE part of the course and find/trigger a mob on the course. Did that a couple dozen times to get to 8.
---
i ll buy it for caps or trade for it if interested PM
---
I do now! As I said, I was pretty wrecked at the time.
---
You might want to submit a support ticket. My bloodied things are working same as always.
---
Awesome, I love running into you higher level gamers in the world.
---
Out of curiosity what was fallout 1 like from the boomer perspective? I am a gen X dude that barely caught the tail end of the cold war so I am curious.
---
Yes. Exactly the way they work in Fallout: 4 to my belief.
---
It's funny - IRL can be stressful at times so what do we do to unwind and relax? Head to Appalachia (or The Commonwealth) for a dose of murder, mayhem, horror and heartbreak!
---
Okay this Is just a rough early conclusion draft, but heres a idea how rare the masks are so far based on replies in the thread
---
Witch Mask x12
---
Owl Mask x6
---
Giant Mask x4
---
Beret Mask x3
---
Soldier Mask x2
---
Toothy Man Mask x1
---
Merman Mask x1
---
Why should the OP have to pack up and leave?  A high level clearing an area that is level-appropriate to me annoys me when I’m trying to focus on the game.  Sure, he thinks he’s helping, but some would go so far as say the high-level player is actually griefing because of his interference.  
---
In cases like this, I typically move to another area of the map, but unless I’m disconnected, I don’t change servers.  I have other tasks I can spend my game time on, and other level-appropriate areas.
---
Didnt even think of that. Bring on the paints! 
---
No I won’t take it sound tho man
---
I just did this quest for the first time last night. Man was it frustrating. I didn't find it funny until today when I was thinking back to it lol. 
---
Fair point, it’s an event not a quest. My expectations should’ve been a bit lower maybe. But I still think this is far away from being good content.
---
"Whaddaya buyin'?"
---
He just says that I should come later...
---
Equip bloody mess to dismember the boss or use explosive stuff, you can loot the body parts no issues!
---
I bought the pyjamas last week
---
Do you have the plague walker mutation?
---
So found this through r/gaming ...
---
Wow, you know it's possible to share your opinion without being a total douche about It? I bet people would listen to you more if you actually provided constructive feedback instead of sarcasm. 
---
Thanks everyone for the info. I guess apparently I was getting extra damage from the last patch which is why I hit 700. Appreciate y’all!
---
You’re very welcome, have a lovely and wholesome evening/whatever time it may be in your current region/place of residence you beautiful human being ❤️❤️❤️
---
Yeah still at it. Been mining since 1980. It's as safe as you make it 
---
It isn't that the overseer's journey can't be completed yet, is is a specific sub quest related to Evan that cannot be completed in some cases. Someone mentioned that the same thing can occur with a Watoga quest.  I was primarily referring to those, and the information that the TNT dome key 7 series of actions seems to get caught in a similar state. If server hopping does not adversely impact server stability, then that's my mistake.  I thought that Bethesda was trying to reduce server hopping for that reason.  Cheers.
---
Did they revert the change? 
---
I didnt know there was a boss lol. To many people were there 
---
As has been pointed out several times in this thread alone, some people don’t want your goodies.
---
Two ranks fireproof and a dense torso makes you immune to explosions. Competitive PvP players run it for that reason making the explosive affix less than optimal in some cases. 
---
 I can't join from over an hour and my buds too
---
Baseball bat. 
---
Hear me out. 
---
Weighs like 3 pounds. Cheap to make
---
Cheap to repair. Get a decent about of adhesive and you can  craft/scrap a few dozen and get every mod real easy. Heated rocket bat. Extra burning damage. Chance to cripple. Carry three of them and still weigh less than a super sledge.
---
Also, pool cues and pitchforks get no love but they should. Pool cue with sharp mod weighs .6. Decent damage plus bleed. Not bad. 
---
Need a video of the Alpine Horn. Would love to see and hear it before I buy. 
---
It's on an hourly timer, you'll have to be patient and wait around for it to trigger on its own
---
Lol noob sucks to be you!
---
I don't know going around town then killing the boss monster and lighting the fire was interesting, its really fun seeing the whole server at the event though other then queen raid in an event you know you won't die lol. Waits for someone to nuke the event.
---
Second the low character. I did the entire quest my first time to WhiteSpring as maybe a level 20 or 25. I've only ever seen them 1 other time since then. I figured they were for someone's quest and made sure not to kill them. 
---
Sadly the same... I think I will lose first day of fascnacth I hope they fix this soon
---
No. Because there is a perk card that increases damage to camps.
---
be prepared for super mutant suiciders
---
It's really great hearing from people all over the community sharing the experiences, and it's really opened my eyes to the different kinds of people that play the game
---
I woke up this morning to find only 12 hours to go! I really do enjoy the Fallout series, so I’m thinking I’ll enjoy it!
---
Like I said. It does not always proc. You will get an event message on your top left when one is starting
---
Oh shoot, thanks for the heads up, they've been a pretty rare sight for me so far in 76
---
theres a legendary spawn at the end. lv35 sloth
---
For what it is, I’ll take it. The game is at an unfortunate place where all the hardcore players have done everything. But all the more casual players still have a ton to do.
---
They are on the same pace as their other games for large dlc releases so I’m not too frustrated yet. 
---
The camp McClintock quest was one of the earliest quests I did and I remember when I got the military ID wondering "wtf is this for?" Then after getting to fort defiance I was stuck for 20mins wondering what to do till I looked it up. One of the biggest OHHHHHH moments of my life.
---
Yeah I think the initiate is the only paint in the game right now
---
But could you get me the initiate paint? I’ve done the quest to do it about 8 times and I haven’t gotten it once. I can meet up at my camp in about 90 minutes because I have a power armor station there
---
Two different weapon mods add the extra two stars. Scorched receiver adds a star
---
Somewhere I got a mask a few months ago. I have no idea where I got it. It's a mask with a long nose on it.
---
Just server hop , I did four back to back just server hopping 
---
They've already mentioned re-working Pacifist after they roll out Survival servers, so probably don't worry too much 👍
---
How do you start it?
---
I was able to play the first event then I log off and I can't join anymore
---
Oh haha
---
Shweeeet, thanks
---
I know squirrel bits give you +1 luck aswell as wolf meet gives you either +2 or +3. Pretty sure scrochbeast liver gives you +3 luck. 
---
Stacking food with a type of alcohol will get you the required luck buff. Definitely not as convenient as chems but killing a couple scorchbeasts should give you the desired body part to cook. 
---
47 years old probably makes me an old coot playing this game 
---
At least you won’t hear the “sup brah” from me 
---
Gauley? If so, there isn't much there. I recall 2 locations in the entire mine.  I suggest going in with a new alt character that hasn't discovered it before. The "tool tips/what is this" mechanics will point it out. Hard part is remembering those 2 locations.
---
Seems you may have a minor learning or reading disability?
---
I clearly informed the poster of why/how he was getting his teeth kicked in. 2 people, 4, 10 or the whole server with me.... the turnout will be the same for the OP regardless no matter how you want to dice it.
---
As for the irony there’s no argument there. 90% of my time I play as myself, a person that likes helping people and do it on the daily when logged on. I build bases or accessorize bases for free, give out paint jobs, weapons, aid, junk, ammo you name it.  I enjoy passing out items to others or just helping assist with any nonsense someone might be up to. 
---
Sorry if that makes your brain hurt that when I’m not doing all that I might be crushing people to death.
---
People

One
---
Thing
---
Oh. You've interpreted my comment as sarcastic.  
---
Oh ok :( I guess I just missed it. That sucks 
---
People would just swap it on and off when they wanna pick a fight, so no, it really wouldn't decrease
---
Lol yeah that seems like the assessment I would make as well.
---
I have no idea how to get them to spawn. All I know is that I’m level 106 and killed three of them last night. Only six more to go...
---
No sure, wasn't going to try, but my guess is no, else people would be trolling events. time will tell.
---
Just stick around on the same server :)
---
I got a mask called the Giant mask that looks a bit like a super mutant. Also, you can get decor plans like balloons and streamers. 
---
The first one existed as a bug. When completing the event everybody on the server got 5 cans of stew. We all assumed this was intentional because the event is called Feed The People, but it was a bug.
---
Second one has existed since launch.
---
I just waited for it to turn into a meat pile. Looted it then 
---
So you play with English language setted on your console?  One of my friends say to me just now that changing the language of console to English let you access. I will try tomorrow morning if they haven't fixed yet
---
I liked that I had a corpse  drop back down into the same spot after about 10 seconds, made quite a thud.  That’s the only way I knew it was there.  It was my first legendary protectron.
---
I just wrote that I do respect yours and everyone else's opinions and preferences. I'm not sure how that is unclear. That does not mean that I agree, nor do I expect others to agree with mine.
---
The entire point of my post is that I don't think the developers ever intended for players to have to use server hopping as a workaround to solve problems. So, in that regard I believe that I am willing to play the game as it was intended, since I want to stay in game and on server.
---
I haven't done one of the quests that has been discussed here, but there are at least three, and I have had problems with more than one, which is why I wanted to bring attention to it. I'm clearly not the only person that has had problems in this regard.
---
Your personal attacks are unwarranted and uncivil.
---
I have 2 PA in inventory. For me the last one i used is always first on the list. 
---
Flamer is just a mod you find in the world. 
---
Awesome! Hope I have the honor of seeing this someday!
---
You need the flaming mod. It used to be at vendors but hasn’t been there in a while. You’d need to find someone who has one left but there have been a few people searching for them. 
---
I like the way you incorporated the bridge into your build! Wouldn’t mind checking it out sometime are you on XB1?
---
Its not school bus. Its safety yellow like a bulldozer or other mining equipment
---
Aww I would have loved that! Maybe I’ll take some inspiration from you and be the PSN care package giver 😜
---
That's super lame.  Thanks for the heads up.  Looks like the search is on then.
---
Ahahah it works
---
The sacrificial blade mod adds a star to a machete. 
---
Seconded... I put the marker just past the location so that its still accurate on the compass.
---
The English language setting? 
---
Nope! In any case the mole miners died quite a distance- I was about to snipe them through a scope! 
---
Anytime
---
Oh that’s great! Hopefully I find a good crew to play with 😊
---
I enjoyed it too! 
---
Oh thank God, there's someone here older than me. 😂 Being 55 isn't easy either but I love this game. 
---
Perhaps- except for the protectron isn’t tagged as hostile and also I was in the middle of talking to it! Weird 
---
It may drop in the next little while. Seems like they add sale items late in the day, around 7 or 8 e.t., maybe check back then?
---
Haha awesome! Make sure you have something to play while you wait! 😂
---
There are ways to grief a player without engaging in PvP.  Why is that so hard for people to understand?
---
There is one at the Freak Show by the baseball/Honeybeast exhibit.
---
Am I the only person in the world that understands what I need and how to get it when it comes to liscencing?
---
I understand the hyperbole of this quest but realistic is not the word I would use. 
---
Lol really went to r/gaming to cry 
---
I also never asked for things to be handed to me. I simply want quests to work properly.  What I am asking for is no different than any quest where an NPC is missing, where a key or combination doesn't work, or any other condition where players in previous Bethesda games might have had to reload a save game or use a console code to move forward. It is my understanding that the quest scripting in Bethesda games can be tricky and have a tendency to get stuck, and I think that is just made more complicated by this being a multi-player game.
---
Wow😂
---
Yes just tried and I'm online 
---
Hahaha can I wander with you?
---
Please stop Nuking the Event
---
Sloth didn't spawn when i did the event a few hours ago
---
I got a syringer just yesterday...
---
It is a very good news. I know that tomorrow morning I can start the event. Good luck. See you in Appalachia 
---
I have the same problem, ive tried everything so far and nothing worked.
---
Guess well have to wait for a patch.
---
I will! See ya soon! (And by soon I mean in at least another 11 hours lol)
---
Personal attacks are a policy violation, and unnecessary.  It is fine to just say that you disagree.
---
Yes, I did have to server hop in order to complete the Overseer Evan quest. This is a known issue.
---
That have to wait til tomorrow sadly. It's 23:30 pm here.
---
I hoped I could play the event once quick before going to bed.
---
So you made the event fail for everyone, and then posted a self-congratulatory post? You must be fun. 
---
Oven traps?! I have not heard of this. But also, that scenario sounds like a lot of fun 😂
---
Done it three times this evening, first two were super crowded and I didn't really get a chance to help at the start. Third time was less crowded and helped a bit. Will try and spoiler tag this but apologies if it doesn't work. 
---
&gt;! 5 robots, all need different "fetch" tasks doing for them to allow them to join the parade.
---
Collect radtoad eggs for the Baker (they are in the creek)
---
Collect beer steins (around town)
---
Collect intestines for the butcher (from the squirrels)
---
Collect wood for the bonfire (bonfire is outside the church)
---
Play music with the robot (on the stage next to the creek)
---
I'm not sure if the parade will start without them all, and if the tasks are different each time.
---
Then you have to escorts the robots around the town. Down the High Street, across the little wooden bridge, around the building and ending back near the church.
---
Swarms of radtoad, super mutants and then the mega sloth, wolves and sting wings.
---
One of the robots often gets left behind on the bridge, so have a tail end Charlie as a super mutant suicider spawns on the far side.!&lt;
---
Obviously it's an escort and protect mission at the end. It shouldn't need to be said but do not use explosive/area weapons or grenades.
---
We had somebody lobbing molotovs and took out three of the robots.
---
Also don't shoot the suiciders bomb and blow it up for the same reason.
---
I actually like the safety yellow better after staring at the new skin for a while. The dark blue and purple resemble ultracite PA too much. I’ll wait for the all black version 😁
---
Sadly no we were all in it. We wanted to see what would happen 
---
Against 90% of players explosive is better. Against the 10% that know how to PvP fire rate is better. Fireproof 2 and a dense torso literally immunizes your character to explosions. It doesn't matter what rank of demo expert they have because x% of 0 is still 0.
---
Please let low levels hit the legendary sloth before all you high levels blow it up. I am level 22 getting level 35-40ish legendaries and it’s going to help a ton leveling up. 
---
We did the same in Cranberry Bog... we killed it and it froze in the attack stance and all that happened was the spinning waiting Deal for the loot and nothing would happen. 
---
It then blinked out of existence...
---
It's __usually__ the case, but not always.
---
Also think it's random when you join a server?
---
Yes that’s what I did overnight! It’s now down to 11 hours!
---
Thank you. I think there are simple solutions to these problems and I hope that Bethesda is listening to constructive solutions.
---
Yeah you can also end up ruining it. Others have reported it will break the spawns for small creatures that drop intestines and other stuff
---
Hi, I'm interested in an instigating handmade and a two shot handmade. Do you have either still? Both?
---
Not just you. It’s been happening to me more lately (ps4). I can hear them die as I get there and nothing new respawns so I’m left with a bunch of corpses and no loot.
---
Not sure if it’s related but I’ve also been having issues with fast traveling to an area and having enemies spawn in all at once already attacking me. It is ESPECIALLY bad when doing the nukashine quests because I’ll have 5 ghouls hitting me at the same time before they appear on my screen.
---
I would love to see snow in the top of the world. Maby in nuclear winter?
---
fasnacht!
---
Yea, I had to do twice, was on second to last step first time haha
---
I like the yellow better too. It makes sense with its purpose. 
---
Is it happening right now and never had before?
---
If you're on PC I'll buy that recipe for sure.
---
T-51 - Love the more retro / chunky look, also Nuka Cola paint job.
---
same problem...
---
That makes no sense to me. What's the point of putting star value to an already hard to find enemy if you're not going to get loot of the same value. 
---
Bruh I know and then I called you out for teaming, idk why you wanna act like I’m calling you a terrible person, cause I’m not. All I said is that I feel bad that you don’t think you can do it alone, that was probably going too far and I’m sorry because I don’t like personal attacks.
---
 It doesn’t change the circumstances in which you phrased your response and my subsequent response, you were teaming and I called it weak and that’s that. I’m sure you’re a multi talented individual I just think that aspect of PvPing is weak and I’ll say it every time, just because you can team in this game and it’s part of the mechanics doesn’t mean it’s not a weak and cowardly thing to do. 
---
I didn't think about weight. I could add it in the future, but right now I don't have access to all the weight data. I just got this data from the other guy's spreadsheet, which doesn't have weights.
---
Have you been able to compare them to non-bloodied and TS version? I’ve been playing every day since the patch and haven’t felt anything unusual until I pulled out the TS today and looked at the numbers. 
---
If you get the other quest, the one where you drink and then usually have to perform a task like killing a mob, you tend to get a recipe item instead of just autolearning it.
---
Hahah I saw that post after I bought it! I’m about 15,000 kilometres away from Tennessee! And any Walmart’s too I’m guessing 😜
---
Yeah, but maby with power plants making that powering them up has a bigger impact? Like lights in the streets os buildings with electricity.
---
You can just server hop lol, ive done 5 this last hour
---
Yep 
---
Yup see u bud
---
Disconnects seem fairly frequent with this. I've D/C'd about 30% of the time during the event. I may just be unlucky (or lucky? how are other people doing?)
---
we all knew someone was gonna do it lol
---
Gorge junk yard work shop has had a few for me
---
Seeking revenge seems to add caps to the pool but I don’t know exactly how much. 
---
What you and I consider "working well" is probably different. I think what you are trying to say is "why doesn't it work the way I want it to work"? And for that, you would have to ask the devs.
---
Happened twice so far at the end of the parade. 
---
T-51. Just for the Nuka Cola paint job.
---
Well I haven’t played yet, so I’m probably not the best person to ask.. but I’m gonna day yes, yes it’s a bug! 😜
---
They’ve been glitched since the beginning unfortunately. It’s a shame because they look really cool for the 10 seconds they actually work.
---
meanwhile one month later...
---
Hmm, I too have done it twice and had nothing but stellar performance. Both events had 10+ people.
---
I haven't thought to take my TSE out of stash, no. However I know off hand that its never hit over 600 for me and my bloodied stuff is still over that. 
---
Most likely your internet lmao, ive done the event 7 times and have had 0 issue
---
Haha alright =).
---
A quick check of Reddit would have answered this question for you. There are plenty of complaints on here a out just this thing. 
---
Yes. Seems that there's a problem with EU servers right now.
---
This bug is common. 
---
MAYBE I WILL
---
I only just managed to get a shot off to at least get some XP was about 12 people doing the event. 
---
It’s working so far. There is no problem with our version 
---
Thanks for the tips! And now I feel like eating soup, dangit
---
Lol dang coming in hot, sounds like somebody needs a little parade to lighten their mood 
---
 Are you in need of a deathclaw doner kebab?  😂
---
Same. Dropped once but got 6 done.
---
At least you're honest. 
---
Best part was when they call "Ticket Number C123(blah blah)" and a feral ghoul with that number for a name shambles around the corner. Like he's been waiting in line so long he got nuked and irradiated into a zombie and he's still waiting 😂
---
I have fiber optic internet, definitely not me. The experience is similar to when you’re doing the queen event with a dozen people, nothing loads, spinning arrows on every corpse, event doesn’t complete for 10-20 mins after it actually ended.
---
Please save your useless speculative comment, it’s non-constructive.
---
Yeah only time I made it to the end, DC. smh
---
I had more than 1600 without using any real money.
---
That's a good thing to know - I wonder if it'll work out that way for me.  Thanks for the tip!
---
If you’re on PS4 and ever need a team, me and my boy are always happy to help! My PSN is radiationdaddy
---
Google tells me this is a doughnut! And now I’m hungry! Thanks!
---
Yeah it doesn’t seem to happen to the server hoppers showing up in the middle or end, just to the people who were there before the masses.
---
Would you be able to confirm how many blueprints there are?
---
So far I've seen:
---
- Witch mask
---
- Owl mask
---
- Soldier mask
---
- Toothy mask
---
- Giant mask
---
- Fasnacht beret
---
The robots are wearing, but I haven't gotten as a reward yet:
---
- Harlequin mask
---
- Scull mask (with a wizard hat or something
---
- Happy sun mask
---
- Tentacle hair mask (Weird)
---
I also haven't talked to anyone who has the Old man winter mask.
---
Yeah, maybe i posted this too soon. Need more testing.
---
Oh nice!! I'll be mindful of that when I see legendary wood armors from here on! I had been selling them for 5 to 10 caps when I'd see them figuring they were only useful as low level armor. Thank you for the knowledge!!
---
Bumblebee needs a bath.
---
I'm an immigrant. It took me 10 MONTHS to get my US driving license, and every wait was 3 hours long MINIMUM. Once i had to queue 3 hours, see the person and then queue another 3 hours to see a second person on the same day. 
---
This happened to me in Fallout 4 lol it could be a carry over glitch to 76..
---
I added a answer to this in general section above.
---
Just walk in Helvetia, it will say, join the fun and talk to the master of ceremony
---
Knight is also in the game. Was added during patch 7. I have it on PC.
---
I joined the event after someone nuked it, we still completed it, spawned a 3\* legendary megasloth during the event, it was laggy though, everyone's going for the masks, this is really co-op though, which is better than pvp in my opinion.
---
It's not too hard to get. Bring lots of springs iirc.
---
What platform are you on?
---
A prior redditor post stated AA on nrg isn't working because armor is only referencing ballistic armor.
---
Your test above it what I wanted. I've never seen anyone actually test it. Just say it.
---
Platform?
---
If you’re unable to loot the sloth you can wait for him to turn into a meat pile if you really want your legendary. 
---
As a Brit; our system seems annoying..... Fallout put into perspective the American TV/Movie horror that is the DMV.  
---
Granted, i'm not sure the real world version has you attacked by radiation zombies.. but I can now appreciate American media a lot more. \^\_\^  
---
On PC. I've noticed mass monster suicide when I zone in from fast travel. It seems to be happening more the higher I level.  I've been suddenly murdered to death by huge mob insta-spawns before, as well as being slowly murdered by not-yet-visible mobs.  Makes for a challenge, for sure. 
---
Ok, you lost me. Are we agreeing or are you just not proof reading your comments?
---
see it worked
---
[https://imgur.com/a/G3dO7Dk](https://imgur.com/a/G3dO7Dk)
---
no problems, I don't understand why people are down voting but I'm just showing it worked for me
---
“I’m surprised anyone plays that game anymore”
---
Jesus Christ do they not teach grammar and punctuation in schools anymore?
---
While reading that, I was hearing the words in an out of breath, whiny little kids voice.
---
That stinks you got killed and lost your stuff, but that's part of the game. It's only scrap, super easy to replace. Just pick stuff up as you do quests and you'll get enough.
---
General rule I always follow, especially in CAMP and workshops...first thing I do is scrap all junk then throw it in my stash. Takes all of 2 seconds and saves you much headache.
---
It's a shame it's way too easy
---
Pc, Xbox PS4?
---
Unfortunately there’s nothing to fix, that’s how they designed it, stupidly enough.
---
Although I do remember Mr. Todd explicitly stating that if you were murdered by someone (not flagging back for PvP and they kill you) that you wouldn’t drop your stuff, but most of what that asshat said has turned out to be bs anyway.
---
Oh my fucking god it was awful
---
thats odd. i can see you wearing it from here. looks good on you too.
---
That’s unfortunate, but what year did this happen?
---
Hey brother. I’m right behind you at 63. Love the fallout series and played them all. Enjoying this but I’m mostly solo. Only part I hate is hlvl players killing me lvl 38 to steal my caps. Like you I am quick to shoot at sudden appearances and have accidentally shot another player. Wish they had a emoticon for Opps Sorry 
---
Imagine. Thinking you can just get a game and make your own decision on if it's fun. The absolute *nerve* of you. 
---
Good for you. Doesn't change the heinous price to effort ratio on these skins.
---
Is this build still viable ?
---
Irrelevant. I was replying to how you made it sound like people were actively working together when in reality it's an event that one person can do by just clicking E.
---
In terms of the base content vs new content. I don't think we should accept new content not requiring challenge just because the base game was just as medicore and didn't require challenge either. I'd rather the game evolve and become better and better. 
---
No, whenever you die, pvp or pve you drop whatever junk you have on you at that time. If you start getting attacked or before you go to a dangerous area it's a good idea to store your junk so you don't lose it. Can be annoying but it is avoidable for the most part.
---
That’s feckin hilarious! They were so surprised when you broke shit. Especially the piano. 
---
I want to ride around in a vertibot and rain hell down from above.
---
nice, I had no idea. Thanks for sharing
---
This is an old glitch from FO4. A workaround is to wire it to a switch and toggle the switch, this will make it work properly until you fast travel away or log out. 
---
I was hoping that this was mostly about different Legendary perk effects... 
---
Ok i keep that in mind for tomorrow :D thank you
---
tl;dr
---
2k each mod
---
Just check vendors I think Grahm always has them. Also 100 caps is lowballing
---
At least other players can't steal your FC from your generator...Imagine the trolling/griefing there'd be if it was possible?
---
You not succeeding at every quest **is them working properly**. Server hopping is an exploit, not the intended game mechanic.
---
Wow :O
---
I do indeed! Just seems like nobody commenting is willing to say anything remotely specific
---
Found a way more detailed post by someone else with pretty much everything I was looking for so 🤷 least there was something out there
---
Definitely. Even Serums should be up there for the materials and flux needed. I expect to see people under pricing you in here shortly though. By this time next week you'll be begging for 60 caps...
---
PC. I should have specified that.
---
Help same thing but it drank mine and the game crashed, after restarting it's not in the inventory and no longer spawning, I've tried server hopping but not helping
---
That is adorable.
---
I've had this happen a couple of times. It's very annoying
---
No idea that why I’m asking the first day it was perfect only had to fix it one time against the queen now it’s back to like 4 
---
Seems steep, in my opinion, for a few reasons. Anyone can make it,  bloodied melee builds don't really need more damage, and it has that pesky side effect of randomly teleporting you to the other side of the map.
---
But you do you, maybe I'm wrong and it can't hurt to try.
---
Salts back on the menu boys
---
Haha YES
---
I just wish we could go into a menu and wipe the camp clean or remove certain items  
---
All Rise or a good ski sword are my picks.  All Rise is the best when you can afford slow but powerful hits.  The ski sword is awesome when you need fast and strong hits.  I have an aa weightless power attack level 45 ski sword with the metal bits attached and it does 124 at 200% durability with 12 strength l.
---
we actually did it in the first try in an eu server. .
---
The best part about the shrouded mod is the + sneak movement speed with 5 shrouded wood pieces equipped. I can't go back to any other armor after getting used to that, feels like I'm a new born baby crawling on the ground without it.
---
I found that the head flies off and you can collect loot from it and not the body
---
That feels risky :s I expect a lot of burnt down camps when players dont like the price
---
It's really not a big deal. You can probably replace all the scrap you lost in about fifteen minutes just going through Helvetia and Greg's Mine Supply right up the road.
---
Don't let someone murder you next time, you have stimpaks for a reason.
---
The demand will go up once they eventually nerf that too. 
---
Remember when they said the TSE guys were too overpowered and needed balance because they could 1 and 2 shot damn near everything? Yeah... now a guy with a clown mask and pajamas on can 1 hit kill a 80 scorchbeast...
---
I can easily get over 100 dirty water using this method. Put on super duper when you boil water also. 
---
This happen to me. Work around on xb1 was to just rejoin the event via the map. 
---
But it's only for 1 power armour type. The 14-1800 ones work for 4 of them
---
To all my knowledge - it should. But i will log in tomorrow and check it out. As i stopped playing f76 quite a while ago
---
Save your ammo, use knives, 6 in your inventory is more than enough. Good armor, or Power armor to soak up some damage. Lockpick and hacker on max level, turrets can mostly be deactivated, you can bypass the reactor section by short cutting through a locked door nearby. About the only thing you can't short circuit is the launching. Still, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
---
I’m old enough that I went through college using a slide ruler (I’m an engineer). So I started with desktop PCs at work, then being able to buy one at home, then to modems for bulletin boards, then the internet, etc. Believe it or not, playing Pong was a blast when it came out (the little dot acrossing back and forth on the screen as you moved the little paddles to hit it). It was something completely new.
---
As gaming progressed, basically every “new game” would be soo much better than the previous one that they were amazing to play. So the progression of Fallout was great. However, to go back now and play FO1 would be disappointing. In fact, I can only remember FO3 in some detail and the first 2 are a blur.
---
Nowadays, games are coming out faster and there are more of them so trying a new game is not always much better than past ones. For example, FO76 is basically the same game as FO4 with respect to graphics and playing style, but the new content and the slight twists like moving camps vs settlements and no NPCs is making it enjoyable. So I’m more cautious now before I buy a game and check out the internet and Youtube beforehand.
---
I just audibly laughed at this. Thank you.
---
Damn, are you supplying a 2 shot handmade to put that on??
---
Between that and the movie zootopia, we are living in a Golden Age of DMV media representations.
---
Dungeons and Dragons is just dice rolling and paperwork, yet nobody seems to have a problem with that game.
---
I always thought they charge the cores, when you pull one from a generator in the world it just flickers the light and keeps right on going. And the ones you build don’t have cores and work anyways
---
If you fast travel back to the area fast enough, can loot it. Has worked for me twice so far.
---
49'er here and my brother is 57. Fallout has been our favorite franchise for years.
---
Launched!!!!
---
As someone who got the rad ant lager I was really hoping it would work.
---
But confirmed Party Boy works with none of the new alcohols. No +150 carry weight for 2 minutes. Sad day.
---
Thinking the same thing. I know there's been talk of making CAMPS immune to damage if the owner is pacifist. Maybe that'd help
---
Sometimes we block out the bad memories... :P
---
Serious note 10 mins is a slight exaggeration most of the time but I have old footage of times when 10 minute interval disconnects actually happened to me.  If you guys have played since beta you probably still shudder at that de-equipping sound.
---
Pacifist mode turn it on
---
Check your fancy fiber-optic internet. Seriously brush some salt off the table and check this screams connectivity and ping issues.
---
Go on unplug the router do a hard powercycle we all know it's the problem.
---
That's odd that's happening though. I hope they'll fix whatever is causing people's items to disappear.
---
Nuka-Cola, It’s What Plants Crave!
---
the pylon got fixed? HELL YEAH!
---
Me too
---
And a happy screw u tio asshole
---
There's vault dweller corpses all over.
---
IIRC, They're from vault 93.
---
Saw a reply from bethesda on here a couple weeks ago where they are working on extending pacifist mode to your C.A.M.P.
---
Awesome
---
Except he never said that
---
I didn’t notice the difference either until I looked at them side by side today. After my previous reply I restarted my PS4, now all of a sudden the numbers are correct again, at low health the Bloodied is now showing higher numbers than TS, followed by Hunters. Looks like it’s a software issue and can be fixed by restarting. I’ll keep an eye on it 👌
---
I was talking with another player I came across in the wilderness that had a son playing. I remember fonding playing Quake with my teenage son many years ago. Back then, we connected our 2 computers via the printer cable and would hunt each other in the game. Thanks for the offer to assist. I may give you a call when I want to tackle a nuke launch.
---
"Sorry for the face shot!" My new life motto
---
Just server hop at the dome, I didn't have keys and I got in, plans were there!
---
Obviously it’s not a spelling error. The Brotherhood is collecting data on techncials, a rumored wasteland craeture
---
Rad toads should spawn. Check the river and behind the house as well as inside. 
---
LMAOOO 
---
I use sledgehammers and about 100 rounds of 5.56. The rest is the same.
---
To add to that though, make sure to take 30 circuits with you just in case. Take the time to find as many Mainframes as you can. Repair the remainder. After a few runs youll have enough cores to just swap out and move on to launch prep. I think i have 40 something cores in my stash box. 
---
30 minutes is a great first run tho!
---
What about Blocker though?
---
thanks did not know that existed
---
Direct me
---
Let’s make one, I’ll edit my comment here with any new ones I find.
---
&gt; have collected over 30 Technical Data in the meantime.
---
Try collecting Techncial Data instead? Not sure how you could confuse those two!
---
Thats a Pawn Stars lowball hahaha
---
Plans valued at 2200 caps
---
Best i can do is 125 caps 
---
I got the plan for it on my first time but for some reason it doesn't give me a option to craft it even though I've learnt the plan. 😭
---
Check the random spawn in whitespring club house. This changes frequently
---
Are you using or ever used any mods?
---
That fiber optic internet isnt working properly chief
---
It just works. -Todd Howard
---
You know too much...
---
I’ve only completed this one twice. Once with a couple of other guys, which made it fairly easy. 
---
The other time I was by myself and you have to be almost perfect to get enough alone and make it up all those stairs in time. 
---
I’ve failed by myself countless times because I didn’t notice it quick enough and was only left a few minutes to do it.
---
In the secret room where you put the code in the door kept closing a trapping me inside it with no way out.
---
T-51 for physical defence, Ultracite for radiation defence with almost the same physical defence as T-51.
---
Just restarted the PS4 and now the numbers are correct again. Looks like a software issue and can be fixed by restarting 👌
---
Some quests are not perfect, and can get in a state where they can't be completed without changing servers. I agree that hopping is an exploit and is not intended as a workaround for quest problems.
---
One of the scientists was driven insane by the interloper. He then murdered his colleagues. 
---
It gets a little bit better with every update :)

If your on xbox, tap the glowing button, then the hamburger while over the game. Go to offical club, then to multiplayer. Theres always people selling in there. You can even post an offer Looking to Buy.
---
You know what I meant. No other place sounds like that lol. My phone autocorrected 
---
Level too low?
---
Scanning....Scanning.......
---
Do you have the parts?
---
Is your gunsmith card high enough?
---
I always figured Marine and Trapper were the only two options for non-power armor users. But to know that Heavy Robot armor is a contender as well really opens more possibilities. 
---
The guy/girl probably just wanted some quick caps without wondering the wastes for them 
---
I've never seen a legendary syringer. Unless you meant normal syringers drop instead of legendary loot.
---
After that quest I was dead set on launching the nuke for the final mission on that place. Fuck fissure site prime and anything else. That place DESERVED the nuke.
---
WOW sorry ps4
---
playstation
---
I'm pretty sure this is what pacifist mode is for 
---
You can still loot it, it's just that the hitbox is not aligned with the model. Most of the time it is below the visible model.
---
Ive been online for nearly 3 hrs.. have yet to see the event.. the servers seem super buggy today - keep disconnecting before the event even starts.
---
Is this even all day or only 4 hours a day ? 
---
When will vending machines be in game
---
Just seems like a bad attitude to take with someone who takes the time to give you some information. If you only wanted a step by step rundown then don’t ask for “any other advice you can give or things you’ve learned about it” and then get short with those who offer their insight. Just something to think about in the future. 
---
Yeah well, people are running around in full assassin+sentinal/cav gear and rocking weapons with huge amounts of armor piercing. You need some Dr/ER but it's hardly the most important thing.
---
Player damage values are far too high compared to armor mitigation in the game.
---
Haven't seen it yet. Rarest one I've seen so far is the owl
---
It’s not even showing up on the list of possible guns. Gunsmith lvl5
---
Same. And than I end up being just beside it. It's not game breaking or anything like that just a minor inconvenience 
---
There is no plan for the mask. The plans you learned were old man winter effigy, a camp item.
---
It doesn’t work like that.  Did you have pacifist enabled?  
---
The current version requires you to destroy an item on the other player’s camp before you are wanted.
---
Level 105
---
Just replied to your other thread. There is no plan for the mask but there is an old man winter camp plan.
---
You sure it wasnt just the Mask? As far as I know, you dont learn plans of the Masks
---
I have found that if your scrap your junk on a regular basis you don't loose it when killed.  
---
I would also like to point out that you can now report players like the one you encountered.   I dont know what bethsada will do about it.  I hope that they will eventually get banned from the game, as they take the pleasure away from the rest of us.
---
I saw a floating connector rod about an hour ago on the road in helvetia.
---
And a way to lock the fermenter also.....
---
Same here...
---
🙄 thanks tips
---
Which is why my comment began with the qualifier “if”...
---
Has anyone gotten anything cool yet?
---
It's a new bug, only started happening as of last patch
---
If a player is not interested in PVP then it is NOT 'part of the game'!
---
thats awesome
---
Same age! :D
---
Kill that fucker
---
Under machined? Odd 
---
I was literally just saying I don't care about spoilers, so lay the details on me instead
---
Dumbass is on the menu more like it, and you’re the main entree
---
Dropping your loot on death IS part of the game. Griefers gonna grief...no need to water down the already watered-down survival aspects of the game.
---
Junk is easy to come by, I always have too much just from casual play. It's a minor inconvenience at best.
---
According to the internet speed tests showing 300mb/s , it’s working perfectly, servers are just cheap garbage
---
it resets every hour so you can most likely get it done about 2-3 per hour unless you get lucky and get a fresh a server
---
server hopping doesn't work, they run every hour so just hang around after the event, or waste 230-40 minutes and get in the next one
---
Except he did say that
---
See my edit. I heard of that mode but could never find it because it's not available when you load the game you have to load into a server then enable it. Quite baffling to be honest. 
---
Saving this comment for future reference, thanks!
---
My internet is testing at 300mb/s , I’m not the only one having issues either, go waste your lack of networking technology on someone else kid.
---
Says the person who doesn't know how to unplug a router. Damn you're cranky when you don't get a nap. Have momma bring you a juice box she'll make it all better.
---
this has been mentioned and yes, that is some realistic tedium.
---
I'm not really a fan of this one or the all black paint job. I'll hold out for another paint/skin.
---
This has been around since patch 6 or so I believe. 
---
And I luuuwsss it
---
I'm glad I am not the only person who is super slow with the communication. I'm not even half your age yet find myself constantly flashing the wrong signals to other players and generally coming across as confused when they come across me. 
---
Asisde from the Order of Mysteries Quest line, this was my favorite quest of the game. I was dying of laughter.
---
Meanwhile no issues with my shitty 30mb connection lmao you like wasting money. Just unplug the router already pretty soon we'll be calling a waaaabulance if you keep this up
---
Just hang around and wait for the event to restart. That’s all you have to do
---
T-60, the repair cost is insanely cheap
---
Supper? at 3 in the afternoon? What are you, sixt.......oh wait. I see what you did there.  ;)
---
Glad you are having fun!
---
Eyy that a good angle of me :D
---
Thanks! :)  I had only just started on it (it was a few minutes old when you got there). It's looking a bit more finished [now](https://imgur.com/a/G6OSAoG) but I'm still working on it until I'm happy with it.
---
It's all about the legendary mods anyways
---
It’s your custom.ini. Google it, it’s a pretty simple fix, I just don’t remember it right now and am not at my computer. 
---
So server hopping is a yes
---
Do the solo nuke launch. I was level 40ish when I did mine. It’s rewarding to know you did it yourself. For your level, it won’t be that difficult.
---
Jesus, I need a new grandparent. Do you want to sign up? I just want to play Fallout with you. 
---
Must  be you cause the one in my base has a core, it is weird that they still work despite not having a core but “it just works” 
---
End of an era. Id prefer a 3rd server type. 
---
1. Survival,
---
2.adventure (vanilla)
---
3. PVE COOP with no PvP
---
But im a lousy raider. So take my opinion lightly
---
I like the idea of being a 1 tank stop. Though eventually I want to run a bloodied build maybe. Unyielding sentinel but I don't know  if unyielding sentinel would be very tanky...
---
Pretty much I'm looking for a build that is a in your face type build. But not have to run and hide after two swings.
---
Do the masks actually do anything?
---
Check your ini file again and adjust whatever need to be adjusted, this issue occurs when game archives can't be loaded because of edited ini.
---
u need more gunsmith perks
---
I feel like it has an hour cooldown or so. Don’t quote me though. It’s faster to just server hop. 
---
Not necessary there's a wood storage area behind the yellow house by the river. I easily picked up 36 wood there. 
---
I did the quest, got the keys and unlocked the dome door. The only thing not in it was the plans!
---
Think I’m cursed never to get them. 
---
If you want to play a "tank" then you should be able to take at least a couple hits from even highest damage opponents, including PVP
---
much create.  so edge. wow. 
---
X-01. It’s the only one that gets a recon mod for the helmet (as far as I can tell)
---
I knew what quest this was about by the title alone 😂
---
It close by the Sutton train station if you know where that’s at.
---
yeah server hop right after you finish and you will most likely find 2-3 other ones
---
It took me so long to do that DMV stuff that the ghouls respawned twice and the mutants respawned at least once. I once got pushed through a wall by a mob of ghouls, but I think that was at the asylum.
---
I'm on xbox. I have initiate, knight, knight captain, knight sergeant and officer. Wont be on for another hour or so
---
In Helvetia! It starts one hour after the last instance of it began. Which is why we need an event timer lol
---
The mask your true face while you raid settlements around Virginia :)
---
I have 10 masks from server hoping 
---
If your on Xbox, look me up, I'm only 58, but play with several old guys, and we would be happy to help you launch that first Nuke, and deal with any other issues you may have, and we are really good at dealing with griefer's.
---
If you turn on passive mode it will make you tankier.
---
Do they have any effects or just cosmetic cause otherwise why bother?
---
they're trying to reduce server hopping for farming, as to those other quests because I'm not sure but the one for the personal journey is it's own cell at the end, TNT Dome 7 is part of the world
---
The server I was in went haywire and the last two instances (before I packed up for the evening) run pretty much back-to-back.
---
People were goofing around and in good spirits too :)
---
I play solo and don't usually seek the company of others but this event is definitely best enjoyed with a crowd :) :) 
---
Anytime I've used weapon artisan on my bloodied grognaks it has never added any bonus durability, and I always check because I specifically equip it just to repair the grognak 
---
I’ve got the two toothy ones and 1 owl mask so far
---
Just cosmetic
---
Really odd. All you need is the right level at least 25, gunsmith 5 and the correct parts. 
---
Just for shiggles and gits. You did use the plan right?
---
Cell phone. 
---
I'm truly sorry about Barry's toilet and piano. May they live again.
---
Indeed. I do have a cell phone. Lol
---
Helvetia. And once the bots line up for the parade, you’ll see the actual spot
---
Thanks man, deleting the folder now and validating the game. Thanks for not chewing me out like ive found in similar posts about this issue!
---
Use the clock function to set alarms. Until we get an ingame one. 
---
Pacifists mode
---
I’d suggest a server hop, if that doesn’t help you might need to send a support ticket
---
Theyre mostly for players who love to collect all the outfits in game. If you visit Market76 people will trade 20k caps or 3* legendary gear for a rare simple outfit that offers nothing but a new look
---
Sounds awesome dude, I can't wait to get off work!
---
He just beat us to the punch :p
---
Fantastic, looking forward to it! I legit have everything I've wanted to get, even the sniper coat and the Mr Fuzzy costume. So now the masks and the new thing for me to do. 
---
Got the owl as my first reward... Really want the red jester/harlequin one
---
Or Bethesda can continue to have rare items that reward players that invest more into the game.
---
Sick, thanks man!
---
I feel like there should be an autoresponder bot in this sub watching for "falling through" posts.
---
Played it during the BETA and it crashed....every...single...time. Took me DAYS to complete it.
---
Owl, soldier, giant, giant
---
very cool ty
---
Yeah ... I completed it ... all except going back to the Fort ... and a recurring bug cost me all those quests ... had to do it all over again.
---
I bought one from a vendor after the February patch, so they still exist. 
---
The amazing thing  is that somebody decided to nuke Helvetia instead of whitesprings or the prike fissure.
---
Especially with the huge mining aspects it would've fit beautifully 
---
All 3 toothy man
---
This is why outfits are your friend
---
"I have been playing Fallout since version 1" that's so cute. Reminds me of when my younger brother used to call different saves on games different profiles. If you're reading this OP, what did you think about the first few Fallout games and what did you think about the transition from 2D games to 3D games? I'd honestly love to hear about it.
---
I kinda want to get the game now just for this quest... Although living in the UK I've never had to go to the DMV so everything I know about the DMV comes from Zootopia and reddit
---
 What level are you?
---
I loved that part of the quest. I remember the hell I went through at the DMV, and that section of the quest is waaaaay too funny.
---
I wouldn't mind a specialized, craftable fusion generator to serve as a power core consolidator. It would allow you to drain fusion cores to fill others. Then a recipe for a re-usable fusion core casing that can be left in there and slowly charged over time.
---
Received the witch mask and soldier so far, as well as flag pole plan and the burning effigy plan at the end. 
---
That's a smart idea!
---
What kind of plans exactly?
---
Plans for a garland, a bonfire and ballons (like you see around the town)
---
I went to bed when I was almost done with the quest and woke up the next day to finish it and I had to do the  whole thing again
---
LOL! I'm so glad I finished that quest. Usually, I go to the DMV 30 minutes before it opens so I can be in and out in 10 minutes. The game, however, makes it point to stick it to you. I chuckled the whole time and resisted the urge to shotgun the DMV bots.
---
Your version of "better" isn't everyone's version of better, obviously. I think the devs are trying to make the game a certain way and it won't appeal to everyone -- like every game. I agree it's easy as pie in a lot of areas but I also don't play Fallout games for the difficulty /shrug
---
Same actually, I'm cosplaying hotline Miami now lol
---
Awesome, thank you
---
Either to many electronics on your WiFi or somethjng I have trouble playing ( just as described )when it’s full house 
---
I think once you hit lvl 11 you can start buying gunsmith perks. I recommend that you buy it only if you want to focus on guns. My character is pretty much Grognak so I dont really need to focus on anything with guns.
---
Can confirm fasnacht sausage uses intestines and a few other things
---
Quantum sometimes spawns at tables in the whitesprings bunker and Bubbles sells quantum on the upper level of the whitesprings resort, near the bartender protection.
---
they evolVe
---
The real one getting other then old toothy mask 
---
This old post has all the masks supposedly
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aovxuc/helvetia\_faschnacht\_masks\_in\_fallout\_76/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aovxuc/helvetia_faschnacht_masks_in_fallout_76/) 
---
Yep. I had this bug. Went through it four times before I was finally able to finish it 🙄 😂 
---
 Both! :) 
---
Your network is shit... Like your attitude
---
I think this parade event is actually the first real sinker for me as far  as new content in this game goes if I'm being perfectly honest.
---
I think it's an interesting idea, but I really think we're way past the point of it being an event that fits in with the game at this stage.  This event has a big problem with a lack of scaling to such a degree that because a lot of players are now very high level, all it would take is one person with an explosive gatling plasma to trivialize the whole thing and make it a boring, slow trudge through the town with nothing interesting happening.
---
There needs to be some sort of level scaling for this event where it's made much **MUCH** harder if player participation and levels are above 50.  I mean.. Radtoads.. a few super mutants and hounds that are like level 14.. And a few stingwings.  The enemy variance in this event stinks, and it's a complete cakewalk to such a degree it's not fun.
---
I think we might need to consider the possibility of making events instanced by teams.  So that groups of players can get their own private instance of an event that they can play between themselves so one well-equipped player can't trivialize everything for everybody else, and kill the only legendary enemy at the end so quickly before anybody can tag it.
---
This event is something that should have been available in the game from the very start, and it shows.  Had this been a thing since launch, it would have been meshed better with the game at this stage, because you'd only have players around 1-20 doing the event, which fits in a lot better with the enemies you're facing.
---
This is a low-level event in a low-level area, that is pretty much being done by high-level players who are long-past the challenge of the Forest.
---
And I'd also like to say that the recipe for the Fasnacht donut is completely and utterly absurd.  Even if this food item does not spoil, the fact that it requires so many 'proprietary' ingredients to make is ridiculous.
---
I mean seriously, is this a joke? Brahmin Milk, cooking oil, frog egg, razorgrain flour, salt, spices, and wood of course.  And that's not even counting how much of each one you need.
---
This food item has almost as many ingredients as scorchbeast mixed meat stew, but doesn't even yield even a quarter of the benefits from such an overly complex recipe.  This must just be a gimmick joke item for such a shopping list of items, I refuse to believe it's genuinely something the developers believe people will realistically make.
---
Feels bad for the low levels that don't have hazmat suits.
---
You can sell bulk items. Not all junk can be sold unless its bulked. Some i believe do refuce weight but not all. 
---
I can't login and am getting error 4 8 2000. 
---
I've got three toothys, three witches, two soldiers, and two owls thus far.
---
Stuff like this sure would be fun if they designed this game to have any perminance for the rebuilding themes instead of pointless temporary servers. 
---
Ugh I got all tooth man 3 times in a row 
---
I can't login either and am getting error 4 8 2000. 
---
Where’d you get the coat?
---
I hope this one is still a event reward - I love it  [https://i.imgur.com/s2p9nyW.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/s2p9nyW.jpg) 
---
Back in the day BEFORE CALCULATORS you could identify the nerds because we carried slide rules (aka slip stick) in holsters clipped ono our belts. I wish I still mine, but it is long lost now. Been a few days since then.
---
It might just mean nobody had by that area recently to trigger the event. You tried rubbing through the area?
---
The endless loading started when I tried to enter the tattoo parlor, after completing a parade then a trade. I was on my way to turn in the daily, which was the lead martini
---
The Motherlode is so sweet tho.
---
Ill do it. 125 it is
---
Videos would help us diagnose.
---
Helvetia is actually one of my favorite nuke spots, a decent amount of flux and tons of high level Scorched. If you hit Greg’s Mining you can get a lot of Glowing Ones sometimes as well 
---
Sloth didn't spawn on my second go through which was a pain as I missed tagging it on my first.
---
1st - Soldier Mask
---
2nd - Owl Mask
---
Wait. Im ps4 tho
---
Give me a keycard and I’ll shoot you one off in 10min
---
It's the event that just started today!  Find your way to helvita, shoot a single shot at every enemy you can to 'tag' it for exp and enjoy the sweet loot.  Low level legendaries should be easy to come by during the event, as people are littering the ground with them.  Limited time headgear too. 
---
See you next Tuesday.
---
Are there options?
---
Sure thing what your gamertag
---
PSN zyraluv 
---
Bulking gets rid of plastic
---
Bulking lead and aluminum supposedly reduces weight, but not significantly. Any other weight reduction is just the loss of plastic used to bulk the items. 
---
The real purpose is to sell it to vendors. 
---
does he have a line for the base game mask, the camden park mask, or the tattered mole mask?
---
All tooth, owl, giant, witch here. Really want harlequin. 
---
Instead of doing it at stations do it at the actual impassable parts. The game spawns in a bunch of construction robots who slowly clear rubble and fix up the tracks and players have to defend them over time
---
Someone commented he does for the long nosed white mask, no idea about the others 
---
would gladly purchase a few of those from you - marsupial at least.  add me - same name as here
---
Can you add a volume slider for holotapes? They've been pretty quiet since launch.
---
Mods.
---
Buy pc and plug xbox control in with full controller support. Its what i did and i get twice the performance. You pay for what u get
---
If you get disconnected you get to start over from the beginning
---
My 40 something year old parents would have me believe you don’t even exist at all! Thank you for justifying this 20 something’s gaming hobby. 
---
Added, doing the parade rn tho!
---
Oh I thought it was the black one!
---
I have 354. You have any .45 rounds to trade?
---
Does this drop? Haven’t seen it on anyone yet. 
---
I’ve got the Owl, 2 Witch, Soldier, Beret, and Giant Masks
---
I have 11 nukashine shine I'd be happy to part with if you want to buy em for 300 caps a pop.
---
'Rubbing through the area'... are we talking about the same 'event'? Because I don't think we are :P
---
