This right here. Some people are just shitbirds and don’t care. Sociopaths.

---
You don’t need wasteland whisperer to tame and camp budget (at least for me) is not affected by a tamed creature at your camp. If you are indeed in a random spawn location then you should have no problem taming.
---
If you log out and back in while your in the excavator it will give you an extra bonus carry weight of 100 lbs.

I went and loaded up FO4 with a bunch of mods. Omg... sooo much more fun, challenging, and interesting.
---
Is there any site or post with all of the data mined info about Wastelanders?
---
Yeah, I didn't read the words at first and was just looking at the pictures and the captions, was like how'd I miss that garage under Watoga?
---
LMFAO I thought the same thing when I saw the underground Watoga car park... I’ve farmed that place more than I’d like to admit for a lot of different reasons I was so ashamed I thought I’d missed an entire underground portion😂
---
There are a lot of things wrong with the game... but the map/environment itself is not one of them. People like to say they just "slapped the game together", and that may be true for certain aspects... but the people that actually crafted the world did a great goddamn job, for sure. It is a wonderful playground with too many restraints.
---
Like maybe 100 caps
---
Common spawn at top of the world
---
That's been patched, and broken so many times that it's always worth a test to see if it works this week lol.

The first thing you should do is learn about the perks, weapons, and legendary effects.  The above sites can help you with that.  Come up with a build focused on 1 primary weapon class (rifleman, heavy weapons, commando, melee, etc).    
---
Don't be one of those people who just wings it, takes perks solely on what sounds cool or makes lets you carry more shit without ever tending to increasing your offense and defense, and then winds up posting on this sub "help, I'm lvl 50 and can't kill anything the game is too hard!!"
---
Lol alright alright, its known then.. And no, no mods.. Just logged into a private server with it on.  Take it off and put it back on, back to +100.. Re-log and +200 again
---
Edit: world.. As an IT major you would think I wouldn't say "server", but old habits die hard.
---
yep, sucks.
---
I only even noticed the ITV because ot was on the Discord homepage.
---
Snelly ghaster i hear can only be tamed through wasteland whisperer
---
Can you link the update please!
---
Yes please
---
I literally talk about not regreting buying the game.
---
have fun is the main advice. Its a sandbox. Like you can just walk in a compass direction and see what you see then go back to the vault if things get too rough. Then walk in another direction. The critical path as such should be seen more as a suggestion. Its a take it in game. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You should go to the nukes and dragons website that is linked to know what is coming in terms of builds. Pistols and shotguns aren't great, anymore in the case of shotguns. Auto Rifles can be strong, heavy weapons can be strong, melee is insane if you really build for it. VATS stuff can be very strong, I like free aim so i haven't gone near it much. You just don't want to end up with bullshit perks like you take less rads from eating food. Everyone has 100s of radaways and if you ask some high level for some they will shower you with it because they have like 30 on them and a 100 in the stash just in case. 
---
Visit people's camps. The work benches are generally available. People will usually have free crops growing that you can cook for food and free purified water.
---
Really and truly you are at your own pace.
---
Does #2 include retrieving a keycard and destroying a cargobot for the customer?
---
Because damn I hate trying to blow it up
---
Definitely ask on filthycasuals they're very friendly and you'll find someone to play.
---
Exactly! (the in-game music)
---
Decided to come clean after being called out on your last BS post. 
---
I said it before, I'll say it again. Everyone on this sub is more knowledgeable about the game than any YouTube shitposter.
---
Well there is also the coding issue to figure out. NPCs work differently in an MMOPRG like 76 compared to a regular RPG like Fallout 4. Game developers need to figure out a way for multiple people to interact with them at the same time. They so can't be killable like in previous series. The removal of NPCs was designed that way to reduce strain on servers but also because it might have been hard to to bugs and glitches. Remember how challenging NPCs were sometimes in FO4 because they would dissapear, get lost, die and not respawning, etc.
---
And allow us to wallpaper the inside.
---
I didn't care about it, but I saw that people were turning against each other over it.
---
It'll get old after another year. Plus the radio needs to be updated badly.
---
Do nuclear keycards last indefinitely?
---
I know the silo cards you find only last a week but does the nuclear keycard itself last forever?
---
Explosive Teslas are legacy and don't chain to enemies. Just a heads up
---
I agree and seen the same.  The game isnt "new or different " right now.  Wastelanders is going to make or break the game.
---
Because we’re the true monsters killing them for sport.
---
Free with Fallout First
---
Have you all considered the possibility Bethesda support staff does not speak english natively? It's very suspicious because they miss by much the meaning of the request - almost like if they were using online translators...
---
A good melee weapon and a black powder rifle will do....
---
Lol true but such a fun sport it is..
---
Lmao I can't tell if this is sarcastic or not, I really hope it is.
---
Well I'd say if you like being in pa, and spraying lead and tanking is your thing
---
Id go for a heavy gunner build, if you're rocking a vampire explosive/faster fire rate 50cal you will do goo dmg and never need to heal yourself
---
Kinda, but then explore Skyrim and you'll see what BGS can do... then 76 just looks kinda lazy. The map is more colorful and dynamic than F3/4 but then it doesn't have a story or life so it's just a waste. PLus a "Fallout" world should be somewhat bland.
---
I usually run with a Stalker’s Black Powder to take down health from a distance then Executioner’s 10mm or Gamma Gun up close to finish them off. With Tank Killer, Riflemenx3 and Gunslinger2x3 it works quite well.
---
Haven’t got any good melee weapons, no idea how people are getting the damage I see ...
---
It’s legit
---
You're joking right
---
Probably unarmed melee.  Pairs well with rifles.  use glowing meat steak, yao guai stew and fury.  mutations help too like adrenal reaction for bloodied builds, twisted muscles, talons.....if you can find an instigating or bloodied black powder you can probably solo the burrows carefully.....
---
also gamma is not ideal for ghouls, rads heal them.
---
Nothing has changed since FO1st. There have been reports of class wars but I play every day and haven’t personally witnessed any such thing. Sounds like you need to wait for Wastelanders.
---
You probably wouldn't know a bug if one crawled up your ass and laid eggs, like you crawl up Todd Howard's ass and eat his shitty ripoff games.
---
I don’t even pick them up anymore. No one wants them when they’re in my vendor even at 50 caps.
---
What's your in-game name? I'd be happy to help. I *believe* I have them unlocked.
---
My ign: Juri.
---
Hmm good to know.. The explosive effect doesn't chain or no chain whatsoever?
---
All of us who stuck with this game get some pictures, yay
---
Boiled water, concrete and razor grain is how you make it, but idk if you need a recipe for it or not.
---
On the bluffs in the center of the map, really any bluff offers amazing views. You can find some cool ones if you follow the tracks south past pleasent valley.
---
25% less action point cost
---
It's great, until your opponent turns up stealthboy - and he will.
---
I believe it is just razorgrain and concrete scrap. No recipe.
---
No chain at all. Non legacies are better Imo
---
I don’t know where the recipe came from but I know it. If you’re on PS4, give me a buzz and I’ll be happy to craft you some.  User name is XO_Apes
---
My explosive Tesla just shoots exploding bullets, no chaining to targets with any of the barrel options. I made it into an exploding shotgun and it's pretty nice
---
\+100 for excavator alone, plus another 100 for calibrated shocks.
---
old bug used to give you the 2nd hundred even without shocks.  Was patched out at some point.  Might have returned ?
---
That's true.. I have a good mutant slayer gatling and plasma that I use from tine time to time, but that aiming down the barrel bug that causes it to not fire immediately throws me off.. Im almost used to it but eh.. I've had a few handmade s but no good prefixes and I've yet to have a Fixer.. Not sure if that's the sweetspot im looking for or not in terms of firerate and damage.
---
I figured they budgeted this thing out for multiple years at a relatively modest budget, so they’ll keep tweaking and releasing content for a while to come. I dunno. I work in aerospace where we have schedules that stretch ten years or more into the future, so maybe my perspective is off.
---
Based on the E3 presentation and documentary, the game has progressed about as I expected. They wanted to evolve it as time went on. That’s what actually piqued my interest. The “other players as NPCs“ didn’t work out, so they’re bringing back human NPCs.
---
The atom shop is trivial to me because I’m on ESO with its $40 mounts and $50 crafting motifs and $100 housing. The atom shop feels like popping into WalMart to me. 🙂 $10 outfit? Sure!
---
My big disappointment is the bugs and what appears to be severe tool chain issues. I’d like the inside story there someday.
---
I forgot to switch to my event weapon on a uranium fever today. Rip potential 2 star legendary to 4 people 
---
:(
---
Cool! I'm Kusumura
---
It’s a craftable food item (at a cook station). All you need is razorgrain and cement.
---
How much are you looking for? I will be ready in minutes
---
It seema so.. Im nit complaining.. Useful for a junk horder like myself.. Just dont want to get in trouble for it, ya know.. I mean its bit duping or anything, other than carry weight lol
---
Awesome thanks! I’ll add you in a min!
---
I'm sorry, but it probably didn't survive the trip back to your camp. 😥
---
You're not alone. Apparently it can't be done. I've Pacified a dozen on more but they never show up. Checked it out myself &amp; saw where lots of others have the same issue. Just get you a nice friendly Deathclaw or Mega Sloth. 😊
---
I guess they might've had an internal build with (barely) playable 96 raids but after all the community backlash about 94 raids' quality and stability of their instancing technology in its current state they decided to postpone the release of v96 content to polish it or even fully remake it. After all, releasing yet another piece of content that is buggy and tedious af won't do any good to this game's reputation. Last thing they need now is to turn the rest of their fanbase away from the game doing that sort of thing, I suppose.
---
Yes. The keycard lasts forever. The codes last a week, but we always have access to the new ones within a day of them resetting
---
what i waste of a perk card..... thanks though. does it work with dogs or wolves?
---
Not a thing! As long as you have the Flux covered, I don't really care and don't want anything. &lt;3
---
Beat game ever!!!
---
For an extra 100 caps, you can buy the keycard off us.
---
Weekly, after 9pm EST.
---
They are working on a fix for that apparently
---
But the 50cal dose not have a wind up so won't suffer from that bug, and is the best all around heavy weapon
---
You were online yesterday and today
---
I was just thinking this today, because with my brick house I decided to make the garage a warehouse add on, due to the door sides being corrugated metal.
---
They recently (couple months ago) changed the armor pen on all energy weapons.  Now anti-armor energy weapons completely bypass resistance.  
---
Also, with rate of fire considerations these “hard to miss” automatic rifles have become the generic standard for DPS vs players.  Simply aim roughly at the feet of your enemies and you will nearly always hit.  
---
I think the armor pen changes are what you are referring to.
---
Pareidolia
---
Lol, currently have the game deleted, but archived post just in case
---
I've just stopped playing because of the lack of content, Nothing to do = nothing to keep me playing.
---
I was hoping for a sale on Fallout 1st...
---
I almost really super want to see BoS faction in its early days with limited manpower and supplies. It'd be super interesting to watch that unfold.
---
Omg it has teeth! 😵
---
Awesome idea.
---
Yea I've seen dogs &amp; wolves. If you want a nice friendly dog..one that isn't feral, there is actually a sad little dog above the cliffs and railroad tunnel bridge by Harper's Ferry. His owners are both dead but there a doggy bowl &amp; he/she refuses to leave their side. You could build your base there.
---
I honestly think they came up with this plan not long before or after release. NPCs were either killed, infected, or driven out by the scorched, and a year after the vault opens they'd return after hearing the Vault 76 dwellers had wiped out the source and developed a vaccine.
---
What's wrong with these guys. Low effort troll, you didn't even bother to hide the squatch vest the guy was wearing in watoga. Blows your whole story like the mouth you photoshopped on you self.
---
I’ll try it thanks
---
You've got a crazy good eye ...
---
you cant bring the cat to your camp but you can bring your camp to the kittttttties!
---
That was my thoughts lol. I was sitting at a load screen with my screenshot and just happened to notice it lol.
---
PS4
---
Thanks I’ll give it a look
---
Lol I noticed on the 100 pvp armor they put in nipples.
---
There are so many ideas that come across here that are absolutely gold and they ignore. If they did they would implement at least 30-40% of them.
---
Kinda of yes is it supposed to completely bypass dodgy
---
Most Atoms are being rewarded 3-4 business days after the monthly transaction occurs.  I was billed on 11/21 and got the atoms on 11/24.  
---
Also, there has never been anything promised to subscribers outside of Atoms, Stash, and private server.  Any hearsay about outfits or other free things
---
Is just that.. hearsay.
---
Oh awesome Ghouls!  Would be great to get options to ghoulify our characters!
---
I dunno. 
---
Underground anything is an immediate +5 to coolness bonus.
---
lol shear horror isn’t it 😂
---
Short answer, yes, but it depends on the type, your build and if you are using heavy gun perk cards
---
I can do it for mats if digivice doesn't.
---
Depending on the primary prefix, yes explosive mini guns are still good. Some of the better of primary prefixes for the minigun are vampires, furious, anti-armor, bloodied, junkies, and two shot. Not sorted in any particular order.
---
What did he actually mean by that? I know it's a meme now and all but there must be some basis to it beyond supposed graphical fidelity
---
Yes!!!! exactly what i was thinking!!!
---
Yeah, hope they skip any kind of underground forest. WV as a map is already pretty green. 
---
I want interesting, well designed underground settlements.
---
Ok go with me on this one:
---
More underground areas..... More caves to put camps in?
---
Or a whitespring suite
---
Mini and other heavy was actually buffed in one of the patches, it’s very powerful for boss fights. Even better if it’s B or TSE or F or AA.
---
The only real issue with 76 on PC with "hackers" is in nuclear winter mode. I've never run across problems with them in adventure.
---
for sport? they deserve to be put down as a service
---
Yeah I have seen this , it was rare through.  Once one walked away off into the sky on an invisible staircase
---
This!
---
3 to 4 days for the november atoms?
---
Been trying to add you in-game, but it doesn't say that there's been an invite sent or anything. What's your Bethesda account name?
---
Seneca Rocks. If you spend enough time rock hopping your way above the entire map.
---
Added, sorry for keeping you waiting
---
Is this one of the devs posing as a player or something? Your whole post history is just 76
---
Is it wrong to be a fallout 76 fan? No? Okay... 
---
(I’m just joking, your opinion is opinionated and heard my friend)
---
Ah yes, the classic sleepers, always fun
---
I need you help :) my ign: Juri
---
2 hours server hopping in multiple locations and no plans but I did see a heavy combat right leg so maybe it isn’t a myth
---
Nah I’m not saying that, I mean I kinda enjoyed 76, might still do, idk haven’t been on in months, but i was just saying it was just sus that everything on your post history is just from this sub. Idk
---
And you’ve been on reddit for 46 days
---
All well and good👌
---
That hasn’t been my experience with taming snallygasters.
---
I've noticed a lot just gave up all together after the recent bs but still love the game. I just refuse to play it in it's current state and with how Beth is treating the situation. If they can turn it around and stop fucking people, they may consider going back. But honestly, I dont think they will. They more than likely will end up like EA and Activision completely dumbfounded as to why people dont like them. If they can drop the price of 1st or get rid of it all together and give us unlimited scrap storage, that would be a great start. Oh and drop Atom shop prices. I'd rather pay 100 bucks for 50, 30 even 25 items than 100 for 5 or 10. Just my opinion. Hopefully of most folk as well.
---
The announcement that it was moved to Q1 of next year was made when the fallout 1st was announced
---
You're not just wrong. You're stupid.
---
I watched a video a couple of days ago. A guy glitches through at the top boarder and it takes him 10-15 minutes of sprinting to reach the end of the solid floor map, then he started to glitch into the ground.
---
Glow Sights in Perception is up to 60%(?) more damage against Glowing Enemies.
---
Certain Agility perks can let you do more damage with silenced weapons, or at night.
---
Bloody Mess in Luck is 15% more at max rank.
---
Otherwise, there's Adrenal Reaction Mutation and Legendary Effects that can boost it further.
---
Honestly, I'd also love just a clipping mode that allows objects to be embedded in others. Or at least massively decrease the hitbox to allow for some modest clipping.
---
Bloody mess in luck is +15% more. A two shot weapon will display 25% more too. Sounds like you're good on semi auto rifle perks... If you go automatic, it will display higher numbers, some people might be junkies or bloodied, not sure what you're looking at but there's many reasons why others damage numbers are different. 
---
As for QOL stuff, I like having green thumb on, sometimes I need thru hiker or something to fast travel, but I try to stay unencumbered
---
I'll drink to that
---
Love my mushroom house.  Easy to place with lots of room,  and a rooftop deck with a view.  The fact that it looks like a mushroom cloud is even more appealing to me.   I do wish there were structural elements that I could add so the stairs didn't look like they were made of some super strong alien alloy.
---
I changed to this style out of frustration. After making a few camps that I wouldn't consider overly elaborate,  but did take some time to make,  and then not being able to move and place them in relatively flat areas I got annoyed.  This was the best solution for me.
---
Thank you
---
Yeah but it’s not only rad damage and if you pop them fast enough they don’t have time to heal. Still, Usually I use the 10mm for ghouls, gamma for others
---
In perks, look at Radicool, Demolition Expert, and Bloody Mess perks to increase damage numbers.  
---
Armor selection can also increase damage numbers.
---
I was assuming that bloodied/junkie would jump the numbers, and believe that is what I am seeing. Makes me feel tempted. Thanks for the input.
---
I had one. No one used it
---
This has been a glitch since an early update. Can't believe it's still like that. Sometimes you'll kill one and they'll fall through the ground.
---
I run an all rifle build. Got maxed rifleman, expert rifleman, and master rifleman cards, as well as maxed tank killer in the perc tree. I run stealthy too so I got maxed sneak and covert operative cards. I run a on star hunting rifle (lvl 50) with the  instigating effect. It’s good to start. I get shots between 1500 and 1980 damage if I’m hidden.
---
I always find this hilarious
---
Drugs and some foods etc will do it, it's hard to say really. I have a junkies commando and use Ballistic Bock and psychotats, it pushes damage up there. If you like doing vats try out rank 3 in concentrated fire and do headshots
---
Also the wallpaper only working on one side of the walls.small adjustments will make the game better!
---
Explosive and two shot show higher base damage. Junkie's and bloodied also can show higher base damage.
---
I should mention I also run a ton of luck cards including a maxed bloody mess. My P is 15, A is 15, and Luck is 10.
---
Most of the timed events need to be removed from timed events
---
I think I should look at putting another point in covert ops. Most of my weapons are instigating. I’ll have to start moving things around. Thx!
---
Can't wait to go down there and blow things up.
---
I personally have mine set up just southeast of Point Pleasant. Underneath the large transmission tower. It has a flat surface(with access to a junk pile) and it overlooks the town and west side of the map which I really enjoy. You can build up to 2 floors before building becomes more restricted. There a small space for a garden and water too. I’ve had my camp here since nearly day 1. I just haven’t found another area I enjoy being in other than this one.
---
Yeah, I saw a legendary ghoul and after I killed it, poof! It phased through the ground!
---
Amen! With implementation of the timer, it feels like there is now *LESS* content
---
Got a link? I think the Secret Service may have a connection to Vault 79 as well.
---
You’re giving me some things to really consider with concentrated fire. I’ve got figure where to move points from.
---
I try and tag every enemy when im in a nuke zone and then kill the ones away from people to not cause PVP
---
Honestly pvp should disable in a nuke zone so i can shoot my crippling Auto GL at hordes of enemies and not hit randos
---
I've dropped some stuff I didn't want, but I do transfers in a container near a train station. I've seen the bag have stuff in it through a long process of transferring things to 4 characters and other times it will have the bag there but infinite loading and never show contents. So it's weird, definitely safer to use a container in the world, log off and back on as quick as you can
---
I always start with the instigating hunting rifle unless the enemy has been damaged, then I either switch to a legendary two shot hunting rifle or a legendary two shot lever action. I also run all my weapons with suppressors.
---
For other's information: he posted the same link previously with the title "funny video I found"
---
Far more interested in traditional vault experiences over RAIDS.  Part of the pull of the Fallout universe for me, is seeing what shit Vault-Tec got up to this time. 
---
Bit difficult doing that with random other people each shouting for you to hurry the FUCK up because timer.
---
To the best of my knowledge they only finally fixed energy weapons to get any AP at all in that patch. Pre-patch energy weapons never benefited from any AP at all. 
---
But I haven’t played since July so I may be wrong. :)
---
Is your non-ultra Primed, and the ultra isn’t? That could be a difference.
---
It's a nice perk, VATS gets finicky sometimes but you'll get the hang of it. You can always give Junkies a try with some addictions, if you end up not liking it you just take an addictol :)
---
Xbox?
---
Shhh don't tell him I can't afford to pay for it if he raises it
---
They are immense fun, though not particularly op.
---
I know, I miss spending an hour or so going across the map selling to 7 different merchants...
---
Pretty certain it will be a blow everything up situation.
---
Will do! Not all hero’s wear capes &lt;3
---
Note: when doing option 2, make sure to follow every order given, to make the process as fast as possible
---
Amazing! Why didn't I think of this????!?!?!
---
Pleeeaaaasseeee bring back Preston Garvey so I can blow his whiney head off
---
It’s funny but also a tremendous ass pain in some areas
---
I’m on PS4 and always trying to find a server with people who will join this event.  Bobbyfnshaffer if you wanna add. I’ll always try
---
Most people probably didn't think of it because most people can't run it in 15 minutes, meaning their customers would have to wait quite some time...
---
Given how slapdash things have been for the past year, it’s almost certainly B. Bethesda wanted to release FO76 ASAP so it could start making money; which is why the world feels largely empty and really heavily relies on environmental storytelling. So they attempted to craft a story which supports the world being [i]initially[/i] empty and leaned into the ‘you are the NPCs!’ disingenuity to try and make it feel slightly less disrespectful than ‘you’ll buy this half-baked cookie, yeah? Great.’ 
---
Tbh, I wouldn’t be surprised if the team has been largely focussed on getting NPCs to work, and Wastelanders by extension, for the past year. Certainly would explain the terrible track record of addressing bugs and balance, rather than just assuming they’re incompetent.
---
Cultists seem more set on giving the meat to whatever they worship.
---
It’s essentially a shotgun with a sci-fi skin. It functions completely different from a typical tesla.
---
Yeah, I fell for that once too.
---
The fact that you just made me realize it looks the KND treehouse makes me like them even more.
---
Don't look up the movie "Teeth" then.
---
No, I said DON'T.
---
Yes yes yes. Fallout 76's hottest complex is available to 1st members only and 40,000 atoms.
---
Now a solid solution to missions with swarms of enemies. I don't leave my CAMP without my trusty AA Tesla.
---
If I can’t at least flirt with Mort I’m uninstalling the game
---
How many times does this need to be covered? Bottom line, just dont be a dick okay?
---

Yo the only reason they have a pooled cap limit is so no one abuses it to sell every dupe  they have for lots of caps. This may not be the case now, I played a while ago, back before the battle Royale mode and stuff. I guess if you don’t have duped stuff, this would be a fair claim. I hope this game gets better. 
---
Sincerely, 
---
Yeetus Lendu lll
---
I use my shotgun to cripple now and then switch to my handmade, with the shotgun bug now healing the enemy it is worse than ever.....
---
"We" don't all want an unlimited number of caps to be available to anyone with 20 hours a day to play.
---
There has to be a limit on the economy, or caps will become effectively worthless.  It's already a problem, once you get anywhere near end-game you can practically print caps, but to be able to do that from a low level would really tank the economy.
---
Fireproof for sure lvl 3
---
i disagree, the last thing we need to do is crash the market by devaluing caps even more.
---
&gt;all vendors share the same cap poo
---
this was a player request that they added, they used to be seperate (200c each) and you had to hop all over the damn place to sell your goods (faction bots in whitesprings didnt exist at the time)
---
Vagina dentata!
---
I stopped selling to vendorbots the minute player vending became a thing.
---
While it doesn’t chain, it hits like a truck. I have a QE Tesla rifle that can easily decimate a crowd or a boss  or including the SBQ
---
Different kinds....
---
My boyfriend and I will be on in about an hour and can get you through it
---
You can do silos solo. Best set up would be a troubleshooter's armor and weapon.
---
However, for my first one, I had no legendary gear. Slow, steady and methodical is what worked for me.
---
The ghouls in this game are pathetic, kill them all
---
Before you judge too hard. I am also a high level player 400, and I try to hold off killing legendary by gun butting them. It never fails that someone will find the legendary and go to town on the with their tse, usually a level 45 or so who just got their first explosive weapon, and they kill it before I get there after watching me do it right for them. So in the end I will give players a single chance and then i don't care. It's a game, competition, and I'm not going to sacrifice for random strangers. if you are not on my friends list you are not friend, may sound harsh but life in the wasteland is hard ;)
---
I've sold about 75K worth of stuff today, none of it was unyielding or TSE.  The trick is to find good mid- to end-game equipment, even if it's not the god-roll items, and price them correctly.
---
And I don't use the market, I just list things in my machines and go shopping (I've started buying all my ammo instead of farming for it).
---
You can farm water or assault rifles to cap out the 1400 a day, but it's not necessary if you do some farming and price the nice mid-tier items right.
---
Please, no. Maybe an option, but not forced for all.
---
These add to the atmosphere of the camp in that area without taking budget. You should learn to use it to your advantage.
---
Here is a strangers camp I found at this location with 2 of the Points of Complaint visible. The boat was in a hallway at the back iirc.
---
There are some rumors about mid to late February, so yeah.
---
What do you play on xbox ps or pc
---
Lol what would you estimate your guns worth.. Priceless?
---
Full set of raid armor? I haven't even got a single piece. I'm 2 for 30 and that's on novice. It's crazy hard to run solo-bloody-rifleman, and that's on washout and dead in the water. Meltdown? Anything breathes near me and I'm dead. Dead and back outside. I've done quite a few solo nukes, maybe 80/90, don't mind the challenge, but the risk/reward just doesn't seem viable for vault 94 solo. Anything less than perfection is rewarded with 10 xp a kill, and some bulk scrap. An hour and hundreds of rounds of ammo, meds, and stim packs toast. Wooo. 
---
I know there are a bunch of people that can do it solo, I know it's possible, just super hard for the average player. I want to emphasize- I DON'T want it changed, keep the challenge there in Vault 94 for those that like it. But maybe next vault raid, add some content for us common folk and/or solo players.
---
Even worse when they rush to play the damn music. If you let the timer run to the last minutes you can farm 7 legendary items including the final mob. But noooo, everyone just rushes to play that damn music and finish as fast as possible. Seems so stupid to me. Why not farm good stuff here for 20 minutes? Most of my best drops come from this event, contrary to what most people think. Uranium fever is lvl 40 limited and 3 max, violent night is Soo much better when farmed correctly.
---
Never? I think we both know that is an exaggeration.
---
I stopped playing after the power armor exit bug kept ruining my game play.  While I’m glad there are content updates I was wondering what is the state of the bug squashing? There seems to be less complaining but are people complicit with them or has it improved?
---
Some players build their camps around the cats spawning locations. So it looks like they own the cats. There's also a billboard in the savage divide that has 2 or 3 cats always there &amp; people have built camps there as well.
---
You really don’t want that answer.  lol
---
Anyone still raiding?
---
Are there human npcs yet?

There’s 4 spawn spots up near sunnytop station.  North at the wreck by the statio , south at the abandoned shack and two more eastish and then northish of the shack.
---
I wish you could increase camp size by upgrading your camp. Would be interesting to see, or make it a quest reward at some point. Like the equipment Vault 76 got wasnt what was inteded but what was on hand and the equipment it should have gotten was lost along the way. Would make a decent side quest to complete.
---
I would like to join your cult immediately please.
---
Pacifying is just temporary, if there is not a tame option it won't go to your camp. Apparently there are tameable cats, but I don't know where. Pacify temporarily makes them not run away or attack. But if it says tame and you click it there will be a dialog that says, would you like to send this to your camp. And if you say yes it will go. I've only found one sloth, one rad toad, 2 deathclaws, and a dog in my 2540 hours of play. But they will get killed by enemies while your away. They usually last a week, it's not really worth it until they give us a way to heal them. 😢
---
I think it’s worth the money, the issues r overstated and the benefits of 1st r worth it. I never buy in game micro transactions but after a year of steadily playing this game it’s a service I gladly pay for! 
---
I also think a company as large as Bethesda has quite a bit of disconnect from us so I don’t think this would solve the issue. I think they introduced the service because sales r low and sales stay low because of the negativity in the community. They’ve repaid us in ways that show they want to appreciate us so let’s be appreciative back. 
---
Buying the first subscription makes me think they’ll be able to continue content updates well past wastelanders. If they continue on the track they r now this game won’t have the chance to get much better. All games now a days r rushed products that r released with bugs and issues plus they’ve done well to regularly solve issues. They aren’t perfect and they could definitely do more work in that department but how can they justify hiring more manpower if the revenue just isn’t there? It’s then a risky investment so we vote with our dollar... by buying first we show them there IS a side of the community that is devoted and a side thats willing to do their part to allow them to do their part.
---
never on fucking PC... I swear
---
A feathered beast, for the Blood God.
---
Thank you for explaining yourself without being rude. I appreciate it. But they don't have done some money with the creation club already?
---
Man, after A Link to the Past, I don't mess with chickens
---
Not sure why some people think Fallout 1st is a pay to win service. I've completed the game on 3 different characters before 1st ever came out. By not being a 1st member you are not losing a single feature from the base game. Does having a private server give you an edge in finishing the game (Beating the SQ). Scrap Boxes, I've never heard a player say they were unable to complete the game because they could only store 800lbs worth of gear in a box. Does the tent make you a better player. 1650 Atoms, does buying a few camp items items &amp; a new outfit make the game easier. 
---
I don't agree with a lot of what Bethesda is doing but 1st is just an added feature for die hard fans to get more out the game. And honestly if you're someone who does truly need a 1st membership to finish the game then that's just sad.
---
Another Skull for the Skull Throne
---
I have had no extra budget when I had my last 2 pets. I don't think they use budget anymore. And you do need wastland whisper for deathclaws and such. I don't understand why so many people think you don't. 😞
---
no, that's coming maybe feburay or march. no confirmed date on wastelanders
---
nooooo, it's was just pictures of the upcoming expansion. it's coming  out early 2020
---
I loved the game at launch, it was a little rough but I thought it would be fixed... nope.  It's a real shame, it had so much potential.
---
&gt;!This is my personal evaluation of the game, I am in no way saying other people shouldn't enjoy it.  Please keep enjoying the game if you do.!&lt;
---
That's probably what it was, originally. Then they realized that making a new far harbor was a much,  much better idea.
---
Every online games have a subscription, I know it but in Europe it's 120euro at year. + psplus = 180 euro O.o
---
Considering what she's been giving me lately, maybe dressed as the Grinch is more appropriate.
---
I’d reckon 50-100k. Although a two star, it’s priceless to me.
---
There are no tips or tricks unfortunately. Find the mound, spam until all your maps are gone from that location. PA plans are rare. I've done over a 1000 maps and got 4 plans so far.
---
["In general a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-paying peers. Such games are called "pay-to-win" by critics."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play#Pay-to-win)
---
Pay2win is about gaining ANY gameplay advantage through payment.
---
&gt; By not being a 1st member you are not losing a single feature from the base game. 
---
Funny how you word it that way and not "By being a Fallout 1st member, you will have several advantages over those that don't pay for the subscription". Both are true statements but paint VERY different pictures.
---
My tip is never ever ask for help, you'll appear weak and feeble and someone will eat you. Get out there and handle your own shit and the nukes and XP will be more rewarding because you earned it with your own mutated blood, diseased sweat and irradiated tears.
---
Dude kidding me!??wow it's terrible drop rate.whats your luck stat bro?
---
Luck does not factor into finds, only item condition, when found.
---
I wouldn't mind helping out pro bono, i also find the silo's to be easy as long as it's not just one person...killing those robots are a great way to farm for bullets :)
---
Damn I think I have to gather more Atleast 1k before starting
---
170 sorry
---
Creation club is fallout 4 revenue though. They won’t consider those revenue streams as interchangeable. They might look at it and compare its potential but that’s like saying because one game from the company does well they would justify continuing every game they ever made.
---
And no thanks r necessary, there’s no reason to get rude about it. I’ve heard about the pricing in different countries including the costs in Australia and tbh I probably wouldn’t get it if I were paying ur prices but the truth is I’m American so it’s $13 (monthly) on top of the $60 (yearly) that Xbox gold costs me. So it’s not so terrible. I bet if u looked at the statistics the largest part of their fallout 1st subscription base is American buyers since we do only have to pay $13. I don’t blame u for avoiding it in ur region but I think the problem then becomes the cost of it in ur region and not the overall subscription service. 
---
Now when it comes to solving that problem I really don’t have an answer I don’t even fully understand why it’s so exorbitant in other regions.
---
Are the people that solo her getting the achievement? I did her with 3 peeps before and didn't get it
---
You should get a few with 700 maps. I just save em for when I need a change of pace.
---
Aaaa yea it was supposed to be a recreation of that first day , it couldn’t have been perfect though and I apologize if that ruined your immersion, I’ll try better next time.
---
I guess you didn’t watch the video. Doesn’t seem knowledgeable too me.
---
Found a beaver. Like New Gad I think ints random what animal shows up. I have server hopped about 30 times not and haven't gotten a chicken at numerous locations. This is truly a shit challenge.
---
Man I'm sorry if you think I was rude.. I'm not a troll
---
So you chose the wrong build area and the wrong spots to put your perimeter wall. 
---
Bethesda Plz fix it!
---
Looking at the Pip Boy right now, my bloody explosive Fixer has 410 damage.  When I just shot a wolf in Leader of the Pack, I did 1057 damage, with 102 on the explosion.  I had a stack or two of Adrenaline perk going, as well.
---
I’m doing the standard bloody build.  Nothing fancy or weird.  Rifleman perks, nerd rage, bloody mess, adrenal reaction mutation and covert operative.  I also use mister sandman and glow sight, which will ramp up damage considerably, although situationally.
---
If you use unyielding armor and even get a single star bloody rifle, your damage will increase considerably and you’ll be much, much harder to detect with 30+ agility.
---
I think future dlc will be free for sure. I’d bet money on it because if they were going to start charging they likely would’ve already started the games business model reflects many other games like gta and fortnite. 
---
I don’t think Bethesda will shut down or really be bled by this game but I do think they’ll cut their losses on it if they think it’s the only solution and that’s what I mean. If the game sales or subscription sales fail to perform as is necessary we’ll probably see a good first half of year two content additions but then a gradual slow down and eventual resignation of efforts- for this specific game. 
---
I know some people say they won’t buy anymore Bethesda games because of 76 but I also think that to b a an unfair strategy for consumers to adopt. I don’t like wolfenstein but that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t buy doom or other comparable Bethesda titles. They have different teams working on each franchise and even titles. F76 production is not done by the same who will develop es6 or star field so I rue that consumer strategy. 
---
I think u have to look at it from a business point of view- as Bethesda management will do also. Each game is a different limb of the greater body and if we look at this wounded leg and ignore the issue then they will not be able to heal it nor will they think it’s worth hearing. They’ll think it’s too far gone and simply sever the limb as soon as they think is necessary so I continue to aid that healing and hope that once they have the tools necessary they will not only heal it but strengthen it. Again I also don’t think of it as broken. So it’s not even like I’m handing a broken leg money it’s like I’m giving money to a wounded limp with a bad rep. I know it’s got a leg to stand on and it just needs time, money and a chance
---
Sorry -_-
---
FO1st works fine for me.
---
Lock pick 3 and hacking 3 will also help a lot
---
Because they think they are rare even though it randomly drop from liberators.
---
It's like the people that put perfectly preserved pie in there vending machines for 25k.
---
Wearing his meat suit? Right?

As well as keypad doors!!
---
Delete what ?
---
I wish there was an option to become a ghoul, itd make sense.
---
That’s a handy hint.  Sometimes the enemy corpses are difficult to find depending on the terrain.
---
Thank you CiFBaSA. Remember when they add the atomic shop cartoon in the train station? Well, after we said clearly that we don't want it because it will ruin the Fallout experience they remove it, so, I hope Bethesda can do some change with the subscription in the future
---
The lazy ghouls still in the game lol
---
This is where online fallout doesnt work.  Fallout was always about choices.  Choice that change the wasteland forever.  Want to kill an npc?  Sure. Go ahead but that quest line potential is gone forever.  Cant do that in an online game.
---
Or fireman helmets
---
Remember, listing isn't selling.
---
I can list 'You've been insulted' notes for 25K all day long, I've seen plenty of people do it.  I'll make exactly 0 caps doing it though, so what's the point?
---
Yeah no, theres a good damn reason Im homesteading in the middle of no where, I dont like people. Just me, my robot, and my brahmin. And the mirelurk..damn mirelurk.
---
Ha I wasn’t even going to try this challenge but when I traveled back to my camp one time I heard a *cluck cluck* in the distance. I hit VATS like crazy looking for it and winner winner chicken dinner.
---
What that dude said. I've done a little over 2,000 now and the biggest thing is the plan out how you're going to slowly walk to the nearest bench to scrap.
---
In addition to boosting your intelligence to learn mods and equipping the Scrapper perk there is a magazine that increases Scrap.  Use that too and you'll have more steel, glass, rubber, wood, and plastic then you'll know what to do with.
---
Not sure what the first dude was talking about but I don't think legendaries drop. I would think after over 2,000 I would have seen at least one. Also the power armor plans are pretty rare after doing all those I still needed like 4 plans.  I did get lots of duplicates of others though so I was able to trade for most. They also sell for about 5k per plan.
---
It's a pain in the ass but on the plus side by the time you're done you should know 80 to 90% of all the mods for weapons and armor.
---
People rushing to finish One Violent Night can be frustrating.  It’s a great way for low leveled players to tag enemies and gain XP, and everyone gets half a dozen legendaries.  But it’s unfortunate that some people don’t want to share the legendaries and experience.
---
Someone posted a video of this about 6 months ago and everyone called bullshit because there was a red rocket underground lol.
---
True, I just didn’t know if there was something to this trend that I wasn’t tracking lol.
---
Too late, I've already watched it.
---
Yes it's all win in my opinion and the biggest problem is what you mentioned bro.ill gather 1k maps before starting and will share the results with community
---
It could change ur definitely right! It’s just my predictions at the moment and based off of current trajectories. If they change the sub service in almost any way I wouldn’t be opposed but also I’d mention my exact motivation for joining f1st in the first place and maybe I’m not the only one who was motivated in this way. 
---
At the introduction of f1st there was a cool gladiator outfit in atom shop that I thought of as a must have so I was about to spend money on atoms for the second time ever! (I’m clearly not a heavy spender on micro transactions) but when I was about to spend $10 for that outfit I realized $13 would buy me not only the atoms necessary to get that outfit but 300 extra atoms and every other benefit of the 1st sub service like a tent, scrap box, ncr Ranger outfit, and scrap box. 
---
So I bought it because it was $3 extra for all that it was a no brainer! And not really a decision motivated by wanting to further fund the company. However now after having gotten comfortable with the service I’ll likely continue my subscription. Maybe others feel the same way
---
are you aiming your gun at them to try to tame?   thats the problem they did change the mechanics you have to walk up to it for "tame" to appear
---
&gt;I've noticed a lot just gave up all together after the recent bs but still love the game. 
---
That's mostly because most of us ran out of content. Bullshit I can put up with, and the state of the game doesn't bother me *too much*. It's a Bethesda game, and I play them with the expectation of it being a deep, but buggy as shit experience. But without new content... eh. You can only kill the queen or grind for legendaries for so long before you're just playing Lather, Rise, Repeat 76.
---
I still enjoy the game, but most of the people I played with are are in the same position I am: waiting around for some meat to be added to the game's bones. I was kind of hoping every quarter would have a release schedule on par with Wild Appalachia. The flow of new content was great, always a constant trickle, and it kept the game reasonably fresh. But then the flow stopped.
---
The diamond icons need to be different colors as well it’s so hard to find them when they run away.
---
everyday kid
---
PA exit bug is gone.
---
LMAOOOOO this is like the Jay Wilson Diablo-3 fiasco all over again. Just about everybody had gone WTF when the concept was first announced - and hey, we were right.
---
I wonder if Hines will follow in Wilson's footsteps and GTFO, or if he'll keep taking in all this sweet, sweet cash in exchange for more of his creative genius. Heh.
---
try fighting the stuff when you teleport to someones camp, instead of beelining for the vending machine and then teleporting away.
---
I frequently put items from scrap category in vending machines at high prices.  The goal is not to sell them, but prevent from scrapping or being used as scrap material.
---
For example, I put all the items for daily Scout quest (glands, stings, tic-sacs etc) into vending machines for 1000 caps just so I won’t accidentally scrap them.  Surprisingly... people buy them and I have to go look for more.
---
See, that right there is why I hate modern art. :) They lied with straight faces while trying to cover up the half-baked nature of their product. I still remember all the artsy proclamations Bethesda had made about this being a really cool edgy groundbreaking concept lol
---
Yeah the atom extra are cheap though
---
Yea I've lost them a few times.
---
If you use the shutdown code then they will stay and fight. However, there is an inherent risk with that. Benny the Bloodbug cant stand up to a yao gaui
---
Yeah really!
---
Thank you Bethesda praise bot #104
---
That’s what unyielding armor is for 😉
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
I wonder if people actually start to believe that’s what those items are worth when they see them frequently listed at a high price. Little do they know that the seller is just trying to save their items lol.
---
When does wastelanders actually come out do we know yet?
---
The solution to "can't place my 10 foundation floor on a 45 degree slope" is to make an ugly ass tower square? No! You pick a camp spot and you build there, if for some reason move your camp every time you log in then you should use smaller blueprints that look like a smaller mobile-type camp. Now they are just saying they love it because you called it a mushroom cloud and its "perfect" for fallout. 
---
Have some imagination; Best and Brightest my ash...
---
Very possible as that happens irl all the time. People see those ridiculous ebay ads and all of the sudden everyone thinks trash has value. But yes, most are likely just trying to prevent the pins from being scrapped.
---
Also tried it. Stumbled along this hidden gem looking for a chicken. (Still not working yet)
---
Here's some pictures to help your cause friend

Idk why you got downvoted, I chuckled.

I think the colors are beautiful but not the actual graphics. 
---
Kind of old and outdated compared to other games.
---
You can scrap any gun to get the modification.
---
But the sentient ones
---
I for one, am looking forward to Wastelanders. The public events are really getting old. Like I really want to go and herd some friggin' Brahmin one more time.
---
There's not a trend really, just people trying to get money the lazy way.
---
I see it all the time here in RL too, either complete idiots (unlikely), or wannabe scammers trying to make a lot of money off nothing.  Costs nothing to try to get people to get ripped off...

Search vendors for plans or go on to Facebook and join one of the many groups to see if someone will mod/sell you what you want

Sigh.  Not this shit agin.

they need to use more of the map..the side where the wolf and the cardinal are is untapped potential

I'm sorry, but ehh. Mount and Blade warband can be more beautiful than this game sometimes

You know, some flat grounds would help, too! I'm sick of endles slopes, cliffs, steeps, mountains, and other parts of landscape. I can't build my house straight.

Trust me, she knows. She's letting you be the badass.
---
Scrap, scrap, scrap. Loot everything you kill. For the handmade auto you'll have to buy the plans and make then scrap the rifles.
---
Bethesda lied.  That's your answer.  Enjoy the game if you will, but people need to stop pretending that Bethesda's PR team isn't just saying whatever it is they think you want to hear at any given time.

Dammit, you're probably right. There goes my ego. Lol

Still love the game, bugs and all.

Automatic piston receiver on the Furious and that tenth shot will fire about .5 of a second after you fire the first one and hit hard af.

No. Nobody plays this game anymore, they just come here to bitch about it.
---
Our group right now is doing Cranberry Bog #1 Maps and we got 4-5 power armor plans each every 250 maps. None dropped from the Forest #1 maps we did thousands of earlier, because the plans don't drop from Forest maps.
---
There is. It's called mutation serums.
---
Stay to the left side of the map. Level up and do side quests. The top of the world and everything east of it becomes a grind at that level. Start low.
---
You don't need a recipe, if you look in the crafting menu at a cooking station it will tell you the ingredients you need.
---
I find it's better to hit up people who ask "Is this game good?". Better to influence those that are more open-minded than those that have invested in the game and dev no matter what.
---
Yeah they are ok
---
I think instanced player housing could be a great idea.  I think they should also have a player faction house for each when wastelanders is released.
---
It is a game. And how you behave in the game, what you _support_ in a game, done to actual people, shows what kinda sack of shit you are in the real world.
---
A waste? Yep... a wasteland.
---
This is awesome, I didn't know you're allowed to do this.
---
Does the pipboy stuff you listed change the color of the pipboy menus, or just the light? I also modified iHUDColor just in case. However i can't seem to get screenshots to work correctly in game now. They all come out black.

Not really.

What platform?
---
That would be amazing, I second this.
---
Spoken like a true scorchbeast.

It doesn't suck, it's a marked improvement.

Previously each of the 7 vendor types had 200 caps each. You couldn't sell more than 200 caps at a time, and had to vendor hop every day to get your 1400.
---
Right! Sorry, that would be important. Editing my post.
---
Strange how it seems to be getting some more attention since they they got an injection of funds from FOF...
---
PC! I'll play with you once in a while! Ign jonmoreno96
---
I doubt they’ll ever do this, but roleplay faction communities have already popped up around the game for just about everything you can think of. Bruns free states group myself. Can be pretty fun
---
The [Free States Revolutionary Outfit](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Free_States_Revolutionary_Outfit) has some strange Futuristic-WW2 vibe to it

Thanks!

I was informed that the start of the Enclave questline is guard by deathclaws and that's the only thing I'm seriously worried about, but I want to join the Enclave asap. I've played Fallout since 3 and this is the first game where I can join the Enclave without mods, so I'm kinda excited.

BEES??? BEES!!!!!
---
Make the AI more like this overall /. Make them unpredictable and have quirks like this where they actively try to ambush and lure u , cooool

Have a group on discord;join if you want
---
https://discord.gg/CUqZarv
---
That’s a good idea, after all when you finish the mayor quest the robots are no longer hostile, so you’ve earned your place in the city
---
Do you have discord? Not necessarily for voice chat but I find it's easier to find people online and willing to play if I can ask them on discord.
---
Do you take people along? I still need to launch my first :p
---
I do, are there any channels you suggest?

Fallout 4 with a few mods looks and performs way better. Also compared to pretty much any other aaa game in the 5 years fo76 looks like garbage

For the past five hours I’ve tried to capture Grafton Steel workshop but every time I get set up and have built everything, some level 200+ comes kills me and takes it. I server hop and make new one and the same thing happens over and over again. I am now almost out of my scraps. :(
---
I use an endagerol syringer at sbq fights and it seems to help a lot!
---
Had it happen a few days ago too, sounded like a 50 cal.

Bethesda scammed you. This game is and will always be a buggy pile of dogshit

The only people allowed to tag along are employees. (Gotta keep the method secret)

HOWEVER, I can clear the path for you and make the run 100× easier. You gotta trust me on this one, it's a lot simpler than it sounds. do as I say and we can be done in about 15 minutes! You up for it right now? I'm on!
---
I saw someone with one of those in their vending machine and was completely confused as to why they would waste a vendor slot on keeping one.
---
No, you just don't know what a video where something happens is. Not my fault you are dense.
---
Camp budget is not affected? Damn, that's the whole reason I haven't done it this whole time. Think I'll try tomorrow and see how it works
---
I didn't start the Brotherhood or Enclave quests or finish the Responders quests till after lvl 100 because I was doing my own thing. 20 levels later and I still haven't launched a nuke, just don't feel like it yet.
---
You can buy plans of MOST mods for MOST weapons at robot vendors.  Different vendors have different inventory lists though.  So you’ll have to google which one has mods for the gun you want.
---
Alternatively just scrap every non-legendary you come across.  You can learn MOST mods through doing this for MOST weapons but some you need to buy the plans for.
---
The gun you scrap does not need to have the mod you are looking for in order for you to have a chance to learn it.  It just needs to be the same gun and there is a random chance to learn a mod.
---
Alternatively check player vendors.  Often we are selling plans cheap because we don’t need them and it’s hard work finding people to give them to.
---
I tend to price them at 1-5 caps unless they are actual rare plans.
---
A second alternative is to ask someone to mod your gun for you in the mean time.
---
This might be superstition mixed with RNG but i swear they wont drop until you hit lvl200. I was farming them and distant thunder and i swear i rever recieved any plans until i hit 200. And the mire and bog maps are the only ones that have dropped armor plans for me but i dont really do any others. Good luck buddy
---
If settlers are the only non psycho faction in wastelanders this is going to be a hard miss.
---
One day someone will buy it...one day...
---
This sub is feeling like George Orwell book. You didn't tow the party line and the thought police shall punish you with their downvotes. Anyway you gave me a chuckle.

Do you need to have more than 3 charisma?

What is it with Jordan Peterson fans like you being utterly useless, incompetent parasites?
---
Go home Todd ur drunk.
---
Silo is easiest done solo frankly.  Any time I do it with others it's longer -- at least in my experience.
---
Just like fucking with the chickens in the Witcher lol
---
Great idea, they could even take the ESO approach with it, where it's instances for each player - as well as a similar monetization plan for them too (where pretty much every house is purchasable with in game currency, but you can also pay irl $$$)
---
That is a random spawn location, can have all kinds of critters.
---
I wouldn't be surprised to see them as a purchasable with a good deal of buffs
---
I got a bunch of cats today, but found a chicken on my first hop. All the cats were later when I was trying to help my bro find one.
---
Lol, gotta throw that disclaimer on just in case the dislike mob hits
---
Sorry, don't have a pc. However, if you Google it, you can find out everything you need to
---
Delayed along with Wastelanders DLC until next year. 
---
To my knowledge, they are supposed to release along side each other so once we know when Wastelanders is dropping we will know when Steam release hits.
---
So shouldn't you be excited that they're finally finishing the game? I am.
---
I still want interior (both sides can be wallpapered) walls.
---
Not necessarily, you can make one and offer to add the people you need online to it. You can share your discord username and add people so you can message them when they're not in game asking if they want to play.
---
I'm only suggesting this because on PC the alternative is to basically just add them then show up announced when they're online.
---
I’m on PS4 but the deathclaw thing is not so bad. I did it under level ten. When you go in the cave just time it right and sneak past them. Stick to the left side of the cave and search the body.
---
skrt. nah
---
I solo'd pretty much all the quests except killing the SBQ. And I like, wasn't super geared up or anything. Just scrap/store your junk often and don't fear death lol
---
Don't need to. Got it on dvd. Funny. I've only watched it once....
---
still sucks lmao
---
Fyi two shot makes most heavy MGs like minigun and the 50 about as accurate as shooting rubber bands though...
---
I've found this happens a lot, too.
---
The only way to reliably make it deal damage is with VATS, preferably with a crit for the 100% hit chance.
---
Well for one, there are plenty of flatter places to build and two, why would you want to look at that ugly terrain everyday?
---
I thought from the start there can't be "player choice" with a online game, so not disappointing. I don't care about the atomic shop they said from the start were are going to pay for cosmetics, I just don't buy any. 1st really broke my hart, not going to defend bethesda to the haters any more. But I'm very happy they are adding NPC's. They said in the beginning there aren't going to be any, but we asked and they said yes.
---
Divide, Toxic and Ash all most definitely can drop PA plans.  I've never heard of the lvl 200 thing but I likely got all that I know post lvl 200.
---
Nope.
---
I'm partial to the cliffs between the civil war fort and the munitions factory at the top of the map, myself.
---
exactly
---
Kill a Radroach with a Board
---
Does anyone even go to Watoga?
---
Idk why I put laser I meant plasma but ah dang idk I needed the weapon blueprints too. That could be it
---
Sorry, can't do such impossible
---
Skyrim: All I did was killing a chicken...
---
Fallout 76: Where's the damn chicken?
---
Bethesda loves their chickens
---
I am on PC, how can i do it?
---
Can you wallpaper the inside of a garage door IRL?
---
Fallout 4 and 76 graphics comparison comes down to personal preference since they are so similar. I find 76-s graphics better because it has more vibrant colors and the lighting seems to be better too. After playing 76, Fallout 4-s graphics seem "washed out" to me.
---
WOW. The hero we need.
---
../Documents/my games/Fallout76/Photos/"Some number gibberish" There you got your screenshots, just take everything out you dont want as loading screen and put it into a different folder.
---
I thought you were asking because they lriced it high, but then I saw 3k, it's like nothing lmao.
---
Any explosive guns at 3k is worth it, if you want it just get it.
---
I'm running a pc I built in november '15.  i7 6700k not overclocked, 16gb ddr4 3200. GTX1070. SSD for my games folder. Playing in 2560x1080, I'm frame locked at 120fps. Occasionally dips into the 70fps range in crowded events. The monitor is G-Sync capable 144hz ultrawide so screen tearing is a non issue. As long as you're playing in 1k, it'll play fine on older hardware.
---
im thankful for the improvements they've made since launch, but these suckers gotta do more, not just wastelanders but fix performance on ps4 for example and create factions and more monsters and turf wars and shit
---
Rifle going on YouTube does a nice walkthrew how to by pass the bad parts
---
No but it will chew up all your ap in no time
---
No
---
reminder this was a super simple mod that was added into fallout 4 within 24 hours.
---
I think he meant the wall that holds the door.
---
I've been playing since the beginning and have never heard of the bulldozer what is it? Where do I get it? So much more to learn...
---
Was planning on doing that, but this way seems better, more fun.
---
r/verbosity
---
Considering that Anor Londo in Dark souls 1 looks better then any vista in all of 76 (A game from 2011), I must beg to differ.
---
It's an automatic feature, if while trying to drop something in build bode you pass over certain environmental elements like rocks or bushes, they will disappear and prevent an error in dropping the item.
---
They reappear on next login in case you remove whatever you have put over them.
---
Technically you can wallpaper anything in real life if you're brave enough.
---
done. Available for only $1.99. Black Friday offer :D
---
That would be a bit too extreme for a multiplayer game. But also the way it is right is way too limited.
---
 M
---
it continues to be disappointing that no matter what (or how many) stunts Bethesda is going to pull and how much they'll ruin the potential of this game, you'll have "fans" like these who will clap along to anything they'll do.  
---
or maybe this game just attracts the most naive and gullible gamers - if you think this title """"evolves"""", I don't know what you'd say about the likes of say, Warframe (that actually makes an effort to supply varied content on a reasonable pace)
---
That would be cool. As a side note if you got that colom from the shop you can click the NW trophies to it, idk if anything else works but its somethin
---
Yea this is the final nail in the coffin.
---
I quit the game ages ago but still stay subbed here for the off chance that I see a patch or update drop that actually fixes thing but there's only 3 things posted k nthis sub.
---
1.) Good ideas from the community followed up with a flat "I'll tell the dev team!" from a Bethesda Employee, that we never see anything come of or hear from again.
---
2.) Here's this huge fucked up thing Bethesda did this week to show they don't give a fuck about you. They ignore every problem with this game (Fallout First, NW cheaters, normal game cheaters, bugs that still exist since launch) and proceed to shit out new ATOM shop items
---
3.) and lastly this fucking post. This game developer has shown time and time again that they will fuck you in the ass and take your money, and the community doesn't give a fuck about it. You post moronic posts like this gobbling on the developers dick telling them how good of a job their doing and how good of a game this is.
---
This game is a fucking dumpster fire and at this point I whole heartily believe that the only people who are still here are just into getting fucked.
---
I'm fucking unsubbed, fuck Bethesda and fuck this sub reddit.
---
But the side is safe
---
and you keep it all for yourself. shame on you.
---
I have my camp on the Whitesprings Golf Course, within walking distance of the Golf Club, the last time I saw a nuke was 3 weeks ago.
---
GTFO as in leave the company? No. The only way Pete Hines would leave Bethesda is *maybe* if he was offered a juicy sports radio or journalism job and even then... no. He's been with the company since 1999 and he's certainly not bored of it.
---
That's the trapper mask. Is from the Atomic Shop
---
Oh ok, I have been having the same problem and gave up and moved my camp. I thought I missed a perk card or something thanks for that.
---
For me, a riverfront home is so nice. Anywhere along the river that runs vertically up the left side of the map. 
---
You only need to fortify the road side of the camp, because baddies can’t come for you from the water side. 
---
And you have water, dirt to grow food in, the sounds of birds and shit... it’s positively idyllic.
---
The set dressing (the little stories the word tells) are just great, definitely not slapped together. But most people just want to run through the game level up as fast a possible and not take in the scenes. They are the ones complaining the word is empty. And since F4 they have been catering more for them.
---
Hoping that room for future expansions.
---
Ty! Will i still he able to open in game the galllery ans see them?
---
i think either a ghoul or super mutant
---
Yes it's Richard Cranium.
---
You on ps4?  If so I will get you a list of materials, you collect them and I will craft you non legendary armor and weapons. Think of it as a quest, while not legendary you will still be considerably tougher then using the random stuff you have collected
---
No, but you can just look at them in windows.
---
Don't try to take on 10 of them at once. Pick them off from a distance. It's easily doable at lvl 23.
---
smart 
---
i will do this too now,
---
have a tip from me: rename your weapons with the ammo type included, if it starts with a dot . then it comes at the top in pipboy 
---
makes it easier to know what ammo to take with you
---
Staying positive. Like everyone else I hope they knock it out of the park with this one. We deserve it.
---
I really hope they can all be blown up.
---
I really love seeing a camp that has had a lot of though and effort put into it.  
---
The “mushroom” single base structure was something I used when camps could not be placed and had to be rebuilt in the early game, but I’ve found them detracting from the immersion these days.
---
If you find yourself on a laggy server, there's a good chance you can get 2-3 digs from a single map per mound. If you spam the action button for "dig", you can score a few dig animations before the server catches up with your input, thus granting you bonus digs per map.
---
I'm level 100 and something, I'm not a min max player. I've done uranium fewer where one of my shots takes more than half of the legendary's health, then I back up and call the others. Gun butting is a great idee, will definitely do that next time. Why didn't I think of that.
---
While it is subtle there is a story, read notes, listen to holotapes, check all the computer entries. Its not very deep or plentiful  or as in your face as past fallouts but it is there.
---
lmao
---
You can turn on passive mode.
---
r/dontputyourdickinthat

Would you mind telling us what it is? The loading screens say it’s marine armor but I’ve noticed polymer scout has higher stats, I know forest and urban have the same stats
---
I'm a member and I agree

I agree.

Thats true, but id still like nuke zones to be a forced pve area

Lol! Make you happy.... It's parent company -&gt; investors -&gt; themselves -&gt; media -&gt; whales -&gt; you.

Know your place bud.
---
he was probably thinking about non-cosmetic microtransactions
---
Saw ur comment about how to fix the exceeds camp budget? Can u let me know plz. I am stuck with my base atm.
---
Make for more satisfying kills
---
&gt; the biggest thing missing is the players
---
and the cosmetics-only promise
---
I decided I don't want to take on a subscription so I play Adventure. 
---
I've nearly 5k Atom points and I want nothing from the store, I live simply, a very small camp and don't use skins, I would pay Atoms to buy a StashBox.
---
I got scammed by a cosmetics-only promise :(
---
Having unlimited access to junk is the same as having unlimited access to your character in my opinion.
---
Ye i was thinking the same last night...i really need to start hunting for treasures
---
Afaik is Heavy BOS combat armor in terms of resistances.
---
Platform? I've never had your issues (PC), I think it is your system setup.
---
Pm me
---
Don’t worry about dying, make sure you land a hit on all the ghouls, when they die you gain XP. You can either server hop until you see some high level players are there, they will finish the ghouls for you. Or you can draw ghouls to the sentry bots and let them lend you a hand.
---
I'm thankful for Fallout 1st
---
/s
---
I’ve got a junkies build, using junkies weapons (and have five addictions) yet there is no difference between the displayed base damage on the PIP Boy, compared to identical weapons without that legendary effect.  Do you (or anyone else) know if this is a glitch, or I’m doing something wrong?
---
Anecdotally it appears the weapons do indeed, do more damage, but as mentioned no difference is displayed on the PIP Boy.
---
"cosmetics-only"
---
yeah...
---
"And I will word it this way for it to make sense, there are players who are currently playing this game within the limitations of the early game because they are not subscribed to fallout 1st. That is wrong"
---
…… I'm a member but it's hard to disagree with that statement.
---
Glad you got to this realisation eventually. 
---
A lot of us were already well aware of the impact something like the scrapbox would have on the game. It's why a lot of us were asking for SOMETHING, anything to deal with the storage issues.
---
The ones of us that knew about databases knew that this was possible with little to no effect on performance for many months.
---
Do you believe us now when we say that stuff like the scrapbox and tent are pay2win items?
---
As a current member I completely agree. The scrap box should be available to every player. At the very most for the price of some atoms. But as you say the game is evolving in it's own way and players need to have access to these changes in some form. I hope in time we see this happen. I would gladly give up  everything else about the membership but that scrap box is key.
---
Fair point. I’m a slow learner and obviously didn’t realize the impact without actually experiencing it. However I wouldn’t consider it pay to win I consider it something worse than that.  I would consider it pay to play the game
---
Make you happy means what exactly - your little linear chart doesn’t quite explain your thoughts - uses sentences
---
I would've liked it if the whole game was co op, (except if you are a raider or something, we need factions). I'm not very skilled and there are hundreds if not thousands of PVP games. And fallout lends itself very well to co op, the niceness of the community is testament to that. It's a nuclear wasteland lets rebuild it together. But if a raider, mutant or referral ghoul player comes my way I can run my ass of. Don't mind me I'm just daydreaming.
---
I want to make it clear, I'm happy that you've come to this conclusion and you've chosen to share it with other people on here.
---
Whatever term you want to go with, we can at least both acknowledge the serious issue at hand and Bethesda's failure (or greed I guess this this is very much intended) to do right by the loyal player base.
---
What exactly do you dislike about my statements Mr.?!
---
It HAS a server wide notification so.....does one violent night and uranium fever and campfire tales and more..
---
20 hours after your first transaction
---
Once every 20 hours from the time you first sold the bot an item.
---
I'd love not having to juggle the contents of my Stash.
---
I’m at a tricky point in my relationship with fallout 76. I’ve played pretty much this game and this game only since beta but now I’m at a place where I see that in order for me to enjoy the game I have to stay with this subscription and I don’t know that I will do that. I recently began a new Skyrim playthrough due to this and I’m having a blast away from 76. I’m truly thinking I might step away for a while to see if it works out without me dropping a full year payment for fallout 1st
---
I’ve just started my 3rd character .. this time I’m just wandering around, finding a place for a good camp and building up resources 
---
Once I’ve got my base sorted and a healthy level of resources I’ll then start on the quests...
---
The quests are designed to get you to explore the map but you can do that without them .
---
I’d do the responder quest lines then just chill and enjoy what the game has to offer
---
Whole heartedly agree, I personally love this games for he same reasons, I am level 127 now, slower than most but some times I have ignored challenges etc and just aimlessly wandered through the towns and bush land because that is what my mind needed. Other than the odd griefer the majority I have met are friendly and helpful.
---
To those that claim it is “just a cash grab” everything is a cash grab, from buying an apple to buying a house, that is how capitalism works. Make enough money from a product to pay wages, property and improve or replace the product.
---
Add interior walls!!! So we can wall paper both sides. To give a true separation of walls
---
By replacing the desired wall with a door frame, and having a foundation on the adjacent side you can place another wall inside facing the opposite direction allowing for both sides to be ‘wallpapered’, consequently using more budget. Doing this with a flipped brick wall and two metal half walls looks super cool btw, haven’t tried every combination though.
---
I meant back when vendors didn't all share the same amount, i remember at one point being able to go to each region and selling stuff instead of them all having the same exact amount no matter where you go.
---
You get to actually play the game. And You get to enjoy the resources you collect by playing the game. Because even without the Scrapbox you will amass those resources. But unless you pay for the subscription you won’t be able to fully utilize those resources in your play
---
Don’t show Rifle Gaming this post or he’ll call you out on harassment for it
---
He’s a cool dude I love his channel. He loves the game and he doesn’t let popular opinion sway his judgement. The fact he takes that stance AND has a channel dedicated to the game is what is causing his issues
---
Bottom line the Scrapbox as a monthly service is shady. I believe it’s intentionally that way but promoted to fly under the radar
---
I'm pretty much at the exact same point I started with the beta too and have found that the subscription offers much in the way of convenience for the player and it's pretty hard to step away from that. It's a massive weigh up to see what works for you and what dlosent for sure. The year sub is pretty expensive, being around 180 for me in NZ. I myself am hoping and waiting for wastelanders to give the game that massive content lift it's been needing to feel like it justifies the sub. But who knows that could seem very foolish from previous experiences in content updates this game has had. In the mean time I decided to do a fallout 4 run and start a more challenging build in 76 an alternate between the two
---
The vendor pool has *always* been shared since beta. The maximum caps has always been 1400 per day, shared across all vendors. Previously they each had 200 caps, and you had to travel between the various regions to max your caps. They've never had a separate pool of 1400 each.
---
That’s a very interesting alternative I believe could work. Start a new character in 76 and just use the stash same as before fallout 1st like the scrapbox never existed. I think that would work
---
I remember at one point going to 3 diff places having 1400 a piece, unless it was glitched 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
The map itself is nice but the game certainly is not pretty
---
Bethesda probably forgot about it lmao
---
I definitely agree, I hate changes to events that were previously player activated. And yes you can do imposter solo, here you can see me doing it, just fast forward to 15 minute in to this video: https://youtu.be/F9OmHxl-hEs
---
If you are interested I was able to solo on standard week one and two of V94 and it’s on my YouTube channel as well, I wanted to give week 3 a try but recent patch bring new bug and i can’t break pipes by shooting ;/
---
I sort of agree with you. 
---
I understand any business model needs constant income to keep servers alive and pay a staff to update the game. Bethesda has to have something of value to offer players to keep the game going. The sub is cheaper that buying atoms too so it pays for itself. 
---
However they're neglecting the largest part of their fan base at the same time they're trying to cater to paid players and long term I dont see that working. 
---
The scrap box is wonderful. It makes the game a million times more enjoyable. What they should have done was given all players a limited scrap box. Say 500 extra lbs of just junk storage independent from stash, and made the unlimited a bonus for subscribers. 
---
I feel the same about the fridge they released as well. These are things the entire community has been asking for. The people who play the game thru the bugs and glitches. They'd probably have made far more money releasing a fridge as an ingame item and skins or bonus capacity for atoms. 
---
The repair kits were done via atom shop or earned in game and that's how it should be. A bonus for subscribers, but a more modest model for all players.
---
Best of luck I hope it makes ur decision much more clearer and you have a blast playing!
---
Now make those services available for PC 😅
---
Nice! I'll make sure to check it out. Meltdown is the only one I havent solo'd yet...maybe because I just hate looking for the cards lol
---
You know what, I'm sorry to say it but this was probably a bug, and the ghoul was pathfinding to something else, or was finding an alternate route to you
---
Looking for the cards with a clock ticking is even worse 😅
---
I would add that we should be careful with what we wish for - maybe add a toggle for bulldozer mode. Otherwise we run the risk of being unable to build remotely near any trees or bushes. I already hate how placing down a lamp post already clears a huge section of grass leaving a weird green patch around it. Turning on bulldozer mode would mean for example that we can't build onto trees.
---
My only tip i can give is to split them and do them several times instead all at once.
---
You will get lots of plans and it's weight adds up quiet fast, your vending will be stocked up in no time.
---
For PA Plans, you should focus for the Mire and Bog Maps.
---
Oh dang, that makes sense. Still, it was a cool personal experience.
---
I've had the exact same thought myself. The Scrapbox is the hook, it gets you used to effortlessly gathering junk without worry, and having ~400 more stash space to boot.
---
Moving away from it would be a significant regression to a worse gameplay experience.
---
I very much agree. As well as Campfire Tales! That event used to spawn every two game nights!
---
Please we need more up votes
---
You ain't kidding. But I can usually skip residential and on a good day most of engineering
---
Very true. I’d also like to just say popular opinion shouldn’t be hated or deemed negative just because it is popular. The game is being used as a cash cow and updates bring more bugs. In this case the pop opinion should matter. Unfortunately, and not to talk shit or throw shade, Rifle is easily entertained as is many people, by what Bethesda has crapped out. I wouldn’t mind that can-do positive attitude if the game wasn’t broken and being prostituted like a New Reno woman who just turned 18. 
---
On a lighter note, Rifles nuking experiments really motivated me to use nukes more often in the early days of F76. I’ll watch his Wastelanders videos to gauge wether to get back into F76. Till then, I’ll keep shouting about the issue the game is plagued with and the business practices that harm the community.
---
If it's the one I think it is, Grahm also sells it, and it's about 200 caps
---
If solo I’m starting in engineering, when with team then greenhouses but yes residential is always skip
---
Most of us are like Rifle. We love the game, we understand the (justified) “hate” but we don’t let that stop us from doing what we enjoy. Life is good for us. Why? Because we don’t have a YouTube channel dedicated to fallout 76
---
Oxhorn is semi dedicated, although he’s more of a lore guy and covers all Fallout games. Other than that there’s Matty but he’s been avoiding F76 content because he isn’t too happy about the state of the game and the direction Bethesda is taking it. Damn we need more Fallout youtubers
---
Junk is the game. It’s the core component of the gameplay loop. The only thing as essential as junk is your character. That shouldn’t be limited at all if there is a means for it to be unlimited. Unless it were a free to play game.
---
Juicehead is my guy
---
Plz let us take one like in fallout 2 just for fast travel to carry some extra stuff in trunk 😍
---
I had to edit the .ini file so that I can use my full 144HZ instead of the default 60...

have a nice weekend!
---
This is the same thing we have been saying forever. The inventory is terrible and "Junk/Scrap" should be separately stored and the 800 limit should be for everything else AND we need shared stash to transfer between our characters.
---
Scout armour is the best for arms and legs, heavy combat for torso.
---
Disclaimer: metal is best purely for DR and leather is best for ER
---
It's been awhile but the only way I could get more was to go to the location and then log out then log in at that location. I think this worked for me.
---
I found Heart of the swamp didn't work nor did during a nuke strike elsewhere.
---
I don’t think we should be able to transfer between characters because different characters are different playthroughs. The same way I can’t send a fully modded 10mm from my level 50 fallout 4 character to my level 1
---
I like the tarot reference.
---
I was about to be very salty, reminding you that me and many other pointed out the "scrapbox exists to sell a solution to a fake problem: we cant provide limitless stash, so we sell it"....
---
...
---
but I'm taking a deep breath and just being glad you walked to a right direction.
---
Ok cool
---
Yeah I had to experience it to see it. It sucks
---
I am not 100% however I wouldn’t imagine so.. as you can edit and change any way at will.. so you can change a wood wall to a steel wall without have to delete the wall and place a new one.. and when you do this there appear to be no change in Camp budget, so my assumption is no, full clarification is needed tho!
---
Quick reminder that you can change the color of Pipboy, Qickboy AND PA Pipboy Hud (Not the normal PA Hud, thats a texture you have to change sadly)

No problem, friend... life is just like that, we must experiment sometimes.
---
Assuming you're talking about the cosmetics, You have to craft the items at a work bench. They don't just magically get added to your inventory. Its something incredibly inexpensive like 1-3 cloth or something like that.

The only reliable way I get them is with my alt. I started the quest to make radshield but never completed it. Now I can farm them regularly but have to transfer to my main for crafting. 
---
If you're ps4 I'll help you
---
So you joined the enclave but actually have a responder's heart!
---
I'll try to add you if your friend list isn't full yet
---
Yeah if they're just adding more stuff on top it's going to be shit considering even just doing the SBQ that has been there since the beginning is still laggy as fuck. They really need to fix their fucking engine instead of just loading it past its limits constantly.
---
Never, that's all the spare caps in Appalachia. You'll have to panhandle in front of train stations now and hope other players will take pity on you.
---
I am on ps4, I am spudgunrich lol
---
Thank you for the tip.  Good idea
---
And some form of internal lining for roofs and under floors to match current wallpapers.
---
So do you still have access to the scrap box for withdrawal only? Now it can be damaged, is it repairable and storable assuming you can't build one?
---
Haha since we are already friends, ill join you now lol
---
And half width walls
---
Spiral staircase
---
BOS building set
---
A bunker building set.
---
Yes it’s withdrawal only. Haven’t had it damaged but I’m assuming you would be able to create/fix another one.
---
I've been tempted to work on a camp budget database. Work out how much each is worth and how much can be built. 
---
All I know is tamed animals take the most, then; turrets, billboards and brahmin, lights are quite expensive, foundations are more than walls, roofs and walls are more than floors, then you have pretty much all objects, and 1 display item equals 1 basic camp object
---
I beg your pardon but I disagree. 
---
Anor londo (and most of the scenery)in dark soul is incredibly beautiful because it's a still screen you can't interact with.
---
90% of what you see in dark soul is far far away buildings, sky etc. 
---
So yeah, it's beautiful but honestly the sky in FO76 is too.
---
My worry is they don't let you repair/store it or build a new one.
---
Never launched a nuke and would appreciate the help sometime PSN Aquaticadventure
---
No and all 4 materials have the same stats, they just look different.
---
I believe once you’ve subscribed to the service it’s like the ranger outfit. It’s always available for you to craft. You just can’t store anything in it if you’ve unsubscribed. Because it’s there in your build menu.
---
Yeah, we just ran the SBQ again.... From the time she left the fissure to death now that the wife is using the Prime Ultracite 2 shot gatling laser? 3 minutes and some odd seconds I believe it was. Gonna put a stopwatch to it tomorrow. Thanks for the input y'all! Made a HUGE difference!!
---
It really doesn't matter what you think (sorry if that's a bit harsh)  people are already moving items across multiple characters using friends as anchor points or joining a friends server, dropping stuff in a container and yeeting to their other character before that person leaves the server.   
---
Its already happening and important if you actually care about the game and keeping any items. Also your example is flawed anyway because items are level capped in Fallout 76 (so your level 1 can't use that  level 50 pistol)   
---
People are duping items and selling legacy exploding lasers for hundreds of dollars but oh no it would be immersion breaking to be able to share items between your characters on your account.
---
There is no point in these posts. People have and always will defend this game. Its always on your end...its never something Bugthesda does wrong/has done wrong.
---
You are thinking mostly like a single player game - and I suggest you try it a different way. Open world multiplayer games will always have concerns with new player content mixed up will late game.
---
People likely will not come back to Appalachia, we constantly find not completely rotten corpses, perfect sheets of paper not degraded by the environment effect, etc... It's more likely we will find where they are hiding; scorched that kept they mind are hiding from non-scorched, the "good guys" are hiding underground, enclave will gather people by offering high security due the control of many bot... the brotherhood would receive reinforcements... and, in the end, new people could come because they are fleeing from another worse place outside our map, where other queens live (we could randomly find they wandering to west).
---
Lore-wise, we will probably find where they are all hiding; and some settlements may start from Vault 76 NPC residents.
---
Where did you see this at?
---
My logic isn’t flawed. I could whip up a modded level 1 rifle and send it over to my new character if I wanted. But it truly goes back to how you play the game. Fresh out of the vault and my character is receiving all this free gear? Yeah that’s immersion breaking for me. Then again some people don’t play the game that way they play it arcade style and in that case there is no true authority on which is or isn’t the best option.
---
&gt; Maybe Im just getting in my head about this 
---
Yes but then again all of us would have to speculating on what Wastelanders will be or not be.
---
The way I see it, it'll be like Morgantown airport i.e. there will be remnants of what was already there but lose some of its initial meaning and gain new meaning. Probably all the references regarding no one being around might still be there initially but once you get to a certain point in the game, you move past that into more HUMAN npc populated areas (cause Grahm, Rose, Biv, MODUS etc. aren't NPCs... smh) and then the later part of the game in terms of story notes will have totally changed or given new context.
---
The only thing I've listed for 25k is something which can't be placed in a display case. These players are probably just hoping that someone who is generous or quitting the game will dump 25k.
---
Thanks
---
that was the whole point of fo1st...

🤔

They need to just add the keypad as a standalone switch you can stick on any wall and link to a powered door. (Preferably without running an ugly-ass wire from it.)

When I played NW last night after I died, I was “watching” my lone alive teammate, he was underwater shooting. I thought he was an idiot and logged out...but now I see that’s a new glitch.  Boooo
---
yeah, they taste the best
---
Obviously any ghoul slayer's weapon is going to be ideal down there. And you're gonna want a whole lot of Rad-X and Radaway.
---
Oh great this is good info though (not to use it, it's a cheap move)
---
Oh so most of the enemies are ghouls? Good to know, thanks. Many Glowing?
---
Well, I'm just glad that they had the wisdom and humility to realize that they were wrong rather than doubling down the way some people would. Some companies just try to force consumers to want what they have to offer. The fact that they're responding appropriately is encouraging.
---
Pretty sure intelligence doesn't affect scrap returns? Does it?
---
Do you have a semi-scientific source on the effects of Luck?
---
Yeah, after about 1,000 hours of gameplay I've mostly set it down while playing other games (Warframe, and more recently The Outer Worlds), but I'm eager to get back into it when Wastelanders hits. I've had many, many, many happy hours playing Fallout 76. I look forward to more once the game expands its scope.
---
the on game music is great..
---
Why would you pay lmao
---
I hope we can drive one but yours is my close second
---
I thought they removed budget requirements for pets a few patches ago?
---
I pay for things I enjoy. I treat myself. I ask a lot of myself in the real world so I have no issues indulging in what I like
---
You know, it's been a while since I've been down there, and I can't remember off the top of my head if there's many glowing ones or not. Either way, I'm sure you can shuffle around your perk cards once you're down there and see what the practical realities are.
---
Well then you are obviously an achiever and collector and those aspects of a game is your terminology of fun playtime. To me that makes no sense because the only reason why i play such games are the social aspects(roleplay) and exploration(story, world).
---
 If they sell you stuff to fullfill your dreams of the perfect collection with a membership programm, go for it. Again for me and many other the membership is a waste of money and a completly wrong marketing strategy just to get money from a specific kind of playerbase. 
---
 I would much rather pay for a fully sized dlc with huge story and world improvents than a monthly sub for a again for me infinite inventory.
---
I've been writing it few times already but I'll do it again:
---
\- caps are worthless, all are static spawns in the asylum and you can get them on 1-2 runs through the fort.
---
\- below prices are approximate and are estimated on rarity, but may differ depends of seller/buyer.
---
White dirty/Withered - worthless
---
White Clean - up to 500 caps
---
Brown - up to 1k
---
Blue - up to 3k
---
Green - up to 5k
---
Pink - up to 10k
---
Yellow - up to 12k
---
Forest - up to 20k
---
Red - up to 70k or trade only.
---
The attainment of resources is the foundation of the game. The foundation of the game shouldn’t be limited unless 1. Unlimited resource collection doesn’t exist (it does) or 2. The game is free to play. 
---
If you play the game for the social aspect and exploration. Do you not loot? Are you not collecting. Of course you are because that IS the game
---
Charged on the 21st and still waiting on my atoms.
---
Agreed. This is one of my favorite events, but I had to group with a few people to get the top tier rewards. It's impossible to form groups now and then trigger the event. The few times I do see it pop up no one even bothers with it.
---
I put all common outfits that I don’t scrap into my “free” vending machine.  Even then some outfits don’t move.
---
The wall to the sides of the door
---
It blooms only at nights, so fast travel to Crevasse Dam, turn around and go to the Dyer Chemical. On the right you see small river (and usually 2 Gulpers) - you'll see blooms from far away, since they shine in darkness. Usually it's around 5-6 along the river banks (twice with appropriate perk card).
---
Awesome info thanks
---
Thanks!  I swear I did a search on the feed and didn’t see anything.
---
Do u mean you all gathered specific maps before heading for hunt?250 maps of same spot??how dude?
---
Thanks I just was heated in the moment. It will happen again for sure with new issues, but hey...it's how we learn through blocks and overcoming novel scenarios or challenges. Ultimately a fantastic game, but given my weakest personality characteristic is patience, this is really "difficult" for me to focus and enjoy. I struggle alot with auditory attention and processing stuff, so I get easily agitated simply trying to navigate the FO world in groups, between groups, between group and discord, discord only and not in game, its really really exhausting for me. But I still love it and it teaches me alot about what I'm interested in with work and I gain insight to growth in my weaknesses. Thanks for saying your comment though
---
This, I like this. PVPer can be raiders, mutants or feral ghouls and so on. So I can haul ass if I see one of them.
---
Did u ever play any Singleplayer Version Before? With Mods and Stuff? The core mechanic of Bethesdas Version of Fallout or even any Elder Scroll Game is the Immersion into the Gameworld, the feeling as if you actually are in this world. Fallout 76 is exactly the same with the only difference that the new component player interaction is the core focus of this games immersion. Looting is usually just a tiny tool to get to  to understand the world better. For example you cant build a house without collecting wood. After you built your house you usually try to improve it and even try to find a more userfriendly place so other people can visit it and interact with it. 
---
All of that are different aspects of the game. Dont know if you are familiar with the Bartle-Test, if not i really can advise you to read something to this topic and maybe you are doing the test for yourself. In short the test classifies MMO players into 4 aspects and 4 different kinds how they approach a multiplayer game.  
---
To summarize this, just because YOU think collecting stuff, and paying monthly for the infinite inventory is the core aspect of this game and that it makes the most sense and fun, doesnt mean that a PVP player, or Storylover thinks the same. Again, i see no fun in horting trash for no reason. Maybe to buid a base or sell it that makes somewhat sense, but thats not what Fallout is about Dude.
---
You and I are playing two different games. See, this game I play you have to collect lead and steel for ammo, which you need constantly you can never have enough of. Screws, springs, gears, and aluminum for repairing weapons and since this isn’t a sight seeing game it’s a shooter rpg you repair constantly so you can never have enough of the components. Ballistic fiber, plastic, all help to repair armor because again you aren’t just taking a hike through Appalachian mountains you are constantly fighting all these things in the game I’m playing are core components to actually playing this game. Without these components the game can’t be played and having as much as possible is a very good thing.
---
I'll certainly give it some thought thank you
---
Is the game still trash?
---
When you go there with character that have this quest (pick up strangler bloom) active it will bloom them on that server then you can use all your 5 characters to collect them and your friend can do the same, remember to equip green thumb
---
There is litterly no point in joining any faction atm imo... The factions just exist
---
If you look at Adventure mode as a competitive game, transferring supplies from a character that has a much greater ease with obtaining said supplies can definitely be seen as cheating, and shouldn't be as simple as popping something in a special chest at your camp. At the moment, however, it's as easy as dropping something for a friend, relogging, and picking it back up. Adventure isn't all that competitive though, and it seems to be more productive to just work on already-high-level characters, so there isn't that much use for the practice (unless you just want a different build or level faster, idk). People are still people though, and if they believe they can achieve an advantage over other players or mobs by exploiting the game - they will try.
---
So, it's possible, and it's happening, I just don't think it should be a feature of the game. It's an exploit, it should stay an exploit. I don't know how they would even do it, but Bethesda has every right to remove it if they want.
---
Cheers, making a new character as we speak lol.
---
[This Google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4sA-lJt2lV5r4NjkGNgyVUGNwjRMLN-ishup58v_Qs/edit#gid=0) is somewhat outdated and lacks scout and wood armor, but otherwise gives a good overview of the armor sets in FO76. [This one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17NwpXnPBzeT4Gd--3qi-ejEC46--48qtbbQdDyZrGOQ/edit#gid=0) includes wood and scout armors but is also somewhat outdated (over-repairing no longer has any influence on armor stats, e.g.)
---
Check the train station vendors, or those in Whitespring, they frequently sell the plans. Also the bot at Grafton station may sell the more advanced mods (deep pocketed, ultra light, etc.). It seems quite possible that your level does matter. Although to be honest, if you need the armor only for yourself, it might be enough to know the light armor anyway, since that is just as good (and cheaper) for scrapping and learning the mods, while in the late game you will use legendary armor.
---
While the Queens death stops her from breeding for more Scorchbeasts, we still havnt killed all of them at that point.  
---
We got a working vaccine, which stops the spread of the scorched plague between humans.   
---
The goal after the queens death is still kill all Scorched and Scorchbeasts, basically the real cleanup starts then.
---
I do hope we get more queen like bosses with Wastelanders but i also hope we dont get to see the queen anymore because that would not make much sense.
---
We definitely need 2 versions of adventure mode with Wastelanders, old and new.
---
Just don’t craft radshield on the guy with quest ;) you can pick up flowers even tho one will be marked as quest item and quest will progress to craft radshield, after this flower will spoil quest will revert to pick up strangler bloom.
---
Meh just don't pick it up. You don't really need it once your camp is built. As long as you have enough to repair weapons... even that is questionable since you get so many repair kits from queen.
---
I really hope so as well. But at launch I was certain that they'll do a NMS with 100% certainty. I also expected that the road to NMS-like redemption would be apparent a year after launch. This time has passes and while the game is a lot better, there's tons of non-content related bullshit that I can't say the game has better reputation than at launch... So now I feel that my hopes for a redemption have probability like 60-70%, maybe a bit higher after seeing the update...
---
Yeah, that's the one thing that pissed me off about Fallout 1st and tips it into p2w (no atom shop isn't p2w).
---
The tent is very convenient but it's the Infinite scrap that hurts for me.
---
I've been saying this from the start!
---
We'll have to see I'm hoping they do as it's still a fun game all things considered 
---
That and I'm not level 100 yet lol my main is level 82
---
I would like to help. I'm level 100 and something. When I was level 30-40 I was on a team with a dude, he ran off and launched a nuke. I got the quest completed message. So now I don't have quest markers to do it myself.
---
The night thing is false. 
---
While most of the time I have collected them it was night, I have collected them during the day as well.
---
Ye i'm expecting it around the same time as Wastelanders.But i wouldn't hold my breath...i really don't care if it's on Bethesda launcher.As long as i can play,it's fine by me
---
Hey okay!! Add me as a friend! I need to go grab a new keycard real quick but I'll happily go launch a nuke with you. I still need to revive an ally to get my backpack :)
---
It's the sort of game mechanic that used to be pretty standard in free to play games but now is also disturbingly common in full priced AAA titles as well:
---
Create a problem; sell the solution.
---
When you are running around the mire, on the left hand top side of the screen it will pop up something verdant season in the mire. If this pops up and it's night time then go to dyer chemicals. It doesn't always work but when they do spawn, with green thumb I can generally get enough to cover me til the next bloom.
---
Well, I can't confirm this, since I've been collecting it during the night only, never been there at the day to collect the flowers.
---
Fallout has always been a game the heavily emphasizes picking up loot and junk and fashioning something useful with it. Adding mechanics like weapon and armor degradation adds to those game mechanics of picking up junk to maintain your equipment. And God forbid you want to build a nice player home. You now have to collect junk for that.
---
The Scapbox is a solution to a problem of Bethesda's own making.   Inventory caps may have been needed early on to keep thing stable, but at this point they've got it figured out... and instead of issuing a bug fix, they've put that solution behind a paywall.  Why?  Because they know that having to play without it makes the game more tedious, and people will pay for convenience.  A lot of games are pulling this lately... intentionally making things grindy or otherwise a pain in the butt (effectively artificially crippling players) so people will be heavily enticed to buy thing to make them less grindy and annoying.
---
As a sub I also agree. Lock the tent behind a sub? Sure. Special outfits and skins? Absolutely. The scrap box should be for everyone though. Its just to important to the game play loop of the game.
---
I didn't even know that the "night time only" was thing until about two weeks ago when I got in to a discussion with someone here who was debunking myths, the two involving Strangler Blooms being, "Heart of the Swamp" and "At night Only"
---
At the time, I had only managed to collected them during Heart of the Swamp (But not every time), and as mentioned didn't know that "at night" was a thing as I had already collected them during the day. They showed me a video proving that Heart of the Swamp wasn't needed, and it happened to be during the day. Then just by irony, I was on that night after work and found them blooming, during day time (nothing new for me) with no Heart of the Swamp event (I was looknig to do Queen of the Hunt and FT's to Dyer as it was close by to a site)
---
70k lmao
---
I pretty much do what is said already or just server hope till i find them blooming.
---
Personally I don't care about outfits and still have over 3k atims from in game I rarely spend. Tried private servers with friends many times and it's nice to get more legendaries, more loot etc. but gets boring lol.
---
So what would I be paying for? All the junk I want? That's it. I managed making a new character over a year ago with 400 stash space, got a little better with 600 them 800 but I can still manage so no thanks.
---
I still play a couple hours almost every day hunting legendaries nuking killing queens lol but not spending anymore money for stuff they should have done from the start.
---
Absolutely yes if you have a heavy build and the right perks. I have a chromed Furious Explosive Minigun I call "Grandmaster Flash". It turns foes into minced meat.
---
The same thing for ESO. Really hard to not play that game not subbed for the craft bag.
---
Metal+leather is even better, the leather limbs have so high ER and almost the same DR as combat (32-77 vs. 35-45) that you can mix them with a metal chest and have both resistances higher overall. However, most anything that gives both DR and ER above 200 overall is good, and other factors might also be important, like legendary effects, mods, durability, and weight (scout armor in particular can be very light with the ultra light mod).
---
Or maybe needless whining about shit most people don't care about is bound to attract downvotes no matter the subreddit?
---
I've heard it happens when you click get revenge too fast after you die.
---
Cool. I'm at work now, Will be home tonight. My time zone is gmt +2. I'll be on at about 18:00
---
I also prefer actual blocking instead of the ''parry'' system we have, specially considering that this is an online game and the latency associated with it. Afaik this game still uses some version of the Creation Engine(same one used for Skyrim where you could block), so it's not technically impossible to add.
---
There's plenty of advice out there, just use search or google
---
If that's too hard, then this has helped me:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/
---
Now you've said that I quite like the idea of a Santa Deathclaw haha.  It would be nice to see some towns decorated, maybe a mission where a Santa suit is awarded.
---
yes thats it, to craft weapons you need the weapon blueprints, ressources and the respective perk to do so
---
mods are (with some exceptions) learned by breaking down weapons
---
if you break down a weapon (no matter what level or mods are on the weapon) you have a chance to unlock mods for this weapon type
---
for energy weapon blueprints id say hit the brotherhood vendorbot in watoga i think he sells the plans for laserpistols/rifles
---
Personnally, I like roleplaying. I like how Fo76 is good for this type of play and imo this stash is just... out of it. But I could totally understand the pleasure to just have that whole place.
---
I've had this bug happen on several occasions. Any time teslas or explosive energy weapons are used it seems to happen. I've PvP'd many time with friends for fun and never had it bug out using other weapons.
---
Fireproof perk time
---
Only way I know to fix it is to relog.
---
I thought your name seemed familiar...you were just on the same server as me, lol.
---
I sent you a request, but I’m case you don’t see it, my ign is ThisNonsense. I’ll be happy to pal around with someone whenever I’m on.
---
Yeah I have an explosive laser rifle so that could be it, I usually use my hand made but it was broken at the time that could be it
---
Well said
---
I'm stuck on the quest for launching a nuke, maybe i will use your sevice!
---
There was a green skin for the ranger armor but thats been in for atleast 1 or 2 weeks.
---
Fallout 76 is NOT an MMO. The game was described as rebuilding after the war, Which includes scavenging for junk\\scrap\\useful items etc.. and to try cooperate with the other vault dwellers to help rebuild Appalachia. That is what FO76 is. So yes collecting junk and other items IS what this game is about. We didn't get all those workbenches for nothing, We don't just build our camps for nothing, It's to help rebuild. How are we suppose to do that with such a limited stash.
---
If this were truly an mmo then the world would be bigger and be serving hundreds of players on the same servers\\instances. This is not the case. Battlefield can host up to 64 i believe and that still isn't classed as an mmo. Fallout 76 is at best a 24\\8 player coop.
---
Did 150 maps and got 3 plans yesterday
---
&gt; Bethesda has to have something of value to offer players to keep the game going.
---
I think the problem here is they've really not done well with the atomic shop in general, so I think they wanted to monetize something easy. Something that people will definitely buy into. QoL and pay-instead-of-play are some of the most popular micro-transaction options in many cash shops, but neither of them lend themselves well to a "survival" game, where resources are meant to be scarce/managed.
---
Peasant!
---
No bueno. Well, I guess I'll always have old Fallout games to enjoy whole Hines releases more and more monstrosities...
---
Its just super odd to say "the stash can only handle 600-800 pounds before the server has issues" and then they drop the scrapbox, the thing that will supposedly break the servers with its unlimited weight limit for junk. Are we buying a base game feature for extra? Or a ticking time bomb that'll supposedly break servers?
---
Im not gonna act like im taking any moral high ground but i did buy the subscription for a month just so i can free up my stash, place a tent near venture to farm data quicker and cheaper and get the ranger armor. 
---
But i will stand by the fact that the scrapbox shouldnt be monetised content that you cant use after a subscription is over at all. That shit is preditorial to consumers and (like you said) abusive. 
---
The stash box needs unlimited weight now. Not later not never. Now.
---
Agreed mostly but I don’t like the Med-X addiction and use Formula P instead (-2 CHA -2 LCK).
---
There should be both. Parry to avoid 95% of the dmg and block to avoid 50%.
---
That is a great idea. The button serves bo other function while using a melee so it would be totally possible to make it permanent block. Blocking also doesn't cancel all incoming damage so ot wouldn't be overpower. It would give some value to blocking legendary perks as well. Win,win,win.
---
I'd be happy to be able to wallpaper both sides of the walls
---
Don't support Bethesdas bad decisions and just play the game in its beta like me since the start... You don't need the easy option to enjoy the game
---
Manufacture a problem and then sell a solution.
---
Fo76 is frankly straight up unenjoyable to me after some time and I couldn't figure out why as a guy that put over 200 hours into fo4. Then i realized. This damn inventory management, sucking the fun out of finding anything (not that the finds are that interesting in the first place). The god damn need to stay within the weight limit, which is really, really easy to go over.
---
That is precisely why I always modded this thing in fo4 out and since I can't do that, nor can I fix the unintuitive UI that is always the the thing modders take good care of in Bethesda games...
---
Thanks for the input and perspective. Definitely a lot to consider. Never knew there were people who played the game so differently role playing and pvp to the point that junk isn’t a fundamental part of the game. I wonder how they end up with their costumes they buy off atomic shop in game since they obviously don’t have to first and foremost visit an armor workbench and craft a costume from cloth, gold, and other types of scrap. Or continuously mod their weapons, craft ammo, and repair armor
---
The OP needs to learn how to use the enter key much better, but if you are too lazy or dumb to read all of 3 paragraphs worth of material than you should probably just move along
---
Bog, Mire and Savage Divide for T-Series Plans. Toxic for Raider, I think I got some T-45 Plans from Toxic also (I'm not 100% on that). I haven't been keeping track of how many, but it's been a massive amount, easily hundreds (maybe closer to a thousand) since last December. 
---
-
---
Also get lots of Dense &amp; Deep Pocketed Armor plans, I think Legendary Combat Armor drops too, but again, not 100% on that.
---
Pretty sure there's a few guides on here where folk have taken notes with what they have found, I'll see if I can find you a link!
---
Yes I can confirm too toxic valley maps contain raider plans thanks for info bro i will publish complete guide after all my hunts

Yup! But still worth doing for all the materials from scrapping weapons and armor.
---
Perfect info man ty.its becoming clear for me with you guys informations I didn't find good post about it so I'm gathering info and I will publish good guide after my hunt
---
On bethesda.net, its the latest inside the vault article.
---
I’m talking about the whole thing. The upgrade pack doesn’t seem to work as I look in the workbenches and nothing’s there, no option to craft the outfits and weapon skins
---
It's an old glitch and we report it to Beth every single Patch (see the Unofficial bug roundups).
---
I don't think they can actually fix it. One time 10+ months ago they fixed it so that even the +100 bonus was completely gone and had to hotfix it back to the glitched state.
---
The first screenshots we got were existing locations being changed ie space station? Why would you ever think they would give us a new map? And split the player base?
---
No problem bud! You've got me itching again so I'm gonna do more tonight!
---
Check this out, very very handy information - https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ck3lm7/digging_300_treasure_maps_breakdown_heres_what_i
---
It took me a month to get used to making use of the tent, as i forgot about it most times. Now it is going to go away, i feel a bit loat without it.
---
I wish they would just do the scrap box as an atomshop item, like the collectron etc. It also proves that they have the capacity to do this already and server stability issues was not rhe 100,000's of bits of junk they said.
---
Please let us know about your hunt too☺️and thanks for this link🙏
---
It's short, and easy read, and is really great. The vampires are "classic vampires" that can speak, have a city, and an entire culture. That's what makes it a better metaphor. It isn't about learning to stop killing monsters, but to stop killing people labeled as monsters - and about isolation's effect on the mind. The dog part is much more brief, and sad. 
---
The one thing he mentions almost immediately about how the vampires try to get him out (they know where he lives), is also his downfall. 
---
He is not a doctor. 
---
They did get a lot of the aesthetic of the first half right with the day to day stuff - but completely 100% ignore the ending, and point, of the book.
---
there their they're
---
sorry had to do it...
---
The scrap box is a spit in the face of all fallout fans that stick around fo76. You have to pay subscription for something that should have been included in the release, but they intentionally didn't so they can ask now for your money.  
---
And the people that pay that ridiculous sub, they are the real jokers.
---
Damn fate devided us dude:(one day we can hunt maps together
---
I frequently reference this guide.

---
To make matters worse they had a much more thought provoking original ending to the movie but scrapped it
---
Is it true that the divide ones can drop shielded raider plans?
---
The amounts I wrote are approximate from the market (at least on PC). When the supply is low and demand is high the price can skyrocket - there were situations people traded legacies for red asylum.
---
I thought alcohol was AGI?
---
Broadsider is pure fun lol
---
They should make it like Rust where objects such as walls can clip certain distances into terrain, rocks and trees etc, would make building way better
---
Thanks man
---
I'm on Xbox 1
---
Praise Atom, this shall happen!! Good luck captain!
---
Elder Scrolls Online pioneered the bottomless storage concept via subscription and it too is the main reason why I would subscribe, and have, for a month at a time here and there.
---
Scout =  45dr/30er per limb, chest 85 dr/ 65er.                         Total = 265 dr / 185 er 
---
(insert insulated backpack, refractor perk or grounded mutation here and you're good lol)

Heavy Bos Combat =  35dr/45er per limb, chest 86dr/86er           Total 226 dr/266 er
---
Most balanced of all armor types in game but good luck finding an entire HEAVY LEGENDARY set with the exact legendary effects you want. Same thing with any other armor type, like leather and metal that have light sturdy and heavy...
---
Anybody else is welcome to post this for the other armor types and your reasons for preferring them. I'm curious thanks!
---
Unfortunately i can't justify 18 dollars a month for the subscription. 
---
It's absolutely insane. I was OK with the idea of a subscription but damn that price is atrocious.
---
As for the private server stability... well, there is none. I used to crash twice a day, at least. The first few days was ok. It just got bad
---
Ad victoram brother
---
Depends on opinion, I’ve personally liked it since the start but a lot of people still don’t like it.
---
I have PS4 and mine did not auto renew.
---
The Ghouls are evolving in to AI Super Ghouls.
---
I have noticed lately when i pull out my Sniper Rifle, they instantly know what comes next and scatter.
---
Chameleon might as well be called "Super Ghoul Come Kill Me".
---
Another thing they should incorporate about the Fallout 1st subscription is the ability to still have your vendor avail to others while on a private server.
---
But yes, the scrap box is a sweet bonus for sure
---
My subscription ran out a couple of days ago.. I would actually like to resubscribe.. but recently I can’t play the game for longer than an hour without atleast 1 crash if not multiple, untill I can see an improvement not only will I be not renew my membership, but I will be taking a well needed break from this game
---
Yup, only critter that doesn't have a set location is chicken.
---
Shame, would have been fun :)
---
They did :) I added a pet at max budget a few times now
---
Thanks for the comment,  
---
**Questions(s):**   
---
\-Any photos?  
---
\-When does it clip? (Running, crouching, etc)
---
Yeah, that's the main thing keeping me from coming back.
---
Peace and Fucking. ;)
---
It doesn’t, I build max budget builds on all 5 characters at all sorts of levels and it’s all the same :(
---
doesn't matter, false advertising = fraud
---
So because you never heard of it, it doesn't happen? There's post on Reddit about it, I experienced it myself. Any FPS peaks higher than 140 will cause freezes in smaller cells. 
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/duo6vt/cant\_move\_within\_closed\_areas/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/duo6vt/cant_move_within_closed_areas/)  .. has a video attached as well.. 
---
Capping at monitor refresh externally will not help in this situation since it's the client/server communication (dtls - udp) stream that can't keep up. Update tick = UDP tick = bad design but not much we can't do about it.
---
This problem doesn't occur for most people since not everyone is running around with 2080ti's - but it's reproducible by just lowering video settings on a high end card and running w/o vsync.
---
it's not about ptw, it's about cosmetics vs non-cosmetics
---
Someone made a video testing this a million years ago, the wood and corrugated steel are very weak compared to the brick and steel but there is almost no difference between brick/steel or wood/corrugated :)
---
Timing my actions is hard, I just wanna hold to win 😭
---
I dream of Wastelanders fixing the broadsider, I would love to see what it is supposed to do.
---
North east of the Map, just north of the Farris wheel , they small cliff hills there and there is some great spots especially with little ponds you can have and be on a cliff admiring the views at the same time in your camp. All the wood you can want to start off a build  all the wild food , great area to start and have amazing views. To top it off you get to have the big water machines there if you find the right spot and collect lots of water. Hope you find what your looking for , cheers.
---
Hope you have better luck than me. Decided to launch one for the first time in a few months last night. I've heard about the bug where explosive weapons aren't destroying mainframe cores anymore and wanted to see if it was happening for me. Nope couldn't destroy them, tried multiple time before I started pulling them by hand.
---
Apparently that caused another big because I pulled every core by hand and the laser grid refused to drop. Spent 20 minutes checking every terminal bank over and over hoping I had missed one.  Nope, I had pulled every last one.  Finally gave up and left.
---
Long story short, don't try and blow them up.  Pull them all by hand from the get go so you don't end up like me lol.
---
I never said it doesn't happen because I haven't experienced it, I just simply said I personally have not really heard of the issue. Most likely due to it being rare, I didn't mean to dismiss your problem. 
---
I apologize for my poor phrasing.
---
Please read through this. Sounds like you have a corrupted file or a stored file in cache that is messing the game up.

---
Ps4 hardware is such junk
---
No worries. Apology accepted :)
---
I saw this issue a few times pop up and most of the times it is just players that apply ini tweaks, don't read nor care what they actually change and run into this problem if they spend their xmas cash on hardware - and yes - it is rare since it requires hefty hardware or slightly less hefty but on potato quality graphics level settings :x
---
Well I guess I will try this, I am definitely going to miss my photos tho😭😭
---
I have tried to figure out a pattern myself and miserably failed.
---
Said that you could blame laziness, I could always check on the .esm what conditions govern the bloom.
---
However the only place I have ever encountered it is one the banks of the stretch of river by the chemical plant. I have seen pods in many places around The Mire but never in bloom.
---
I just do as you suggested and when I am starting to get low on RadShield I server hop until I find a server that has it.
---
As it turns out although day or night doesn't seem to matter they are significantly easier to spot at night.
---
Ive done a fair amount of trading...not a lot by any means. But i have some god tier weapons that ive found myself. That being said ive had the game for a year, and basicly done nothing but farm legendarys after i hit level 50.....i really dont find much else to do in game. 
---
 Not everyone needs to be the best equiped pvp' er in Fallout. Ive got the bloodieds and the anti armors...blah blah....but i also have some other stuff that shreds in PVE, and its not a legacy gattling plasma. Just saying, everyone likes toys, but dont get tunnel vision
---
There was recently a video expkaining God made. Happens when a player's body is destroyed on death. Leading known cause is energy weapons for turning people into dust or goo, but bloody mess does the same when it shreds a body. Bleeding damage kills em. Also they cannot fast travel, so have someone open there camp and throw a foundation on them, can't be destroyed and can't fast travel. They either log out or you can hold them in place to use a nuke to kill em lol.
---
Jesus what the hell has become of this sub.
---
So you are "all for" microtransations and "boosts"(pay2win mechanics) in the game? Are you forgetting you paid money to get this game, and you are willing to pay out more money for the rest of the game??
---
Dude. It should have been available at launch. 
---
What if... Ya know. They made a playable game AT LAUNCH   - I know it's a crazy idea! /s
---
Fallout 1st shouldn't be a thing. People shouldn't have to pay fucking microtransations, for a half assed glitchy incoherent hellfest of a game. It still is this way AFTER A YEAR SINCE LAUNCH.
---
Anyone who defends microtransations in this game is part of the problem that encourages companies to do this.
---
Big sad.
---
Yea...I felt the same way man. Gave a good opportunity to take some awesome new shots though!
---
Either way good luck! I know it's super frustrating.
---
I will definitely chime in a comment on how my situation goes over the next couple of days :)
---
I ran into this when I did the mission.  From what I remember a letter spawns in either 2 or 3 different places and you can actually pick up the wrong one that doesn't match the other paperwork and the DMV will not accept it, sending you looking for the correct letter.  Check the map for other circled areas where it may be.  Too much like the real life DMV lol.
---
I grabbed one right by the capital building and the DMV did not take it. Ended up finding the right one somewhere in downtown Charleston.  
---
Also for me the quest did not checkpoint and if you leave it you are starting all the way over from the very beginning.  I assume it's like that for everyone so I'd recommend making sure you have time to commit to finishing.
---
And watch people shoot it and blow it up.
---
Feel free! Just figured I would share my experience that I had. I'll add I had this same issue with same correction on FO4 which I found from asking in their forums. The guy who did that write up was super detailed on why and how it happens but basically said it's when the copies overwrite for updates sometimes code gets mixed and this is furthered by the chache not clearing normally on a PS4. 
---
Please share your experience though. Hopefully it helps!
---
I agree. As a current workaround, I've put four Perfectly Preserved Pies in a display case, with the Greek Letter Set 'Pi' on the front.
---
A single-item glass dome would be amazing (for the robot models as well), but I think this looks a bit cool too.
---
I saw someone with a double wall and the wood paneling on both sides the other day.
---
Agreed with the roof paneling.
---
Good to know. Thanks
---
TESO does the same thing. Fortunatley, right now I have the money to pay for it, but as soon as I cant pay it anymore...
---
Yeah I certainly will! Thanks 🙏
---
I just tamed my 3rd deathclaw and I don’t have wasteland whisperer.
---
The thing is realized is that no one should of purchased fallout 1st in the first place.
---
Same. I just wish they never introduced 1st. I really enjoyed the game, but I don't think they can fix the bad reputation that the game has grownth.
---
No. You don’t need to aim anything, but you do have to approach the creature.
---
Might play the game again for that.
---
Same
---
I agree and like the idea.  It always bothered me there was no way to break ammo down or exchange it.  I'd be fine with a 10:1 exchange ratio!!
---
I used to drop ammo all the time feeling like it was such a waste.  My new solution has been to start using it, crazy idea lol.  It's actually been kind of fun using all sorts of weapons I spent 100 levels avoiding like the plauge.  I recommend trying it!  Once I see a have a lot of some ammo type I grab one of the good weapons I have stashed away for that type and go to town burning through it.  Get to shoot things and not worry about having to craft more.
---
The ash pile will be exactly were you killed it, if it was in the air ash pile is levitating there
---
I hopped servers a few times still didn’t show me the button to collect it. I am on pc btw
---
Never seen levitating ash pile. Sounds like some kind of cool new feature.
---
I saw some people posting screen shots of possible UFO in fallout unfortunately those are just ash piles
---
This is a totally bs list my man lol
---
I'll launch a nuke for you for free. All I need is 1 keycard lol
---
Yes vendor bot Phoenix in watoga may have mods but should at least have the plans for the guns themselves so you can craft and scrap them to unlock the mods. 
---
Also gatling laser and ULTRACITE lasers are different weapons with different mods check which one you have lol!
---
Those days sucked hard
---
Thanks for this, submitted and hope you don't mind the citation!

[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup | Patch 15.0 | 11/19/209 Fallout 1st &amp; Atomic Shop love](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dywtko/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/)
---
yeah I was so excited when I realized there was more to watoga because those parking gareage entrances are everywhere and its begging for expansion
---
Disagree. In fallout 1-2 if a region had thematic emptiness it had immersion emptiness as well. In fallout 3-NV games, junk was just for more immersion and maybe little caps. With fallout 4 junk/scrap/looting became a very important part of your character progression. In 76 it has become a core game mechanic and then artificially handicapped so that you could be sold refs and unlimited scrap storage. 
---
I don't understand why you cannot see such an essential part of the 76 experience that Bethesda has walked of f.
---
Don’t mind at all. Thank you for tracking all the issues.
---
Not at all. Pretty accurate from my experience on the Reddit PC market
---
I'd actually prefer having new, better (or buffed) weapons for the heretofore unused ammo types (.44 and fusion cells, mostly) to such a solution. But failing that, yes, an ammo exchange, even at rather unfavourable exchange rates, would be preferable to the current situation where I simply dump certain ammo types into the nearest suitcase because there is no use for them.
---
Oh god no. I loathe the grind of a free to play game. 
---
I'm still waiting for Fallout 76 to update a sort of "retirement" patch. Where anyone who owns the game can continue playing private, moddable worlds, for free, and the game is released on Steam etc for anyone to purchase for ~$20 and are able to play private worlds, mods, etc to their hearts content.
---
Servers should become player based. i.e. the player with the best internet connection hosts the server.
---
This is my perspective as an avid single-player gamer. I just want to experience Fallout 76 on completely my own terms.
---
Got home early. Ready to nuke something?
---
I occasionally use these machines to buy scrap components like springs and screws. Bet you didn't know they sold that too huh? Nope. Cuz pretty much no one uses them as you said. They need a higher purpose.
---
This is EXACTLY why I stopped playing...I collect junk as part of my play style, I was then having to do inventory management that was taking me away from the game. I am an adult, with a full time job and a family...my time is valuable...so is my hard earned cash. When I play my games I need to be playing ...not managing inventory. I really like the game but from a lifestyle time management perspective, as of yet I am unable to justify playing this great game when there are so many others that I can actually be playing...not managing inventory.
---
Yes sure! Did you send me a friend request? It said I got one but then it instantly disappeared
---
Yongyea said that long ago. It’s a collecting game. Without 1st, fallout is a collecting game where you get punished for collecting. Its necessary to the game
---
I’m on a lot on weekends and every other Monday. GT same as here. 
---
👍🏼
---
I don’t thinks so but roofs and ground floors take up the most.
---
Also the 2x2 standard floor is less budget heave than a 1x2 floor
---
You'll enjoy it.
---
It's more fun in groups, as the grind gets very dull solo.
---
Unexpected cannibalism
---
"If God wanted them to live, he would not have created me."
---
This... is exactly what they’re saying? The “premium feature” of the scrap box is more of an essential bug fix than an actual upgrade. It needed to be free to use for all players, not locked behind another ridiculous pay wall.
---
8 months ago. Stop lying to people
---
Oh yes it is very good fun. Grab a mic, make some friends and have a blast.
---
Two shot is a pretty bad prefix, but people still recommend it and overvalue it.
---
Intelligence improves the chances of learning a mod from the weapon/armor you scrapped.
---
But don't you see the increase when you equip the weapon? For instance, a Junkie's revolver causes 124 when in your stash. You take it and it still shows 124. But when you equip it, it goes 180. Like bloodied.
---
It's so disappointing. I leave Reddit for weeks to months at a time, and Everytime I come back I look here to see if things are better... And the answer is always no :(
---
A BE Minigun is pretty overpowered.
---
I guess both Baronik and I must be at the wrong market place then. Have a nice day, friendly person on Reddit :)
---
I’ve only got two PA plans, raider power helm and T51 left arm. I did a total of 173 maps. I keep a careful log of treasure maps and loot.
---
Thanks for your info man🙏
---
Really?! I've never heard that!
---
There is apparently already an ammo bulk mechanic coming to the game with the wastelanders' dlc according to datamines and off-hand mentions in their posts.
---
Hmm...earn Atoms in game. That's a pretty good idea...
---
You ever look at the challenge window to see what you get for doing them by chance?
---
ESO players have been saying the same thing about the Crafting Bag since it launched. It'll never happen. They know it's the biggest value they can possibly provide in their subscription service.
---
Hey, don't cross knowledge domains :)
---
I am a fan of vi/vim over emacs.
---
Creation club credits aren't even related to f76
---
That's one way to do it.
---
Will send again
---
Here’s a tip that helped me with that same issue:
---
Clean the cache off your PS4 : 
---
Power down your PS4 . 
---
Wait till the lights are completely off
---
Then pull out the power cord from the back of your PS4 and leave it out for 30 seconds 
---
( wait a minute )
---
Plug it back in and turn it back on and your cache will be clean. 
---
That should drastically help you with blue screen errors. 
---
The problem with the PS4 is it can’t handle fallout 76 as it was most definitely poorly optimized. 
---
I’m on the PS4 pro and now I go most days with out a single blue screen where as before I had 4 or 5 a day. 
---
Goodluck!
---
So, I do actually block using the in game block system.  It's got that timing thing but it's fine.  My only issue is that the AI doesn't use the same system.  I've had mole miners and super mutants walk up to me guarding and never stop until I show them my back.  They can do it so I know full well it's possible for us to, but for whatever reason we don't have the option to.
---
A parry and guard system would be great.  If anyone quotes the system they use, Elder Scrolls has a guard system, so it's even proven possible.
---
Oh what’s the credit thing called for 76
---
It was $9.99 at Best Buy when I was there last night.
---
Atoms, and we do earn them in game
---
I climbed a rubble pile that was like 10' below were it disintegrated and saw nothing in the air or on and around it unfortunately.
---
I am skeptical still of its quality. I have yet to see anything making it worth the wait. 
---
1) Other games of this scale add dozens upon dozens of new enemies and models in the amount of time they have been working on this. My bet is 4 new enemy models or a equally pathetic count
---
2) theyre history of addons since fallout 4
---
3) they havent shown much at all. Nothing getting excited worthy.
---
4) need multiple nee world bosses as a minimum. No sign of this.
---
5) fallout 1st greed
---
&gt;I would pay Atoms to buy a StashBox
---
Please do not say this. This isn't any better than paying a subscription for the stash box.
---
It's been a long time since I dug treasure maps with a low-luck character, but at the time I was only getting plans 50% of digs. I switched over to unyielding gear, and started getting a plan 90% of my digs. Perhaps they changed it, since people seem to think luck doesn't mater anymore, but it used to be a large and obvious effect. If your luck was low, you wouldn't get some of the categories: Plan, mod, weapon + ammo, armor, aid, and junk.
---
Spring Cleaning? It was also a terrible implementation that broke precombines and tanked performance.
---
Thankyou, I had someone else describe a similar solution and I definitely am going to be trying them 🙏
---
I’m actually redownloading it rn after being away from it for months. I was just thinking about the controversies and thought of the atom shop. So apparently you can earn them in game but I’m assuming it’s not a lot you earn cause Bethesda lol.
---
Did you get it?
---
Ah I’m actually redownloading the game. I haven’t played since they dropped that battle Royale update.
---
If I remember correctly, I've used them once, in 800 hours, when I was feeling way too lazy to get ammo out of a stash for a side melee character during the Camp McClintock range mission. I consider it like having heat for your car when you live in Florida: more than likely you'll never need it, but the very, very rare case you would need it, it's nice to have.
---
definitely use emotes for this - when you see the legendary, emote 'follow me' and after everyone tags it emote 'thumbs up' 
---
i've been in groups that really did this well! and i've been in groups where johnny-one-shot pissed everybody else off. i just get on the mic and ask kindly to let everyone tag before finishing it, sometimes it helps.
---
In addition to the 20 hour window, you can also ‘refill’ their cap pool when you purchase something from them, at a 4-to-1 ratio. 
---
Meaning that when you buy, say, a 40 cap item the pool refills 10 caps. 
---
If you’re planning to buy anything from the bots (like plans or recipes for example), sell your stuff first to get them down to zero, then buy one item, then sell more stuff. If you buy first then sell you’ll miss out on some caps.
---
This can be especially helpful for high cost plans like PA mods or serum recipes if you still need any. 
---
To maximize your selling price, get your effective Charisma up to 20; this will get you 25% of the item’s base price. 
---
To minimize your buying price, get your Charisma up to 25; this will get the price down to 175% of the base price. 
---
I hope that helps!
---
Nothing new for me, just like the “craft bag” in ESO; its the main reason I am a subscriber. The atoms and tent are just a bonus.
---
Yes, but you can't put any more scrap into it, only take out what's already in it.
---
I have said before that I feel this is extremely unlikely.  I feel that since Steam has a return policy that is actually functional, it would be unlikely that Fallout would release on their platform.
---
Australians fought in court just to get a refund and it took them nearly a year.  Setting precedent for a refund on any store front would go against their current practices.
---
I hope it does come to Steam, but I’ll have to see it to believe it.
---
Yes, however you won't be able to place junk in it when your membership expires.
---
with those atoms i would buy the shadow prime power armor skin, its really cool
---
&gt; To summarize this, just because YOU think collecting stuff, and paying monthly for the infinite inventory is the core aspect of this game and that it makes the most sense and fun, doesnt mean that a PVP player, or Storylover thinks the same.  
---
The point is that regardless of your personnal opinion, it IS still an important part of the game. Just because you don't care about it doesn't mean it's not important.   
---
&gt; thats not what Fallout is about Dude. 
---
You're thinking of fallout 1-2-3. Fallout 76 is a very different game.
---
This is very true, and the main reason I stopped playing. Even if the bugs were still there and the servers still lagged, I would be able to deal with all that. The constant inventory management and struggle with inventory space and weight eventually got overbearing and it made the game start to feel like a job instead of enjoyment. I made it into the level 200’s and have most of the good TSE and BE weapons, so I did play quite a bit, and if they were to bring unlimited junk to non subscribers somehow I would definitely pay atoms for it and play again. That would be revolutionary in my opinion.
---
Yes and everything you have in it stays in it but you cannot “ add “ to it anymore until you renew.
---
Cheers!
---
There's daily and weekly challenges to earn atoms. Most people have never bought atoms because they just earn all of them in game.
---
Or head to Aronholt (I think I spelled that wrong) farm to get the cranberries there... it top left of map near WV Lumber Co. Avoid the bog for now if you aren't quite ready... but get those cranberries, make some cobbler, then head to the bog to kill the baddies with more XP.
---
I completely agree. The problem though is if they give it access to everyone then fallout 1st members will complain that because everybody has it that they lost part of there subscription. So they will start nagging about partial or complete refunds.
---
Oh, and bloody mess!
---
How does it ‘suck’ to only have to go to one vendor to sell 1400 caps worth of stuff?
---
How does it ‘suck’ being able to sell an item valued at over 200 caps to a vendor?
---
This is one of the few actual improvements to the game and it’s illogical for anyone to complain about it. 
---
There used to be seven vendor factions, each with a cap pool of 200. Why would you want to have to go to seven different bots to sell your stuff?

Or they could slash cosmetic prices so I don't have to pay $5 for 1 skin for 1 weapon or $8 for 1 outfit. Then maybe other players and I might want to buy shit without feeling ripped off. Then maybe they could focus on making good content, updates, and fixes to get some good will with the player base so that players would be more inclined to support a game where the devs actually care about them more than their shareholders. Don't really want to spend more money on the game if I don't see myself playing it in the future, you know? Would be a much better solution in my eyes than blatant p2w, or rather play 2 enjoy, subscriptions and microtransactions.
---
Not a bad idea. Giving players a spot to buy unique ammo that can't be crafted, limited in it's amount to purchase. Instead of .38 sell .357 mag, does 2x damage, but you can only get 30 a day or whatever, and only hold 60 or 90 total. 12ga buckshot to 12ga slug, eliminate the range de-buff. Incorporate FMJ, hollow and AP maybe with 45. And maybe, just maybe, (hint mother #*ck!ng hint Bethesda) we can have our 1911's back. I'd really appreciate some love shown to the pistol category.
---
Make sure you are using full rgb or 4:4:4 color.  Really makes everything pop.
---
I like how OP has no idea obout the game
---
IMHO, there's a pretty simple solution to the whole FO1st clusterfuck.
---
A lot of people (like me) are still extremely salty about being straight-up ripped off and lied to by Bethesda. They said that the game wouldn't be PTW. They said there's be no subscription. The said cosmetic only. They fusking lied. 
---
Now the above, I' be fine with if I hadn't paid quite a lot of the game in the first place. If I had a buggy beta product that I'd been acting as an active BETA tester for for over 1,00 hours of my life, but it was free? Wouldn't blink an eye.
---
So in order to make it right and continue to have a sustainable business model here's what they need to do:
---
Make the game Free To Play. But, before they do, give everyone who bought the original game 6 months of FO1st as thanks for putting up with this bullshit (with the provision f a credit card and ongoing monthly billing after 6 months). That way, in 6 months time, everyone's addicted to the FO1st features and no-one feels salty about it. They'll have a massive increase in their subscriber numbers and will have a MUCH larger number of on-going subscribers.
---
And no-one feels as digitally raped as we all do now.
---
what a beautiful game
---
My secondary character got almost an entire set of T51 plans and he was barely level 100.
---
I think a compromise could be that everyone has * access* to a scrapbox but can only place one or have one in your camp if you are a 1st subscriber.
---
The only thing you get from forest maps is overencumbered.
---
Good idea. Also I'm one of those players who buys fusion cells, if they are at 1 cap each.
---
I can understand your frustrations, but to some degree you’re projecting a desire to hoard junk as if it’s a sentiment universally shared by the player base.
---
Sure, it’s nice to keep all the lead and steel, but I played the game for a whole year with strict junk storage limits.  If I needed more ammo, I went to Lucky Hole.  I play a sniper as a main character, so my ammo efficiency is good.  I lost premium for a couple days after my initial month wore off and got it again specifically for the private world.  The loss of the tent or junk box didn’t bother me, but having to play with obnoxious people again did.
---
After being frugal with my stash weight for so long, it still feels ridiculous to actually save and store bone and fertilizer.  I kept most things in stacks of 20, on the off chance I need ceramic or silver.  If I needed it, I marked it for collection and grabbed what’s required.
---
Personally, 80% of my stash weight has always been dedicated to weapons and armor.  I trade a lot, I keep every legendary for scrip, and I have a handful of backup weapons for specific situations, like a furious auto handmade to use for Meltdown, or to grab all the pylons during Encryptid.
---
Unless they offer a fully weightless stash, which would allow me to build huge collections of legendary gear and keep multiple armor sets on hand for multiple characters, weightless junk is just a minor convenience for the way I play.
---
Yes
---
Waste of money if you ask me. Sorry but the game is only playble, endgame if you get the Fallout 1st sub so you have place to store tour massive bundle of junk and event then. The game gets boring quick...Hope you have more fun playing then i did (Played since beta)
---
I enjoy some of the dynamic terrain like that but it does get annoying. I wish there was a way to sink more pieces into the terrain than just foundations.
---
I play on and off since launch my dude is only level 102 and i'm usually solo and I play with a mixed (high int) build so I don't do uber damage. I enjoy aimless exploration, having a mission or quest is fine but I did enjoy just randomly exploring the game at my own volition, in terms of bethesda releasing half a game and then adding to it over time, I sorta expected this going into it, like any mmo most of them have been fleshed out over time. but I suppose I don't mind the idea of seeing the game world itself evolve over time and not being overwhelmed with a billion path choices. for example if wow released with 3 expansions on top of one another, the original end game wouldn't have time to mature or remain as something worth the time investment.
---
I think there are many many things to consider when trying to make a game and have it be fun and keep it open for additions.
---
I pass through looking for that brotherhood suit with the flight jacket in the train car. And see what Phoenix has for sale.
---
Is it in 4k?   I have a PS4 on a 75 inch 4k.  It looks great but....the graphics are fallout.
---
Thx for telling me that now I can get some and sell them for thousands of caps and have everyone hate me 👍
---
The power armor edition appears to be in stock at Best buy
---
Do you know this question gets asked and answered daily?
---
I actually had no idea about this! I got the costume but not the helmet. No I will have to go look!
---
Thank you!
---
Yes it is. Atoms can be earned in game. 12.99 USD cant.
---
Yeah I love how the game looks except for the textures you have beautiful god rays but mountains that don't load in completely
---
What do u play on I could show u around and help u level
---
Check under social menu.
---
&gt;In 76 it has become a core game mechanic and then artificially handicapped so that you could be sold refs and unlimited scrap storage
---
I have to agree with this, but then they are making business decisions to make income so kind of understand why they did it.
---
God damn those trees look horrible in 4k
---
Dang either your ps4 is bad or your wifi is bad cuz my Ps4 hadn't crashed for over a year
---
I bought a copy for $11 for my wife since my son using my Xbox sharing/family slot
---
Welcome :)
---
If you don’t see it then just server hop
---
Oh, and speaking of love shown to the pistol category, it would be awesome to see the sawed off short barrel, *pistol* gripped shotgun moved to the actual pistol category. Let it benefit from enforcer but why not pistol too, who else really uses the shorty shotty anyways? Give that bad boy a boost. The thing only has a max effective range of 4 feet anyways. Others in the game move categories when altered, laser pistol to rifle, plasma pistol to rifle, etc.
---
Edit.
---
downvote All you want but its true. Look around this sub and more often then not you Will see people reporting bugs, crash etc. If not that its about adding content that BES can and will ask you to pay for RE. Fallout 1st. So there are to many things that the game Still needs (Ingame and the way BES are running Fallout 76). For IT to be called a good or event playble IMO.
---
Itll get downvoted im sure, but am i like the only person that has no issue with the 800lb limit? Like 800lbs stash and 360ish lbs on my character. So all but 1200lbs of storage. I havent had to juggle things around, my box is never over 600lbs even with junk. Like i underatand what people are saying about being full and collecting and whatnot, 
---
Maybe dont have 5 running vending machines? 
---
Maybe stop trying to sell 8 thousand rounds of .38 ammo? Maybe get rid of the 80 missiles youre never gonna use? Maybe stop storing 300lbs of fusion cores that you dont need? 
---
Idk. Thats probably just me, but i dont understand how everyone is NEEDING this scrap box.
---
Yeah I've been on the other side of this
---
I was doing a friendly fight with my friend and he is 3 times my level but I'm stronger than he is. And when I killed him he hit revenge for round 2 and he couldn't do damage to me.
---
It's a display issue but I would call it a bug (surprise!) The game doesn't render ash piles or goo piles or flesh piles from below on the Z axis. It's up there but you can't see it, can't get to it and can't loot it.
---
If you want to 100% loot a scorchbeast don't use an energy weapon.
---
Its more clear on my end the TAA is really blurry at 1080p but at 4k  its less noticeable
---
Cool thanks for the tip :)
---
Don't forget the higher level you are the less things cost in budget expect for defense and lights
---
Don't belive me test it out build until it budget is full on level 2 but no lights or defense (turrents count as defense) and than do the fans with level 100 and you will see you can build alot more with the label 100
---
For a bethesda game the textures are okay but yeah i must agree the textures in this game are very smudgy and blurry but they did a really nice job with the lighting in this game
---
To some extent mounting splitters on laser/plasma pistols/rifles could also move them to shotguns. There is a lot of grey area with those mods, still wishing we could mod pipe revolver with shotgun shells like modded FO4 had. One Day.
---
I fall into that category.  Junk is a means to an end for me, not something to hoard.  Until I could simply stash it all, I grabbed all the lead and steel I could carry, turned it into ammo, and repeated as needed.  The same goes for weapon and armor mods.  I learned where the handmade existed as a static drop, grabbed one a day, learned the mods, applied what I liked to my gun and was done with it.  
---
I understand what it’s like to play a heavy gunner with a thirsty weapon, and you do spend more time with the need to feed it.  I also have a gauntlet melee character that is hardly needs junk resources at all.  There’s a lot of different builds, so your needs may be incredibly different from someone else.
---
Thank you I will have to switch I have the zealots laser gatling 30% increased damage to scorched. I will have to switch to the mini or 50 after the zealot does the brunt of the work.
---
You add it to the weapon or armor at the work bench
---
K the account I play on is A Annette Wiseman (not my account is my mom's cuz she had ps plus(im not a little kid don't worry)
---
That would be good too.  Anything other than a random spawn.
---
I forgot about this store! Guess many people do, so perhaps they are thinking it is rare so charge silly caps for it. 
---
Stands to reason though - some of the plans Pennington in Whitesprings sells were rewards too.
---
Before the box, I always had about 150 of each resource on hand and would bulk and sell anything over that. Once I moved that amount of junk over, my stash was 500lbs less. Having 2/3 of your storage solely for junk is just plain not fun. Every player should be able to keep as many resources as they need on hand and have room for some legendary trade stock/consumables/ammo. The scrap box is the one thing from the subscription I use the most.
---
Sorry to say this but, you guys that still play this game need to be really dumb to only now notice stuff like this. 
---
The fact that only when your precious junk is uncapped behind a ridiculous paywall is when you realize how your guys money is being squeezed explains a lot.
---
I m sory again.
---
So true
---
It is different as I would make a one off purchase for it and use Atoms I earned in the game, no irl money involved, no subscription.
---
I can't stand the noise and I don't use power armor except for occasional runs to Luck Hole.
---
Paying opens a magic portal where little goblins store the junk, so it doesn't cost any server resources !
---
Im getting really bored of this game because the inventory weight... And almost all my friends who bought the game leaved for that reason and I understand it now ( I recommended it to them before bethesda fucked up the game)
---
Haven’t played this game in months and after the news of fallout 1st I don’t think I’ll touch it anytime soon. We should not have to pay for things in the game that should come with the $60 purchase of the game, things that should have been available on launch. Really disappointing for me, especially cause I enjoyed this game a lot even with all the hate it got.
---
That sounds very enterprising actually.
---
I could be wrong but I believe it does, but it isn't noticeable. If I remember right, I boosted my intelligence up and only got 1 or 2 more steel for scrapping an assault rifle. It's not worth the hassle.
---
If you find a mod, you can use it on that weapon/armor, but you haven't learned the mod by doing this.
---
You can only learn new mods for armor/weapons by scrapping weapons/armors, they dont have to have the mod for you to actually learn a specific mod, it's all random i think.
---
We totally need ammo bulking. I like to use weapons that use the less popular ammo types, but they're not worth 1 cap each.
---
There is a market for ammo exchange but because it is sub cap prices it is hard to establish. I always buy all ammo types at ten per one cap, but it is hard to get people to sell to me unless they are hurting for caps. Then they are amazed I drop 4000 caps on them for three minutes of effort as I clear out parts of their stash for them.
---
I have made a variety of ammo sales at my vending machine at one cap each but they are situational and modest quantities. Basically desperate sales. I would love to offer ammo sales at sub cap prices which involves personal interaction, hopefully bulk ammo makes this possible as trade interface requires more trust and time so many players skip it.
---
At the moment I buy ammo for my personal use, my automatic weapons loving character shoots all day long based on my buying thousands of rounds at prices from 0.2-0.8 caps per round. Since I am using cheap weapons and exploring easy areas I get what others do not use so both sides are happy.
---
I have sold fusion cells, 45, 556, at one cap per round in vending. I also offload some rounds at 0 to just get them out of my inventory to someone who needs them. I believe 45 and 556 consistently sell at one cap each so vending machines are fine for those.
---
Other ammo types like fusion cells I bet if there was a reliable sub cap price would move much faster. I think 0.6 caps per round would be a sweet spot to sell at, as I can buy at 0.4 per round from players who hate energy weapons. Fusion cells tend to build up in player inventories.
---
The 50 rounds have a sub cap market as well, maybe 0.6-0.8 because I cannot get people to part with them cheap. 
---
A lot of players at end game only use certain ammo types so they distort the market for other ammo, but lower level players still playing the game instead of the grind will find use in types like missiles, grenades, flamer fuel. It is surprising if you do not just go for max dps you can use just about any weapon in this game thru most of the content, it is just more efficient to use only a few ammo types once you are at legendary grind.
---
But ya if you want to offload ammo I always buy at 0.1 caps. If I get people interested in buying ammo and can establish an exchange rate I increase my buy rate, for instance I buy 556 and 45 at 0.8 caps regularly, fusion cells at 0.4, since I can usually vend them at some point.
---
I was buying 38/10mm/308 at 0.2-0.4 but I have collected enough to probably see my character thru the lower level content. I have sold some 308 to other low level characters at 0.5 each, but it is rare.
---
Yeah, they do that, same with radstags
---
If your looking to farm karma try this on a diff fallout reddit sub.
---
Anyway thanks for telling us how to spend our money, no excuses...
---
Some very vocal people. There's a silent majority that plays and enjoys it.
---
How many hours have you played? I’m at 1615 hours now. Most of my inventory on my main is armor pieces. High value armor pieces, that i keep to complete different armor sets. I got a mule with a full set of wwr armor to hold my weapons. And i got a mule with a full junk weight reduction set to hold all my junk.
---
You're in the minority here, character transferring is what most want. We do it anyway, we're just asking for it to be made easier. Borderlands 2 had it ten years ago. If you think it's gonna be immersion breaking to give one of your other characters a weapon or armour piece they can't use for another 49 levels, don't do it. But imagine your rifleman guy finding a Bloodied/Swing Speed/90% Reduced Weight Super Sledge when you have a Melee character. What are you gonna do? Sell it and hope your melee guy finds one as well...?
---
Ammo takes stash weight. Scrap takes stash weight (or wastes time while you hunt for materials). Armor weapons take stash weight, while you grind for the perfect ones.
---
The game is designed this way. Dunno how you don't see it, unless you're doing a naked hth build or something.
---
Im right up there with you in terms of hours played.
---
Sounds like a pretty normal thing to be put behind a paywall in a F2P or B2P game, honestly. Hamstringing players who aren’t paying a sub is status quo; typically these differences come down to a player choosing between spending time [working around the shortcomings of non-sub play] or spending money. This is the decision. If your time spent doing inventory management is worth more to you than the sub price, you pay, and if you’re skint, you can still play but you pay with your time.
---
I agree, and I don’t.  I’d love to have unlimited junk storage, but I make my caps selling bulked junk.  I only try to sell when my stash is full, so with a scrap box, I’d have all the junk and no moneys
---
It works for certain floor decor pieces. The NW trophies, the statues, and some other things. The columns themselves snap to each other fwiw. 
---
It's too bad they didn't repurpose / recreate those as a single Display 'case'.
---
I haven't tedted with walls, but FLOORS DO. The stone topped "default" concrete foundation takes up almost double the budget that a light or dark wood plank concrete foundation would. To test this edit all your flooring between the two and you'll notice. I found this out when changing all of my flooring to concrete, it put me over budget even though nothing new had been placed. I thought this may have been a case of it doubling up when swapped, but I built a base fresh and they still took the extra space. 
---
Tldr; if you have stone foundations swap them to wood plank, log out and back in and enjoy your extra budget.
---
Im not doing anything "naked" i kept some cool collectable stuff. I have probably 6 or 7 weapons that i use on my character, probably 5 or 6 fusion cores or so, thousands of rounds of 5.56, .50 cal, 308, and 10mm because i use it. Ive got 2 or 3 full sets of PA, and a couple outfits i use. Ive also got 4 vending machines running and thousands of meds. Sometimes its better to keep things on your person because of perk cards.
---
Good point. Unvaulting a bunch of stuff would renew interest in the store with them doing the least amount of work. 
---
I'm assuming there was going to be a lot of wastelanders tie-ins to the atom store. Those got pushed back with the delay. 
---
Personally grinding for the communist PA when it's released even though the last thing I need is another PA skin. 
---
I got hella excited on Tuesday when a friend started messaging me saying they say the door open and shut. 
---
Jumped on - watched it open and shut - waited until the Noon change over and. . ..
---
La déception a augmenté
---
Heads up: they charge you two days before your renewal. And they don't give you next month's atoms until that your renewal (two days after they charge you). Ask how I know...
---
Your system was, and still is, far from an entry level PC built in the same time period, which is what the bottom half of my comment was about -- not older hardware in general.
---
They also said Faschnaught will come back. 
---
It seems like it will be Fashcnaught again before Faschnaught comes back lol
---
Thx for this
---
Same here, no man can argue thatvAppalachia hasn't been a breath of fresh air for the series. However when I say gritty I don't mean like downtown Boston, I'm thinking like The Pitt as I mentioned or the area surrounding the Sierra Madre. Something way different in tone and vibe to contrast with the optimistic countryside in 76.
---
All I get from your post is that people with a life are to dumb to use Google. O...kay. lol
---
Even at Max level with some really good legendaries I still do this just for a change of pace.  I was pigeonholed into using the same set of weapons and for me personally it was starting to make the game sort of stale.  It might take 10 or so .38 to kill a supermutant compared to the one 5.56 from my bloodied handmade, but I end up wasting one less 5.56 and it adds a little variety and challenge.
---
 I only keep the lower weapons when I get a good 3 star version with 90 percent weight reduction so they aren't weighing my stash down.  I also only do this for 3 ammo types. 10mm, .38 and fusion cells.  I have a furious Tesla for the fusion cells and it isn't reduced weight so it sits in my vending machine when not in use.... apparently nobody wants to buy it.
---
So it increases yield of scrap but does not increase the pool of scrap items that you get. So you get more steel,wood, molded plastic, and such but it does not get you a wider variety of scrap items like it did in FO4. Scrapper gives you a  few more types of scrap to get but not things like screws sadly. Its probably not worth the hassle to switch gear, take damage, switch perks, wait until night, and berry mentats if you only have a few items.
---
I guess that’s a way to interpret what I said.  Given that little jab at the end, are you sure I’m the one being close minded?
---
The *need* for the scrapbox seems mostly aspirational. 
---
I have FO1st. Here’s what I’ve noticed:
---
In 266 levels I never needed to choose to destroy or vendor stuff I was going to actually use at the 800 lbs level. 
---
I did push aid items to a mule so I could save them for friends. (Not helped by stash box)
---
I did push all ammo types to a mule and friends that I didn’t use (not helped by stash box)
---
I did push all flux to a mule when not crafting, but now I keep on main (helped by stash box)
---
I craft ammo in bulk less often (helped by stash box)
---
I don’t bother selling silver, gold, asbestos extras to a vendor (neutral, non player/community benefit).
---
Like ESO, it’s a benefit for crafters and hoarders of trash.  The *need* for it is to save time if you want to be the trash king of the wasteland. 
---
Having some form of reduced space for all players would likely be a net benefit to all players if only to reduce server hopping and trade strain from inventory management.
---
Wasn't that what sold subs for ESO? The bottomless crafting bag? Without it, you'd be at max inventory constantly unless you ignored the sirens call of hoarding everything you could get your hands on. When you had it, life was good. Without it, you feel like a lower class schmuck.
---
That's how they get ya, get you hooked on convenience.
---
Everything else was icing--it really was about the bottomless junk stash. I have a shotgun and LMG that burn through ammo, and I am tired of never having mats to craft it when I run out. I can get a lot of mats quick, but my weight reducing armor means all that junk balloons in my stash.
---
Quite sure.
---
Free atoms earned in game have been there since day 1
---
wtf there are owls in the game?
---
gotta capture a few then
---
Inventory kits don't make ammo.
---
I’m the one who made this video
---
I like the idea of an extra set weight of junk for everybody. Especially if it was something we could earn. Say, finish 200 events for a workbench plan that boosts your stash space.
---
This is only happening because of stash weight.
---
Exactly the only reason I go for ESO Plus subscription.
---
You actually can earn a pretty good amount. I have a few different PA skins, costumes, a hat, some stuff for my CAMP, etc
---
I would love to see UFO in Fallout 76.
---
Try the whitespring bunker. The hill right up from the side entrance. They sometimes spawn there
---
Absolutely, join me
---
I think there is no static spawn for chickens. I usually run from Overseer's camp towards Flatwoods. There are 4 or 5 spawns between the river and the road. And I have sen chickens spawn sometimes. However I complete the challenge by running to the pond east of Vault 76.
---
Thanks, I’ll give you some 556 coz I feel bad haha
---
You can display the chasis
---
Dont need anything.  Lol  I am good.  Just a nice day!
---
I subbed for Fallout 1st just for the outfit I haven’t bothered using the tent or the stash box knowing I won’t keep the sub long term infact I cancelled the auto renewal within 15 mins of buying it
---
Agreed
---
Oxhorn is a homophobe, racist piece of shit. Its amazing how Bethesda supports him.
---
I can't really sneak in PA nor really want to...
---
Not at the moment. In the future private servers will allow you to have a bigger camp budget though.
---
You won't get legendaries from from treasure maps, unless they changed it.
---
Gonna try this, thx!
---
There's a critter spawn in a shack south of sunny top station. It has a chance to spawn chickens if you server hop there.
---
And how?
---
Agreed.  I’d pay $25 for a small DLC if the mission line culminated with the Scrapbox.  I purchased Fallout 1st but I too will be canceling.  I don’t want any of the other crap, especially the atoms.  We’re grinders and traders, not micro transaction Barbie accessorizers.  Bethesda marketing has continuously missed the mark with 76.  I’m quite forgiving of technical difficulties for an ambitious game, but I can’t accept Bethesda’s approach this time.
---
Thats a fair point, and one that i make regularly, its literally called junk.
---
They’re very rare, I’ve seen one or two maybe. Can’t remember where.
---
Don't forget about the Starched Genes perk card
---
I've said from day one the unlimited scrap box should be made available to *all* as base game.
---
 there is nothing stopping them from implementing a scrap box for all to deposit unlimited scrap  (since it works no matter what server you are on private or no).
---
this is pure greed on their part. and it's dirty to me because they stated over and over unlimited wasn't possible. ok fair, unlimited stash is not possible. *but* they found a way to implement unlimited *scrap* for paying customers. this was probably the most requested things asked the impacts quality of life in this game. and it's still gross that it's a paid feature.
---
(I have almost zero issue with the rest of fallout 1st being a subscription but I'm still iffy on the tent being paid also. I kinda wish that wasn't also but it's not actually as game changing as the scrapbox.)
---
Yep many times with explosive shotguns you will see the enemies health bar gain health as you hit them. Been a bug for awhile now that BGS has not corrected....
---
I love these! The one where it looks like the scorchbeast is coming out of a fissure is fantastic!
---
What mods are you using cause my photomode don't look nothing like that and I'm on the highest settings with my 2070 super xc ultra, 32GB of RAM, and a i7 8700k...
---
Ghouls and gutsies
---
There's some really nice pictures in that collection (especially the close up of the Rockhound)! Just out of curiosity, was it a case of rotating the camera in-game, taking a landscape photo, rotating it again in post and resizing for the correct proportions? Or did you take a different approach?
---
On a side note, you can get some pretty trippy photos using the camera rotation when in Tanagra Town due to some building being at an angle already, so it makes your character look as though you are defying gravity!
---
I started a new character right when 1st started. Level 29 now and noticed yesterday I had neary 6k steel in the scrapbox and tons of other stuff. Insane amount of scrap... But I'm still just as short on screws, adhesive, nuclear material, etc., as ever. So while I can hoard a lot of scrap, I tend to think it's mostly excess that I'd have been selling anyway. My main characters don't have anywhere near that much because of regular crafting, and I'm fact I'm still in the market for 308 for my heavy guns guy.
---
All that said, the scrapbox is incredibly convenient and everyone should have it. The 1st sub would be worth it still for private worlds and atoms, IMO.
---
It’s probably called the campbox and comes with fallout 2nd.
---
It can be soloed. I did it in Excavator and used a Troubleshooters Gatling. Lacking that, anything AA should work.
---
For some reason this just reminded me there was an actual brothel in new Vegas...
---
Depends on your build, the effect and the armor type.
---
A) you can sneak in PA, there's even a stealth boy mod. It's free damage, you asked for tips.
---
B) she's virtually immune to explosive damage, so use the faster fire rate one. Pop psychotats and ballistic bac.
---
&gt;maybe, just maybe, (hint mother #*ck!ng hint Bethesda) we can have our 1911's back.
---
Oh man, I'd do a pistol build for sure if the 1911 was available...assuming it had the stopping power it'd deserve. Perhaps a stagger affect build in?
---
I've done several thousand in the past all over the place and never gotten a single Legendary. It's a rumour unless Beth changed something. This is highly unlikely, as it would benefit the player.
---
In principle, I agree. In practise, FO76 has seen next to no development over the past year. To use one of your examples here, the endgame still has fundamental problems but they haven’t touched it. Weapon balancing remains totally out of whack, camp building is plagued by fussy and sometimes bizzare issues, and one of the more substantial bits of content, the vault raids, are still very unstable. In short, the foundation of the game is rotted through, and Bethesda Austin don’t seem interested in fixing it before dumping more weight on there with Wastelanders.
---
You could try throwing knives/Tomahawks but that would likely be frustrating as hell.
---
 Pint Sized Slasher ?? i smell a trap, lol
---
Haha.  No trap.
---
😂🤣👍👌
---
C) drop the 3 commando cards, move two points into the one gun army to max it out, and put the other point into concentrated fire. That will let you target her wings to cripple them and force her to land.
---
If you do - let me know!
---
At a glance, Forest Survivalist Sniper. Good against normal mobs, but man, don't invite me to Scorched Earth anything soon. I may as well be throwing Legos and wearing spaghetti.
---
It just doesnt make much sense to me, that people would return to appalachia with a serious plague there along with giant bats dominating the sky, I could understand having two sets of servers for the old main story and the new, since the new would then be higher leveled enemies and no scorched but more human opponents instead, its the lore that irks me I guess.
---
You hav cal shocks onit? Even more carry weight lol
---
They should definitely bring the Vulture back as another End-game boss - Toxic Valley / Savage Divide would be a good place for a Scorched Vulture roost
---
I agree, each zone should have a boss that spawns after it is nuked.
---
I'm sorry. Ill coat my next FO76 comment in a jar of semen and piss. That should make it more believable for you.
---
Don't fret. The Jar will cost you 20$ to drink so you know it'll be of fine quality.
---
Earning in game credits (atoms) has been a part of the game since day 1.  Have you even played the game?
---
Wait around for some random to shoot one down and Rob it... That's how I finished my melee only play through.
---
Or does that count as cheating?
---
Nah, can't see that happening. Hello Games are a small indie outfit albeit published by Sony. They were guilty of  a little overhyping and I was a little disappointed. They have done the biggest Lazarus job of turning the game around. About adding and improving the experience for existing customers for no extra cash. That is commendable. To work damn hard to make us happy after paying a one-off price. The Jeff Bezos of this world probably can't understand the honour they show in doing that.  
---
Bethesda produce AAA titles and have constantly taken every chance to cripple the gameplay experience, asking for money to ease the grind. They have 1,000 times the resources Hello Games do and still cannot fix the buggy mess that is FO76. It is unfixable. Eventually you stop patching, let the ship sink and just buy a new boat.  
---
I will come back once Wastelanders launches and will give it every chance to impress but those two main issues will not and can not go away.
---
I'm not being contrarian for the sake of it but have ridden this game through the highs and lows and can look back on my 2,000+ hours with some nostalgia but mostly frustration that it could have been so, so much better.
---
You could try to aggro the vertibirds/cargobot with a throwing knife or grenade, the cargobot should aggro and fly close enough for you to vats melee maybe
---
yeah this is what I think makes most sense, from a developer standpoint of course they wouldnt ditch all of the old stuff that they worked hard on, there's no sense in removing content. a split between current main story servers, and higher level, wastelanders servers, would make more sense, that way the established areas could also get more challenging enemy spawns than they currently have.
---
take the weapon to you local workbench.
---
Select modify, aNd go through all the options. Select them, but do not build the mod.  As you select the various mods, check the dmg, range, and accuracy numbers.  You’ll se them change.
---
hardened receivers, tuned barrels, magazine type, and  stocks will all affect dmg. scopes and stocks, muzzle devices affect  accuracy (stocks affect bash damage, too)
---
Some of the numbers you a see are the result of foods/bobbles/chems the player has taken.  Those will affect the dmg number shown in the pip boy.
---
Can prob purchase a keycard from player vendor, think hide an seek is a repeatable main quest, so not really a main quest. Getting keycard should advance past tjat part.
---
I...Don't, but now I'm gonna next opportunity.
---
I find and earn so many medical supplies Much of my daily vendor cap is selling them.
---
I like roleplaying a bit and have different buildings in my town where i place a vending machine with junk, notes and holotapes appropriate for the building.
---
One time a guy bought all of my “physical evaluation and crazy ramblings” notes... made 5k caps by accident
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they came out and told us they "need" to charge us for "the DLC" that's been gathering dust in the corner, since the game released.
---
Very nice work. So nice to see someone with 'the eye' do screenshots.
---
Some people fix these issues by curing mutations/ addictions and getting then again, unequipping all equipment, unmodding weapons, etc. 
---
You might also want to try with a different character, give him the weapons and see.
---
I’ve seen them occasionally spawn just east of Big B’s Rest Stop (in the Mire, south of Harpers Ferry). If you FT to the rest stop, turn right and go down the road. You’ll quickly get to a truck trailer; the animal spawn point in the area to the left (north).
---
Don't take this guy's rant as a reflection of the actual "state of the game" or anything. Whatever is happening to him is a result of something wrong with his PS4 or with corrupted game files.
---
As a general rule, if you make your DR **x** times higher, you will take **x^0.365** times lower damage. For example, doubling it from 200 to 400 would make most ballistic damage lower by a factor of 1.29, or in other words, reduce damage by about 22%. While an increase from 200 to 250 would make it less by ~8%. Which is better than nothing, but not as good as a legendary effect that reduces damage by 15% (and the difference is actually greater than that in practice, because the effect is applied before DR).
---
Your good. 
---
   Just a pita to have to remember you cant exit armor and still walk when you get back in it, without having to relog.
---
work on rasing the caps for the mod - I think its 5880 caps with grape mentats and hard bargain 3, and the 10 violet flux you will need.
---
Put those on, Been a non-issue ever since.
---
For real though there isn't a real need to hoard junk. Like if you want to collect "junk overages" that's kind of on you to have to deal with inventory management. Like in your scenario why not just use your junk before you collect more?
---
I guess “it just works”. But seriously cheers for the reply, I may have to explore some of those options.
---
It's about pixels per inch. The game does look so much better in 4K but only a screen no bigger than 24".
---
Ony place I ever saw that was the Atom shop
---
Dude on my friends list put a team together and i joined. 7 people server hopping and waiting in worlds. When we finally found a world with it active only 3 players got in. Was a 45 minute effort in futility
---
Nah man, sometime the crab thingies do the same thing, other this is a cool glitch, or maybe the weaker ones are programmed to gank you  cause this happens to me all the time
---
Yeah, this is a thing that needs to exist. I mean, there are 13 Teddy Bears, for instance. Let me have 12 in normal setups and one held in special glory! I could even shift who gets the central pedestal now and again.
---
Roses quests, which ARE part of the main story, require you to kill stuff.
---
dragon is a good weapon when you turn 50lvl, im using melee/rifle build, legendary super sledge + legendary dragon is something so amazing
---
Damn. What a tease
---
When I was still playing I felt like I probably spent more time fucking with my inventory than doing anything else so I definitely agree. Its one of the reasons I stopped playing along with all the other ridiculous bugs n shit. The worst part is I feel they will probably put more and more important things like that behind a paywall,im expecting something big from the wastelanders update will be behind a paywall,most will probably be free but they will want to give you more reason to subscribe . I cannot justify putting more money into this game as it doesnt really feel like I got what I paid for as is.
---
Wow, thanks! Lots of good ideas coming in fast.
---
Throwing knives and grenades are an idea...feels pretty hit/miss though (bc my aim sucks). I should probably get my hands on that explosive perk that shows the arc and increases the blast radius. You think it will fly low enough for me to melee it though?
---
Crossbow...hmm. Well, it's not a bullet so it could be okay and I already "broke the seal" by firing the syringer for Rose. It's kind of the same thing I guess. (Added bonus: could finally use some of the 763 crossbow bolts in my vending machine that don't sell.)
---
Waiting for someone else to shoot it down doesn't strike me as cheating...not any more than just buying a keycard from a player vendor. Only challenge is that I actually want to do the quest if I can. Maybe this is a last resort.
---
Final question: should I be good with melee only after this stage of the quest then?
---
Sure I don’t mind what’s your ign?
---
No they are not the evil company you make them out to be, it has always been like this on PSN and it has always been like this for all games. Stop hating on Bethesda and their holdings for the sake of hating on them.
---
5 caps for a single shotgun shell.
---
Just kill me.
---
You could cut that number down significantly with a crit build. My crit pistol build runs around with a pipe pistol, and only uses a couple bullets per mutie. Bit more if they notice me, but that's when I pull out my revolver to 1-shot them.
---
Andrena mutation ? if so, that is the reason ,that effects all weapons...
---
Just go for enclave quest, finish it and start to gather ingredients (and caps) for a X01 with the leg mod (on both legs) for +50lb load.  
---
profit.
---
Hm, don't wanna move any points and Strangler is Ultracite PA, which doesn't have Stealtboy torso (I use X01 for that). I might try the crippling thing on some SBs; got a few limb heavies.
---
Bethesda created a problem and sold the solution. 
---
Go play something that respects you and your time.
---
I'm guessing you have the adrenal reaction mutation which increase weapon damage at low health regardless of what type of weapon it is.
---
I use Optimum Reshade and have done since it came out a year ago. It makes quite a difference. Also for a long time my PC couldn't handle ultra textures without me turning stuff off like volumetric lighting, godrays, lens flare and adjusting the blur settings in the ini file before I upgraded about a month ago. In some cases, the lighting and drama suffers without those effects turns on but in other cases, it can be an advantage, especially in blast zones. I also sometimes use vignette. I like to use it to draw focus and at the bottom of some shots to darken closer crappy textures.
---
One can't build two-story home without using a ladder. A lot of things cannot be places in water. Unsinkable plants with ugly roots pointing out, square shacks, huge restrictions — a terrible experience. For my settlement time i come back to Fallout 4.
---
Yes, totally.
---
I knew it was something simple.  Thank you.
---
Totally is.  Thank you.
---
Thank you! I can't begin to tell you how much Radex and Radaway I have taken, standing at fissure sites for ages waiting for Scorchbeasts to come out. xD
---
Thank you kindly!
---
Honestly, it seems like you didn't actually want any advice. The points in commando are "point"less if you're running a heavy PA build. Points are easy to earn and move around, I have about 45 extras right now. I'll occasionally shift stuff around.
---
This is the same reason why I pay for ESO+. With ESO+ you unlock all of the DLC and a craft bag, which holds an unlimited amount of crafting supplies which you pick up in your travels. It frees up A LOT of space in your inventory.
---
totally the game has serious issues still and the content has been sorta thin, I'm not sure what really bothers me the most about the game at the moment, urgency like they talked about with wastelanders is something that has been missing, piling more problems on top of the game, I think the idea is to put yourself in a position where you have to create the means for it to work but after wastelanders they can focus on a new set of content perhaps that will require new tech or what they create to make wastelanders work, will ultimately play a part in future content. laying the ground work so to speak.
---
I've always thought that there is massive inflation in the game right now so it'll be interesting to see how they deal with this. the balance of what items are useful etc its not totally perfect. I enjoy farming legendaries and recipes as the end game meta, padding those chem supplies and making sure you always have ample ammo for your favourite gun is fun but I guess i wonder the impact on the overall economy, i've managed to sell some items mostly bobbleheads ill sell because they are somewhat rare but I think someone did buy some shotgun shells from me the other day. it works but i worry that if everyone keeps farming then the economy won't maintain itself unless they add higher tier recipes with greater resource requirements to balance the item sink.
---
You don’t NEED to do that quest to finish the main line of the game.  It’s a repeatable one to help you find a cargobot and show you how to find keycards. Caveat that I haven’t done those quests in some time so it may have changed.  My first character was same boat as you, and I found no way to bring it down without ranged weapons.
---
You may be able to get this done by looting any downed bot so perhaps if you wish to remain pure, just follow one around or hope to get lucky.  Vendor purchased cards will let you nuke but as I recall not deal with the quest.
---
Now then it does beg the question of if your aversion is to lead or gunpowder.  There are other options, tho the syringer is technically non-lethal whereas the others are definitely lethal.
---
Hey bud. You realize how much time, ammo, item durability, and aid items you'd waste doing stuff for free? 
---
And don't be tryin to take people away from my business please. It's rude and disrespectful.
---
Make sure you're wearing the highest level Excavator armor you can, and you can buy calibrated shocks for it at Camden Park
---
No, I was meleeing the scorchbeast with my super sledge when it got on the ground. It died by my melee not range weapon like the laser or plasma
---
That reshade only lowers the color spectrum and desaturates the image. What I'm saying is your renders look sharper than what the vanilla game offers.
---
Thank you very much. All these were taking by rotating the camera 90 degrees in photomode, which can be a literal pain in the neck and also a little hard to get used to moving the camera. :) I then just rotated them. None of these were resized. I uploaded at 1080p. And yes, I love Tanagra Town! And yes my girlfriend and we took some of us doing the 'smooth criminal' thing while we were there. :)
---
I keep buying from the atom shop but then I have to sacrifice to make room in mycamp :( I want a bigger budget too
---
Lol @ the downvotes. 
---
Say all you want about the fallout community but this sub can be trash.
---
You get a very tiny boost to build capacity for each plan you learn, so unlocking a bunch of the cheaper plans can give you some extra space.
---
yeah but it's still 100 carry weight less than the excavator right?
---
Not a problem! Friend request sent.
---
I know sugar grove used to be the place I went to get screws, but I haven’t been there in a while
---
I know there are at least three different versions of the fireman helmet from what I've seen. Two are red; one looks much dirtier/weathered than the other. The other one is white. I just assumed the ones people got from the MN event were different from the ones sold by the WS vendor.
---
Back to Basics is part of the main questline (side quest) but still part of the main quest story....You have to shoot targets at the range at Fort Mclintock...How did you pass this test?  Or did you just skip one of the main parts of the story?
---
Oh I should clarify, I can see I mislead you a bit with my wording. The Horizon mod is an overhaul that affects a lot of little things like what you can loot, crafting, settlement building, healing, leveling up, etc. It changes a lot of the gameplay of the game but keeps the core experience. It doesn't change the greenery or anything like that (though it does add some new settlement structures).
---
I meant to say that you should grab Horizon + a separate greenery mod, just to make the world cooler and more like 76. I would recommend True Grass and Commonwealth Conifer Redux, together they make the world much more lush and it will feel a bit like a mix of The Forest and Savage Divide.
---
That said, these mods together will make the game harder. You can select a difficulty for Horizon, but it's meant to make survival a bit more punishing/rewarding, and the tree mod will make ambushes and such more common because it can be harder to spot enemies. So prepare yourself!
---
I dont think so....  
---
The excavator gives only 100lb in total... I THINK.
---
[removed]
---
That's when i quit playing. Sounds like game has changed a bit since then. 
---
I had to quit due to the visuals. Everything had this glow to it, like a horizontal smear glow, and it messed with my eyes. I never found a way to fix it so I quit playing.
---
From the author/uploader: "OPTIMUM RESHADE - Fallout 76 Improves the visual appearance, makes the game a little less colorful. Lighter and less blurry, eliminating the washing effect." I do have to say that it really does remove a lot of the blurred, washed-out effect. I actually can't bear playing without it. :)
---
:]
---
Of course! We hope to see you soon!
---
Another good option it gather CAPS to buy all \*deep pocket\* regular mod for armors.  
---
this and a backpack gives a lot of extra load. (they are not cumulative with the PA)
---
You can put calibrated shocks on excavator for another 100 pounds and if you wear excavator while logging in that's another 100 for a total of 300 extra carry weight
---
Well, I do actually want an advice, like what chems are best to use, specific food before fight, how to maintain certain HP level during fight, that kind of stuff. I've never done bloodied before.  
---
Also I did write that I don't want to shuffle any points; in fact I don't have any spare, as I'm pretty much doing PvP only, so my xping is really slow - those points in commando are to retaliate with explo laser rifle, when an opponent uses one (which happens quite often).
---
It won't be full. I never let it get full. 
---
We hope to see you soon!
---
&gt;You can put calibrated shocks on excavator for another 100 pounds and if you wear excavator while logging in that's another 100 for a total of 300 extra carry weight
---
oh my, that's.... huge.  
---
I didnt knew excavator have this mod for legs
---
This isn't true. :(    I have personally compared a level 5 character's budget with a level 50 character and they both had the same.
---
I mean, if you have some hard proof please do share, but I can't see this being real because people have been searching for ways for over a year now and absolutely none of have worked out.
---
Did you ever see that message that says "A party of 8 players is recommended"?  There is a reason...It is hard as hell at level 52 to complete solo...Get a team or team up with someone and let them launch...You get the completion just for being in the silo when it launches.
---
Turns out you can melee all of the targets to pass the test. There's no requirement to use a gun or to stay inside the building/structure.
---
You've got to be quick though!
---
There is an office building in the abandoned bog town (Cranberry Bog) with a number of typewriters and other items for ~20 screws.
---
In the Savage Divide, there are three good locations in a relatively small area: Sugar Grove, National Isolated Radio Array, National Radio Astronomy Research Center. These take more time to clear, but you can get up to 45-50 screws, as well as a variety of other materials (spring, plastic, etc.), and XP from killing mutants and robots.
---
It is all about the scrapbox. If you have ever paid for an ESO subscription it is the exact same model and it totally works.
---
Yea that's why it's the only PA some people use. The carry weight makes up for the mediocre defense
---
Sugar Grove is a popular spot. I know Innovsurvivalist on youtube did a video on farming screws and springs. Yao Guai also drop screws so go where the bears are. I've  found that components accumulate just by playing the game.
---
An addendum to this path is try to find legendary armor parts that reduce weapon weight - that's also means a lot of load saving. I only have 2, so I guarantee you 2 will stack to -40% weapon weight (I'm not sure if more will keep stacking).
---
Got ya...was not sure that could be done!!
---
Me too. I usually stock in my vending at 3 caps in case people want to flip it.
---
If you're on Xbox I have loads in my vendor
---
Ps4 sadly.
---
There's no known way to increase budget. A lot of people have suggested various things like leveling up or the contractor perk, but in the end none of those people have brought any substantial proof to backup their claims. Meanwhile, a few of us have tested these theories and shared our data showing that budget really is the same for a level 1 as it is for a level 100.
---
The best way to get more out of your budget is to stop using certain items that heavily consume budget. Here's a basic breakdown (copying one of my posts from another thread):
---
 Camp items in order of how much budget they use:
---
1. Billboards
---
2. Turrets
---
3. Brahmin
---
4. Crops
---
5. Foundations
---
6. Roofs
---
7. Lights
---
8. Virtually everything else
---
I find most people burn out their budget because of turrets and crops. I believe the crops' budget cost was actually ninja increased by Bethesda a couple of months ago so some folks likely didn't notice.
---
I always carry some of them with me so when somebody acts like an asshole I can pretend to give them a gift and then just drop the note. Most of the time they didn't even pick them up.
---
Yeah aside from the monetization, HG have my respect thousand fold for what they did, I really should play their game more lol haven't played in a couple weeks 
---
As for Bethesda I agree with you and commend you on your 2k hours holy crap lol and yeah it has so much potential I'd do it myself if I had the money to buy F76 off their hands lol (I'd so decrease the price and the atom costs for a start lol) I'm hoping they do it justice and make the game the way it supposed to be as it's still fun for me
---
As far as I know, bears drop springs and acid. Super mutants have a slight chance of dropping 3x screws. You can get 5-6 from wendigos, but they are rare.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Screw
---
I usually go to places that spawn yao guai, i know of at least 4-5 places, each drops like 5-6 acid
---
Sorry, my mistake. Yao Guai for springs, wendigos for screws. Noted.
---
I just carry two sets, X-01 for fightin' and Excavator for haulin'.
---
I like the way you answer.  
---
Here, get +1
---
There are a couple wendigos that spawn on the road leading south from abbie’s bunker. You can server hop and get around 8 - 10 screws each time. They’re also helpful if you’re looking for stimpaks.
---
Tip: Even when you don't need screws... never let behind any toy car, antique globe, typewriter or desktop fan.  
---
These are very common items.
---
Hey if you’re on PS4 I’d love to help. I’m level 105 rifle and pistol guy :)
---
I won’t :) thanks!
---
I've tried everyway I can think of to jump high enough to melee her in the air with no success.  even if I'm in distance I still can't get a hit to register.
---
It’s so stupid that they decided to charge for it
---
I use a western revolver on my slugger character as a backup, almost specifically because of Gun Runner perk.  If you live in power armor and hate Speed Demon, it is fantastic.  The pistol itself is milquetoast, even an AA/25 version, but I just use it to tag legendaries anyways.
---
I find .44 everywhere and 500 rounds is more than enough to last me a while.  It would be cool to sell off the rest.
---
" Now I don't know if it is just the servers I'm getting in but no one  wants to party up and that leaves me playing solo 90% of the time. "  
---
I know what you mean... I play this game since launch and I never launched a single nuke. At some point I just stopped trying to group.
---
Hemlock Holes has three acid deposits and I use it constantly.
---
Tanagra?  Loads of crickets there which drop acid
---
server hop tanagra town tunnel, kill the shit out thr crickets, loot, repeat
---
Uncanny caverns and Hemlock Holes
---
Head to Tangara Town, Crickets always spawn there, you can walk away with around 40+ Acid every trip, 5 mins work. Clear them out, log off, back on again, rinse and repeat.
---
Craft a Bloat Fly Syringer. Shoot anything with it, then kill it, spawns a Bloat Fly, shoot that, rinse and repeat.
---
**Best method:** Meltdown Raid, unlock Engineering only, kill all the Crickets until they stop spawning. Fast Travel out then start over again. Maybe half hour work for 300-500 Acid per trip. Can only do his every 3 weeks though obviously.
---
One time, my Fallout 1st membership wasn't being recognized due to slow internet speed. It was temporary, but I learned some stuff about what happens to a member when their subscription ends. So, like others have said you can still craft using scrapbox materials without needing to move it to your Stash, so feasibly a player can pay for a month subscription and fill up a scrap box, cancel the subscription and basically use it until it completely runs out. In order to refill it, you'd just have to subscribe for one more month. Clever players could get full scrap box functionality only paying 2 or 3 months a year. I don't think you can build a scrapbox without a Fallout 1st sub, so it's important not to delete the one you built before.
---
My survival tent stayed on the map, and I could use it to fast travel. I wasn't able to move it though. Basically if a Fallout 1st player put their tent at Whitespring or Camden Park for a permanent free fast travel spot, they can keep that forever if they cancel Fallout 1st. I think that's really cool. If you ever want to move it somewhere else, you just resubscribe.
---
There is an office building in Abandoned Bog Town right next to the workshop (the most intact building. If you enter through the elevator shaft on the roof you'll find a metric shitload of typewriters and desk fans. The spot is good for concrete and fertilizer as well.
---
Haha. I realize that but the whole goal is to get rid of the ammo I don't need for my build day to day.   No reason to make it ammo efficient! Unless you mean not using the single 5.56.... in which case I think you've got something going there.  You just look at them and they die lol
---
'round Dyer Chem
---
Im so happy to finally see some x01 love. Lol.
---
It's been a week since my sub ended and I really don't think the scrap box made that big of a difference. I'm thinking of resubing but only because of that tent. On demand stash access is way too convenient.
---
The only useful thing is the collectron. It combined with a junk collector resource saves me a lot of scavving and gives me more playtime. Everything else is aesthetics. Well except for the scrap and repair kits which I rarely use and I get them by playing the game.
---
I guess I'm really just confused as these are supposedly "cookie cutter" enemies and though they look the same  and share the same name without any modifier (ex: feral ghoul and feral ghoul roamers), the damage resistance and damage output are at complete opposite ends of the spectrum from each other.
---
Ty for the help!
---
you have to shoot the ground beneath targets.  direct hits are bugged.
---
Hopefully they come up with a Christmas time event before the end of the year.
---
Formula P gives -chr and something else. It's just a pain in the ass to get.
---
I think the best would be something similar to the Sink in New Vegas, but with also Display Cases. It would even fit the lore of the franchise, because Big Mountain and House were concurent in pre-war America, so its not too unlikely to imagine that House would make his own sink, but for the ultra-rich residents of Watoga. It could even bring more attention to some event, for exemple you could unlock mods in different locations of the map that 1) give something unique to almost everything in your player home (Like those light switch or that toaster in (again )the sink) and 2) have, for some of them, rare drops from events. The Display Cases being in that instanced player home could solve the problem with those you have in your C.A.M.P.; with 1 bubblehead display case, 3 magazine display cases, a dozen of weapons display cases and 4 or 5 mannequins (that you can switch the gender of)\*. You could even enter a friend's player home with a system like in GTA Online, with the ability to choose in which player home you want to enter upon entering, or fast-traveling to the location. If I would place it somewhere, it would definitly be in Watoga Estates, as it is an unused location. That being said, it is just me throwing ideas. Id like to know your toughts.  
---
  
---
\*The numbers I wrote here are just something I thinked of in like 5 minutes. I think Bethesda could have their maths right when deciding how much display cases we can have so we dont raise the lags of the servers that significantly.
---
If you pay by cash this dose not happen if you pay by card this will
---
If you put the chassis on a display it will show the chassis. But no armor and it looks really weird...
---
I thought the 8 player recommendation was if I were to nuke the Prime Fissure site. And not to restate myself, it is very hard to get random players to team up, or at least for me as I don't have a mic and no one accepts my random team invites.
---
🦀🦀🦀 free players deserve bank space too 🦀🦀🦀

The same as scavenger's outfit ;)
---
Already doing the balancing for them. Good job!
---
Fair warning it is guarded by a Mirelurk queen and her goons. But the exact location is in the portable toilets in the quarry x3.
---
There was a brilliant post made on the subreddit some time ago talking about the Ammunition and Medical vending machines and how they should take Pre-War Money instead of caps (makes sense, after all). I kind of liked the idea. It makes Pre-War Money into something other than...cloth.
---
caps lock is the ptt button..
---
I stay up to date so I know that if they make good changes to the game I can come back and play. I do love the game and played it since beta, so if they improve it I will be coming back. The only way to know if they do is if I stay up to date.
---
Yes, I love Steve’s videos! I especially love the ones where he smokes super old cigarettes.
---
Most what?  Decrease in hunger?  Hp?  Quantity?
---
Yessss!
---
You've pretty much spelled it out perfectly. Unlimited storage needs to be offered to everyone. I've spent way too much time on inventory management and not actually playing the game. The last week and a half of my membership I spent scrapping everything in sight to put into the scrapbox. I'm pretty pleased with 80k steel, 6k lead, and so on, but this needs to made available to everyone. However, I have a feeling that Bethesda won't budge on this because Elder Scrolls Online offers an increase in storage space as well with their memberships.
---
“I call it Lydia because it carries my burdens...” 😂
---
Looking for quantity
---
Never have, never will. I alway know I’ll need screws at some point.
---
I'm glad they are working on updates. I've gone back to skyrim.cuz I missed NPC characters lol
---
There's a way to trick the game to doing this.
---
Please explain
---
This is what I need to do instead of forgetting which set does what best when I really need something STAT
---
Lol thank you I've been going nuts looking everywhere.
---
If you find out, tell the rest of us plz.
---
I did 50 maps the other day. Only good for some ammo and high tier weapons which can be scrapped to learn mods without spending crafting materials. 
---
Also, rare baseball bats.
---
Great deal. It's the kind of game where you can easily make your own fun.
---
Place a brick doorway. Place another one, 180 degrees rotated, in the same spot. Then, select one, hit replace, put whatever wall you want there. Do the same for the other. When I get home from buying Lowes' supply of Christmas lights I'll post a picture for you.
---
Do u mean yellow &amp; indigo? really??
---
Thank you for the clarification, I misunderstood :P
---
I like the idea tho. I'll try them. The base game really turn me off even in survival comparing to how much they polished FO76 core mechanics. At start, I had the bad surprise to see that every mods are available at the weapon workbench D: I love the grinding for weapon modifications, etc.
---
Yeah well cool good luck with the lights 👍💪
---
For future reference it’s the X key
---
I'd make a YouTube vid, but I don't know how to capture from xb1 to post it.
---
Elder scrolls online plus is easy to turn off. Go to account settings, subscriptions, turn off. Fo1st I had to google how to find the page on their website where it allowed me to cancel. These two games come from the same parent company. If you have ever worked in sales then you would understand company’s do try to trick customers to make more money. Don’t be naive.
---
If you’ve ever ventured out in search of lead, screws, spring, adhesive, copper, or aluminum you too are a junk hoarder
---
It would be nice if they added a barn door as well
---
Very true. There is a lot that could be done to add to the gun community, exponentially creating different, fun combos instead of seeing everyone rock the exact same guns/mods. Those scattered laser "rifles" are really a lot of fun to play with but can't really compete with true shotguns.
---
well if you have rejuvenated i think its called active and you loose your well fed bonus you loose your extra hp in the process wich kills you
---
Thanks.
---
Toxic Larry's spawns three snallygasters.

Crickets near Tanagra town.
---
That oughta keep you permanently stocked on acid.
---
Im guessing snack cakes.  Cant confirm atm.
---
Not nearly as many people would stay subscribed with the scrap box as a free in game item. At least I don’t think so
---
You're absolutely right I never thought about that. Thank you.
---
Of course you'd pay atoms for a scrap box... and so would everyone else... using their free atoms.  Bethesda doesn't make money off of people handing back their free atoms.
---
One of the guys in our group is a trader with multiple accounts who trades for maps and legendaries, and last night he started putting some of his accumulated collection to use. We spent a good 6 hours
---
only know that because of a youtuber i regulary watch it happens to him all the time :D
---
Oh this is disgusting, I have to take another bite
---
Sugar grove hopping is the only real answer.  Enough people going in, that you’ll get filled up quickly.
---
Oh wow Atleast it confirms viability of mire and bog plans
---
They generate at the same speed. 
---
One item every 3 minutes with a maximum capacity of 4.
---
If you just want the best healing/hunger value, pick Salisbury Steaks (25HP, 20% Hunger, IIRC). 
---
Sugar Bombs are a good choice for AP recovery though.
---
Yeah, just swing a meat hook.
---
The white one is by far the rarest. It goes with the Responder firefighter outfit, which is also very rare. I believe it only drops from events in the Forest and some Responder quests.
---
The dirty red one is part of the Fire Breathers outfit, which you get automatically by completing the Responder quest line.
---
T
---
You paid too much.
---
I started doing this myself. I keep a gun for each ammo type except for the heavy guns (weigh far too much to lug across the country). But it's been so much more interesting and it helps me keep the ammo out of my stash box.
---
That's likely true
---
Hell yeah
---
Salisbury steaks

Also fo1st does not show up in the history of purchases under my Xbox history. I have had xbox live since 2004, it shows history of trial subscriptions I tried but didn’t need to purchase from 10 years ago but not fallout 1st? Interesting.
---
I've never experienced that myself so maybe it was a bug I run commando build tho so dont have to melee the turrets but they all only take 1-2 shots with my handmade as for teaming up ppl rarely accept team invites in game if they dont know the person sending the invite because of trolling and getting dragged into pvp they dont wanna be in I'd suggest posting on here asking for some1 to run a silo with you youd probably get more joy that way they are perfectly soloable tho with out doubt with practice you can get through them in bout 20 mins and you can definitely do it at level 52 with right gear and perks try again on a different server see if you get the same results with the turrets
---
It is all about the salisbury steak, but you need to baby sit it since it had a low cap of 4 per 12 minutes.
---
Thank you for the heads up.  I cancelled mine about a week ago.
---
wow! compliments!
---
 I am on pc and the option doesn’t even show up
---
Hmm, i dont seem to crash anymore..
---
Since they are mutated bats, they don't lay eggs, give live birth, and that's a vagina.
---
(Now I'm curious if baby Sierra Bravos are cute!)
---
Impressive!
---
Sugar Grove is decent and gets you 15. 
---
Abandoned Bog Town is better and gets you almost twice as many in a very small area.
---
I believe Bethesda would have saved themselves a lot of controversy, especially since opinions about the game were mellowing out, if they marketed it as a private server rental with free atoms rather than a premium member thing like “first class” on an airplane with all these potential game altering benefits.
---
I am a fan of lead lined for SQB fights and anywhere there is chance of rads.
---
I loved the different ammo types in New Vegas.  It was a fun and interesting addition to the game, so of course Bethesda decided to scrap it for 4 and now 76.
---
Yeah we found Ash Heap maps give T-45 while Cranberry Bog maps give T-51b and T-60 plans (T-60 seemed less common), and I think mire gave T-51b, not sure about T-60 because I logged off when they started there. Savage divide maps they said can give Raider plans.
---
Good information man thank you🙏the rarest is t-60 it seems
---
It is quite simple. Just start the record, stop it when you're done and wait for a couple of minutes(depending on your upload speed) for the clip to be uploaded to Xbox Live. Afterwards, just download it. I do it using the Xbox app on my phone, but I'm pretty sure you can somehow do that on your PC.
---
Assaultron heads give 1 screw; 1 silver; 3 circuitry
---
1. Get a few scrap assaultron heads;
---
2. Craft assaultron helmets with Super Duper (for every 3 helmets crafted - you will get 4)
---
3. Scrap the crafted assaultron helmets (scrapping will restore the assaultron head)
---
4. Craft Assaultron helmets with Super Duper...
---
Repeat steps 2-4 until you get enough screws (may take 5-10 minutes to have a few hundred)
---
Keep 4-5 assaultron heads for future - scrap the rest to get the scrap materials.
---
PS. You can always find a few Assaultrons at Watoga and/or Whitesprings
---
Know how you get around either having to buy into 1st to get a scrap box or having to fill up your stash with junk?
---
STOP.  HOARDING.  SCRAP.
---
The VAST majority of scrap in this game can be collected both quite quickly and quite easily just by knowing where to look when you need it.  Outside of rarer materials like Ballistic Fiber there is zero need to keep more than a moderate supply of the more common materials you need for quick repairs in your stash.
---
Everyone wants infinite scrap but no one actually fucking needs it.
---
Did you previously lose anything during the ‘Scrap Box Glitch’ period?
---
Bethesda gave this out to those that were affected as an apology.
---
compensation from Beth, read more here

---
Pirate hat is atom shop only, it's the outfit that dropped from the event.
---
This. Exactly. Fucking. This. Is why I don't play half as much as i used to. I truly feel betrayed by Bethesda for this but it seems I'm the only one and not enough of the community have made a stink of it 😪. I do still enjoy the game for the most part, and I'm looking forward to Wastelanders but I just feel there's going to be much more paywall locked content.
---
Did it also break everyone elses arm when they used it?
---
Is that the church in Helvetia?
---
I see. Yeah, that's a straight up bug, then. Sorry to hear it.
---
I didn’t pay by cash. I used a credit card. Mine expired. I had to physically renew it. I couldn’t live without that scrapbox!
---
"Hmm, I'm feeling peckish... guess I'll die!"
---
I could stomach the game and all its flaws, knowing that everyone else was suffering in the same way.
---
Removing the stash limit for those that pay extra removes that illusion.
---
I quit the day Fallout 1st was announced.
---
I would also affirm these prices to be fairly accurate.  
---
If you stumble across the last 3 varieties, they really do trade quite well.  The Red specifically is usually so sought/valued that finding a 70k payee would be quite easy.  Most people whom I’ve seen with a red asylum set consider them to be priceless.
---
I'd go as you are dude use the 50 cal or the laser only thing with laser is explosive energy weapons are shit against flying enemies but you'll be doing most damage when she lands anyway make sure you kill anything that does damage over time attacks before they get near you they'll kill you quick if your not paying attention personally I'd have my 5 points of agility in adrenaline for the extra damage your tanky in power armour and the auto stim is gonna proc everytime you take damage because you'll be below 30% health anyway if bloodied n you'll end up using mad stims when you solo the queen it's a completely different experience she doesnt seem as tanky and the mobs are much less than when theres a group I cant remember your build now after writing all that but if you dont have stabilised put that on if you can
---
when you lose your well fed bonus your hp goes down
---
Does it make a big difference?
---
Yeah I'm sure there's somewhere online with all the possible drops.
---
Well if your bloodied I'm sure your looking to wear some uny gear, that will help your carry weight. Aim for RR or armor, will serve a better purpose being low hp most of the time.
---
Oh do they? Thanks for the info.
---
Takes longer, has scorchbeasts interfering, they are more hidden, and it’s far less likely to have others come by and respawn items for you. 
---
Quit looking at data sheets and you’ll realize sugar grove is far superior- just by virtue of people coming in constantly if nothing else .
---
Refrigerator mod. So at any time you can go full carnivore to maximize dmg efficiently and more conveniently.
---
There is no such thing as “hoarding” scrap in this game. If I venture out and explore for hours on end and collect scrap along the way, guess what....I won’t ever have the issue that you do when you have to stop what you’re doing to go out and find a specific scrap component that you ran out of. Scrap is the game and if you have to modify any aspect of gameplay specifically for the accumulation or disposition of it you aren’t playing the game you are playing inventory management. 
---
Further, chances are you’ve already done the work for the scrap you are in need of you just had to get rid of it and now you’re doing double duty
---
Nobody is brave enough to try and break the meta.
---
Find the answer out yourself and you will be a hero.
---
I never had a problem with scrap mine was always close to 6-700 though. I just throw away any junk I don't need for bullets and repairs.
---
Nice outside the box thinking.  Try mysterious savior as well!
---
Allrighty, thanks for the info. I have an Emergency Protocols Torso for, well, emergencies, so there's that... But really, 30% HP is the minimal treshold I'm willing to go.
---
It's such a pity that Bethesda's stash limit is based entirely on server stability, I'm not sure about you but my game crashes pretty frequently and the servers are far from 'stable'. It's just depressing that the one thing people asked for since Fallout 76 was released, announced even, was for private servers and they found a way to capitalise on it and squeeze as much money out of the game as possible. We saw how EA got so much flak over their microtransactions, can you imagine if THEY also started a subscription service just for stuff that should have been FREE!? It'd be outrageous, yet we still pay anyway because we don't have a choice, we either stop playing or play with such a major handicap (that is a choice but shh). I ain't buying another Bethesda game, I'll be donning my eye patch and peg leg and spending my money elsewhere.
---
The scrap box is essentially the crafting bag from the ESO subscription and the main reason to keep it. It's not going free ever.
---
Well, time to redesign my CAMP. Thanks!
---
Can you use the stash box on a pub server?
---
It sound kinda like you are.... screwed.
---
(sorry, I'm weak and couod not give up this joke) xD
---
1. Artificially Create A Problem
---
2. Sell The Solution
---
Bethesda planned this before the beta.
---
I mean shit. There’s already server issues. I’d rather have server issues AND unlimited scrap than just server issues
---
Never used power armor in FO4 or 76. Can’t stand it honestly.
---
I might be able to use the Xbox app on my laptop then. I'll do that when I get home then.
---
Those and the medicine ones need to stay in the game, period. Although they need a rework. Do all ammo besides ultracite available for a cap each maybe 5mm 3 to 1 and stims super stims radaway and other basic meds and chems for like 10 to 25c each. This game needs consumables and other things available in good quantities for PVP and pve also separate vendors for more quantums overdrive stealthboys ect at the player market price average and more quantities available so everyone can get a decent amount of each not just the people duping aid
---
So, everyone that pays can hoard scrap to their heart’s content,
---
but, we, the plebs, have to play the inventory management game?
---
Sounds fair. /s
---
Yeah scap box is probably the main feature
---
“Never done bloodied would like advice”, proceeds to refuse all advice and not go to 20% where nerd rage procs avoiding one of the primary perks of being bloodied which gives you huge dmg boost and dmg reduction.
---
That didn't work.
---
I WANT to give Bethesda money, but they aren't making it easy.  I have no interest in private worlds, or even monthly atoms, but I would totally pay a one-time small fee for a Scrapbox/Tent combo.  I'd pay even more for some additional vending machines.
---
Huh weird, I’m on default key set up and it’s X for me
---
thanks! Now I may scrap all those helmets without feeling guilty.
---
just like real life :D
---
I've been bitching about the scrapbox with several posts and nearly everyone just replied with "stop hoarding junk" in a game about collecting junk.
---
Vault 94 raids, you'll get tons.
---
Probably best torso mod anyway if that's as low as your willing to go that's cool you should be able to do it but personally I think with bloodied you gotta be all in to really benefit from it I'd think about going 20% and using nerd rage as well coupled with adrenaline to really boost your damage and from experience the 50 cal shreds her although if you've got no points in demolition and have a ffr version use that lol sorry bad memory cant remember your perks again and dont wanna type this out again 😂
---
this!  I will go over encumbered just to grab that last fan or globe
---
I've started playing again, recently. Tutelarycomic43, level 190
---
Those are the same people posting on fallout message boards “LTB Lead, Steel, Copper 1 cap per”
---
God that vulture is awesome, I would love it being introduced like the sheepsquatch, maybe a small quest and some spawnable events. Hell make it a little smaller and introduce it into the game with random events where it drops a dead brahmin or mutant out of the sky.
---
if you're on xbox hit me up, AirTurtle88691, I think I have enough for you
---
I've been ranting a lot about it too, but the players that buy the subscription just tell none 1st members to suck it up and stop being a hoarder in a game about hoarding junk.
---
Ok, but how do I keep myself precisely at 19% hp..?
---
If your mom sets the ps4 as her main/home ps4, all accounts on it will share her ps plus, it will only share it on that playstation though but it lets you use your own.
---
We have 2 Ps4s my parents and mine (and my brothers) and I'm already so far ahead and stuff and everyone I play with knows her account so it'd be more trouble to switch
---
I should have really pointed out that I don't have any points to shuffle build, don't have any bloodied weapons except heavies nor any Uny armor. I really want to work with what I have...
---
The economy will be destroyed. People can make ammo. People will abuse it. Not worth it.
---
So glad to see these here. :D
---
Lol. Can't argue with that.
---
I know, which infuriates me even more.
---
&gt; I do have to say that it really does remove a lot of the blurred, washed-out effect. I actually can't bear playing without it. :)
---
Optimum Reshade was the first mod I installed during the free week of play back in June.  Without it, I would not have purchased the game; vanilla FO76 is a soupy, blurry mess.
---
Nice collection of images, btw.
---
Are you serious?  It definitely doesn’t take longer. They’re all in one office floor at the top of the building it takes maybe one minute to grab them all once you’ve done it once. 
---
And open world items have a server-time and per-character lockout. Once you loot 180 items, your per-character lockout begins to refresh. And nothing another player does will affect the server-time lockout. So, other players coming by doesn’t ‘respawn’ them for you. 
---
Scorchbeast interference?  Rare, minimal, and easily ignored. 
---
Higher traffic doesn’t make any open-world loot items spawn faster.
---
Oh ok, just wanted to see if you knew, as some people still don't.
---
I member when it was 200... God it sucked so bad
---
Totally understandable but if you don’t like the low Health options there are very good high Health ones that can do good dmg too.
---
How's that?
---
spamming my ass, those photos/renders are incredible!
---
They did this with ESO too. The materials bag is a game changer. The professions in that game are so complicated that you need a bag to sort it all outside your main inventory. The difference is that ESO started out as a sub style game then went free to play with a few legit benefits reserved for subscribers. FO76 is doing it in reverse which makes them seem greedy when really it's the same business model they are trying to build.
---
All my friends comment on the fact that i practicaly live in my power armor (which is kinda true i almost never take it off) even though my regular armor is actually better, I just really like power armor and its T-60 too so easy on the maintenance and i get to have my Brotherhood paint.
---
Interesting. I’ll try this out tonight. 
---
Trading some Steel for Screws, Silver and Circuitry isn’t a bad deal. I’ve got about 14k Steel so this could be good.
---
You could be wearing T-51b with calibrated shocks, have the same carry weight as you do now, plus have the best damage and energy resists in the game, lol.
---
Meltdown is the correct answer.
---
You dont as long as you put your rads so you can only have 19% health you just gotta stim when you drop it becomes second nature when you always run bloodied to keep an eye on your health but it's a bit of a juggling act can definitely catch you out at first but in power armour your biggest worry is poison damage damage over time that's why it's important to do as much damage as you can everything but the queen should die in 1-2 hits also you probably know this but just incase only target her wings when she's in the air when you've got a perk on that can stagger hit her in the head or torso when she's flying and she's gonna stagger and not land and itll take you way longer than it should key is get her to land and shoot her in the face then she'll go down quick
---
I just wanna try it, as it's the only thing in game I haven't done so far... Also I traded those weapons long time ago, might as well dust them off and use them.
---
I have been curious about this too!
---
Fixer and lever action FTW!
---
Your regular armor isn't better. PA resists go into effect AFTER the built-in 42% damage reduction that all PAs have.
---
Not auto stim, it only activates after a revive from an incapacitated state
---
So life saving armor/ mysterious savior is the way I go
---
I will sometimes grab a set from one of the spawns and "drop" it in the camp with pieces on it.
---
I am using the blue/yellow vault-tech-tiles But i'll make sure there arent less expensive floorings later. Thanks for the Info
---
Life saving is what I was thinking of sorry
---
I am a Strength build too. And you can do melee with heavy guns and it doesn’t take much to start hitting like a truck but the commitment to lower health is a big factor. PVE you can be pretty tanky at low health using poison resistant armor, bolstering/uny, serendipity. You also don’t need fancy armors. Collecting 1 star unyielding is a great start that still gives +3 special for each piece. That means more carry weight so you can take away more qol perks. You don’t have to make the transition all at once either. I was 120 or something when I transitioned. I am still slowly fine tuning my build as I play with it learning more about optimization at 220. With 4 perks into perception you can still do great dmg while still being optimized for melee. One perk in each commando or rifle +concentrated fire for headshots. To efficiently be a queen killer sneak is a huge multiplier you don’t want to avoid. Not only does it save you ammo because you are doing more dmg per bullet but you save healing resources which = less farming.
---
It may just be the stone top ones that take up more budget. If I had to guess I'd say that the tile ones act the same as plank but who knows.
---
So, why not just drink one and then when you wake up, see if you can place a C.A.M.P. nearby, if you like the location?
---
If you can’t/don’t then repeat the process until you can/do.
---
Oh I agree with you completely.
---
Look me in the eyes and tell me this armor isnt sexy... Hey my eyes are down here.
---
I don't think quest items can be dropped. It doesn't even let me stash them. But I will check out If I have one.
---
I think that’s generally what happens when you try to provide a rational thought on this sub.  If you’re not up in arms about something or providing the game equivalent of cat photos, no one wants to hear it.
---
I agree with this, I love smaller areas with big impact, all about optimization and minimization. I have a single 1x1 room with 3 of my workbenches. The shops are large and obnoxious, if I could get a tabletop vendor or something like it, i’d be all over that.
---
Turrets are the easiest way to save budget, I've found. A few heavy lasers or missle turrets (2 or 3 max) is more than enough to handle any camo defense in the forest area, where I see a lot of builds. See a lot of people with max turrets in the Forest, you'll only get low level enemies attacking, 10 missles for a mole rat is a bit overkill. I currently only have 1 turret at my far west forest camp, and it more than protects.
---
Yeah this is a great idea. Like the size of the kiosk computer thing.
---
There was a pirate hat that dropped during mischief night and it is different than the atom shop one.
---
I've heard reversing payments / charge-backs are against 'the rules' and a very very quick way to losing access to your account. 
---
I wouldn't wish that on anyone regardless of how much big B screwed up. 
---
Hold tight in that respect. I hope they pull through for you soon.
---
I think the whole reason the quest glitched out was because I dropped them
---
Thanks,
---
I tried a lot of custom ini files but none of them completely disabled the shadows
---
I am not at home to actually test it but Can you please just post a screenshot just to see how it actually looks like ?
---
or you can give 1000 pound scrapbox of junk to everyone, then unlimited to 1st member
---
but not black and white
---
They are now literally manufacturing problems and selling solutions. Despicable.
---
Make your own reshade - it's easy as hell.
---
GT- TheFriskyPete, my main is 225 and rifles but I'm going through a new one who is melee and only 50 so I'd be more than happy to help. I've walked a bunch of people through the Enclave missions and helped them fire their first nuke, I feel like it's something everyone should get to try at least once, very rewarding.
---
Allright, I'll try to utilize that. Also, as a PA pvper, I'm quite used to dying fast, even with full health, so there's that, haha.
---
Sitting here having my mind blown out the back of my head by how good these are and that you can take */just rotate the camera/*
---
I mean I get what you're saying; seen some folks melting queen with meathooks... It's just that I have all those nice bloodied heavy weapons stashed and would really like to use them for once - and what better opportunity than soloing a queen?
---
I got an instigating broadsided on Tuesday.  I shot  it twice then turned it into scrip.  Woof.
---
Damn, that's some good info right there. I had no idea how it worked, thank you, seriously. I've trialed and errored for 800 plus hours, this makes so much more sense.
---
Yep, turrets are really expensive. I don't think I've used a single one in any of my recent builds. It's typically not hard to defend camps and there's always the option to unplug from the world in the face of catastrophe (like when my place was attacked by a scorchbeast in Ash Heap last night!)
---
There was a video posted a while back where a guy compared his camp budget before and after learning a bunch of plans.  I can't find it now, and it may have been edited if what everyone else is saying is true.
---
Whoa. I've had the same wallpaper (David Gilmour's On An Island) for eons, and just switched to the power armor/nuke shot. Great stuff!
---
Like the size of a one arm bandit.  Speaking of which.
---
I will check in a 20 minutes or so, depending on the NW match. You can have my sample ... if I have one that is.
---
I've had the same question and I'm not aware of one.
---
Haha, I think captainoob used a 50 cal on one of his queen tested videos recently definitely worth a watch it'll give you an idea what to expect and you might be able to see the perks and set up in action so you can tailor your build around it
---
There are a couple different songs, and from what I understand, the skill with which you play them is actually tied to your Intelligence.  Your character will stumble and restart a lot with low Intelligence.
---
Suppose that's better than wearing Legos and throwing spaghetti. Jokes aside, even if you aren't that DPS oriented, Queen fights are a great way to level through the lower scorched spawns, plus a lot of bloody, die all the time dudes like myself always appreciate the guys who run around stim packing those who fall. There are a lot of ways to contribute, so don't let the difficulty stop you from heading there next Queen.
---
Great advice! It’s good to see someone loves building as much as me.
---
He’d have to waste nukashines or take the time to farm up a tonne. It’d be easier to get a map of all the wake-up spots.
---
I think they use Digital River to handle sales.  They are pretty incompetent based on dealing with them on other purchases.  I’ve had zero issues with 1st orders so far (using a credit card), but I’m not surprised there are issues due to Digital River.
---
The scrapbox has been useful for sure, but I don't think it's such a big deal if you're not the kind of person who hoards endgame weapons and armour. I'm more of a builder and because of that play multiple characters, none of whom have stash problems.
---
I would say for me the private server itself has been much more helpful. It gives me a more stable place to farm for building plans and a way to start new camps without competing for locations. Plus it really simplifies trading between characters (since you can dump stuff at a train station and log that char over with less potential for loss than Adventure mode).
---
In the end I agree Bethesda is using QOL to sell the subscription. It's unfortunate and not something I approve of, so I'd be in favour of giving scrapbox to everyone. But the sub itself isn't a bad deal for people who have the money and are willing to buy atoms in the first place.
---
If you get some unyielding armor you can run a semi-bloodied build and get all the special stats back plus some more without having to be on the brink of death all the time.
---
If you're picking up stuff you don't need right now in the belief that if you hold onto it and the next piece and the next piece and the next piece and the next piece that some day you'll need it then that is the definition of hoarding.  
---
I don't run out of scrap because I replenish my stores before they deplete.  I don't need to go out and collect five hundred gears because I am never going to be in a position where I need five hundred gears.  I never have to worry about running out of gears because after I use some the next time I'm depositing junk in my stash I replenish what I'm missing and junk the rest.
---
I never asked for a reverse payment which is why this is so mind blowing to me. I just want to product I paid for. But yeah I’m with you. Definitely need to be patient but the point I’m trying to make is we shouldn’t have to be. OSRS had a dupe glitch that was fixed is less than 12 hours. Bethesda takes months to do literally anything. My problem has a much simpler solution and if they can’t even solve that then damn...
---
Can you take a picture of what you see when you kill a ghoul and look at the corpse? It’s subtle but the blood doesn’t physically show up in the inventory.
---
This is exactly what I've been wanting, wonderful idea. Would really liven up the nuking pattern versus 95% Fissure Prime and Whitesprings.
---
I just want the Veteran Ranger Armor to be honest.
---
Wow! It's an honour. Thank you!
---
A map would be helpful if there was one. I don’t know of one.  That’s why I offered an alternative. It’s obvious that to ***use*** Nukashine you have to ***have*** Nukashine. 
---
The actual experience would show him not just the location more specifically than any map but also the orientation upon arrival.  That could be extremely useful.
---
I don’t know, but when I first read “autism armor” I was seriously confused.
---
One - 76th Upvote!
---
Two, I like it. Still doesn’t make it useful for me as a melee player, but I just give ammo to friends anyway. Maybe something good for medical ones too...
---
It is fair because the amount of effort needed to collect or hoard that scrap is equal.  People that have scrap boxes do all of their farming at once and store everything at once while those without do their farming on an as needed basis.  Having an infinite store of scrap means nothing because you are never going to be using so much scrap at once that you actually have to use all of what you have saved up.
---
I love building. It has too many limitations right now (mainly budget, placement barriers, and a low number of non-shop assets), but it can be quite fun regardless. Appalachia is a great setting for camps and it's slowly getting better.
---
I don't have high hopes that Wastelanders will 'save' or dramatically change this game, but I think once that update comes I'm going to consider 76 a prime candidate for lots of future entertainment.
---
Hide this post so we can get RICH ;)
---
Savage Divide seems to have a higher drop rate, at least for me. Both of my power armor plans came from SD MAPS.
---
There is no “belief” you will need these items. You will need these items. 500 gears is great to have ESPECIALLY when you’ve put in the 10 plus hours it takes to explore and collect said gears. Which you will do anyway. I want to keep the assets I took the time to collect that’s not hoarding that’s playing the game and enjoying the work you put into playing the game. And since the ability to keep those items that this game is built around exist and we all paid for the game, we should have to option to keep our work
---
Awesome 60% of my plans are for SD
---
Interesting I didn't know that.
---
It is pretty cool, I tend to let the popularity of outfits die down before I rock them
---
At least ESO lets you upgrade your bank and inventory
---
Here pay for this game what’s that you want features sure just pay another 100 dollars the frick Bethesda
---
At that price, I’d just consider the mark up as a convenience fee, to be honest.
---
I seen someone post on here showing 3k dmg with his heavy. I totally agree that the queen is the best thing to learn to optimize your build. My best advice I think would be to save up perk points for a while. Spend that time testing consumables and where to farm them so you always have them available. Sneak would be hard with heavy since you can’t silence them but you can def do critical shots. Most critical shot perk cards are in agility so look through that. Slowly move away from weight reduction and qol cards. Don’t do it one lv at a time save them up while you figure out the best path to do so. I know there is alcohols that boost gun dmg. Not sure what dmg chems would work toward heavy so just try different ones at the queen. A good question to ask would be does strength increase increase heavy weapons? If so go carnivore you can eat strength boost meats. I try to avoid health boosts or endurance consumables because it makes my dmg fluctuate to much, plus when it wears off you take dmg. I do know players that don’t have trouble with that but I don’t like baby sitting my health so that’s a play style difference. Also you shouldn’t need the conditioning reduction card if you plan to farm the queen, I have 180 repair kits and they weigh you down if you don’t use them.
---
The non atom shop pirate hat is event only, not in the store (as far as anyone knows right now). Could change in the future though, so who knows?
---
Go to Silva Homestead (western part of The Forest, SW of Poseidon Power Plant near the water's edge). There's a barn right behind it where all the wild corn grows, and it usually has like 7-8 bags of chlorine, which produce 3 acid each. 
---
You can also claim acid workshops if you want passive income. I believe there's one in the north of Toxic Valley and Google-fu may yield more results.
---
I didn't want to insinuate you did - just get the caution out there asap because a lot of people don't know and will try. 
---
I agree you should be able to pay and receive what you pay for without too much friction and hassle.
---
It definitely seems that they are overloaded both by completing the remaining burndowns on the Wastelander's runway and also on the F1st C.S. side of things. 
---
Hope it happens soon my Grafton f(r)iend
---
It's alright , yep it must be a bug, the thing just disappear no body or meat pile.
---
The BIGGEST single tip I can add is... DON'T USE CONDUITS!
---
Wire glitching is one of the best single ways I've been able to conserve budget in a lighting heavy build. I have a single upward facing advanced power connector at each corner of my 4x4 square building on the first floor (each on a rug for the glitch), a similarly placed and upward facing one on the roof connected ALL THE WAY DOWN to the first floor. These 4 are then connected a single pole (also on a rug) that now resides in the rooftop dome where my generator hides.
---
So other than "incidentals" that require a direct power connection (vendor machines, doors, decontamination arch, etc) I have enough inductive power to put lights everywhere but dead center of the building. All for the cost of 5 connectors, 1 pole and 8 wires. And other than a very thin line in each corner that's nearly invisible, there is no visible wire clutter.
---
Find a resource deposit in the ground. Then build your camp there and build an extractor on top of it. 
---
I would try to farm mole miners for Black Titanium, because you’ll want to build your Excavator power armor as soon as you hit level 25. 
---
And choose a build immediately so you can plan your Special and perks.
---
Yeah, I like this. I know its *not* popular to buy Atoms, but this is about the store and sales not about the Atoms themselves. 
---
Offering very limited items doesn't encourage spending, it decreases it. If I buy 2400 atoms, and buy the one package a week or every other week then after that one package there is nothing else to buy, why would I ever buy a large atom bundle. That is also to say I've never bought that package before. If they keep re-releasing small amounts of things, there is a good chance I already own the item, and there is no point in buying more atoms. Have some days every now and then opening up tons of items, not just a plushie and a gold dagger skin.
---
Not using cannable perk and the option just doesn’t show up
---
Lol no I honestly didn't but thanks for freeing up a few slots in my machine. I'll just dump the extras in a train station suitcase.
---
I am sure Bethesda is thankful for people willing to ignore glaring issues and shell out money.
---
oh dang lo, I had something similar to that, those airdrop boxes from that quest up in Morgantown airport in the Collision quest or something somehow kept appearing for me randomly when I am at Sulton station, there was nothing in it. I haven't seen them (airdrop boxes) since I guess they patch it up or something
---
I wish that legendary scorch beast follow me so I can get the legendary :(, this wasn't my first time a legendary disappear too.
---
I love the gamma filter shots.
---
The graveyard shot looks real, like an old photo
---
Go on the Microsoft website, sign in and click “Account &gt; Services &amp; subscriptions &gt; Fallout 1st” and under payment settings it lets you cancel it and gives you your money back.” I know you’d rather have Fallout 1st rather than doing this, but you paid for it and didn’t get it, so at least get your money back. It’s not right for them to charge you and not allow you to use the service in which you paid for. Especially when the new cycle has started and you’ve missed a couple of days.
---
Ah, true, forgot about him. Will definitely watch it.
---
Yes. This works. Thanks!
---
What factory?
---
dang I agreed man, the time and effort and just to found out the legendary scorch beast or others legendary creatures gone before i get to loot it. It's quite frusrtrating
---
&gt;or they really do just think their players are that stupid. 
---
This one. Could you blame Bethesda really?
---
It's a weak sale, yea. It would have been nice to see something like Steam's digital sale with 50-70% off a ton of stuff, but the problem is that the cash shop for this game pushes out new assets too slowly for Bethesda to really give good deals on many things. In the end it's a hit-or-miss situation where if you have already purchased the few items with good deals, you have nothing new of interest.
---
In the end though there are far bigger fish to fry IMO. So it doesn't bother me much.
---
Ouch, yeah, most areas are pretty tame for camp defense. I've found a couple areas where the enemy spawn is either crazy low or even non existent, just have to move around and test various areas. One of my favorite areas was actually in the Bog, and didn't spawn any enemies, was nice not using turrets.
---
Friend request sent. And I have one sample of each.
---
No problem. Hope it gets sorted out and doesn’t happen again.
---
Dang, I got a Junkie Rowling pin on one before from the SBQ, I think i gave it to one of my friend's friends
---
Or to anyone else. Again, thanks for the help! Just needed a solution.
---
Come to the bloodied side... I get 450 carry weight and 500-600er/dr without power armor :)
---
Probably not, it's just reached a level of quiet seething.
---
Seems to have
---
for the most part yes, there are random upticks here and there.  the big thing is the brigading from people who never touched the game and hears via clickbait has ended.
---
Put them outside?
---
Voted down a lot, though it tends to go both ways.
---
I think most of the people who are disgusted by it have either moved on or given up.
---
Mm yea too true. I've been paying more attention to where I build lately. My newest place is a level 5 dude's camp in Savage Divide, which was really scary at first because it has a guaranteed enemy spawn right in the middle of it, but they tend to just be level 10ish mongrels or ghouls. 
---
It seems like the type of creature that spawns can be worse than its actual level.
---
Yh man happy hunting 👍
---
What do you mean by clickbait
---
I guess the one close to flatwoods (starter town i havent played in a few months)
---
Ouch, 3k per hit? Must have been some godly gatling, perhaps..? I will try to find it.   
---
Thing is, I don't have really time nor patience to change my build - worked a long time to perfect my current one around single thing (pvp); changing it would change basically everything I do and make most of my gear collection obsolete. Maybe, if I hade unlimited free time, but you know how it is...  
---
Also, 180 repair kits? You're quite the queen slayer, I give you that.
---
Cool, I believe I joined up with your discord I'm not too sure honestly since I never really used Discord all to often lol
---
I'd be happy if they just fixed the meshes. I hate the open space at the back of the raider ones but I can't slide them in around objects like rocks or trees to close the gap.
---
I've seen a few videos making claims but they never pan out, there's always some variable unaccounted for. And then others will try to replicate and end up with the same budgets as before.
---
Overall I feel that if there was a reliable way to increase budget, we would have figured it out by now since it's been over a year, and people would be sharing how to do it with firm proof.
---
They already confirmed this as an upcoming feature.
---
The game hasn't evolved, it was created with this in mind.
---
*adjusts tinfoil hat* all the youtubers spamming out videos of "game iz bad" and getting about 70-80% of the info wrong, but they had a catchy title
---
Do you have any Mutations that could be the cause?
---
Get them all. Backpacks only weigh 1 each.
---
the # is your current stat rating
---
the +/- just means you have a positive or negative effect  on said statline
---
effects tab will show you whats causing the +/- and how much the effect id
---
I already removed most mutations, only keeping Marsupial. Worse part is, if I Equip Class Freak Perk card, the specials become even more negative than before!
---
Private worlds.  Not servers.
---
It's not really smooth and lag free but it is slightly better on private
---
Check the pictures i uploaded. There is no visible effect on what is causing them. I already removed mutations, addictions, all clothing, etc. Nothing that could be subtracting the numbers
---
Wish it looked like that on console
---
I’ve had same issues. My carry weight has dropped , my DR has fallen. I’ve tried same to remove my armor but nothing helps.  I have no clue what has happened either
---
You can always just arrange them front-to-back and label the sides, if you want.  You can fit four of them on a single foundation like that.
---
and you stats are mostly negative?
---
What pisses me off is that I just felt it happening. One moment i had carry weight of 500+ and over 32 strength and then boom, -13 strength on a 15 strength on special character. FFS
---
Does the Auto-revive armor or M. Stranger proc your Charisma perks?
---
- EMT
---
- Injector
---
- Quack Surgeon
---
- Healing Hands
---
- Spiritual Healer
---
Back in the first month of FO76 it twice crashed my PS4 so hard I couldn't even get back to the PS4 menu.  it hard-crashed the entire OS and gave me coloured lines across the screen.   Never seen a game do that before or since!  Glad they nailed that bug!
---
No, guy.
---
I’m an endgame player that knows where to farm everything.
---
I’m NOT going to keep playing this game when everyone else can pickup every item of scrap they can, while I’m stuck carefully managing my inventory.
---
It’s not a ‘choice’. Given the choice between picking up all scrap and keeping a small supply, show me a 1st subscriber that does the latter. I’ll wait.
---
I still think we should be able to scrap ammo for highly reduced amounts of lead, etc.
---
Explore and collect gears?  Jesus Christ... if you need gears you don't spend hours running around the map rummaging for junk that contains gears, like most scrap you get this shit off of enemies.  All you have to do is pick a spot like the substation near watoga, kill the deathclaw, server hop and repeat and you have more gears then you would ever reasonably need in short time.
---
Beyond the few pieces of scrap that are actually rare and commonly enough used that you need to hold onto whatever you find actually hoarding most scrap is for people too inexperienced to realize just how easily you can pick this stuff up on a whim.
---
I play on PC and PS4 and was really surprised to find PC is more stable even tho PS4 hardware is so consistent and it's been out for half a decade, and the OS is linux based!  I assume (I know I know) that it's because Fallout was originally developed on PC and ported to consoles.  Just a guess
---
You don’t get it or you’re pretending not to get it. Exploration and looting are one and the same.
---
Sunshine Meadows near Flatwoods
---
Going along with what /u/thecentury was saying, what are your PC specs? I doubt mine could run Reshade and still get a decent framerate (Ryzen 2600 / 1060 / 16GB), but who knows.
---
I havent been able to get a single badge yet, that is why i want to know what would be the best option
---
I’m so sick of the circle jerking of this game!
---
That sucked. At least we had the infinite weight glitch back then, it’s pretty funny how so many people had to use it because being encumbered all the time sucked
---
I used to do this for a while. Sell a lot of stuff right after a queen run for sure.
---
You are amazing! Thank you!!
---
it did, together with the playerbase. 1st drove away lots of the remaining players.
---
wastelanders better be a godsend or the game is as good as dead. I mean, I'm sure it's more profitable now than it was before. less freeloaders, more paying customers, etc. but from a playercount perspective the game is barren currently.
---
That sheepsquatch quill shot though, damn.. Amazing!
---
I used Excavator for ages on my Responders characters, but with my current BoS guy, I'm running T-60 and Ultracite (obviously). The loss of that extra +100 has made me cut down significantly on what I carry, and it's been kind of refreshing, to be honest. Still dig that Firefighter Excavator, though.
---
Are you running starched genes? If not it seems you got Herd Mentality mutation, you must be in a team for it to show in pip boy status or else it won’t show
---
If you're an "endgame" player that still picks up every piece of junk you lay eyes on then you have problems.  I'm nearing level 350 and not only do I not pick up most junk any more I don't even pick up most chems or aid... because by that level you had better damn well learned what you need and what you don't need to pick up and almost everything should fall into the "definitely don't need" category.
---
Comme ci comme ca.
---
Yeah but it was done in...you know....a day....and worked as well as anything did at release date of fallout 4, where they still havent fixed multiple bugs from launch of either fallout 4 or 76
---
I spent the last week mucking around with this, as a VATS sniper who was using chameleon.  I can't say for sure that chameleon doesn't effect sneak, but what I realised was, it doesn't matter.  What's important is, what's more combat effective?  Unyielding or chameleon?  What I found was all the extra special points I get with unyielding more than made up for the 3 I lose by fitting Sneak-3.  My gun is so much more accurate, and I have more AP, so I'm killing things before they kill me.  Either Sneak-3 is *as* effective as chameleon, or more; but after running full unyielding for a week I'm not going back to chameleon.  I'd hit less frequently and die more.  So that's the real answer; whether it sneaks or not, it's not as effective in PVE overall.
---
Pretty much this.
---
The brigading picks up whenever Juicehead, Jim Sterling, or whoever release a new video that mentions 76.  It's like they instantly mobilize an outrage mob that sweeps through and craps on everything, filling the sub with tedious "Everything is horrible" posts and downvoting every post they can find.
---
The irony is, if you're bored and look at their post history, most of them either never post here and don't even play the game, and/or you'll find they are fans of games with far more aggressive microtransaction schemes (i.e. Fortnite, Call of Duty, etc) they turn a blind eye to.  They solely want to be "part of the crowd."
---
D: nobody ever recognize me as a vilain
---
I hadn’t checked but I was able to carry 390, now I’m 360. My DR was 392 and now it’s 326. I didn’t change any perk cards. Same mutations I always had. Even my DPS went from 304 on my melee to 286.  And oh my gosh... every other battle my armor breaks
---
Still costs caps to fast travel however, you can now travel to events for free. Stash box size is 800 but I gotta say, the FO 1st scrap box will hold ALL your junk and has no limit. So with that, the stash is MUCH easier to manage. There are still bugs and yes, blue screens do occur from time to time but that feeling the game is unfinished has dissipated, at least for me. There will be an update, "Wastelanders" coming up in February or March that all the regular players are excited about.
---
There's no point going about it constantly but people who were unhappy with Fallout 1st aren't any less unhappy. If anything more have joined the ranks with those that paid for 1st getting screwed by support (or really lack thereof).
---
I get it. That’s why I said just save the perks up and take your time to learn bloodied. Start with just getting perk cards that you can easily swap out. Prioritize what your lacking first if you feel tanky go for dmg perk changes if your dying to much and it’s not fun to play then focus on dmg resistance changes first. If your still into the build and want to keep going down that path then think about special point moving. It seems some people see bloodied as something that you just put on and can solo the queen. It’s true that you can quickly get a solid dmg boost but it takes a while to get to that crazy queen killer dmg. I have done hundreds of queens and the beginning was the hardest. Dying over and over and over and over lol. RadShield is a nice chem to have to manage radiation. If you farm biv and learn that voltage hefinweizer drink I think that’s the alcohol that boosts your guns. Bobble heads and magazines have gun dmg boosts you can add those. 3 dmg boosts right there. If you find meats with good boosts like I said you can stack meat unlimited. AP refresh will make you more tanky while using dodgey. Even though the queen is explosive resistance it’s still in your weapons so why not squeeze out a little more dmg using the explosive boost perk card in agility. Here is the changes I made to your build I would do but focus more on the perk card changes and getting starched genes so you can have the gun dmg boost mutation I put.(https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3379a9&amp;d=sq2s32sr2pg0ph0pi0c72i12ip2a12ls2lt2lu2sg2s82e31eu0c81ib2a71a04&amp;w=l71lq0ld2&amp;m=5c2e&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
It's not perfect, but it is better. Still get the short freezes sometimes. So about 50% better.
---
100% yes on the 1911s, it was single handedly my favorite part of that FNV DLC. Adding that would put me in heaven. Oh, that and the bull barrel for the .44, the one that's in every image for the .44 but not available to slap on. Would be cool to get a .50 upgrade on the 10mm, skin it sort of DE like, limit the rounds it holds, make the recoil *bananas*, and the sound satisfying. Pistols are a fun way to play, they just need a little love. Moving those pistol perks to Perception would help popularize pistols too.
---
I'm not having herd mentallity, at lest not to my knowledge. I had it a few times and it showed on the mutations list on the effects tabs. Maybe removing all of the mutations altogether to do a test.
---
maybe the same bug. That suck... just get naked and remove all perk cards and see how your special looks
---
I treat my exploration like actual exploration.  If I need crystals I head to lucky hole and I walk out with enough crystals to do what I need and a handful of whatever else might have caught my attention to refill my stores back home.  What I DON'T do is leave with five times as much crystal as I need, every lead node and all of the worldly possessions of every Mole Miner in the mine strapped to my back.
---
The power armor and hazmat suit couple got me feelin’ some kinda way.
---
This sounds right, I have HM and if I've taken the card class freak off, everything goes down of course.
---
Thing is, even at that point my stats are well above most with my 3 unyielding pieces on, so.im not sure that's all of it, unless a disease was with it. There could have been a diseased cricket?
---
Start with the high capacity, then just grind for the others depending on what you prefer. I went for the lead-lined mod next because I prefer to avoid using power armor as much as possible.
---
Most of the people that quit where the very vocal minority's of various social media outlets. I still see full servers regularly and play pretty much every day on PS4 . Most players I encounter have first. Several of my friends that quit last December recently showed back up in the wasteland with first memberships . It may be dead to those vocal minority's, but it's not dead in general.
---
Nice
---
Broadsiders can't have the explosive legendary effect
---
I got enough actually and I made the set. But thanks for the offer.
---
I believe Life Saving works.  The Mysterious Stranger does.
---
The thing is, it's ultimately unreliable because how the game determines when you can be resurrected, versus if you instantly die, is very opaque.
---
Life Saving also doesn't stack like you might think it does.  Two pieces doesn't result in consistent resurrection.  I've heard it explained as each piece having a 50% chance of proc'ing, rather than being additive.
---
I never got the subscription and won’t ever. Behind paying for my cable bill, the live service yearly for Xbox and then the 60 bucks I spent on the game up front I’m not adding another monthly payment. Corporations are great at bleeding the pockets of the people. Most just don’t care. Just a bummer to see how company’s play with their supporters.
---
Excavators trash, get yourself a nice set of strangler
---
I've said the same thing since day 1 of FO1st. That's why I will not subscribe, and that's why I haven't felt like playing since they announced it. I preordered immediately after the E3 announcement. I've played since beta. It's wasn't what I wanted it to be, but I enjoyed it for what it was. I had high hopes for wastelanders and whatever else lay ahead. Then FO1st just broke the experience for me. They have slowly creeped towards a pay to win model, and if you're ok with that more power to you. But it's not what I want to play. Just having the stash box by itself fundamentally changes the game
---
Thanks! Some that might look like the Gamma filter were actually the rare times I captured a Radstorm.
---
Sorry for the ranting Lol. I hope some of this helps.
---
Because there is no such thing as hoarding in this game. Junk collection is an essential part of the game it goes hand in hand with exploration, weapon and armor crafting etc if you want to call that hoarding then you yourself are a hoarder as well
---
Yea it sucks, I bought one for 2k if a guy. I could just sell it again for 2k but I would kinda feel bad
---
If a newbie is from release ok I didn't get the memo 😂
---
Ok I’m adding you. I’ll be on today, I’m on rn as a matter of fact. YESSSS that’s what I wanna do, launch a nuke but also get good gear and I need help with building. My camp looks dumb lol. 
---
GT MurdaBoyManny
---
Bethesda: no idiots are still buying crap from us
---
I meet a decent amount of people in excavator armor. Typically in workshops. Always just before I liberate hundreds of pounds of junk.
---
I got my own set of excavator armor with calibrated shocks when I need to be able to fast travel again.
---
Ok I’m adding you 
---
I’ll be on today 
---
This is interesting. It did sound a lot smoother than I remember and a little more complex. I would like to test this.
---
I have FO1st though my membership will end shortly.
---
The scrapbox is a great convenience but isn’t needed....it just makes it easier when you don’t have to through and get rid of all the useless junk taking up space (bone I am looking at you).
---
 My normal stash is nearly full but the vast majority of that is just clutter.
---
I have four vendors (armour/weapons, ammo, chems/bobbleheads, and plans/mods/junk).
---
I have tens of thousands of ammo of sorts that won’t sell and I won’t use...so I can ditch those.
---
I have 100 or so missiles that I can’t even give away in my vendor.
---
Point is I can easily go back to the stash...but it’s just a hassle...and that’s why this scrap box is predatory...it’s so convenient, yet the price is too steep.
---
We’re you trying to get inside the engineering room and couldn’t?
---
In addition to what others have mentioned, all of the dead cave crickets in Glassed Cavern will also have acid on them.  
---
You can't just server hop those, need to be emptying other containers, but it's worth a side trip every so often.
---
I'm still pissed off.
---
You don't have -13 Strength, you have 13 Strength which is your base 15 being reduced by 2 points via some effect(mutation,disease,addiction,etc), the same applies for the other stats. I think that the Herd Mentality mutation won't shot in your mutation tab if you are not in a team and could explain your stats.
---
Regardless of how you leave an area THE GAME provides loot on every enemy you kill and in every corner of every spot you visit. It’s meant to be picked up whether you do or not is up to you but this is a fundamental aspect of the game.
---
Well they weren't at first. It was cosmetic only at launch...
---
I just want to add that allowing infinite junk does nothing to server stability or your machine's performance, but infinite apparel does. I have dozens and dozens of clothe items, armor and weapons in my stash and it bugged like crazy. The lag was insane, it took too long to scroll, and I'd always end up taking the wrong thing because I thought it was done scrolling but it's wasn't. I've since offloaded most of the armors onto an alt character and my my stash flows much better now.
---
I’m not sure how to describe it but like right after you insert the seed canisters in the cases and enter the residential break room with the workbenches and you must proceed to the next step in Washout, you have to listen to the announcement and the announcement never played and I was stuck in a room killing bugs for an hour
---
It sounds like the ones which haven't been rewarded yet may be part of the Christmas seasonal event next month.  Something to keep an eye on.
---
Kotaku
---
I'm not sure the people who bought the game to play it are freeloaders.
---
Is it the whole set or just the helmet can be found at Whitespring?
---
You can remove depth of field, cinematic 30fps-endorsed motion blur, and the cheap FXAA/TAA. Bloom is still turned up to 11 and can't be disabled... 
---
I bet everyone at Bethesda is myopic and doesn't use glasses when playing, for sure as hell using glasses or not makes no fucking difference at the smeared blur that vanilla F76 is.
---
I've had Herd Mentality twice without it showing in my mutations list, hop in the shower and sure enough, Herd Mentality.
---
May the RNGesus be with you.
---
If the game actually functioned properly and was receiving regular large updates it would potentially be justified. Right now though? Fuck that.
---
I have 1 strength on my character (1 endurance too for that matter) and carry neath 300lbs thanks to unyielding armour.
---
I don’t see how people need to carry so much ALL the time.  In walking around with 2500 50cal ammo, 1500 .45 ammo and two fully modded rifles, as well as a boatload of diluted chems and water and food.
---
The beauty is exactly what’s keeping me playing. Bugs are bad but leaving the wasteland is worse.
---
For survivability, IMHO, damage reduction via blocker, serendipity, dodgy, or ricochet are at least as important as Dr ect. You may know the mid for your chest and not your arm, or leg but not chest and so on.
---
We’re you awarded the bulk ammo scrap in that room with the benches? Then entered the room with the 2 floors and 2 generators
---
Even if they didn't give everyone unlimited storage at the very least an extra 800 pound storage specifically for junk would be fine. Apparently that's asking too much though.
---
Would be an interesting way to pick next camp site
---
Communist detected.
---
well yeah, otherwise I would never even have bought the game
---
Try not using bloody mess with energy weaponson players or explosive energy weapons with bloody mess also
---
My stash is at about 675 lbs the last time I played and it consists of very good weapons and armor I’m selling, weapons and armor I switch out if I want to go with a different set of cards, aid I have produced for use, flux I sell, and ammo. Not a single bit of clutter.
---
OK I'll give it a try...
---
Please tell me how I am a communist
---
But it would be just as simple to give unlimited stash to players as it would be an extra 800lbs. Literally no difference in effort or stability
---
Never encountered any animosity, people just use my tent if they need it.
---
These are fantastic! 😍
---
Holy f*** that was it. I don't believe it... Thanks mate. I own you a coffee. Time to get some serums again. And yes I usually carry starched genes. Must has been some time and I sis r realized it
---
I'm sorry. I will commit ritual suicide after the lunch.
---
I'll probably wait after the holidays for more people to play.
---
To think the Recruitment Blues achievement is unlocked by only 10.01% of players. Would be nice to get it when it's rare.
---
You fundamentally fail to understand a basic aspect of this game or any like it.  Enemy loot drops are not there on the expectation that you pick up every single thing and hold onto it.  They're options.  You pick it up if you need it,  you don't pick it up if you don't need it.  If you see something you don't need and pick it up anyway just because it exists that isn't a failure on the game's part,  tha'ts a failure on your part.  You're not a fucking robot automated to pick up every item you see, use your god damn judgement.
---
That was it. Dang that bug. Thanks mate
---
Murgle ftw. In the ash heap, he lives in a broken down coffee stand. His animations are great, and he has a name.
---
So if a player wants to fully experience the game mechanics of the game they fully paid for, subscription is the only way
---
Yes yes that’s what happened
---
50% sounds not good enough for me. I was hoping for better performance when I pay the subscription. Thanks for your time.
---
Ok 👍🏽 in “washout” you have to go to the computer across from the mainframe room upper floor and get the codes then jump back near the entrance and look up the codes in those computers to advance 
---
“Dead in the water” has the announcement
---
Hey look, if you want to slow your pace down and shop every looted container for necessities go right ahead. That’s the way you prefer to play. You must also have the ability to break down every piece of junk to the component just by observing that piece of junk. In all my hours of playing this game I have never seen another player enter an area not just about pick up every item. 
---
You’re a rare player, and very likely full of sh*t for the sake of argument
---
I didn’t think of different armour for different situations as I just use unyielding.
---
I am hanging onto some weapons just in case I want to start another character sometime, as well as ammo for those weapons (a bloody shotgun with 2500+ ammo).
---
If I start coming across sentinel armour and stuff for a full health build I’d hang on to that too.
---
So yeah, my stash space would shrink...BUT, I do currently have 30 different pieces of armour/weapons for sale so I could free space up by scriping the stuff that probably won’t sell.
---
Point still stands in that the stash box is predatory (in my opinion) and is proof they could easily up stash space by a lot...just put a cap on the number of non-scrapped junk item types you can store in each category (so 30 different AID types for example).
---
What are the stats on the RR mod?
---
Fixer is great for sneak-centric build, but handmade is still king for dps out of sneak. I love my hvy guns 50cal is the sweet spot, and vampire=tank. If you go vampire, get vanguard armor, you stay at full health all the time.
---
Oh that would be festive!
---
Oh okay thank you
---
Blocking in 76 against enemies is awful because latency seems to affect a successful block.  The same with legendary melee weapons that deal reflect damage.  Sometimes the reflect damage applies, most of the time it doesn't.  It's very damn annoying.
---
I would love to see the way you approach a ghoul hoard. You must spend at least 20 minutes observing every little piece of loot on each body to determine whether or not you need it
---
If they make the Scrapbox free for everyone, instead of P2W, I might just come back to this game. This game has the most tedious inventory management of any Fallout or BGS.
---
I’m actually with you here. Played a solid 6 hours last night with no crashes. Definitely sounds like OP has corrupted files.
---
Just the helmet. The uniform costume is valuable.
---
Outside of the quests you find in the taxidermy place, Just a few bugs and the wendigo have been added
---
I always get so close to death when well fed wears off.
---
I wonder if serendipity can be triggered from this.  I know it does for fall damage.
---
Keeps in mind, you will get a lot of *useless* junk, which will add **weight**.  Be prepared to walk to a workbench after hitting a mound with that many maps
---
The buildings across from the Ag center in flatwoods usually have 3 boxes spawn there. It's where i get mine.
---
Wait what?
---
Nice guide! I wish Bethesda would give us actual values. 
---
And let's not forget some of the myths out there...the biggest has to be: Build budget is related to player level....that is absolutely false
---
Remember, they can't let everyone unlimited stash cost BeCaUsE iT wOuLd BrEaK ThE SeRvEr
---
Blatant fucking lie and it was bought because bethesda games are so broken it sounded realistic.
---
It's dose keep stacking up to 90%
---
Look closely at your options when you loot the FG.  I thought mine was glitched until someone else pointed this out...it's not obvious :\
---
I got yellow. It came spiked and all, mid level.
---
No problem, glad it worked. Same reason I never take starched genes off.
---
Knightrider Six. I'm on alot during the week. Love helping people.
---
Ah I thought the “genuinely curious” posts had died down as of late!
---
This. These pins auto scrap as do deathclaw hides. When I needed 5 DC hides for one of those scout badges, I placed them in my vend for 25K so that they'd be there when I needed.
---
I did the same with FO4. Building up settlements with NPCs. I’m basically a farmer in the game lol.
---
Oooo thats soon, hopefully they dont delay it for months like they did with es blades
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Same here. Must has been some oversight on my end
---
While I don’t disagree that Strangler is nice, getting mods can be a bit of a chore. It uses ultracite mods which drop from SBQ and aren’t cheap to buy from a player.
---
Serendipity can not be triggered from it as you arent taking any damage, only losing max hp. I've spent enough time messing around with the different values and commands in fallout/elder scrolls games to know
---
Looking forward to building in Appalachia, thanks for the hint!
---
shhh that sub is a secret dont ruin it
---
I remember when it was 200lbs....the struggle was real. No purveyor, no player vendors,
---
Apparently legendary resistance to certain enemy types is always better than flat out better DR.
---
So if you can get one piece of zealots, exterminators, etc it will be more effective that better DR but no such effect.
---
That said, I almost never get seen so there are better legendary effects to have on my unyielding armour (like AP refresh, poison resistance, etc).
---
We've past the denial and anger phase and moved into bartering.  Mostly it's "the scrap box should be free to all!" or similar.    
---
Give it time to move on to depression and then finally, acceptance.
---
Thanks, I sort of figured but wanted to check because I THINK the character makes the “damage taken” grunt noise).
---
If it’s not there just reload a few times. The bot WILL have it, I did this myself.
---
What is it now?
---
And I'm over here and I got it first time doing the event :P
---
I think it just appears at the armor workbench cause I was after it and once I had the basic backpack I was able to mod it to arktos.
---
So I had earned it previously and didn't know it.
---
It’s a lot better tbh and I really enjoy it more now after starting to play again a month ago.
---
Travel costing Caps is much less of an issue now that players have robot vendors AND each vendor has the total number of caps available each day (so rather than having to treacle to 7 different vendors to sell stuff you can just go to 1.
---
It has the ONLY inventory management of any fallout or BGS
---
Do you make standard backpack then add skin to it or will be at the top in different types of backpack?
---
I felt the same way.  
---
I am afraid that they will tweak the in game mechanics to make the scrap box a requirement for play. 
---
This can be done by simply raising either the weight or build material requirements.  Something minute can have a domino effect on how this functions. 
---
In the end I knew this was coming, some sort of subscriptions. From a business stand point the servers they are using to run this game aren't exactly free. And as a business you want to do your best to remain profitable in the long term.   
---
What I hoped for was expansions like NukaWorld
---
Thanks, I was curious about that
---
Add skin, check bc I did it like 3 times and randomly had it
---
You can spend 6k on the plans. Or, ask someone nicely to mod them for you.
---
Location Tip: If you're looking for a camp location with preexisting crops and crop beds, there are several farmhouse type areas just east of Hornwright Estates in the south part of the map, on the fringe of Ash Heap; one of them has a glass greenhouse and another one nearby has soil rows and a few plants.
---
Where in the bloody hell is this place? 
---
​
---
It shows “crafting item unlocked: Arktos backpack” or something like that in the top left corner of the screen when the event ends, it doesn’t come up in the rewards list. My main character took 4-5 tries to get it, my alt got it in 1 try. I don’t believe it’s a skin I believe it’s in the craft menu, but that part I can’t totally remember
---
The suit provides 100, Calibrated shocks for the legs add 50 each (Every type of PA can get Shocks) then you have the “logging in bonus” that only ExPA gets.
---
One of my favorite things to do was to gathing junk and use them as set pieces in f4. I had a speakeasy bed and breakfast at one place
---
I tested my new quad on a deathclaw today, and at full charge (20 ammo) the floating damage read out 3546, which I felt was very respectable.  (I was in vats, just to make sure I didn't miss.)
---
However, the damage bar on the deathclaw only showed a little booboo hit, and I then had to kill it the old fashioned way.  :(  Very disappointed.
---
Is this a new bug?  Or an old one?
---
We both know that's not true and not what I'm talking about. 
---
If you want to store insane amounts of materials and tonnes of weapons/armor you'll literally never use be my guest. But don't cry when you have no space.
---
I don't have to do a detailed analysis of every container or break down junk in my head... because if I want anything that can be found in a container or can be broken down from junk I have better places to directly look for it when I actually need it.
---
If I enter a dungeon with a gym I don't go "LEAD! LEAD! LEAD!" as I scoop up every dumbell in the area and immediately go overencumbered.  I just think to myself that I already have xxxx rounds of ammo, a few leftover bulk lead at home and that Lucky Hole exists and move on.
---
There's a shame that comes with having a first account. Not seeing it brought up as much so less fighting ?
---
Yuo said you were in excavator... 
---
consider adding motion assist servos to the torso - they are +2 str
---
With those and calibrated shocks, you should be able to carry up to 1721 # and still run.  
---
You wont be able to FT, but at least you’ll be able to move at a reasonable speed
---
wow so cool!
---
It's a weird yet awesome feeling that you have infinite storage space in fallout 4 after playing 76.
---
Got mine for not doing fuck all... I fast traveled to the event, it ended, I got the backpack plan. I stared blankly at the screen for a moment in disbelief and then happily moved on to my armor workbench.
---
As you are roaming around, look for an empty nuka shine bottle wherever you happen to be visiting.  If you see one, then that spot is a post blackout landing zone.
---
Discerning users of the Sunshine Meadows processing plant know that Fancy Lads Snack Cakes are the best. Because they're for FANCY LADS.
---
I originally made the standard backpack then the arktos option for the skin showed up as I remember.
---
You pass up lead? Yeah you are special
---
Fancy Lads for all you Madlads out there!!
---
Was just about to say - herd mentality - had the same the other day.
---
Instead of chirping, listen for the crickets going "whoa maaaaannnnnnnn"
---
There is just too much junk, or I scrap more than I should and don't craft enough. I have over 2,000 steel scrap and hundreds of others.
---
That is super wierd rng. I run 5 toons, and all 5 have it. Some of them have never had a three animals alive win. Maybe it is bigger percentage drop on the lesser loot tables?
---
You are probably experiencing one of the melee bugs. I guess you see the damage numbers pop up but the turrets don't take actual damage. Try hitting it from a different position and outside VATS.
---
You should probably just come to terms with the fact that this is one of the worst games ever made from a technical and consumer standpoint in this era of gaming.
---
The dog part makes Futurama's Jurassic Bark look like a Monty Python skit. It's devastating.
---
I don't care about the damage but I wish they'd add a massive exaggerated knock back effect so whatever enemy you hit just goes flipping across the terrain like it got hit by a train. You could win fights with it just by punting all the enemies into the distance.
---
I think the o ly thing you have to do is rez someone else everything else is solo. You can also get the small backpack plan from Morgantown airport.
---
Could always start over and check out all the early mission qol improvements
---
Let me take out my executioner gamma gun 😈
---
There's a newbie backpack at Morgantown Airport that gives +30 carry capacity.
---
Can also confirm. Junk works great.
---
There are ways but it's harder like the swimming one it's easier just to team up with someone for that one quest instead of doing something like taken a Pic of every freaking animal that ever exist and besides u will learn that 76 is better with other players (if u find the right ones but u do play on Xbox and when I played on Xbox alot of people were rude
---
Thanks friend! I'll mission to the airport and see what i can see...
---
YES.
---
I want a bunch of various creatures butts on plaques so I can decorate my Wasteland Proctology waiting room
---
that's how they see it.
---
I don't know if anyone has suggested this, but junk is a good source of materials for all manner of things.
---
Worth a try.
---
Thanks for the quick responses. Didn't know i vould get the plans from Morgantown Airport, so i'll set a course and see what i can see.
---
It's in the overseer box after the mini dungeon there inside the terminal. It's capacity is no where near the possum backpack. Im on ps4 but im sure someone who plays on xbox would be more than willing to help you out in the quest then leave you alone after you rez them.
---
Cool , do you know if rad damage has the same effect, didn’t think to try my gamma gun which would be a lot faster than a syringer I’d imagine.
---
Yes everyone seems to be saying, laser rifles / energy weapons or bloody mess has the possibility to trigger it, i think it may be when you’re turned to ash, goo or pieces and you hit seek revenge too quick for the game to realise what it’s doing, then it puts you in god mode.
---
I havent named mine, but its always in my inventory.
---
Calibrated shocks, motion assist servos (+2 str), and hauls up to 1720# without crawling.
---
(Can only get 1420 out of the other PAs)
---
Thank you! That's awesome, cheers
---
[This Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/edit#heading=h.q5bprqs5522u) has info on where to get all the materials.
---
(Seriously, we need an FAQ list or a bot for all of these kinds of questions...)
---
I'll still miss the first blow on occasion, but not as much as I do in Adventure mode. Melee is improved, but there is still something glitchy that I think goes deeper than server stability with it. Fast travel is also still borked everywhere. It can take multiple attempts to get it to work sometimes. I usually arm/disarm my weapon and then it works again.
---
IMO the biggest gain from the 1st sub is the stupid Scrapbox. Once you get used to just shoving all your scrap into it and being able to just play without extensive inventory management you'll be hard pressed to play without it.
---
Lol I guess I haven’t beaten everything. How do I beat the sbq by myself lol I thought that was impossible
---
Roleplay is fun. Play a raider and go out and piss people off so much they come make a post in this subreddit.
---
Thanks for the reply. I have no doubt that FO76 is better with others (i'm a long time co-op player with friends from back in the day), but my play times are inconsistent and sporadic, so i don't really bother trying to meet new crew.
---
Or maybe i'm just old.
---
Anything that allows me to get rid of the ammo I don’t use. I know I could just drop it but where’s the fun in that. . And plans. Can we sell plans to vendors for even a fraction of their worth. Or maybe trade 4 and get one new to you plan. I’ve been dumping them on low level players but wouldn’t mind getting something in return.
---
I like playing with my friends
---
So, how do I do more damage when I get all my perks and stuff organized?
---
Getting your daily 1400 should net you almost 10k in a week. 
---
Knowing your play style, level, and potential recipes would help in providing an accurate and achievable way to recommend your cap grinding.
---
Booooo!!  Haha *shakes fist in the air*
---
That's how they get ya...
---
TLDR; Guns cause server issues junk does not.
---
Junk was never really apart of the server issues. Junk items have a very small foot print. It's weapons and armour that cause issues. Junk items are essentially just one variable which is amount possessed ( steel = 365 or duct tape = 76) while weapons are number possessed, barrel, stock, grip, sight, magazine, barrel attachment, skin, any other modification, and up to three different legendary effects. Roughly 11 different variables per weapon that the server needs to constantly keep track of. That's why when they fixed duping and culled dupers' stashes server performance was great awhile. Let's say there is 20 people on a server with an average of 6 3* legendary guns per person that's 1320 (20x6x11) variables now multiply that by 20 again since it has to send that information to everyone. 26,400 variables the server has to keep sending and verifying. Each person would need to have 1320 unique junk items to equal the server load equivalent to just 6 guns per person. Oh and I forgot about durability so that's an additional thing that weapons, armour, and food have that needs to constantly update and be verified. 
---
 I am all for saying fuck Fallout 1st but junk itself is not an issue.
---
Thanks, yep that's a good tip. I'll keep an eye out.
---
Kill alot of things then sell what u get from them even if it's not useful sell it to venders 100 items that cost 1 cap is still hundred caps
---
I’m level 81 and I have a shit ton of junk. I do take all the junk I can find when looting and then discard what I don’t need.
---
i do that but they’re so heavy! power armor is your best friend when you’re collecting guns. also when you sell stuff don’t forget to use bargain perk rank 3.
---
Yeah, weird kneejerk downvotes for factual comments are interesting to me. I DO notice when I am on my phone and I tap to scroll down sometimes it will downvote someone cuz it's at the edge of the screen there lol.. I wonder what percentage of downvotes are from mobile accidents like that.
---
Get the backpack and weapon weight reduction armor
---
Both great ideas! My current build is country-western influenced so I'm doing the same thing with oil lamps. :D
---
Use the website nukes dragons and find perks that increase your damage. (Bloodied mess, one man army, tank killer) then invest in them to increase your damage
---
Oh, do crickets actually spawn in uncanny caverns, never seen one, especially when it's worth 10 atoms
---
Isn't the only thing that requires another player the rez an ally bit? I got that one by sticking near the crowd in a SBQ/Imposter fight and stabbing the first person to eat it with a stim. But I also play PC so I don't know how often people do those on XB1.
---
Pvp :)
---
Depending on what the junk is you could always find buyers on trade markets. Or sell to vendors, bulking if needed. 
---
If you can run nuke zones, I would recommend farming them and making serums(if you have the recipes) 
---
Could also sell script weapons and legendaries. I generally get 25c per script. Another option is bulk meds crafting through painfully boeing grinding of world spawn creatures. Selling stimpacks at 8 per or 5 per for orders over 100. If you choose to do crafting of meds dont forget super duper and chemist.
---
Pick a build and choose perks around it.
---
Yeah a lot of times they do.
---
I make it so if you want some respond I am on every Thursday Friday and Saturday and every other sunday so if you want some I will sell you it for 3 caps per
---
Saw a guy one-shot it.  No hakz or sploitz.  
---
Just one helluva glass cannon build.  
---
I can solo the SBQ with my meh build, it just takes awhile.
---
It was in the beta and the  first month or so
---
If you find serums in peoples vendors for under like 300 they sell at 500 caps each at robot vendors. Stock them up and sell consistently and you’ll profit a bunch.
---
Watoga
---
I sell chems and mothman egg omelettes...
---
I think your concern has been answered. 
---
You definitely do not have to team up with anyone ever to get the pioneer scout backpack. 
---
You will see people request help here from time to time but it’s only to expedite the process. I answered many requests for help with this and just stood in front of a super mutant to die and let them revive me. I never had to talk to any of these people ever again. 
---
If you want me to stand in front of a super mutant for you let me know. Xbox GT Astrosguy
---
Hi I'm back, no dice I havent received anything. What is your username?
---
Remember when Fallout 76 was good? No one does...
---
Don't! Lol there's SO much to keep up with in this game, and stuff changes on a dime. It happens :)
---
And it shouldn’t be that way in a game I payed full price there and the mechanic exists 
---
Then again it’s my choice whether I want to accept it or not
---
Amazing post. Thanks for your effort!!
---
Im hoping there are maybe some internal areas I can run through, as they tend to be pretty densely packed vs stumbling around Watoga finding a bot here and there. Thanks for the response though
---
Nuke silos.
---
I don’t like it but I accept it. If a player wants to buy it than go ahead. I think 60 dollars is enough money to spend on a game so I don’t buy it but personally I’m okay with it.

Someone suggested having vendor machines as the blue money tills. Make them be able to sit on a shelf or bookcase and it would reduce a lot of space and give a more shop feel.
---
Look at any farm location or places with a greenhouse. Tons of fertilizer, which can be broken down into acid. Also, I tend to find a lot of Hallucigen gas canisters. 4 acid per can when broken down.
---
I just go around buying good legendaries for cheap from other players, and then sell them on Reddit for at least 3 times the initial price.
---
Hadnt thought about this, seems like I could probably milk at least 100 bots in just a few minutes if I let the event run and ignore the imposter. Any idea on around how many can spawn?
---
Last time I did this I just went inside the whitespring and kept killing the robots in there since they spawn unlimited.

I just posted a map in a reply to the other poster.

I don't remember what state the greenhouse is in, but I recall it was usable if a little cluttered, and there were some mutfruit plants inside.
---
Don’t they not give any do or drops though? I’m not trying to kill several thousand robots for nothing.
---
&gt; I had been running silos to further these but have run out of keycards, so it doesn’t seem all that worthwhile anymore.
---
Yes that is correct they won’t give you drops.
---
I don't really understand what the keycard has to do with it.
---
Although it's "rude" to act like you're doing a silo and not launch, there's nothing saying that you have to.
---
Do you not know what Lucky Hole is?  You can get so much lead that even after crafting a few thousand bullets and bulking some for keeping you'll still have leftovers to drop on the ground.
---
Theyre saying they dont want to go all the way through a silo to then not launch a nuke
---
Zero?  Do people seriously not know how easy it is to get almost every piece of scrap in this game?
---
Lol
---
I'd wait till wastelanders comes out to be honest, its been a very dry few months
---
lol
---
Came here for the insight since it happens to me too. 
---
Fortunately I have healing factor too so I barely see any health drop, I just hear nerd rage trigger.
---
What the hell man, paid Private Worlds I ALREADY PAID SOXTY GOD DAMN DOLLARS FOR THIS POS. I’m subbing to their predatory subscription service. They lost faith in me as soon as they started putting requested features behind a paywall. Wastelanders announcement was the briefest moment of excitement I had for this miserable game. I don’t how someone can be ok with giving them even more money when these developers/investors CLEARLY do not give a fuck about you all.
---
What the hell man, paid Private Worlds I ALREADY PAID SIXTY GOD DAMN DOLLARS FOR THIS POS. I’m NOT subbing to their predatory subscription service. They lost faith in me as soon as they started putting requested features behind a paywall. Wastelanders announcement was the briefest moment of excitement I had for this miserable game. I don’t how someone can be ok with giving them even more money when these developers/investors CLEARLY do not give a fuck about you all.
---
With a little foresight you could have stocked your scrspbox with enough to last you months. That's what I did. I don't collect scrap now, except flux, until I run  through 26k steel  2k adhesive, 500 circuits etc. Once that happens maybe I will re subscribe.
---
Yep that is PVP armor not PVE....
---
Name a piece of scrap you'd actually need and would go begging a friend for and I'll tell you how easily you could have gone and picked it up yourself.
---
Exactly kinda tedious if you’re not getting the benefits of the nuke, especially having to click on mainframe cores at the moment to destroy them.
---
The stash was really what killed this game for me on release. At the time we were told it was a server problem and they couldn't do anything about it. I stopped playing long ago because of it. There is no world in which I will come back to play it with a monthly sub for a feature that should have been in from the beginning. 
---
It doesn't surprise me though. ESO has the same thing for its crafting. It is a F2P game mostly but if you sub, you get an unlimited bag size for crafting supplies.
---
I can't say this is objectively the fastest way, but what I do to exhaust the 1,400 daily limit is to go to Harper's Ferry and West-Tek, kill everything, and sell the weapons the enemies drop.  It's easy at Harper's Ferry, since the vendor is right there.  With Hard Bargain 3, you're basically getting 30 caps on average for Charging Laser Sniper Rifles and Assault Rifles of varying types.
---
West-Tek has a lot more weapons, but you'll need to haul them to a vendor somehow.  The road between West-Tek and Whitesprings can be rather sketchy when over-encumbered.  If you have a CAMP or TENT, you can offload this stuff into your Stash and fast travel, or you can keep some weapon weight management armor or perks on standby.
---
This is not getting enough attention! That beastiary is unbelievable! I could be biased though as I grew up hearing about the myths and legends of Appalachia and knew most even before this game brought them to life. Really is great work!
---
Actually yes so that must be why
---
Getting junk from contesting workshops
---
Not buying it huh? Dang it.  😭
---
There are some available.  In addition to what ZachyChan said, the Pioneer Scout "Stings and Things" daily rewards a few different types.
---
No, it isn't. The game is still buggy and Bethesda has proven to be a predatory batch of idiots.
---
half of this is jus "have you made the game annoying for yourself / spent an unneeded amount of time doing x stuff" lmfao
---
bah I still need the stim diffusers but either i haven't seen anyone selling them or a spare recipe or I haven't seen anyone flawless the event yet.
---
Youre missing left leg plz fix.
---
Some people really need to know where they're building before they start wasting their budget on things they don't need.  The spot I have my camp at is surrounded by spawns that only produces wild animals, the only time you'll ever see something more aggressive than an angry radstag that wandered too close is from the extremely rare spawns triggered by the camp system itself that at best throws some level 10 super mutants or some radrats/dogs at you.  
---
Yet almost every time I log in and someone's in the spot it's turrets everywhere defending them from a few opossum.
---
I skip that whole part, too frustratingly long
---
Someone had a threesome last night...
---
🥳
---
Had a little to much nukashine as well
---
Sir yes sir!  Haha
---
next they give even more build budget for camps for subscribers,
---
all the displays are useless, they take up camp budget as well as inventory space
---
All crops take like 60% of budget, even there is barely any space to put them down, is so dumb.  Next they will add farm plots for subs, and so on, until everyone is milked to despair.
---
Build your camp near megasloth spawns. They drop 6 screws nearly every-time you fast travel.
---
Glad to hear that I am not the only one.  I had resigned myself long ago to never getting a backpack, but I did recently revive a couple of people during a SBQ event,  so maybe there's hope for me yet?
---
Lol. I guess it couldn’t hurt though. Sometimes when hitting the queen those stupid ticks and crickets swat you out of know where. Lol.  I’ve been rolling with the platform queen hunters lately. Too awesome. Super nice guys.
---
Worth it. Found mine by luck months ago at vendor and it’s still my go to coat
---
i never have lag even in public servers. private servers are another cash grab attempt. why should we have to pay for peer to peer networking
---
I mean I’ve got a crit based rifle build, but I guess I’ll have to find something better
---
Thanks, I’ll check it out!
---
Play Outer Worlds
---
Oh my god that mothman love heart ❤😍
---
Just checked now don’t have yet 
---

---
Bobbleheads and Magazines aren't much by themselves, but a full bobblehead rack or magazine rack probably takes as much budget as a billboard.
---
&gt; used to be pretty standard in free to play games
---
Woah, what? What games were those cause pretty much all of them had some kind of inventory limit.
---
For the challenge, it is much better to farm low level bots, especially for the unarmed one:
---
* West of Vault 76 in the parking lot: \~10
---
* Vault-tek Agricultural Center: \~20
---
* Mama Dolce: \~10
---
* Secret spy center under Mama Dolce: \~20
---
* Tygart Water Treatment: \~20
---
* Relay towers: 2-4
---
It took me about two weeks, 4 hours a day, to punch all those robots.
---
I've found that simply jumping will clear that.
---
For a year*
---
Yes that what i just recently read to that better rewards the more animals i may have to go for 2 animals alive to get backpack instead of one
---

---
I don't know if it genuinely helps with the time in animations to hit, but blocking after hitting with a Super Sledge seems to allow me to get another swing out faster.  The only purpose I see in it is use as an animation cancel.
---
Junk is not the soul of this game, and it's borderline useless to collect tons of it.
---
Junk is the wealth of the wasteland.
---
There are also mutations, weapon types and even armor that can help you boost your damage on a permanent (unlike aid buffs) basis. And your level 50 weapon likely had parts you can mod to boost it to your liking.
---
800 is the stash size now, which is certainly more manageable.
---
Yea I didn't get into that stuff because I tend to view it as collector problems rather than builder problems. I know Bethesda recently lowered the cost a bit but not sure if that helped too much.
---
I love these so much!
---
It’s not that hard imho - just stalk a low level player. Wait for them to die. 
---
Help them up and move on?
---
I think you can make a new one as you level up every 5 or 10 levels and it gives more carry Weight
---
In all honesty I just buy the stuff from robot vendors whenever I see it.
---
If caps are an issue then everyone else here has you covered.
---
Also bought over 1000 gunpowder off someone who was selling it for a cap a piece so I’m not running out of that any time soon and only need acid to smelt stuff.
---
I just got back and noticed that legendaries have star ratings now? I dunno if that was always the case, but I have no legendary weapons at all and my armor is all level 1
---
Like most in this thread, I agree.
---
We all spend an inordinate amount of time collecting junk in this game. Being able to grab items indiscriminately vs. having to tag items for search *completely* changes the dynamic of the game.
---
One of the reasons that I *don't* subscribe is that I fear it will make the game too easy...
---
You are not doing enough damage. With AAE Smg, you probably deal 3-4 body damage and 4-6 head damage depending on your build. If she is in the air, you deal even less, or zero, due to the distance/range drop-off. You have to deal at least 1500 damage to get loot.
---
How is it broken? Still trying to figure this one out. then again, i have a decent pc, and internet, sooo... sure. haters gonna hate, and downvote, and prove me right as ususal.  but seriously, finished over half the quests, and been all over the map, build tons of stuff in my CAMP, yet to see these ' issues ' that people have. stop gaming on wifi for one. you NEED a DECENT internet connection for this game, and a DECENT pc. dont expect your 5 year old potato to run this game. just sayin. and allot of people report errors on PS4. well PS4 is trash period. so there is your problem, right there. the servers arent 'empty' as people keep B.S'ing about. thats their internet connection. people dont know how to port forward. so, user error. the servers are often populated and very smooth.
---
Would like to try. Will not be on until later tonight. 9pm ish US EST GT is GrumpyDude
---
That’s always been available and you’ll see some great bonuses on legendary weapons and armor!
---
You don't need to do the whole thing, just farm all the robots. Seems to me that would be the worthwhile part, considering your original question.
---
First time I drank nukeshine I woke up outside my own camp...lol... Was right after it was introduced. I was shocked. I was like "Is this a feature?"
---
The only thing it does that makes the game easier is you aren’t over encumbered as much and you can drop your junk in the scrapbox after every battle
---
AWOL armaments has about 40-50 Handys each event, but also just 10 sometimes, I don't know why though.
---
I wish they’d make them part of quests like wild Appalachia. The rewards for Christmas shouldn’t canabalize content from other quest lines
---
What system are you on? If you're on Xbox I can probably kit you out with some free stuff, I've got an abundance of legendaries atm I'm just waiting to trade for scrip.
---
Got it, thanks man!
---
yea. I invested in a furious combat rifle. does a lot more now lol. put my damage visual on and tested it. And you a very right lol. my furious combat rifle is a good investment. Might get a junkies combat rifle too. that or a handmade.
---
If you afford 100$ subscription, sure.
---
And wolf and ragstag and bear
---
I had the same thought playing my banjo the other day...
---
Not sure why this got downvoted.  You literally just recommended a game that fallout fans would enjoy to a fallout fan that wants something to do.
---
I’m on Xbox too, but I’d like to just farm myself. If I get all the good stuff, no point in playing ya feel? I do appreciate it though! 
---
Side question: how do I tag certain scrap for search?
---
Good question. 
---
Probably very few, to be honest. Usually it’s someone with an axe to grind lol.
---
raids? you can grind out your standard and power armor sets, and the various challenge rewards
---
Must have been a stag party.
---
No probs, my GT is the same as my username if you ever need help doing runs for legendaries or anything. To tag stuff for search you just have to look at something that requires it at a workbench and press the right stick.
---
Yeah it sort of slid in there without much outrage, co-op activities required for stuff... like i said in the post i like to follow my nose and explore rather than rabidly grind and follow the path. But TIL that i can get a consolation prize at the Airport, and if i stalk a newbie in a dangerous location i can tick a box and get a backpack so i can go back to being a hermit again.
---
Jeez maybe i am old.
---
Those are given from the quests inside the taxidermy place that I had mentioned
---
One if the challenges is to revive a player in water. Go to Dyer chemical. Stand in the water there. Let the two gulpers attack you and it’s a two for one revive. 👍🏻
---
down voted. tired of people hating on micro transactions. time to grow up! Oh, BTW trolls, down voting me only proves 2 things. 1) you are butt hurt coz truth hurts.  2)you are making me 100% correct by doing it, thus proving my point exactly.
---
i mean, you dont HAVE to buy these items, others enjoy them. i purchased them also. they haven't pushed me down. if i dont feel like buying something in the atom shop, i close the atom shop! instead of ranting on reddit. ZOMG! i, personally,  buy things from the atom shop, as is supports the company. haters, gonna hate.
---
I remember reading all the silly little posts, calling fallout 76 "pay 2 win" because of a fridge that spoiled food 50% less. ugh. smh. no such thing as pay 2 win. but there is such a thing called "git gud"
---
Ok, I'll be on. I'll add you.
---
EFFICIENT AF
---
👏Do 👏the 👏quests 👏
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bugcmy/i_made_a_list_on_how_to_get_all_the_mounted_head/
---
And maybe you did but it’s annoying to see people constantly beg for stuff thats available if you just do the quests. 
---
I can’t tell you how many players I’ve met that want these but just /absolutely will not/ do the quests for to get them.
---
I have an unarmed character with the -15% damage from various creatures armors, AP regen and Poison resist and some +1 strength, for third star effects Cavaliers and Sentinels mix is nice. I'm rarely taking damage unless it's a yao guai or several gutsys firing at me. My DR and ER is under 200 though so I'm thinking I'll get that up there a bit more.
---
Sounds good. Been meaning to try it out, but just never teamed up. Understand it is difficult alone
---
Still need two more for a full team..
---
I imagine it’s the Junk Jet, but the railway rifle blows its horn. And that’s my favorite part.
---
Liberty Prime serving the people
---
Lol, yeah I tried and quickly realized needed team..lol
---
I fee compelled to mention it because so many players I’ve met have done the first bit of Lying Lowe’s but they never to the Unsolved cases because they think it’s **only the bugs.**
---
Thanks a ton man! I’ll hit ya up if I need anything
---
Ah, yes, when they drop hundreds of pounds worth of junk it’s like mana from heaven. 
---
*And before anyone gripes, I only go after triple-digit players. If they are that level and are still mugging around that much junk, they probably never learned the dangers in that some I’m spreading some education around the wasteland...* 
---
😉
---
You seem to know the numbers pretty well, do you know if Dodgy perk and the sentinels/cavaliers effects work together? I read in one place that they don't stack..
---
Also don’t the unsolved cases start at the local train station board?
---
You can make the enemies bleed their own blood.
---
Is this a copypasta?
---
Well, the end of the year isn't here yet, so perhaps it will come back for Winter Dec 21st ?? Would be weird, but why not, people don't seem to care about immersion, it's october 23rd everyday anyway lol
---
Nobody makes me bleed my own blood! NOBODY!
---
Awesome work!
---
a little late but there def is i have one dont recall where i found it though
---
Well, I was just a bit confused since the mod is just called "upgraded"
---
Sometimes if you mention being downvoted for seemingly no reason, people will just start upvoting you. It's madness
---
Ooooh I member! Member when scrapboxes ate scrap?
---
Nevermind that people are quite obviously spending money on a subscription without even looking at the subscription FAQ that answers these questions
---
Someone was trying to sell it to me for 4k when you can go server hop a couple times and buy It from Cap'n at the toy store at ws 
---
for only 31 caps!
---
This is badass.
---
Your not the only one.  I've played once since fo1st came out.  Before that I was playing everyday.
---
Good for you. Im happy for you. I wish i was so lucky as you and i could enjoy lagless smooth gameplay on my ps4. 
---
I understand your feelings and opinion about this kind of practices. I feel the same way. 
---
I didn't buy anything yet and the feedback from you guys prevented me from this terrible mistake. Thank you all. 
---
I wish there was other good big survival/exploring game availible on ps4.
---
I had one with the same effect on it a few months ago. It increases damage from the base weapon. It was pretty fun to use until I got my meat hook with the extra hook and faster swing speed.
---
Fair enough
---
And no, they start in the taxidermy place on a map board with papers pinned to it. The sheepsquatch quest line itself starts at the train station
---
Im not OP
---
Well yeah.
---
Same here!  I grabbed 3 copies on Xbox so I can play with my kids 😁. I beat it in PC but it's a steal for 12$
---
There is a backpack after u complete the pioneer scout quest
---
Those are already there.  In the lower left-hand corner of the item, it will say "(owned)".  And in the upper right-hand corner, it will show a nuke that tags it as your NW preference.
---
But, having a separate tab for those would be better.
---
The problem I find is that so many players put their Camp right there where the vendor bot spawns. I mean of all the places in Appalachia to have to put your base there, especially people that are level 100 plus they know what they're doing they're trying to put a base where people who are trying to spawn the vendor Bots will come and buy stuff from them. Go camp near White Springs train station or top of the world there's a lot of other places to go stop spoiling the spawn LOL!
---
It’s been so long ago I forgot when it was only 200!
---
Yeah its already there sansdelighttho
---
There are the perks, the backpack, that you can improve (but the quest to improve it is pretty long), and the Excavator PA that gives you a carry weight capacity when fully equiped.
---
Well I only came across a few bases there and it didn't really bother me
---
It still sucks but is directly related to the amount of legendary drops and 150 daily scrip limit.  I’m at 800 because of my waiting to scrip inventory.
---
There is some of those in FO4 but I don't know why they aren't in FO76 there is also maniquiens in FO4 they need to add those because you can put your outfits on those that would be cool to put your rare outfits on those.
---
If u complete the tadpole badges u can unlock the backpack. U need 8 possum badges then for the high capacity mod. I'd also recommend looking at ur weapons/armour to try pieces with weight reduction.
---
Nice, I just use a bloodied sledgehammer instead
---
If you have a spare costume I'd happily take it off your hands
---
What are the best turrets to defend your base??
---
Spawn him down the road from Lady Janets Soft Serve where he spawns commonly (just down and past the bus, I usually get him to spawn in 5-8 jumps). Some people try to get him at the Charleston train station (it was the most famous location in the beginning) where he rarely spawns. That spot is useless and will drive you mad.
---
I remember when they said they wouldn’t increase it cause of server stability. But the server instability was c abused by people glitching it to have I donate space and when they open up their stash it would lag the game.
---
I think like a good 1/2 of the players on the server would abuse that glitch.
---
2 kinds of backpacks and pocketed armor pieces exist
---
Those are some absolutely gorgeous pics! Well done, nice share too.
---
I have had the most success with missile launchers, and most recently Heavy Laser turrets.   There are many locations that you can get away with no turrets.
---
Unyielding armor increases strength which increases carry capacity. 
---
Some weapons have +1 strength. 
---
Some armors have reduced weight junk/food/ammo/weapons effects. 
---
Eat foods/chems to increase strength or carry capacity. 
---
And finally, yes there are several backpacks and backpack mods to choose from. +30/+60/+120 carry capacity.
---
I go do the event every time it's up, typically only get to keep 1 alive sometimes 2.  I've run it probably 20x on my main.  Yet my alts who've run the event, got it quick.
---
man u gettn mucho\_flacko for this post
---
Cheers mate
---
(I believe its a sticker and shirt on my redbubble too)
---
If you haven’t done tadpole and possum stuff you could play through that. It takes a while.
---
Shit these are good. This makes me want to step up my photomode game. I'm slackin.
---
Awesome!  Thanks so much!
---

---
Ant meat and Grilled Radstag boost up by 20.
---
Pocketed and Deep Pocketed armour mods help. 
---
For quality of life I use 6 strength points, 4 Strong Back and 2 points Bandolier (I carry tons of ammo).
---
With full set of Unyielding I have a 330 carry weight. It could be increased if I Deep Pocketed my armour.
---
It's fairly complicated, so it would be best to just look up a video.  If you don't want to decrypt it yourself then you can search "fo76 nuke codes" online to find this week's codes.
---
The water treatment plant is also good for using weapon challenges when you don’t have good items. For example, black powder pistols can easily be done there to double dip if you need pistols and BP weapons.
---
I honestly don’t care about the price, I’m always maxed out on caps.  I just wanted to know the rarity of each color.  When I unload duplicates, somebody is going to get a real deal when they shop with me.  😛
---
These are all perfection &lt;3

That's right

The Robco facility in the cranberry bog, Sugar Grove, the Whitespring and the Nuclear Silos.

---
My bad. You realise it's easy to get more keycards, right?
---
I just screenshot and downliad/share them from the Xbox app.
---
I'm waiting for them so I display the Mistress of Mystery outfit alongside the weapons. It sucks collecting all this stuff along your adventures and not being able to display it.

Not anymore

Yeah true

Where do I pick that quest up?
