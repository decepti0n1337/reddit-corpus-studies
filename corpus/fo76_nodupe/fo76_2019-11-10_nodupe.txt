Ahh yes that explains why I see a full server every time I log in

---
---
Wasn’t a stupid question at all. The only stupid question is the one you refuse to ask. Lvl 182 here and I didn’t know this, so thanks for asking.
---
I like hosting my boxing tournaments, and showing off my camp to others
---
Keeps me amused for when I'm bored...that and I'm addicted in trying to self collect all the magazines and bobbleheads(nearly there actually haha)
---
Someone else asked a very similar question a few days ago.  I enjoy playing it very much and so do the guys that I've been playing with since the BETA days.
---
Under murmurgs train station
---
Unyielding. The enormous bonus to strength is second to none when it comes to melee
---
Right, but Harper's Ferry is rather large to not have any interior spaces (prior to the burrows).  Perhaps they could do some event to commemorate John Brown's raid on the armory.
---

---
Edit:  the raid was in October. Not sure why I thought May.
---
Only other thing is the gun. Sad Mulder face.
---
Beyond annoying dude. It seems like a pretty basic thing to fix. Between that and the other respawn bugs it’s pretty frustrating.
---
Go to a silo and do the quest that pops up when  you enter. You don't need the codes, just the key card from a vertibot
---
I can see by your -11 downvotes
---
I found dense combat at big b's on the bottom of the magazine stand in the super duper mart.
---
I haven't got gud yet. ✌️
---
put scrap into STASH and meds / food / etc into you?  
---
Scrap unneeded weapons, they added selling legendary weapons for the same reason.  
---
Scrapbox are entirely unnecessary if you just manage your inventory. Other than that, you don't need more than a certain quantity of scrap.
---
You need a map to dig them up...multiple maps means you can dig the spot multiple times... “you do know that, right?”
---
did u go through the nuke silo until the end ? if u did then all u need to do is put the keycard into the console on the left and type in the code on the keypad to the right and launch the nuke
---
Thank you anyway i can tell a nuke went off for that silo? Will it just say cant enter?
---
This sub is hardly a barometer as to how many people play this game.
---
Bathesda U missed out this was a perfect Halloween door skin
---
No havent gone in yet i was trying to figure out why the quest is not updated after getting all code parts.
---
[deleted]
---
Its just 10 for the mod. Then just plastic, steel, and gunpowder for the ammo. I have, this one is my favorite though
---
The goal of NW isn't to get the most kills, the most loot, or anything of the sort. It's to be the last man alive, by any means necessary.
---
I'd  like to hear their explanation before assuming they're guilty. It's possible they have a legitimate reason reason for banning him. He's know for doing good things for the community but that doesn't mean he's not capable of doing bad things as well. For all we know he was one of the main hackers killing everyone in Nuclear Winter. Simple question- If they came out with **hard evidence** that he was a Nuclear Winter hacker, would you still defend him?
---
Full set of unyielding prob adds like 600 unarmed dmg, plus the sneak bonus is insane.
---
They're not contesting your free speech.  
---
They're contesting you spewing bullshit.
---
It sounds like you already have the code. If you actually want to decrypt you use the keywords for the respective silos as a cypher in the bunker. Anyway as others have said, make your way through the bunker and enter code at the end to launch a nuke
---
Definitely a better yield! Thanks very much for the info captain. I'll report back after trying it out. Might do it up at the Raider fight pit beside Top of the World. Keep things contained. ;)
---
Unyielding.  IMO, it's not even close.  You might reason that the extra DR/ER of Bolstering would be nice, but I think it is offset if you use Dodgy, because Unyielding buffs Agility, which provides more AP for Dodgy to proc.
---
Sure, I'll answer it - because I FUCKING enjoy it!  And yes, he should move on if the game is this disappointing to him.
---
This. Workshops are great XP for low level toons. Take, hop to next, retake, rinse, repeat.
---
Try to get known locations for 6 or so by using others camps to get you close to a travel point to discover. Then do the above and server hop and do it again. Once you're level 20-25-ish Whitespring should become a viable option for rapid XP, and will likely involve a lot of death at first, but it is what it is.
---
They found out about the exploit from somewhere. Somewhere with accurate, and detailes enough information to replicate the exploit.
---
It does not require testing, only reporting.
---
The wife and I do enjoy the base game. It is neat to wander around a wasteland and... shoot things and pick up stuff and then build some stupid shit at our base.
---
And being that we have a kid, our playtime is limited, so even though it's been a year, we've done very little in the world.
---
SO there's no confusion, yeah, we both agree that Beth has done -VERY LITTLE- with the game in the year they've had it formally released. And we both understand the bad feelings people have for it.
---
But, hey, at the same time, I'm only level 21, and she's level 15.  
---
\- edit -   
---
Eventually, once I have more time -and- Beth does right by the game and its players, I plan on investing in the cash shop. For now, though, I'm content with my two hours every so often playstyle.
---
I could be wrong but  i think It was your post helped me get it at the Quarry near [Watoga.It](https://Watoga.It) was someone who posted on here.
---
Took a while but it happened.
---
Thanks.
---
I do it in ws station.
---
Ah, anecdotal evidence. The refuge of the those that aren't as smart as they think they are.
---
Hahah, yeah that
---
They have messed with uranium fever since launch before it used to be there legendary black ranging from a 1 star to the guaranteed 3 star in the end.
---
During the last few patches it started to spawn a large variety of or configurations of mobs. Where it got to the point you may not even see a three Star
---
If you don't need more than a certain amount of scrap then why did they add the infinite scrap storage option?
---
There’s a lookout tower south savage divide that has a lot of food in house nearby.  Also can check the farm... ahhh it’s near lady Janets soft serve north a bit that has crops outside (not aaronholdt).  You find some canned food there.
---
However you’ve already received the best answer.  Can do and trash cans.  Whitespring should do you well.
---
I don't even launch anymore. I just go to the queen when someone does. I just play around and collect legendaries. Do the same ole events over and over. Sometimes it's pretty boring but then there are times when I can't put the controller down. Especially when you meet some good pvp peeps. Some of those sessions can last an hour or more.
---
Good points that I hadn't considered. Thanks for the discussion.
---
This is such a poor analogy. They walk up to you, admit they hacked the bank account, and then are immediately arrested and prosecuted to the full extent of the law by the Bank. Who cares if they told the account owner?
---
Edit: Maybe it's not such a poor analogy, since what I said, is **exactly what happened**.
---
Unyielding.  Bolstering is a waste of time
---
Wait who are you again?
---
I tried outer Worlds and I just end up going back to 76 lol.
---
Code parts is optional
---
Don’t even need to collect them...
---
Grab a key card and google the nuke codes for the week
---
Never run a silo unless you can confirm the codes are valid
---
Never run a silo on reset day
---
Pay Bethesda $20 a month.
---
0-60 in 3 seconds :P
---
Probably 90% of the people I meet playing this game don't even know what Reddit is
---
Whoa i tried getting that for the longest and just gave up
---
Pretty sure they haven't got one. They are busy counting idiot money.
---
Yeah, i was repeatedly beat as a child
---
In the parking lot?
---
Yes, Bethesda is a tiny indie company that hardly scrapes through. They need money every day just to keep the employees fed. Todd Howard personally cooks for them.
---
I remember that too. I looked for it a while ago and it was gone. Never came back. I wonder if it’s only there when you have 1 character
---
I am not exactly sure what pack is that, is it on the atom store at the moment?
---
I got in and doing it niw thanks for all the help!
---
I want more.  I want a Ski Sword that flashes like a Swing Speed/Martial Artist Combat Knife, and Fire Axe that slashes like a Swing Speed/Martial Artist Ski Sword.  Too Much fun.
---
Yes yes oh my God yes a thousand times yes
---
Good to see these posts removed
---
The Austin studio is a tiny division of BGS.  If they don’t make money for Daddy Todd, they get dumped like a deadbeat boyfriend that plays video games all day.
---
You have to do it from the Main Menu.
---
The fact that is is your breaking point is pretty nuts; Bethesda showed long ago they don't give a fuck about this community's gaming experience. You are all cattle to them, ripe for profit extraction. That's it. 
---
I know your passion for the game is warm, but it's not shared on the other side. They don't deserve you guys playing this game.
---
Yes, relog back on your server and they will all be alive.
---
I think 5mm also sells fairly well. I've asked about ammos to sell before and almost everyone said 5mm and 556
---
It Is cheaper for low levels.
---
That would be amazing honestly considering I've ran melee since launch.
---
But with the current games latency issues it barely registes hits sometimes (I mean mobs can hit you 3-4 times before you get a dmg inflicting hit in). Which fucks up a melee instigating sneak build royally. Or many melee builds overall
---
I used to nearly one shot SB with a combat knife haha anything else was like tearing through paper
---
legendary weapons to use or cheap once to scrap
---
bulk junk
---
novelties
---
sometimes ammo like plasma cores
---
dog food
---
Do you have a way to price good legendaries?
---
Now if only there was some use for them...
---
You sure? This is the most interactive post I ever had. I didn't mean for my post to come off as negative I was just curious to see who is buying from Bethesda after everything that has happened.
---
The sad part is it's completely true, and has been heavily covered online. A community member of Fallout 76 who has made free to use resources for players, including interactive maps, was banned for reporting an exploit to Bethesda. Google it.
---
That's not how subdivisions work.
---
A company doesn't open a new subdivision and expect it to turn in a profit. Why? Because Bethesda Austin is the developer. The publisher is still Bethesda Softworks. The sale happens through BSW. Austin gets their salary from the main division like everyone else (which may vary depending on sales) but Austin is not sitting on street corners selling the game and trying to make ends meet.
---
Small club meeting, I only see 2 people in attendance
---
You only need 1 copy if your on console.
---
Never forget who's game are you playing and what consequences are coming from it.
---
btw i found a product that sells super well. not gonna say what or where but you might be able to figure it out. Its a couple of plans that you cant read. So it will never say "known" and therefor when people see them.. they buy them because they dont know them yet and they sound amazing :D 
---
also the outfits from the bunkers sell pretty well since not everyone knows about the bunkers or has the keys.
---
I wouldn't pay for a subscription for any game. When I eventually quit the game or it dies that is money that got wasted. Microtransactions in general are the same way for me.
---
*there
---
its just the helmets there is a brown one a red one and such no clue if its in stock I thought it was just general use
---
Yes and no. When im by myself, theyre always dead, a relog respawns them. But me and 6 other people launched one the other night and they were all there. Need more testing to see if that changes things or if it was a fluke. Idk though, its weird either way and should be fixed.
---
#Fallout 76 is cancelled
---
My wrapped cap not only shaves me, but it also prevents me from wearing goggles. Top that.
---
You can build a tower. It just takes unconvential building using shelves as stairs
---
I hear ya.  Truly frustrating (the first hit bug/lag that has been plaguing the Melee build since the launch of Nuclear Winter with no patch to look forward to).  But a Guy can dream.
---
Getting rid of or Buffing the Troubleshooter, Mutant Slayer, Ghoul Slayer, Zealot weapons is a no brainer though.  None of those prefixes with the minimal, imperceivable, completely unnoticeable effects they have make them even remotely tempting to keep.  Just frustrating to see drop.  At least Hunters has its minimal boost effecting a large swath of different monsters.
---
It's not that your post came off as negative. I've seen 6 posts in just a few hours asking the same question.
---
From what I can see here nobody is whining about p2w in answers or anything similar, are you talking about some other threads? I agree that honestly regular gas mask shouldn't have a debuff. Same goes for firebreather fireman helmet that also has a debuff unlike the normal fireman helmet you get from Whitesprings.
---
But... Why? I literally toss them, like, 100 a day because they're heavy AF and do no dmg compared to anything else
---
You’ve gotta wonder if they are going to hold off on te China stuff till Blizzard stops getting themselves in the news over and over again in that news area
---
Did you dump the one from the quest?
---
I predict I will Tomahawk their asses, jump servers and pretend nothing happened. The multiverse in action.
---
Lvl 10 bloodied gear and server hop sneak at wes tek you’ll be at lvl 50 by the end of the night.
---
If it can be found in the fire station in Charleston, this is the first time I'm hearing about it. The responder's fireman uniform and hat only drop from responder events, the normal fireman uniform only dropped from the Halloween event along with the fireman hat, but the fireman hat can also be bought from Cap'n Kids
---
Congrats! I've actually seen it says you've contracted whoopsies.......only to not get flag for it on achievement.
---
Shit you got me
---
I'm by no means a regular uploader, but I've done quite a few of what you're looking for I think.
---

I think i have around 10 or so location with Max budget camps on YouTube, have at it :)
---
Once or twice. Honestly, me and my friends find it easier to just have 1 person hack the terminals, another defending the hacker, while people are busting pipes and looking for codes. On expert, 45 secs is a waste of time to dedicate a person to it because you spend more time searching then you receive. If we happen to find one we use it, but were not going out of our way to find them
---
&gt;Its now almost a year and the game is almost as broken as at release day. Its full of bugs, performance issues and still fucking lacking in content.
---
I don't understand the issue here. It's a Bethesda game. Bugs are features, not bugs. They don't get "fixed." You deal with them until a mod comes along to make the game better/smoother. This has been Bethesda's M.O. for years now.
---
Honestly, we all should have known this game wasn't going to be fixed even a year after it's release.
---
I really wish they would patch in tooltips for all items that protect because this way, it makes new players think the gas mask that removes perception is the only way to safely travel to poluted areas. I thought it was like that until recently.
---
I would not like it at all, but maybe a network or underground mutated caves below the Sbq battlegrounds. Like, fissure maze.
---
Yeah I agree the difference in the dmg they deal is negligible, the armor prefix's are pretty solid though.
---
I just use a mutants prefix for my Weapons now and it gets the best return.
---
Personally the dmg reflecting prefix is better than the mob specific ones
---
Nope, I actually drag them into the station itself. They tend to get stuck in small spaces. So you use that and kill 100 or so. And then the meat bags drop mostly in the same location.
---
dog food is life
---
I see, I'll try to find it on google.
---
They might not have anything more to show than in the previous trailers because there isn't much more to show, they know they're going to release another 30-minute-questline where at the end you decide which of two weapons you want and that's it.
---
That's why they delayed it and are now trying to milk every last bit of money as long as they can because they know when they release Wastelanders ,which many hoped to be the 'turn-around' for Fallout 76, every last person will loose hope for them and their promises
---
You don't know what you're talking about but that's OK.
---
If your PSN is down, you will not be able to get on FO76.
---
Sounds like you're having an internet issue. Run a Network test, reset your router/etc.
---
Just went in about 10 mins in someone laughing from same silo...fml...
---
Exactly. Stress on servers is BS when games like Call of Duty can track significantly more stats simultaneously in real time for 64 players in one game.
---
Ran it multiple times, it was only my PS4 that wasn't working so it wasn't easy to figure out that the problem was the internet
---
After Fallout 1st, I am absolutely *convinced* of it. When they announced it, I promptly uninstalled the game and lost any and all trust I had in Bethesda, and that's saying *a lot*.
---
Just relog and they will be there. Kill the enemies and if you relog they will be there again, you can do that until the nuke disappears.
---
just pour a bit of your tea into your water tank and put your tv into a transparent bag, there ya go and enjoy!
---
Might want to add a chair for added comfort
---
sounds like a good thing if you just want to fight the queen tho

Hello!

Thanks for bringing this to our attention Vault Dweller!

 However, this isn't a bug! It's Fallout First feature! Upgrade now to be able to kill these enemies!

Pretty sure this happens in every event.

The only one I have gotten from a quest is the fire Breathers variant. I'm looking for the normal yellow variant.

**Disclaimer!!** I would like to see some new skins drop for items at world events.  Get people out farming some of the lesser events.  I do realize  that Bethesda will likely take any ideas and put them behind a paywall. Oh well.
---
People waited about 10 months for the first handmade skins to drop in the Atom Shop.  Oddly enough the majority of the weapons people use rarely have skins for sale in the atom shop.  I think people would spend on atoms if they put non gimmicky stuff in the store.  Here are some I think people want: 
---
**Weapons:**
---
\-Handmade skins (More)
---
\-Combat rifle (make these work with the fixer)
---
\-Lever action
---
\-Assault rifle (AR-15 skin)
---
\-Deathclaw gauntlet
---
\-Mole miner claw
---
\-10mm pistol
---
\-Gauss rifle
---
\-Tesla rifle
---
\-Meat hook
---
\-Shotgun skins
---
\-Super sledge
---
\-Power fist
---
**Armor:**
---
\-Robot (I have never seen a skin for this)
---
\-Combat
---
\-Wood armor
---
\-Scout armor
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Why they don't focus on some of this along with adding in more faction themed stuff is beyond me.
---
Are you aware that the cheats are a result of a poorly designed piece of software?  It was a single player client hacked into a client-server application.  It is literally not fixable without re-writing under a different architecture.  That's the result of "We need to ship something, how do we make this thing as fast as possible so we can make money asap"
---
Everyone involved in the decision making for the creation of this game should be fired and blacklisted from game development.
---
I don't know why you're so bent on defending Bethesda or this game.
---
I had this happen the other day at Encryptid and didn't know it was an existing issue. No one was going to win the event anyway since there were just three people doing it, but I was surprised when I couldn't respawn after I died.
---
The Mutants prefix is solid with its 10% boost across ALL baddies.  With guns, add another 10% aiming bonus or the explosive (20%?) to it for every shot, and it outperforms the two shot with its low hit rate.  For Melee, it's nice to have the extra 10% across the board, but I prefer AA or Instigating for the one hit kill (if the first hit would ever register).
---
Yea I think it does. No matter what event if you die as it ends, win or lose, your screwed!
---
I usually have good luck with people sharing as long as the legendary is durable.  Lots of the ghouls and other enemies are hard to tag without killing them.  Yesterday that happened at one violent night but people were decent on the nightstalker and all 5 of us got to tag it.
---
Sounds like that glitch with fallout 4 if you froze the enemy and killed it, and it would glitch it up later if it respawned. One good thing about Fallout 76 being online, on servers, is that those servers restart, so these glitches don't stay forever on our character's playthrough. Imagine having to battle save game bloating or undespawning molerat holes. :D Although honestly I really hope they eventually fix all those ugly corpse bugs, makes the game really uncanny.
---
What are you playing on? I'll help you with a silo if you want, xbox.
---
To be honest, I usually just take Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm and put it on Salisbury Steak. I love getting those pristine food items. All you have to do is stay in the area and pull out the steak (maximum stack in the machine is 3, so you can't stay away for too long).
---
Also I pick up every single packaged fooditem when i travel around. I don't really need it, because I technically have more than enough steak, but I'm just too much of a hoarder to just leave them.
---
So... yea I don't specifically loot a location. I am waiting for my food to be delivered to me! :)
---
That's the event I just played and this dude didn't care at all. If I was built for pvp I would have initiated it
---
Not sure what exactly you are talking about.  There are 3 fireman outfits and corresponding helmets that exist.  The normal firebreather uniform and matching helmet, the white responder helmet and bluish uniform (ultra rare), and the halloween version and red helmet.
---
Honestly what’s the point of keeping these servers up? All this fucking game has done is just piss off gamers and singlehanded ruined Bethesda
---
Gonna check that out!
---
I’ve seen many people on Xbox selling for more lol 12.5 was the lowest I’ve seen it even offered at
---
Same it seems we run pretty similar loadouts
---
I’ve seen your posts many times on this sub. I know you’re a sharp guy.  Let’s think about the game as an asset, from the perspective of a board member. Would we approve additional funding for a game that fails to generate revenue, or even stays flat as a modestly successful property? It’s possible that Wastelanders was delayed in an attempt to upscale it into a game relaunch and attract more customers.  Even assuming a generous grace period based on the new acquisition, subsequent restructuring and a rocky launch, we’re going to expect the new division to stand on its own volition eventually.  Until it generates respectable profit margins, I’m going to vote on a lean, mean budget and schedule. That seems to be exactly what’s happening.
---
Reading between the lines, I started to see signs of trouble mid summer. The 2019 roadmap started to disintegrate, the atom shop started reneging on the promise of cosmetic only product, shop prices rose and bugs started going unchecked. None of those point towards a game full of vigor and promise.  I’d infer that the investors started to put pressure on Austin to become profitable at that point, and it’s been a disorganized scramble to get out of the red ever since.
---
I’ve strayed away from the initial point, but it all ties together.  It’s clear that the Atom Shop is getting desperate enough to break their idealistic promises, and no one does that unless they’re forced to do so.  They need players to go beyond their initial purchase to continue funding new content. Unlike a single player game that gets support and DLC for about six months after launch, 76 needs constant care.
---
The atom shop, premium membership and pay to win are a whole separate argument. We might even agree on most points.  What I’m trying to say is that 76 obviously needs money, and I doubt that anyone is going to approve extraneous funding for a game beset by endless turmoil and flat profitability.
---
Can't link it as it gets the comment deleted for some stupid reason, so [here](https://www.google.co.uk/search?source=hp&amp;ei=8V_HXcDPH8m6kwXl6oNY&amp;q=market+76&amp;oq=market+76&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l7.207.1501..2174...0.0..0.58.469.9......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i131j0i3j0i131i10.xNemuWEJN6U&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAjOy9t97lAhVJ3aQKHWX1AAsQ4dUDCAg&amp;uact=5).
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Some people just don't care at all and kill stuff outright.  That one seems to be the worst because it's hard to cover both entrances effectively.  I usually just stand at the back door and cripple anything running up.  That's the entrance the night stalker comes in at too so usually I can get a shot in one him.  I really think Bethesda needs to let everyone in an event like that loot the legendaries.
---
Yes officer, right here.
---
Here is the criminal.
---
But then you have raider skull gas mask that lets you wear goggles as  [BortonForger](https://www.reddit.com/user/BortonForger/)  mentioned. :D Bethesda logic in a nutshell. On a serious note though I hope they update and fix that eventually, as they fixed the atomic store goggles pack that wouldn't let you wear hats.
---
It really needs to be in the side bar.
---
this hasnt happened to me for ages tbh. and im overencumbered all the time
---
If you want the Alien Blaster, you can get one by doing the unmarked quests related to Black Mountain Ordinance Works...it'll be good for a rainy day when you've got several hours to kill.
---
Somebody did the math, looked at analytics or whatever, and concluded this would not hurt their bottom line.  This thing has been worked on, I'm telling you.  That's how they've been so ballsy, so one-eighty, so gleefully abandoning one segment of the fanbase and going after another.  They go after people who open their wallets -- the same way banks and credit cards go after people who borrow and/or have debts.  CC companies make money from interests.  People who always pay bills on time and pay no interests are called DEAD BEATS by CC companies.  Bethesda probably thinks the same way towards those who never use atoms, don't pay extra, and complain about the game's condition.  Then there are those who complain less and keep paying.  Guess whom they go after?
---
Come over to the dark side 😉
---
Like I said on my other response, having consistent tooltips would help and avoid problems.
---
Is this your first video game?
---
You act as if the person in the analogy left behind a trail.  You act as if they can't deny the accusation.  
---
It is a poor analogy.  Bethesda is bank and bank owner, and their's no jury looking at their decision to ban the player other then the rest of the community. I could find a better one but...
---
Alas, the person being banned is better off away from this game and no longer giving them money, or doing their job as people in his position need to do to get a bethesda game to work proper.  Better for everyone from where i stand.
---
I might actually consider buying the subscription. U just can't support P2W mechanics.
---
We're complete savages and no one can deny us. Constantly dehydrated and starving, only time we feed ourselves is when we have spoiled food, and we only drink alcohol we find lying around. We are the lost generation
---
Would be funny if it wasn't horrifically on point.
---
Noooooooo don’t give into pay to win!!!!
---
Could be. Glad to help.
---
I am glad we are agreeing, then. Fallout 76 needs to look profitable in order to survive. But if it fails, it doesn't mean that Bethesda is gonna close down (or one of its subdivisions). The game will get abandoned, yes. The false narrative being peddled by many people is that Bethesda desperately needs the money to stay afloat as a company, and this justifies the aggressive monetization. Some go to the extent that "the Atom shop keeps the lights on" which is absolutely ridiculous. Games are investments, you invest money because you expect returns. Some people here reel under the delusion that anything that gets made needs money from us first or it will never get made. In that case, no game would never get made at all unless we immediately paid money as soon as a developer decided that they will make a game. Now, profits come because a product sells, and good products sell well, which Fallout 76 clearly is  not.
---
The monetization of Fallout 76 is not an outcome of Bethesda needing money desperately. It's a result of them being greedy and asking for money without putting in effort, while exploiting the fact that most of the playerbase is stupid enough to dish out cash for utter crap. That is the whole idea behind microtransactions.
---
 or just uninstall the thing, dislike all u want, white knights of this sub, its just the fact, besthesda can only sink deeper and deeper thx to all the ppl who bought this 1st thing, literally every sane person can see that
---
Alternatively you can get a shotgun or tesla and never miss another legendary
---
You'll never take me, Copper!

I don’t find the blunderbuss plan all I find is the pistol and rifle plan.

My record is six at WS train station.
---
That's actually in the works for Wastelanders as well as perk loadouts.
---
It'll still be nuked?
---
Its not deleted lol
---
a new underground location, a lab with different areas where they tested on big creatures like the grafton monster, sheepsquatch, behemoth, deathclaw, mega sloth and you have to clear out the building.  maybe some sentry bots at the beginning. no small spawns like ghouls. you could hide it behind a covert mine entrance in ash heap
---
I got a bloodied explosive +1 agility handmade there, level 35, and it still kicks the ass of every other weapon I’ve ever gotten. Yes it would be better at level 45, but it still melts almost everything anyway
---
Seems creating something very convenient for all players of the game wasn't something Bethesda cared for all that much. I guess it makes sense, seeing as they're in the business of selling convenience these days.
---
You can Tomahawk any enemy in the Forest area, go epic during collision course, clean the wendigo cave, rain madness at Whitespring and look stunningly epic during Scorched Earth, among other things.
---
Yeah I got a 3* BE .45 SMG there and sold it for 20K.  You’re right though, BE weapons are still great even if they aren’t max level.
---
&gt;People like this person are exactly the type of fans you want.
---
Might be he was making things a bit too convenient. If players have no trouble finding everything with ease etc. how is Bethesda supposed to sell them solutions for frustration and inconvenience?  
---
They do care about customers, but they don't care about fans.
---
Yea I'm sure that's it. The entire studio in Dallas is just sitting around eating cheetos while sending all the proceeds to Tom Howard from their obvious cash grab. Tom Howard will obviously use all this money to build a church of Satan in each and every city in America to enslave America into his evil ways which was the reason this game was made in the first place.
---
I hope they're as nasty looking as the original Floaters.

The Centaurs of Fallout 3 were a comparative letdown to the originals.

That said, 4 had a lot of artistic jump. And 76 continued that trend, look at their classic-inspired pipboy 2000.
---
Tell that to my bloodied high Vats accuracy grenade launcher. It's great fun and perfect for events where you have tons of low/mid level enemies and need area damage. With the right perks, they are fuuuuuun. 
---
Add me. Andreslamantis. Ps4. Ill buy them all.
---
I'm not so much defending him as saying Bethesda is a shit company that's done everything in their power to stab us in the back and treat us like cattle, while not bothering to be apologetic about it.
---
But if they gave factual evidence that wasn't doctored or spun in a way to make him look bad, then there wouldn't be much of an excuse to bitch about this instance in particular.
---
There are three Fireman Uniforms.
---
The Fire Breathers one is unique to that quest.  If you scrap it, there's no way to get it back, outside of player vending or trading it from another character.
---
The Responders one is a rare drop from Responders events.
---
The beige one was a rare drop from Mischief Night and, as far as I know, doesn't appear anywhere else naturally.  So your only chance to acquire it now is to buy it from another player.
---
Sucks. Im on PC. i dont know if that makes any difference. :(
---
That's no excuse for not using a gun. I play a unarmed build and still carry a plasma-gatling.
---
I think doing that again, today, would end up with someone getting stabbed.
---
That was from the Halloween event only.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

I say go for it. It’s cheap right now and good fun solo, and great fun with friends. I’m so busy right now I don’t get to play it hardly at all anymore and I wish I could.
---
No I would just play regular and not waste my money on private servers as I could jump public servers to farm rare drops and would have all the real perks of first without paying.
---
I have 4 characters all with camps built into existing locations.  If you're on PC, my player name is the same as my reddit username.  You can come check them out if you like.
---
You don’t pacify them. Tame is a separate option that can be done before or after pacify, and in my experience you need only one point in WW, and then max AF to send everything to your camp.
---
This is why your subreddit is dying
---
If you want a grindy game and you’re ok with massive bugs, clunky gameplay and an endless hyper monetized money pit... then sure. If not, plenty of other games are fun w friends that are much cheaper and less buggy.
---
Why can't we be as smart as you? Please teach me your ways. Right now I am searching reddit for a game I hate so I can follow its subreddit and piss on the parade of everyone that likes it because I am a stable genius!
---
Ahh didn’t know they respawned back to spawn point. Lost quite a few legendaries there
---
Yes , I have first , paid for a year, and I would love it if they make the tent, scrap box, and private server access available to all players. At 9 dollars a month the amount of atoms I get , 1650. Is a fair deal. Honestly, I saw this as an act of desperation on Bethesdas part. I love the game and play it every day. And I'm hoping that it can last much longer, seeing first as a sign of death throes , I decided to pitch in and see if this can help get the game where we want it to be. I certainly don't agree with their decisions. We have to be patient with them , like trying to house train a dog that is less intelligent than an average dog.
---
We also have to take into account that some gear that was datamined when the game first launched still has not hit the shop. Namely Piper's trenchcoat and Cait's corset.
---
Doesn't matter.  I don't run anything for rifles and all it takes for me to tag an enemy is a couple shots in its general direction.
---
Thanks!
---
I'll have a look through them. The Charlestown rooftop Camp has me intrigued already.
---
I carry a real weapon and an event weapon, constantly. Sure, I can hit for 20.000, but I can hit for 80 also. A gentleman of the wasteland, lets say.
---
However, some people (3000 hours playing, really bored) might want to finish it quickly. They are in their right to do so.
---
&gt; It’s kinda selfish to take the entire map down 
---
I want to bring up how selfish and self-centered this comment is, because my comment earlier wasn't clear enough. This is something the player did during his spare time. You have absolutely no "right" to the map. If he, a fan, did not put forth the effort to make this map, then you would not have access to it. Claiming that it was selfish for him to take the entire map down is ridiculous.
---
Now, let's use your example. A man owns a building. He decides that he wants to use this building for the Salvation Army as a soup kitchen. The town official bans him. So now that person decides to close the soup kitchen. Let me ask you, why should he continue to pay for the utilities of that building? Why should he continue paying property taxes? Buildings (and websites) are not free. They cost money. It would be ridiculous to expect someone to just give away something they'd purchased, especially if they're not wanted in that area.
---
Someone else is free to purchase that building and re-open it as a Salvation Army soup kitchen, but no one is \*entitled\* to that soup kitchen being open under the previous owner.
---
You're right. Who needs money. We live in a free world where all you need is a smile to survive.
---
.308 no more than 1 cap each. Also look for high rad fluids, look at legendaires, etc.

I don't think F76 could ever charge $50 for bank/merchant NPCs or $100 for mansions, or $15 for a face change token

Forgive me if a company with a track record like that earned themselves some brand loyalty.
---
Also, for someone that throws around brain dead, your grammar and punctuation are shite.
---
Remember that the guy got banned because Bethesda caught him using a purchased cheat engine - just like those guys in NW.
---
Fortunately https://fo76map.com/ is still open and has a MUCH better user interface and updated locations.
---
And Fo76Map is run by a guy who doesn't use cheat engines causing his account to be banned.
---
Thats a good price.
---
This guy right here must be an insider or something. I learn so much every day about the inter workings of the evil game studio that is Bethesda. Now this small studio of over one hundred people doesn't need to be paid. They all have good smiles.
---
I wanted the helmet, Sigmund.

If you are on PS4, I would love to stop by...
---
Woodchuck is PSN
---
I imagine they will try to copy it exactly, but fail. This isn’t the same type of game, and FO76 is really ruined. They’ve messed up in so many ways- this will either turn to a niche fan base game or it will shut down
---
Couldn’t agree more I’m fine with the delay but they should give the community a new trailer or a video featuring the devs talking about things they’re working on for wastelanders, throw in a couple new screenshots and gameplay clips with it as well
---
.308 takes a lot of materals to craft and you only get 21 bullets. This is with ammosmith maxed.
---
Wow that worked!
---
My post history will shop you that I don't hate the game but research requires a brain which, if you had, you wouldn't defend Bethesda's vile practices, so go back to Todd Howard's dick.
---
Disagree. Spend the money on server stability and fixes bugs that have been present for more than a year
---
It’s the internet why does it matter not like I’m writing an essay? Also that track record doesn’t mean anything after the shit show of fallout 76 and the constantly screwing customers
---
Unyielding, no doubt. I am not a fan, but Holy shit it turns you into the Hulk. Incredibly broken damage: you can choose weapons because of aesthetics: any rolling pin Will hit for thousands. Any machete becomes an almighty Masamune.
---
I moved my camp last night from just near whitesprings stations ( under the power/radio tower) to up above the power sub-station a fair way and I found 5 on top of the cliff staring at the perfect spot...so I built there.  
---
They are the silent watchers, the protectors, not the ones we deserve but the ones we have right now.
---
I stopped playing 76 a while ago, but I was excited for Wastelanders. Now I’m scared to see what they’ll fuck up this time
---
You earn money by making a good game. Not making people pay through their noses with fraudulent practices.
---
I have the power!!!
---
I'm going to buy 1st now because you just convinced me to !
---
Workshops and Whitespring.
---
How about this one. I honestly don’t give a damn. do you even play this game why are you in this sub? Why are you defending this at a bottom level comment on a stupid thread for a game you only lurk for on reddit. Buzz off you polished turd
---
Waiting was key. Lots and lots of waiting. It seems advisable not to escort, they appear to get attacked the entire way. I don’t think they trigger enemy spawns when alone.
---
Despite what I’ve read, server hopping doesn’t seem to mess this process up and *may* speed it up ever so slightly, or make it seem that way. 
---
I’ve now got my level 21 diseased deathclaw defending my camp and am very happy.
---
Thank you all for your help! Definitely looks like Unyielding is the definite winner! Guess I will go use my 1000 scrip and hope to get 1 Unyielding piece!
---
English major and someone with higher than a second grade understanding of the language here.
---
No, you did not use proper wording. It's "fewer".
---
There's a *lot* that hasn't been released that has been sitting in the game since launch.
---
But in general, things that have been added in subsequent patches *usually* show up before the next patch.  I can think of couple exceptions to this - the Raider Scavver helmet thing and the Raider Protectron - but it's fairly predictable.
---
It’s not just those man, a whole slew of new stuff came in the most recent wave on PC. Gamebreaking shit really.
---
I’m planning on redownloading when wastelanders releases. I’ve been really upset at Bethesda’s decisions but this is where they can redeem themselves. It was moved back a significant time so I can say I have full hopes it’ll be a complete redo. I would love a new trailer or news to keep me going and excited for it. I’ve run out of things to do so hopefully it’ll be massive new content as well as changes to the problems. Like I like to say, “I’m a man with one dlc release and a dream” lol.
---
Started a heavy guns PA character the other day, went to buy a nice PA skin and there's fuck all on there, for a greedy company Bethesda seems to have no clue how to make money.
---
Tried doing encrypted tonight. died and waited 20 minutes to reload. game never reloaded. Assultron Keycard wasted.
---
try anything else.
---
Yea your right. What have they been doing this whole time? These 14 patches were just an illusion.
---
at this point i dont rly care about besthesda anymore, its more hilarious seeing ppl buy it than complain
---
Yeah, the timing really couldn't be more awkward for a release like this.
---
Although I think people will forgive it, because getting to see Chinese Power Armor is kind of neat.
---
Missles I drop every chance I get. Weigh too much.
---
Hey, just saying, most people figure out the difference between there and their before throwing stones about other peoples intelligence.
---
Workshop near mama dolces gives prewar food as a resource.
---
Wow dude you came up with that conspiracy all on your own?
---
Yeah, I wear Power armor when I go to players camps.
---
Sorry I deleted the thread because I wanted to make the headline clearer, did that remove your post too?
---
Keep your eyes open at vendors.  People sell the basic one stars.
---
It's an awesome game so they must be making a lot of money.
---
Well considering they took my cave base away to make way for a door, im gonna say, top of the map above the mire.
---
Is have even the 1* fine to start out with? I have heard that most armor is not worth having unless it is a 3* variant.
---
T51b left leg
---
Do your dailies.  And keep in mind several areas in the game are locked behind a quest wall.
---
I thought they buffed the gouls for some recent event (don't think it was micheif night). They are crazy fast now.
---
I like using the scoutfit with shorts and toothy man fasnacht mask, you could do something like that. A custom sash with the various badges or even made up silly ones, like some of the ridiculous challenges we joke about for 10 atoms, would be rad.
---
It's seems Bethesda is secretly trying to beat EA and the getvthe worst company in the world award
---
There’s no need to be rude. He has an opinion. You have an opinion. I have an opinion. It’s ok if they don’t all line up in lock step.
---
Ah I've been collecting them but never actually use them. Gotta try now that I realize you can get PA plans.
---
&gt;it was just a fan created survey to get an idea of where the playerbase stands on Fallout 1st.
---
That fan must not understand that r/fo76 is not the "playerbase." Especially right after a controversy.
---
The tent is crazy useful for hording. I do it on my lead farming run.  I go into each silo, hoover up all the weight lifting stuff in the exercise room, and anything else on the way.  I'm now encumbered, walk out, drop tent, scrap, now I'm not.  Rinse &amp; repeat.
---
Don't. It's not worth it now. Wait a few months when Wastelanders launches and see if it's worth it then.
---
Bethesda is pathetic. Even for their standard, this is just ridiculous and I am not even shock anymore
---
Cool story bro
---
+100.  You can now use workshops as a workshop, without some PvP twink stopping by
---
Before all of the above is even remotely considered, maybe Fallout 76 can adopt ESO's more competent dev and writing teams and implement enough good quality content to even stomach even a few of these options.
---
It seemed a lifetime ago because nothing came of it. How much of the suggestions and bug fixes from where fans do you think Bethesda actually implemented?
---
If they flew in another batch and they gave their feedback about the game, how much do you expect THIS Bethesda to actually listen to them. They won't even listen when it doesn't cost them any money to do so, why would be it be any different any other way?
---
They even had few bags to give away for free. Made from the finest canvas, before the great shortage of 2018. Those were the days...
---
If you blindly support Bethesda spend money and waste your time playing this shitshow of a game you’re a moron end of story roast me as much as you like I’m just happy I’m not as brain dead as someone who plays and spends money on this shitty game and shitty company
---
Yeah.
---
The private server so I can play alone if I want is cool.
---
Sometimes I get sick of having 11 people at the uranium fever event.  Or the sons of Danes hall.  Or pretty much anywhere.
---
I know I could just go play fallout 4...but I’ve played that game to absolute death and can’t stomach the idea of dealing with the voice dialogue, Preston, or exploring the same map I’ve been over and over again.
---
At least I haven’t even explored all of Appalachia...I got caught up legendary farming when whitesprings was full of legendaries even without nukes and people would be dropping bags of them everywhere...I got burnt out and left.  Now I’m back and while I love adventure mode, I also like being able to not have to worry about someone else running towards me with three scorchbeasts in tow while I am afk.
---
Yeah I was just seeing if anyone else found people to be this toxic and illogical. I just started doing pvp and did not know this is how it usually is.
---
I do pvp if someone captures a workshop or if they hit me back. It is completely fair.
---
A goldmine of cheapness.
---
I like going to a camp and finding everything is being sold super cheap except for god tier weapons.
---
...not literally...
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.
---
She was a level 411 how can she not know what seeking is and my friend is a level 161 that is pretty fair if  not leaned to her advantage.
---
what is wastelanders and why?
---
Hey they know exactly what they are getting into if they hit me back. It is not my fault if they get into pvp. Also I do not pvp lower levels. I just got into pvp and do it for the caps, junk, build tips and fun.
---
I like food that doesn’t spoil...but I also like killing the Brahmin at flatwoods over and over and over even more.
---
Milk the Brahmin, kill the Brahmin, cook the Brahmin, repeat.
---
Vault suit for sure. I have no idea what a pioneer scout is because I’ve never touched 76, and since most Fallout fans are the same (the lucky ones), I imagine a vault suit would be more recognizable.
---
I know. I used to do that too. They are not practical, just fun.
---
Yeah I play on PS4 and people can get really salty. Im not going to get mad at someone if they pvp me just do not be toxic to me for using a in game feature. I just do not think that is what you should do for losing 50 caps a 1 bulk copper. Just do not seek and do not give us what we want.
---
&gt; It's purpose is freedom of choice and customizability of personal belongings to make them unique and stand out which if you think about it isn't really lore breaking at all even if it were to be considered something that effects the lore.
---
We couldn't disagree more here. The kind of freedom of choice you are talking about can totally exist in a single player modded environment just fine, but this game is not that. 
---
They really need to adhere to the franchise aesthetics, or what you call personal choice will become the franchise aesthetics, and it will damage the franchise badly.
---
No. Get out before the mind control drones suck you in and you are stuck dishing out 100s of dollar every month to Bethesda.
---
1. Better gear than I have.  Mostly Armour. Legendaries.
---
2. 5.56 ammo at 1 cap per.
---
3. Stable Violet Flux ... cause farming it is a pain in the butt.
---
What aggravates me?
---
1. Non-Legendary Weapons and Armour for stupid prices (i.e. not reasonable to scrap for plans)
---
2. Scrip Worthy Legendaries (or even marginal Legendaries for that matter) for ridiculous mark ups. (too many business oblivious vendors).
---
3. Vendors who build their CAMPS on cliff side, and put their machines way out over the edge, so you either spawn a five mile walk below the CAMP or have it vanish and drop you to damage your PA legs or kill you out of PA.
---
Who or what is club fuzzy? 😂
---
One less furry in the world? total win-win situation here
---
Horrible for using a feature? It is their fault if they attack back or seek. I never fight lower levels it is always people higher level or just flat out stronger than me. If they hit me im going to hit back and get some caps it is just how it is.
---
It's supposedly a big overhaul DLC by Bethesda's description, so it'll probably be 2 new fetch quests and 2 extremely boring grindy quests, going by what they have previously added.
---
Can you keep doing that to respawn over and over like the old days?
---
It’s to create a sense of urgency when the item does come back so you will be more inclined to impulse purchase items.
---
It was a publicity stunt and in reality, meant nothing. It was done just before they released the repair kits hoping to drown out the controversy with "feel-good" stories.
---
That story may have seemed positive to some of you, but I took it as a huge warning sign when Bethesda decided to listen to a select few without any input from the rest of us. It was a huge FU to the community as a whole.
---
They sat them down and let them play nuclear winter, of course nothing was going to come of it.
---
I think it falls upon us, as consumers and fans, to interpret what items are being sold as cash grab opportunities and what is legitimately keeping the game profitable.  The Atom Shop, being the sole source of new revenue, seems to be controlled by both Spock and Goatee Spock. 
---
If I can interject my personal opinion, I think premium membership is largely benign, overly generous, and legitimate. Yes, it is priced on the high side, using MMO industry standards, but it’s the equivalent of purchasing a Fallout title plus all related DLC once a year. I’d argue that all players should get the unlimited junk box and tent functionality should be severely nerfed, but I just love Fallout. I want to keep living in Appalachia for years to come, so I think of it as renewing my engagement with the franchise annually.  It’s kind of expensive for the industry, but I like the game.  I’ll certainly spend more than $100 on a date night with my wife when the next Star Wars movie hits theaters. I can sympathize with kids and college students, but I’d have no problem giving my child money for a game subscription, so long as they maintain their GPA and treat other players with the respect and dignity they deserve.
---
Congratulations on joining the herd of sheep. Might as well mail your bank account details to Todd Howard.
---
For fucks sake, yes.
---
I know. I I'll pick something up just to tag with
---
No, the scrapbox is the whole damn point.
---
Protest? If the guy actually cared about the community he would know it takes bethseda forever to respond and deal with bans.
---
All he has done is screw over other players who liked using his map. 🤷‍♀️
---
Then your standards of what you consider a good investment are not normal.
---
The ONLY way for them to succeed in going the eso route is if this game became 98% stable at all times, and they ACTUALLY fix the bugs. The fact that there are still bugs that were around at beta is a joke, and the lack of large content to be added in the year it's been out is disappointing to say the least. The reason online games typically have a subscription price is to pay for high quality content, and servers that are stable, not half assed nonsense. This game was already full priced, and already has a cosmetic shop that is  no longer a cosmetic shop, and if they plan to push it further without the game collapsing under the weight of all this bullshit, then they need to reassess pretty much the entire cash system, and hire on a competent bug fixing team.
---
Yea, I know about that, but still there should be more items to purchase while they are doing this, because I have no urgency when I can still keep up while grinding atoms. Also having stuff for sale only for a few days means I'll probably miss them, so I am not exactly sure how that works for them. I guess it does work for them or else this would not be the case, but it is a lame way to do it.
---
&gt;would like to  bring up for discussion what the ESO model provides and potenially  shows as FO76's future. On a plus note and before any other discussion. I  personally believe FO76 has years of growth ahead just like ESO  did/does. So first let's look at the ESO Plus page to se
---
ESO itself wasn't that for quite some time
---
Melons at your camp. 18% water and 10% food, and won't spoil on the vine. Makes hunger and thirst trivial and rather pointless.
---
I did this once..built a 1x1 room..kited a mole rat in there..spent like 2 hours..more of a pain in the ass.
---
Bethesda Texas really does need help from the ESO team for sure
---
are you serious or just joking? the dots at the end let it look a bit sarcastic :D
---
You can always just make sure PvP is off and then just spam a few molotovs around every so often. That usually works.
---
*you’re
---
20 caps per star for legendaries? Who is dumb enough to sell you three star at 60 caps and good luck finding that idiot...
---
Sleep and cran before battle
---
yeah, that’s how I’m looking at it. not from when I’m in a game
---
I care why?
---
it’s not that because I have two characters I did it with.
---
If you're going to talk shit, you could at least give the impression you attended elementary school.
---
Well the servers can handle the scrap box which is quite literally infinite. Just looking for your opinions.
---
It's someone who is still bashing on furries, their capacity for education stopped in the early 2000's.
---
I main a quad barreled auto tesla build and turn enemies to ash all the time. It has the same effect with the naked muties respawning. For me they're not invincible though. They're either just untargettable like they're not there, or you can kill and loot them. The latter version even goes through the voice over cues.
---
I watched 3 hackers last night in Nuclear Winter cheat... after they knew and had commented on a twitch stream. They knew they were being watched. They knew they were being reported. They knew people were clipping the parts where they cheated. Did they care... no. They continued to do it, over and over again. Multiple games.
---
Probably why there’s a year long subscription for a game in this bad state out of nowhere. Way to recoup anything they can before they put the game on pure maintenance life support.
---
nooooo don't waste if money on Bethesda ur so sexy haha
---
Nope, 110 max dmg cap, ballistics got nerfed and melee
---
I will say the fact that this off-topic shitpost is still here does speak to that view. 
---
Oh. Wait. They deleted it. Seems like they're doing their jobs just fine.
---
Wouldn't it be cool if we could pay cash to upgrade the junk storage to unlimited?
---
No, wait, they already did that...
---
What's even more sad is seeing good loot disappear from the game. Giving it to me or other players at least puts the loot back in cycle of the game.
---
I am still pissed the 4th of July combat armor paint disappeared...
---
All the other 4th oh July shit has been available like the flags, backpack, etc
---
That paint was gone before the 4th
---
Yeah that sucks why not be able to pay junk to upgrade base stash or something like a plan for bigger stashes.
---
This is bad
---
I always tell myself the truth, "buddy".
---
Because I think you all should be incredibly pissed off with how they've treated the series and fandom? Because continued support shows them and other companies that this behaviour is ok?
---
The shit I hear about what happens to anyone who disagrees with one of their petty asshole moderators...
---
Nah I'm good dude.
---
Seems to be a theme on these kinds of posts. Bottom line up front... Some people like the game
---
I paid my money for the base game, I enjoy it for what it is, but at the same times the odds of bethesda getting a single dollar from me in future is pretty damn slim...decidedly no more launch full price titles.
---
I clear out West Tek. Leave server. Join another. Repeat. Also have xp bonuses active for resting and cranberry items.
---
Club Fuzzy to Beth:You took everything from me!
---
The Community:I don’t even know who you are.
---
I don't get people who insist on comparing the two at all.
---
Seems legit, "dude".
---
It's not for you, that's ok. Doesn't mean others won't enjoy it. Everyone can decide for themselves whether they like a sub or not.
---
No one said you shouldn't enjoy it. I just think it's fucking HILARIOUS that you're presenting it as a "better" option.
---
Yes it does but only if you use world containers and don't take more than 4 or 5 minutes to relog. I have transferred items between characters since fallout 1st came out. Even if you crash you go back to the same server.
---
That sounds like a legit reason. And fair enough, if you like it cool. Do you see where I'm coming from though? Even though you like it, are you happy with the roll out and subscription addition, even though they promised they would never have one
---
I love this game and ill continue to pay because i enjoy it and can afford it.  FO1st proud!
---
I play it because it's fun I guess. I tried to take a break and play outer worlds but it doesn't scratch the gaming itch that fallout 76 satisfies. I don't mind paying for microtransactions that is probably what other people find bad about the game. I don't agree with everything that Bethesda does but this game keeps me entertained like no other. Shruuug
---
Did you downvote because you couldn't find the link? Lol
---
You do know that fallout 3 was their first game, right? So...your view on "what they did to the franchise" is kinda pointless in this context?
---
They have fucked with the lore and turned the franchise in to a world wide joke
---
No... Not there...
---
They talks about dlc/season pass...doesn't say anything about a sub
---
If they put Wastelanders behind a paywall you have a point...
---
Could you elaborate.
---
Regular gameplay as well. Encountered a legendary Mr. Gutsy. Didn't realize they self destruct and it killed me when trying to get my loot, doesn't appear when you respawn.
---
Not even close
---
At this point it Is obvious the game could work better. It is a matter or profit vs high quality of service. Private servers work really and offensively better than peasant world.
---
Nope
---
If they did what no man's sky did and took the game and made it what was promised and then tried to add a sub, I wouldn't have a big problem with it, but they have just doubled down.
---
Dude you are the most sensible here, all these sensitive kids lol
---
Serious
---
Yes.
---
Of course, this is a bad idea if you're not in Pacifist.  But otherwise, why not make the greedy griefer an unwitting conduit? 😁
---
From the article: “There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s all free after launch – all our content, there’s no season pass and no paid DLCs." - Pete Hines
---
Just seems disingenuous to me,it's all free after launch should means it's all free after launch
---
I hated new Vegas on launch but grew to enkpynitnafter doc was added. 3 and 4 on the other hand I loved on launch. When 4 and 76 came out I felt like Bethesda was catering directly to me as I loved gather and crafting/building little houses and bases lol.
---
I'm hoping for a bigger expansion than what was planned.
---
What's it worth?
---
Yup... And people had a hate boner for them making fallout a FPS/rpg with 3...i haven't had a problem with what they've done to the franchise since 3...
---
The tent should be private world only. The scrap box should be for everyone
---
Love it after dlc was added*
---
What's your Gt I'll follow you around and greif you with robot misic
---
Whiny fanboy twats are the only ones that give more than a fuck about lore.
---
Yea, you're the douchebag that everybody with a bit of sense is laughing at now. You're the idiot cash cow people joke about, you're bread and butter for big corporations. Buddy, you're literally part of the reason they continue to screw people over, because no matter what you'll pay, and they'll laugh to the bank
---
1-2k maybe
---
Start a game than go to your gallery. Im able to do it right now. Its the touch pad on PS4.
---
In Challenges menu. Go to your map and it's in the top right corner.
---
Sun Tzu had something to say about this. Always take prisoners, and treat them well. If the enemy finds out you don't take prisoners, or that you treat your prisoners horrifically, they will instead fight like cornered animals, giving their all until death, which will cost you far more resources and may even cause you to lose.
---
When dealing with people never be cruel. It doesn't make them obey, it makes them dangerous.
---
I dont care that you paid for it. i just dont want to hear it anymore.....
---
Wtf
---
Brown - green - blue - pink - yellow - forest - red
---
Dude, you will looooovvve outer world's. I'm grabbing it soon
---
Do the only thing they care about, stop buying their things
---
Your gonna laugh. You have to be in the game world. Under "vault frames" is the id badge frame too so you can update your badge lol
---
You can also find them in the main menu. ESC then Z on PC.
---
I have it and am 20 hours in :)
---
oh so you have to be in game? omg so many different answers. thank you I’ll try that
---
Lolz, like i give a shit what you whiney neck beards think.  Ask your mom for 12.99 for the monthly sub, i promise youll enjoy it as much as i enjoy your salty tears
---
I made a mistake and bought a game based on the reputation of a publisher.
---
Your shitty disposition requires far more insight, and is certainly harder to correct.
---
Sun Tzu had something to say about this. Always take prisoners, and treat them well. If the enemy finds out you don't take prisoners, or that you treat your prisoners horrifically, they will instead fight like cornered animals, giving their all until death, which will cost you far more resources and may even cause you to lose. Instead, if they find out you honor surrenders and your prisoners are treated with kindness, they will be *more* likely to surrender, *saving* your resources and making victory *easier.*
---
Huh? Thats pvp
---
I was thinking that as well actually.
---
What? You mean that interesting backstory in a game? Yes, some of us can do more than go "Durrrr, shoot shoot, jump, button mash" ? Good luck with that, bud
---
somebody else said you have to be at the home screen. thank you, I have so many different answers
---
Personally love the game. I play only a few games and struggle to move onto new games. Haven't spent a $1 above the base game, in fact I don't think I even paid for the game, so basically they got no money from me .. loved Fallout 4. Just my kind of game.
---
The guy was making a joke 😂 doesn’t seem like you got it
---
Yup... You're a minority... Hate to tell you...
---
It didnt help my situationwith the musoc so im not the happiest with it tbh. Also i hate griefers the most.
---
Bitch, you're the deadshit paying for a broken game while every other fucker is laughing at you, and the only reason you can afford it is because I tip your mum that $13 before I bounce (she pays the tax)
---
I'd rather they fix the game than work on something new.
---
As someone who is in marketing, you’re not wrong... but Bethesda clearly gives no shits about their consumer goodwill and all their behavior indicates they’ve completely written off FO76 and its community. 
---
How broken FO 1st is and the wasteland era delay clearly indicates they’ve got minimal resources dedicated towards it. 
---
At this point, they’re probably just banking on Starfield. And let’s be honest - if Starfield is a great game, most people will forget about FO76 and immediately start heaping praise in Bethesda again. Just like how most people forgot about Blizzard’s China worship and stopped their boycotts when Overwatch 2 was announced. 
---
If you’re still playing FO76, that’s fine. I don’t understand why you would when there are so many other fantastic games to play, but whatever. However, nobody who plays this game should expect Bethesda to get their act together or turn it around. If they intended to, they would have done so by now.
---
Glad you got it for free lol
---
Lol people on this sub are so weird. If you downvote, please explain why. This is all a learning lesson for me. Apparently not for all of us. I’d love to know what’s appropriate and what’s not.￼
---
I’m all about the stealth. Without Evasive (despite how broken it tends to be), I am quite easy to spot so I can’t get as much out of sneak currently. I’m at lv 15 on the new character. Her name is Tina. She went into the vault at 16. She spent all her time in the gym, so Tina is pretty well-built and agile. The Sneak build is a must for Tina. She’s looking for some good chameleon soon!
---
I currently have a roadmap for pistol + explosives. Probably not a great end game build, but it’s something different. Too many fun legendary pistol rolls on my main character had me curious. 
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
Like I said, it was a joke. You think the guy is actually a griefer?
---
Show*
---
Laughing at him... But crying because it'll lead to more and more of this shit, right?
---
Honestly that's worth the price of FO 1st alone...
---
I just did it. From the photo gallery in the game world, the option is there.
---
Oh, and I’m going to throw in mysterious stranger into my build since I’m going to favor VATS as much as possible. 😊
---
Who is laughing at me?  Look at your down votes sweetpea
---
Idk but i could image him doing it and me quitting the game.... Thats enough for me. I really hate that music.
---
Lol, just don’t use the emotes
---
You want a 2 shot fatman?
---
Ahh season pass is pretty much the same thing bro
---
&gt;Blizzard would have treated this guy the same and their CS is usually well viewed
---
You mean the ones you have to submit a ticket multiple times, so that you get something other than "Goto WoWhead to check what your issue is?"
---
The same company, that shit canned its CSR, after "Record Profits"?
---
How do we know that story was even true? Was proof provided?
---
Unfortunately he isnt as strong as he is in other games, Dont forget to take some mutations!
---
Have you considered not insulting people you disagree with on this issue considering that a) it apparently and worryingly seems to matter a lot to you and b) insulting people who have answered your question honestly is going to have the opposite effect effect if you want to change people’s minds?
---
I've had that happen at white springs, no matter how much I shoot those fuking ghouls a with my explosive plasma they just don't die
---
But they do it for other people. If they added a mute all emote feature i would be fine with that.
---
No...  a season pass is essentially prepaying for DLC... that is what a season pass is..
---
Wrong...
---
It's closer to the battle pass models of free to play battle Royals.
---
But ok, that specific wording is what you decided to focus on instead of the actual fact they said no and lied.... Again.

They said if they had private worlds it would be a paid service through them back in August/September of last year...

Thanks for taking the time to comment!

This page is mainly for bugs introduced specifically in Patch 14.0, **as there are several hundred thousand characters worth of bugs, it is actually impossible to list them all even on 10 reddit pages!**

You will find it here!  (and browse the wiki's)

**Fallout 76 Bug Roundup | Weapons - Legendary Effects**
---
Sub =/= Season Pass
---
You use the word literally in a case where that would be literally impossible. Any use of the word infinite is false advertisement. But "free", we all know what that means...
---
Because for example, tonight I helped my 8 yo girl drop a nuke on WS for her first time and then she helped me farm legendarys.  We ended up with well over 10 3 stars and more 2 and 1 Star enemies and loot each between our characters!  Legendaries were everywhere tonight.  It was a total blast and those kind of moments keep me going strong.  Even solo I still enjoy helping low levels, farming and all that Jazz.
---
Still ain’t bored... though  for some reason I just can’t get into outer worlds when I tried it... too cartoony feeling.  I’ll try it again later sometime, but it just isn’t clicking with me yet.
---
lol love that last comment
---
Yeah I get what you mean im just saying that you can put whatever you want in the scrapbox
---
It was verified by Bethesda when it was posted
---
And why are you still crying about this?🙄
---
I play but i don't support it.
---
Why do i play? The early game is chill and enjoyable for me.
---
I try to play Nuclear Winter a couple hours every day. It's fun and relaxing.
---
He had a douchebag answer, I had to point it out? I have no intention of changing minds, people are stubborn and stupid and when you point out the stupid they just fortify. Genuinely interested why they would support it and have had a pretty interesting set of answers
---
You’re right. They should have flown all of us out there. /s
---
Thanks but not once has it been my idea when I die
---
Is that the battle Royale?
---
Does it let you put in teddy bears and other junk items or just raw broken down scrap?
---
Rock on.
---
Are you one of those people who think that F76 has the most aggressive marketing practices? If so, you need to do more research.
---
Yes, it sucks that Zenimax is pushing Bethesda to be more aggressive with monetization, but there are other companies that do far worse things such as adding lootboxes with ridiculous odds  and true P2W items.
---
Why gladiator and slugger?
---
Can’t wait to get high enough for starched genes and class freak. I’ve already got 3 on accident. Marsupial, Adrenal, Bird Bones are high up on my list. I just read today that egg head buffs the intelligence loss from marsupial. Did I miss what you run or did we not discuss that?
---
It's definitely true... that enemies that turned into ash or goo respawn the way like you described... We've verified that on a Whitspring Fluid/Masses-Tour on a privat server.
---
When you try to put something in there it says "scrap and turn in junk" so I think it is raw junk but I do not support fallout 1st so I do not know. My friend does thats how I know about the scrap and turn in junk
---
You gotta practice just like anything else.  If you aren't already good at aiming from FPS/TPS then you have a longer road.  One thing that will help you is having a competent team.  As always i offer myself as tribute if you need a little boost/advice/encouragement.  I'm on PC.  IGN: Huell\_Babineaux
---
Still? That it's a broken mess? What?
---
A douchebag answer would be spitting in the face of people that disagreed with them. All they did was say they liked it, could afford to support and were happy and proud to support. You’re the one being the douche here, not them.
---
*nod*  
---
It can happen with almost humanoid NPC, and it's an older bug, but seems a bit different than what's happening with the Ash/Goo piles.  
---
Next time fast travel a crossed the map and return, 90% of the time they should meat pile.  
---
BTW are you a bloodied / one shot kill build?
---
Ok, I was legitimately curious if it accepted unscrapped junk but I haven't gotten an answer from anyone. I am assuming it only takes raw scrap, as it is a scrapbox
---
It’s fallout with friends so it’s safe to say it can certainly be enjoyed... the only challenge is late game when you get done binging current content, so I can see some hitting a wall with that if the current replay value is not enough but that’s subjective.
---
If it’s so broken why whine? Lol most people who think a game is bad don’t cry online a year later after release lol smh
---
I think anywhere in the ash heap, mine shafts, ventilation shafts even sink holes could be used as opening to the dungeon.
---
It's annoying at times, but I just use the alternative HUD that is similar to the one used when not in Power Armor.
---
Queue the Eric Andre “Let me in, LET ME IN!!!” meme. ;)
---
Legendaries to scrip, plans I don't know, and stable violet/flourescent flux.  Also, ultracite ammo at reasonable prices.
---
What kind of food?
---
Thanks for the comment!  
---
It can happen with almost humanoid NPC, and it's an older bug and seems to happen to ghouls more than anything else, with some scorched here and there.  
---
I have a theory behind what is causing it, they've loaded either the wrong skeleton or the wrong behavior files for their skeleton, you can replicate this behavior in fallout 4.  
---
How often are you seeing it per day?
---
Yea im not sure but I think so. I completed everything in the game right now so im just waiting for Wastelanders and getting some pvp action in to get some build tips, caps and some junk.
---
You will
---
Kinda his own fault wasting his time helping a company who cares not about their fans
---
Lol what are the odds?
---
Thanks for the comment and info, really wonder about the testing on this one.
---
In eso you can change your armor to look like any kind of discovered armor/clothing of and discovered color. Costumes are full body cosmetics. You can only dye them with eso plus, but it isn't a huge deal because eso does a eso plus week every few months. Base Eso has a huge amount of character options, much more than fallout 76
---
Hey man, that's awesome you two are bonding over this, and if you still enjoy the base game solo? Cool, do you
---
I haven't played this game in quite some time so I kinda forget, but what's the point of these diseases?? Do they rly buff you more than debuffing you
---
Yeah, same, I have three characters atm. May start another if they have a 2x XP weekend before wastelanders
---
I didnt mention it before. I went so long not taking mutations and they were a big help in strengthening my build. I dont think egg head is worth it due to the Endurance loss.
---
Personally I recommend 
---
Adrenal reaction for damage.
---
Bird bones for bonus agility.
---
Marsupial for jump/ carry weight.
---
Eagle eyes for crit.
---
Healing factor so you have to use less stims out of combat.
---
And speed demon for better reloading and running speed.
---
Don’t have gladiator, both slugger and experience slugger
---
It's easy to chill out with and I have a good time. I decided to pay for 1st and I will until wastlanders. If my paying leads to solid game investment that's great. If not, I'm paying a bit more for a game I spent $60 and have played 900 hrs. 
---
The way I see it, 1/3 of the community can pay for the bonuses and we continue to get content. Or no one pays, maybe we get more content and whatever.
---
I
---
Don’t have gladiator, just slugger and expert slugger
---
Ahh I see makes sense
---
so in other words they had glitches that were more game breaking then the horrible ones at launch? Plus the ones still occurring. that's not praise worthy that's a sign the game needed a lot more time. And I've done 2 playthroughs of the outer worlds and only encountered on glitch that had an easy work around. Nothing like this game
---
I think it's a bug that it doesn't stop playing if the user terminates the dance early.  That's the real problem, imo.  Anyone who starts the dance subjects everyone else to the whole song.
---
IF YOU PLAY BETHESDA GAMES/ZENIMAX LIKE FALLOUT 76 AND OTHERS WHILE COMPLAINING GIVING THEM EITHER YOUR TIME OR MONEY OR BOTH IN ANY FORM YOU’RE THE PROBLEM TOO 
---
BEING ANTI BETHESDA AND LOGGING INTO THEIR BUGGY GAMES STILL KEEPS THEM AFLOAT 
---
Better? FALLOUT 1STers are as liable as vase game players
---
Just got 66 ionized meat at nuked WS tonight, Daddy’s cooking with bacon for the next month!!
---
If you play on PS4 send me a friend request same as my username for reddit. People usually hate pvpers but I never pvp low levels and either go for people stronger or higher level than me.
---
In general, if someone wants it they will pay 25k for it.   I put up crazy prices and everything eventually moves.   That's why I'm rich..Im rich I tell you!
---
Just happened to me at encriptid, took pylons multiple times and did 80% of the damage to the bot. Right as it was about to die I got punched so hard I skipped the downed phase...
---
This issue started months ago when encriptid was first introduced. I know I've reported it with video proof multiple times in those months but all they've done is make the issue worse by adding an increased respawn delay at public events making it even more likely for people to get caught by this bug.
---
I've seen MANY of them!!!  Here are a couple.
---

---
Ok. Then maybe one day that might be fixed. Should that be the case. Ty
---
Yes
---
It varies greatly.  Some days, not at all.  Some days, multiple times in multiple locations.
---
he's not lying but he isn't right.
---
The original intention apart from the microtransactions for cosmetics was not to have a paid service. Sorry, where does he mention paid?
---
Lost my Marine AP WWR chest piece the other day as well. Tried the usual.  Log out, turn off etc.. nothing. It is just gone. I fear we both may just be out of luck... sorry man.
---
Dude they even forgot adding one of the halloween plans to the loot table, you really don't have to defend them at this point they are really awful and doing a bad job with all the day 1 bugs still going around, adding new bugs every patch etc 
---
I believe this whole "fo76 is a compassionate amazing sub with wholesome community:((" thing also made them arrogant
---
You’re right, I confused gladiator and Barbarian.
---
While that's surely true, that's no reason people should just quietly put up with it in FO76 if they don't like that sort of business model.
---
I know other games are far worse about the monetization than FO76 but I don't play those games, it doesn't affect me one way or the other how they're handled. I am interested in Fallout 76, though, so it matters to me. I should be able to voice an opinion about that without people saying "just find another game to play if you don't like it" or "why are you still here if you're just gonna complain about the game", which looks to be a pretty common response to criticism of First.
---
Better put in this way, they got to meet developers and got to give them their ideas. Developers were excited and told corporate about they’re new plans. Corporate asked, “okay sounds good, so how much we charging for this stuff/can we make more money”? I will always have upmost respect for the developers, those with the corporate office can go you know what in their you know what.
---
I'm not explaining myself, dude. It was douchey I pointed it out. No I don't attack everybody who plays it, welcome to go through and have a read. Be well
---
dang i guess ill just have to buy a new one
---
ok no one cares
---
I did this today and won. Haha
---
Not really, me playing a game I already paid for doesn't support them any further
---
&gt; BGS contacted a number of the most vocal fans from around the world 
---
Is this true? Or did they contact influencers and YouTubers with SM followings?
---
Noo... I'm just sick of companies continually pulling this bullshit and instead of people telling them it's bullshit, you still have the cash cows whose money says "it's ok to be greedy we'll still pay"
---
Ah I'm on PC bro, good luck on your PvP efforts, they kinda fucked y'all in that area. At least you got a hacker free NW tho lol
---
Holy hell, someone reasonable lol
---
stop playing the game and play a real game this will give you the best experience there is.
---
yeah I hope they open up some ban waves thanks very much!
---
I am back to trying to replace mine as well. Took forever to get my set almost completely done. Now I am back to the grind... good luck with yours
---
Because the sub just came out..? I'm sorry are you being willfully dense?
---
Are we really downvoting this cause he criticized Todd? I mean cmon ik that this is a Bethesda sub reddit but Bethesda has objectively become one of (imo the worst) the most anti consumer publishers. And I don’t think anyone would argue that they have fallen so far from their former glory. The reason games like Battlefront 2 changed is because the community didn’t let the game be the greedy anti consumer game that it started out as. They didn’t accept the lack of care for consumers like a lot of people have with fallout 76. I love how much care there is for Bethesda but they REALLY do not deserve it anymore. This community is nothing except a long term cash grab to them.
---
Killing ghouls is the fastest, weakest enemy in terms of health and lack of armor and abundant in whitesprings.
---
Again, if you enjoy it, great, but supporting these arsehole moves by the company tells them it's okay
---
Astonishing build! So imaginative! Would love to visit, like seeing all the varieties. From immersive to inventive and creative structures like yours. Especially ones that break the barriers of building. 
---
Saw one the other day called the UFO. Only way in was to jet pack into the bottom to shop, lol.
---
After a couple of months mabye
---
If it's your thing, cool. Just hope you aren't paying more
---
It happens when your a cheater! A dirty little cheater!!!
---
It shows them that it’s acceptable to do what they’re doing because people will play the game throughout it all it doesn’t hurt Bethesda if you keep their player base alive not everyone who spends money on this game is the only problem that type of blame is lame because people who don’t spend a dime think they aren’t the biggest problem when they are even if they don’t further feed the problem financially it’s why you see some people say how can you still play fallout 76
---
Option 1 seems like it would be most recognizable at a fallout-specific event, but even in a more general setting the Pip-Boy might be enough to set it apart anyway. If your husband is doing a Fallout-themed cosplay too that would probably also make the Pioneer Scout getup look more recognizable.
---
Otherwise, if you're worried people won't notice the Pip-Boy and think you're just cosplaying a regular scout, option 2 or 3 sound like a safer bet.
---
IMO the badges could make a cool addition to the look, especially if they're noticeably relevant to Fallout, too.
---
TYVM! I appreciate it!
---
Dude, go to the main sub, we're all laughing at you. Wait you mean the other idiots on this sub who paid disagree that I called them idiots? Shocking
---
As someone who is a fan of the Fallout series, but feel they dodged a nuclear missile not buying FO76. I feel sorry for what happened to you, but I hope in the future you, and everyone who has read this post, will consider not purchasing anymore Bethesda titles. Show them that you won't support them and what they're doing, like NostalgicBadger/lolfactor1000 said, they're no longer a gaming development studio, they're a business, a coporation making money, and only care about that, money. So stop giving them yours, and put that effort towards other games that do care about you. You owe it to yourself, for how much work you put into it.
---
Old bug from Beta days, was patched but guess it has returned.
---
As one of those fans who was included in that trip, who has praised and brutally held Bethesda's mistakes under a harsh like, personally I'm struggling.    
---
Both to stay invested in the game, and not loose faith in Bethesda as a whole.
---
I've watched cheaters and hackers get banned lifted in days, with mountains of evidence submitted (often taking a two or more weeks and dozens of reports to get them suspended in the first place).  
---
All unbanned/suspended for "lack of evidence" which means someone completely failed to do there job and click the provided links or spend 30 seconds on Google, because the videos aren't hard to find, hell many of them brag openly about their cheating.  
---
At the same time people contributing amazing amounts of time and effort require 2 weeks, and more time from multiple parties than I'd like to admit, are still struggling to get unsuspended/banned.   
---
People we and also Bethesda know are contributing and helping the community

Personally I've had an unresolved Fallout76.exe GPU related bug render the game almost unplayable, with 20 - 40 FPS's staring at a wall, and non-stop lockups if I try anything more complicated than an Un-Nuked golfcourse on a system that prior to the bugs introduction ran **FOUR CLIENTS AT THE SAME TIME on one computer at 60 FPS each.**   
---
Can't get any support, Zenimax's customer support has blown me off, and getting no help from the Dev's...    
---
(Trust me I've done the troubleshooting..... but if anyone running a dual GPU system, non-SLI, wants to try and replicate PM me!)      
---
I could go on, but instead I'll mention the other side of the coin..    
---
There are people trying inside Bethesda trying very hard to make this right, to stop the slide and make our voices heard.  
---
Bethesda has others working on the weekend (their days off) to resolve critical issues....  
---
And those who really want to bring us the new content...   
---
But they seem to be loosing the battle.  
---
Personally want to see some signs of change from Bethesda to keep from tapping out, as honestly it seems like we are in nearly the same situation we were in one year ago.  
---
No communication, updates giving us more issues than they fix (patches 9.5 - 13.0......... don't get me started) and choices announced to the community in direct oposition to what we've asked for.
---
I was wondering how I only had 1 fusion core... I don't use PA except on the queen and usually have 3-5 cores on me at all times. Today I noticed I only have 1 which is wierd. Gonna have to pay attention now
---
You’re obviously not explaining yourself because it’s inexplicable that what was said was douchey unless you’re a fragile loser offended that someone likes something your don’t and has the gall to be proud of it.
---
Its clear you just want to be angry. There is another thread where he is more explicit but I can’t find it at the moment. Sorry i can be of more help but I have to go to bed. If you don’t like/play the game... let others enjoy it. Nobody is getting hurt because there is some voluntary subscription that some people may choose to pay for to get 50% discounted atoms and private worlds. Core gameplay is still free if you own the game. There is no paid DLC, and no season passes. All expansions are free. It’s pretty nice and I will be enjoying wastelanders for free in a few months. Hope to see you out there.
---
We did much much more than that, but I won't argue that the choices since then aren't instilling faith in the community.
---
Might be behind a paywall
---
Bethesda popped in to verify it, and the Fallout Moderators were made aware and sat on the thread killing trolls.
---
I finally got my bag...
---
It suddenly got less rare. It dropped for a lot of people during Mischief Night. I got one, and purchased 2 dirt cheap. Sold one for 5k. They used to be worth more before in my opinion.
---
Oh thanks for your concern but I'm financially stable. I can comfortably afford to buy some cosmetics for a game I enjoy and put many hours into.
---
Private server last night on Xbox did not spawn legendaries for 2 of them and the only legendary was a 1 Star.  It was different not seeing 3 legendaries l Ike on public servers.
---
Generally though on public servers legendaries feel like they are abundant kinda like the old days to an extent.
---
don't agree, especially since the majority of our input doesn't seem to have been heeded.  
---
Personally would have questioned their sanity for most of what we've seen them choose to do over the past few months.
---
Also see Aten_Ra's comment below. He was one of them.
---
Nothing to do with your financial situation, man lol why are people so insecure about that?
---
I like the robot music better than Praise The Lord And Pass The Ammunition 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Why did you say you hope I'm not spending money then?
---
Yes reporting bugs still helps so they can start working on it especially when you consider how long it takes to get them fixed usually 2months-1year though unless it effects atom shop.
---
You remind me of Adam Sandler, "They're all gonna laugh at you!"
---
I wouldn't pay attention to the downvotes. I'm sure Bethesda is paying for shills online to to attempt and salvage what's left of their reputation. Party's over for this guy though. Not only will I never buy anything made or published by them, I will make sure that none of my friends or family do either.
---
Darn corporations being all corporationy
---
I'm not angry. Was curious, got some reasonable responses and some douchebag responses. Nah, I bailed end of last year, friends and I were going to come back but it hasn't significantly improved so 
---
Be well, dude
---
Stealth is even better with melee so long as you use escape artist. You don’t even need to invest into any melee damage cards. Just get yourself an instigating / power attack melee weapon (my preference is a combat knife) and you can kill most enemies from stealth with a single hit.
---
Idk. It might just be me but i actually enjoy the old timey and classic music. The beats might be more appropriate for the institute if you ask me.
---
Maybe they will add that area to NW mode. Lol! Overseer gets the hot new toy!
---
Why don't you go back to the "main sub" and tell them I hope all this monetization completely ruins Fallout 5 for them....
---
And now im imagining it to a synth rave and danse is ok with it.
---
Game actually has significantly improved IMO. Last fall I would get disconnected constantly, now I can play 6 hours smoothly with no issues. Not sure what you’re talking about. Anyway have a good one.
---
I buy all of it whenever I see it.
---
Again, I'm not to explain, but Pat yourself on the back because you clearly held the moral high ground and didn't call me any names... Wait.
---
I had an idea. It would open with the original TV broadcast on a slightly dusty/cracked screen of a Vault Tec tv. Right about the song starts, two Vault Jumpsuit clad dwellers would but picking up the tv and moving it out as the camera starts to pan out over the atrium, now transform into a bazaar selling various goods as the camera leaves the vault. It fades to white then pans down from the slightly sunny sky as it shows dwellers using makeshift cranes and other contraptions to lift metal struts into place, as they build walls and new buildings, the smoke stacks of various factories now breathing out smoke once more was the fires of industry are rekindled. At the very end it could show dwellers dressed in every faction's garb having a BBQ looking out over the Prime Fissure site as it gets nuked and an army of players charge towards the scorchbeast queen, firing upon her and her minions. As the screen fades out, two freshly uncapped Nuka Colas would clink together as the title for "Wastelander's" appears in the sky.
---
Unauthorized access of secure transport container. Commencing self-destruct sequence under “DROPKICK” protocol.
---
Ain't worth shit, used 2 be worth 20k now worth 1k
---
Have you missed my entire point about not supporting a company that has continually fucked over its fanbase?
---
To be fair robots for our camps wasn't added because we requested it, it was added because it was already made as clearly shown by footage from before fallout 76 release.
---
Ahh, that's from Carrie, man lol
---
Great scene
---
Yes! That respawn delay screws me all the time!
---
Lol yea I usually don’t die on purpose for what it’s worth. Sometimes it just happens.
---
Hmmmm, yes, but the amount they've fucked people on this one... Did those folks get their canvas bags yet lol you know the ones they paid for? Lol
---
Hey if you hadn’t started with the names I would have left well alone. But no, you called someone a douche and I want to know why. Was it because they said they liked something you don’t? Was it cause they said they could afford to support it and would? Why was the response the response of anything other than a fan?
---
I’ve been buying them when I find them for under 1K.  I found a Halloween Long Suit for 150 caps today too.
---
No lol you're insanely weird and petty?
---
Happens like crazy in nuked WS on Xbox the last few days.
---
Nope, Adam Sandler
---
Actually they did
---
It's true, and only 2 of us came forward and discussed it.
---
Don't think I called you anything bud, but okay you white knight away. Jesus, this has obviously offended you deeply
---
Who and how did they actually fuck anyone anyways?
---
How am I talking shit?
---
No "friend" would recommend this trash.
---
And then they were promptly banned because they knew too much.
---
You have a point. I do believe a lot of potentialy great games are getting ruined by aggressive marketing practices.
---
I am not against people voicing their opinions, but it becomes a problem when they start harassing others.
---
You can't simply keep people from choosing to buy something, but you can at least tell them why they shouldn't.
---
If me spending $100 a year is all it costs to fuck people like you over in future games...
---
WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY
---
*Why are you booing me? I'm right.*
---
Because TC made up their mind before they made this post and they don’t really care what other people have to say in fo76’s defense. They are just trying to stir things up.
---
So I hadn't played for awhile until last week and hopped back on.  One thing I noticed that seems super suspicious is the little crates that show up at the purveyor before you actually spend the scrip.  They look an awful lot like the repair and scrap kits.  I wonder if Bethesda is thinking about selling scrip for atoms or just being able to buy legendary "chances".
---
As far as the ptw mechanics go I think they added the scrap box and tent to sweeten the deal for the subscription.  As is the private servers seem pretty bland.  If you could have increased camp budget and a persistent server I think it might be worth the money.  Right now it isn't and they took an ok idea with the Fallout 1st and locked stuff that should be in the base game behind the subscription service.
---
Aww, woot
---
Don’t play it then, problem solved.
---
I hate riding off bugs.
---
It's all fun until someone lures the nearby sb to it ;D
---
More income envy I see...
---
Pissed people can afford PA edition and FO 1st?
---
I'm just amused people are still playing, it's almost like they love the pain and suffering.
---
Are you taking the piss?
---
Woah, don't bring the church of satan into this "evil" speak.
---
They aren't.
---
Think of anything else that you can do with your money, and do that. This game is not worth it at all
---
You're stupidity is eclipsing. It's just, wow
---
awesome, keep posting what you run into, better to have 5 people to tell me a bug I know about than miss a critical one!
---
I don't, was asking a question, some of you took it in the butt, not sure why
---
Can I get a link to the post or you describe it?
---
I am fascinated by what occurred. Not in a shitty way
---
Couldn’t possible be because no matter what people say you feel the need to convince them they are wrong. Who cares, it’s a game. You don’t like it then don’t play it.
---
Basically what I have on my main character then, eh? 😄
---
Absolutely.
---
Wait, because I'm not an idiot I have income envy? Do you wear a special bright vest and helmet when you go out?
---
If i said "fallout 1st proud," and somebody got anal about it, i would return with "I didn't mean any offense."
---
Miscommunications happen, but given the way that was all handled i think it's safe to say the "FO1st Proud" statement was intended to get under his skin.
---
I'm sure the fallout community is absolutely tired of hearing it, but the problem isn't the people who have fun with the game, but rather that their is no self respect to demand for better.  1 year and the only thing that's gotten delayed is the one thing that doesn't make bethesda money, the one thing planned and had a release window and would take the game on it's first evolution towards being an actual game (even if the bugs still remain, it's still a push towards this game resembling something worth the initial cost, by the standards most companies actually set).  The more you pay, the more you reinforce the laziness they are showing with the fixing the game portion.  Then, while i couldn't really care about what the fallout community does, other companies will see this is working and a game i may end up caring about will release with no concern for quality.  They'll get enough people to make the game survive and profit.  They won't see my money for i no longer get games day 1.  
---
From my pov, a console or PC is hardware required to play games so that's great, but they immediately put a store into your home.  A purchase for Fallout 76 is putting another store into your home.  But, it can't stop their, the subscription is required so that you can buy certain items in-game, so on top of having the initial two stores that get you to this point, you have to also pay a monthly fee to have rights to use that store.  When do you say enough is enough?
---
No, look at the normal comments lol if people like it fine
---
Embrace it!
---
Shitty trolls always hate being called out on it.
---
Eh I don't think so. I originally played this with friends, but it ends up becoming more enjoyable solo. So much time spent at camps, crafting, and waiting for each other. It gets to the point where you'll prefer solo. Then at higher levels each time you want to do stuff you'll have swap out all your perk cards and back. Too much time lost on nonsense. I say just play borderlands 3 or something if you're looking for a co op game.
---
ive lost so much stuff like this.   camp items like turrets generators workdenches etc.  lost my excavator power armor, my individual armor pcs, fave weapons.  no clue how this happens.  had to grind so much extra in this game.
---
Then what’s the problem? What are you trying to accomplish here? If people didn’t like the game they wouldn’t be on its message board, well evidently that’s not entirely accurate.
---
Not at the price they were asking.
---
Lower the price and yeah...I would have. I want a private server for me and my friend. That's the main reason I bought a subscription.
---
Dude, you really really have some issues. Jesus
---
Ahh so you don't want me to spend my money because of your resentment?
---
Oh god yes...and just more Nuka Cola items in general!
---
It didnt completely hate it at first but now i find it obnoxious. Like i said more insitute imo.
---
Has it been a whole five minutes since the last thread like this?
---
I might have it, what platform?
---
No, not at the moment
---
No you have income envy because you are envious of the income some people earn...
---
You then go online to a subreddit for a game you don't play and try to attack their choice of spending hybdreds of dollars on this game.
---
Your retort is to then trivialize rhe handicapped?
---
So you're not even old enough to drink, right?
---
lol :P
---
Winning is both luck and chance. Won once just by being drunk
---
i dont get who downvoted this, thats funny
---
Very true
---
It’s super fun. The people spamming downvoted have their reasons but it’s a genuinely fun game for many and if you’ve got dedicated friends then it’s even better. 
---
Early game is the best season by far. It’s worth the low price it’s at now for sure. 
---
If on PC then add me @ TheMasterDev and I’ll join ya
---
Have a question. What platform? I use a lot of energy rifles, plasma/lasers. I make a lot of goo piles. Have been having scorched at Harper's Ferry dying, but the scorched and the goo pile are there together. Have pics of those on Xbox. 
---
In PVP, when you still have your dead enemy in VATS, it snaps to where they spawn next. It does it in PVE as well, just not too frequent for me, on Xbox 1 X. I have an old clip on my Xbox, around Fasnacht event with a super mutant in his undies, in a creek. Was able to gib his head. 
---
Also have some clips of the old camera bug that would throw you across the map. Really, don't get me wrong. I really do enjoy this game 90% of the time. It's a lot of random fun. ☺
---
Those are interesting points and better made than those of an obvious troll who came looking for a boring fight. I don’t disagree entirely, although I doubt many companies are going to be watching Fallout 76 as a role model of how to do a monetisation roll-out of an online game! Bethesda could be doing things better no question. But to my initial point, thoughtful discussions like yours are more helpful in driving can discussion than asking trolling questions and then being rude when people answer truthfully. Some people really are just happy to pay for what they like after all.
---
GG brotha
---
That would require dev time and resources. They can barely fix bugs as it is which is why we aren’t getting Wastelanders this year. Any thread asking for new content is immediately blocked by them by this point.
---
I guess I gave up on the idea of bans being lifted. I haven't been aware that this has ever happened.
---
hey guys so im starting this thing called club fuzzy, whos in?
---
Get a few more shifts mopping bathrooms at the pub.. You'll be fine
---
eh it's not like you can take it back.  the guilt feeling is part of being human.  your brain is just reminding you not to slip that far.
---
Why would they put time and effort into changing anything when people are content to play the game they already have with the vague promise of new things in the future?
---
Great write up.  I have spent a lot of time commenting in threads and creating a few of my own to discuss, what I feel, are relatively easy quality of life changes to the game.  I usually get a few really nice responses but the majority lately have been "Bethesda will put that behind a paywall". The negative stuff always drowns out any of the posts created that don't feed that salt.  I have my opinions on Fallout 1st and have stated them several times so I will avoid that here.
---
Long story short Bethesda needs to capitalize on what make FO76 awesome.  The community, the factions, the lore, the camp building, the player vending, the community events.  If they did this and worried less about trying to squeeze everyone all the time for cash they would foster a lot more good will.  Just imagine if they had given everyone a scrap box when they released Fallout 1st?  The community would be singing a totally different tune than it currently is.
---
Building a few generic nuke drop bosses and adding some of the atom shop cosmetics into the game as rewards for some of the old events would really spice things up.
---
I know of a few.
---
They rotate out skins and other things in the shop, "sending them to the Vault" or something to that effect.  
---
Then they bring them back later on to sell again.
---
The goal was to figure out why there would be people still actively monetarily supporting a game that is considered the biggest joke around the world. After constant false promises and general bullshit
---
I by default cringe when there's posts about this. Complain about something that matters more than fallout 76 lol. There's nothing in 1st that makes your experience any better expect you can have 4457 adhesives.
---
It is ok. We're at a year, I'm happy there's still future content.
---
Play a different game, there's so many.
---
We need both TBH.
---
Learn to read
---
But game was “bad” before then right? So why complain now? lol smh
---
Is this a different system to limited time items? Coz then I need to get to that ultracite PA skin lol
---
I’m glad you had a good experience, that would’ve been greater with chat, but Bethesda wants us to use mics (because deaf people don’t play /s).  
---
You can use discord or something (if both parties have it and can communicate they are on), or you can emote like you are on a foreign planet and there are 12 universal signs.  
---
I’d get a mic if you have the chance.  It does make 76 so much easier.
---
Unfortunately, paywalls do not exempt you from Bethesda's incompetence .
---
Probably because most people just don’t care. I don’t think many people are well informed on what these companies are doing. It’s just a game and if they enjoy it they will put money into it, it’s that simple.
---
I won't be over encumbered when I die but it acts like I'm not receiving carry boosts from my gear.
---
Sort of. Stuff that is initially limited time, like say the Liberty Prime skin or the Four Horsemen skins, are only up for a short window initially and then come back to a bit of fanfare on the display.
---
The Vaulted stuff comes back to a bit less applause and a bit longer.
---
As for the Ultracite: do you mean the prototype skin?
---
I saw someone buy one for 15k the other day.
---
I had this issue for my Excavator which I hardly used. I noticed it did the "low fusion core" sound whenever I exited - then noticed cores were missing.
---
It stopped doing that for me but I don't know how I fixed it. I think it may have been because I pulled out all fusion cores from all power armors just to be sure.
---
Count your down votes homey, then question your support on dissing supporters of this game.  Who is really laughing?
---
那#可@##
---
You've heard from both sides, it can be fun, it can be buggy, only you can decide. 
---
The rumor is there may be another free to play week. If really unsure, then wait till then.
---
I personally have played for 1700 hours &amp; I still enjoy it daily - bugs &amp; all
---
I mean, you do you, I think it's damn stupid but hey you give them your money.. to.. show.. me up? I guess
---
those are for the vault raid gear
---
Give it some time.
---
Me? At you, still.
---
Spawn 100 ghouls and scorched and supermutants in there, maybe a deathclaw and sheepsquatch in the mix and have them all fight when a player walks in.
---
Yeah I meant to the prototype skin, also looks like i missed out on those fancy PA skins where they drastically change how the helmet looks like F
---
Certain combinations of effects go well together. Instigating and hunting or lever rifles is perfect- with sneak you can one shot most enemies. For bullet sponges combine furious or executioners with fast firing weapons like fixers, combat rifles or handmades to quickly take them down.
---
There is a PlayStation messenger app on the phone! I use to communicate with my new fallout buddy!
---
They didn't add any description in game to it, so it kinda is their fault. Just adding that it's a crafting component, and not a random legendary modification would have made it much less of an issue.
---
Exactly, they both would make the game better.
---
They're not stupid at all. They know people are still gonna play and buy crap no matter what they do, so they don't care. 
---
Just look at some of the topics on this subreddit. Items disappearing, and an atomic shop full of crap people don't want, yet they keep playing and paying.
---
Why would they change?
---
Im sorry, your mom borrow you the 12.99 yet?
---
Would this work for New Zealand purchases? We have a consumer guarantees act also which I threatened in my original request for refund.
---
Xbox. The problem is I have to find it for it to count, which is yet another dumb design decision in this game.
---
I wouldn't say bad, I'm sure there's a good game in there, it's.. just.. broken. Which made progression kind of hard
---
unyeilding and one lifesaver
---
I've encountered this just about everywhere with a number of different monsters including ghouls, scorched ghouls, and molerats.
---
I actually liked the fallout 3 centaurs in their own way. They are less Thing inspired and more horribly suffering body horror.
---
not broken.  you are still a glass cannon and not ranged anymore
---
I'm using excavator, and it does make that sound when I exit PA. I will try your suggestion. Muchly appreciated!
---
You're not making sense at all. I never said or even implied anything about "showing you up."
---
Yeah, same. And the outfits and emotes.. if they make content people want,  we'll buy it..
---
If you search here, there's an ongoing list of bugs after each patch release. Dig into that and you'll probably find most of them.
---
Haha, retort well you do
---
The Prototype Ultracite skin? It's still in the shop for me, and I haven't bought it yet. 
---
What, is it not there for you?
---
Haven't seen what you describe myself. I have noticed that recently I have been able to add friends and accept friend requests again. Hadn't been able to do that in months.
---
Seriously, issues. I never mentioned income, you insecure people did...
---
DCG needs some neon love
---
This needs to happen
---
The Prototype's pretty swell. I picked it up the first time I saw so I didn't know it rotated out or back.
---
Those'll come back though. Everything comes back eventually.
---
That would be interesting

Crappy legendary items for cheap so I can scrip them.
---
Honestly never though about that. I seldom play online with anyone else really so I'm never I  guild or clans these days, but joining a clan was almost quintessential when I played WoW as a kid. Especially in terms of an MMORPG setting even advertising it and driving us to socialize I seldom see the application of any of the structure for social grouping aside from the hierarchy that the sub service has made and vice versa. Even in my ESO plays I use the guild stores and trading system and I desperately hope for something similar so we can make more caps? I saw a plan on a vendor bot for 11250 caps. That is well over what I've gathered and
---
 playing  with vending some.
---
Lol
---
Because Bethesda is a business that needs money to pay for employees and servers?  This is kind of basic economics.
---
I had an item duplicate in my inventory and it remained there until I logged out, at which point the copy vanished from my inventory.  The item was the special fatman 'Daisycutter' and it seemed to dupe when I was selling off items quickly at a vendorbot, or when I was scrapping a large quantity of weapons at a station.  I'm not sure which though.
---
Cool story bro.
---
You know it's the actual devs that keep reintroducing bugs that they'd previously fixed after each new patch, right? 
---
You can say plenty about corporate (and you should) but the devs as much responsible for the state of Fallout 76 as management are.
---
They also have a much lower player cap, so there is that.
---
Ngl I used to run away from even regular Deathclaws the second I see them, even while I was Level 100+ with several big guns
---
That all changed once I got a Handmade and several thousand rounds of 5.56
---
We have mics. We also have a toddler. And we're also anxious about actually talking with people, much like everyone else is with phones. We keep it quiet when we play.   
---
We would use Discord for text, naturally, if there were a way to communicate this information to a random we encountered, like, Nabil--but that kind of QOL doesn't exist. Maybe if they merge the existing "LET'S USE EMOTES" functionality with the ability to chat something into them, lawl. :P  
---
But, yes. A mic, obviously, would be an easy solution. But it isn't a solution that works for us.
---
I just sold 3 for 500 caps a piece. They're not rare anymore and the market is flooded with them after the event
---
Think about what you are saying it makes no sense.
---
I'm sorry but what else did you expect? He bought a broken, dodgy game from a corporate entity which doesn't care about anything but increasing the amount of money each user pays per month.  
---
And this same question, I want to ask the rest of you. What did you expect? You willingly bought this game. You willingly continue to play it. You willingly continue to participate in Bethesda's dumpster fire. Some of you people even buy Fallout 1st. You get abused and exploited, over and over again, and then when it's all done, you give Bethesda money and beg them to abuse you again.  
---
I'm sorry but if you keep playing this game, if you keep paying, if you keep allowing Bethesda to trample you, then you are as much at fault as Bethesda. Yeah, they're kicking you in the balls again and again, but you're the one who bought and spit-shined steel toed boots for them to kick you with in the first place ... Comes a time where you either stop fooling yourself, or you get what you deserve ...
---
What's wrong with the game? It works fine for me.
---
I’m drowning in all kinds of loot right now from people targeting me because I bought fallout 1st. 
---
ITS BEAUTIFUL
---
Go with carnivore mutation, you can stack meat bonuses
---
...deserve a lot more than a trailer. The increased monetization with "Fuck You 1st" made me just uninstall.
---
Does it count if someone drops it and you pick it up?
---
I was thinking about that possibly or good doggy
---
What, is handholding is too good for you?
---
I've had like 4-5 games with cheaters.... only one today as I am grinding for the glowing halloween skeleton costume. I told the guy off as he was shooting his smg through a wall killing players and I told him off. He turned off his cheats, I ended up dipping out of that game.
---
I price mine at 500 per star for good legendaries (Furious, Vampire etc), unless they are top tier (Bloodied Explosive for example) then I do 1000 per star. They sell pretty frequently at that price.
---
Yes, because people target you for buying it, so I have pretty much unlimited junk and caps
---
A lot of what FO76 basically amount to QOL changes, yeah. Like something as simply as trying to join someone's team.  
---
Or.
---
I'm sneaking on right now. Just wanted to do a little base modification.  
---
I get populated into a world where my base didn't spawn, and it's asking me if I wanna stay here or try another world.

I imagine there's a good reason for this, but... why not just populate me into a world where my base can spawn?
---
I mean you have stack attack dmg by eating different types of meats that are super easy to find. Mole chunks, mutant hound meat, glowing meat, deathclaw, yaogui. That stuff adds up for huge hits!
---
Oh ya absolutely, mainly talking about the new content type stuff. Never said they’re off the hook for the bugs and crashes lol. NW for pc (not as bad on console) needs to be a priority rn. Hackers are destroying what should be a really fun part of FO76. Bugs need to be next, I can only hope that wastelanders will bring a fix to it all. Well at least that’s what I put on my list to Santa lol
---
Im really concerned about the development of TES 6 and starfield at this point. Every month bathesda keeps reinforcing this feeling that those games are going to be **huge** disappointments. I really hope they are not. Starfield is a new IP , so a bad start can be bearable for us space sci fi fans, but TES 6 , thinking about the microtransactions , lootboxes and general lack of understanding of the community , I'm scared what that game will end of looking like. 
---
And if it ships without modding support, of boy, rest in peace bathesda. 
---
At this point fallout is pretty much dead.
---
cranberry cobbler also
---
I'm not really sure what was planned but from what I've been hearing from juicehead and from what I've read on here from people data mining it looks like it will be big. There was someone who data mined new sections of the map which make it seem like eventually they will double the map size. They weren't sure if it was apart of wastelanders or not or another update in the future but I imagine Bethesda knows how important this DLC is so I bet it's fairly large. Juicehead seems to think it will be and he's been right on a lot of things.
---
I'm with you on this. My Two Shot Missile Launcher and Instigating Auto Grenade Launcher are just too much fun.

One of the best I've seen. I know how to get a floating roof but how do you get the floors? I'm going to have to do some experimenting.

Ooo I didn’t think about that, thanks for the tip.
---
&gt; Are we really downvoting this cause he criticized Todd? 
---
You say this as if anyone up/down votes based on anything rational.
---
Fully agree with you that Bethesda deserve the criticism they're getting.

You got me. I made a typo. my God what am idiot I am.

Great, thanks!

what
---
Also what bugs are you referring to and server stability? Disconnect are pretty rare now. The base game is fine from a function stand point. It needs more content.
---
Would it be worth the extra 3 points in perception for butchers bounty?
---
Same over here since fallout 1st.
---
I've found multiple of that idiot. I clear them out every time I find one. They are how I am able to keep my scrip total up waiting for the next purveyor sale without having to grind.
---
Thanks. I stored my other PA and switched the chassis. Problem solved.
---
Goodnight, sweet prince. I wish I had something better to say, but nothing of value was lost. FO76 has been a pile of garbage right from the start. At least now, you're finally realizing it and you're finally putting away the shotgun. No more shooting yourself in the foot now. You've finally had enough.   
---
I'm sure you have realized it by now, but you were wrong to buy this game. You were wrong to buy FO 1st. You were wrong in playing it. You were wrong in supporting it and wasting your valuable time on it. You have limited time on this earth, and you squandered it...  
---
... Until now. At least now, you will be a shining example. Let's hope something positive comes out of all of it and your experience will wake up all the other gullible masochists willingly associating with this dumpster fire of a game.  
---
I'm sorry you've had to learn the lesson the hard way. And I'm sorry I couldn't convince you to stop playing this game before you've had to face the truth like this. Even if you deserve what you get for supporting this game in the first place ... It's still a sad story.  
---
Godspeed in your future endeavors. I hope you will never be fooled again.
---
No your fine without it. Once you learn to grab it as you play you will end up having to much meat. The harder part is keeping the melee meat from spoiling when you need it most. Otherwise I grab whatever meat to eat for hunger.
---
Good with salt might be good then
---
how so? We've already seen their developing "skills" with the last updates.
---
I've been trying to defend or understand Bethesda's actions since the very first Beta launched but by now after they delayed Wastelanders only for their subscription service I have no more hope they're actually working on the game, look at how EA is handling Anthem atm too.
---
They released it as a side-project for income while the main studios work on Starfield and TES VI so it wasn't even supposed to have all dev-power behind it but now even failed more than after launch
---
Because I like the game. Simple.
---
no
---
Yeah dumbass, it's transfer, trade or gifting in REAL LIFE. if they transfer items between players inside the game, there are no issues. Plus trade and transfer is a mechanic so idk what you are on about.
---
Yeah that’s a good perk. I don’t use quality of life perks as I play so I got the refrigerator instead but it still spoils a little sooner then I would like. I’ll probably get the refrigerated backpack mod then I won’t have to manage my meat at all.
---
I can hear the music
---
Oh whoops no its still there my bad, sorry for the confusion
---
The real guilt should set in if you do not report this person for cheating. Bethesda may be slack on their end but at least you can say that you tried.
---
Stranger in numbers would be a great perk for you to use in charisma if you play with friends. It will boost your mutations quite a bit.
---
I'd rather have a refund.

&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
I would consider then getting herd mentality mutation. +3 on all specials when with friends. Also what power armor are you using?
---
It's bad because youtubers say it's bad? Why do people play it then? Why didn't everyone quit? Personally I like it a lot better than outer worlds. I got bored with that one pretty fast. The world's are tiny, the items are sparse. The graphics are not great. The story is decent but it's still not on fallout level. I was disappointed in that one but I love fallout 76.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Shoulda recorded it then sent to bethesda.
---
you do know survival server don't exist anymore right?
---
Not sure I have not really used power armor much in this game, I just unlocked the excavator power armor today on my main. I don’t know what would be best for melee
---
their forum has a stickied post of know issues
---
I got this game on release but quit playing after like a week. I just started playing again last month to get leveled up for wastelanders.
---
I doubt hes ever played
---
Yea but this post wasn't about if I think Bethesda is a bad game company or fallout 1st. It's about wanting a trailer for wastelanders so the people being rude are the ones spamming it about why they think Bethesda sucks. I like the game. I don't want to debate it with people who hate the game. I want to know some more information about wastelanders because what I've learned so far sounds exciting so it would be nice if we got a second trailer!
---
What platform? Today I was able to hit 22k max with a BPA meathook. What’s your consumable stacks and perk card set up?
---
Don’t get me started....    
---
I lose my mind with some of the updates, it takes the Fallout ‘76 dataminers a few hours to find every change in the new ESM compared to the previous one.  
---
Doesn’t catch compiled script errors or missing files in the BA2’s, but just doing that one step on Bethesda’s side would have saved **hundreds** of man hours, if not more, on Bethesda’s side.  
---
   
---
No disrespect to the Dev’s designing the content, but something is breaking down between approval and compiling...    
---
There needs to be change in their workflow.   
---
That and they need actual testing done, not half a dozen people in a controlled environment, but “‘Ard Core” power gamers who enjoy breaking games for fun kind of testers.  
---
We should have had test servers 9 months ago, after the brutal, almost disastrous, launch.  
---
But I’m beating a dead horse here
---
I know but that happened. Dude started shooting me and I returned fire with my shotgun on accident and the guy immediately went to town.
---
Unfortunately, when it comes to trading, only trade through reddit, but still be careful as scammers lurk on here as well.
---
Only trust high karma people. Otherwise if they want your item make sure they know you expect them to go first.
---
It's happened to me on the xbox marketplace &amp; via a reddit trade. Now it's my rules or no deal.
---
If it just happened should be able to save the video of it.
---
At least another legendary sale
---
Happened to me few times but as you mentioned most of them are good but when you doing high end trades make sure to get the help from a courier 
---
Sorry for your loss BTW
---
The conspiracy theories about Bethesda's evil plan to steal everyone's money are getting old considering they don't make any sense at all. We get it there's people who don't like the game for whatever reason but there are people who do so I think it would be nice if we could talk about it on reddit without all the BS.
---
I really wish more people would report on your experience. I know most YouTubers are just jumping at any chance to trash Bethesda and 76 but all of them missed that post and it's a huge shame, it's one of the reasons why I still argue that I'm sure there's passionate devs out there but corporate is making a mess
---
West Tek
---
You with a tesla rifle
---
A higher level going through killing everything
---
Elder Scrolls Online has an entire studio dedicated to that game and that game only and so does Fallout 76. Also I don't agree with the last updates. They have been fine so I'm not sure what you're talking about.
---
Think i might pick up a bloodied GL from a player vendor, they usually go for under 1k on PC and have a go at it.
---
I'll add you if you ever join the PC Master Race ;P
---
yeah but they had the incentive to turn around ESO's launch which was on another studio, with 76 they don't even want to acknowledge the current situation as you can see by their radio silence about any of the critical topics.
---
Also 76 has about 5% of the content ESO basic has, not even talking about ESO plus
---
the key difference is that eso will likely still be around in a year
---
No retort, just wondering why you would bash a company for making money.  That is what companies do to provide more content and pay their own employees.  You complain about buying the BASE game and having to pay more for a premium membership that is not mandatory.   You dont have to pay to enjoy the BASE game.  Dont bash the people who actually enjoy the game and dont have a problem paying a little extra to make the game a little better.  Unlike a lot of people, i dont have time to grind hours upon hours a day.  I have what you would call a high paying job, that takes a lot of my time, plus a wife and kids that are way more important than any game.  So when i can play on my expensive computer i built myself i will play how i want when i can.  Telling by your hatred and shitty behavior i can tell you neither have an awesome job or family. Do you homie, i will do me.
---
I sold them today
---
What was the last thing you did before logging out?  
---
    
---
I’ve had this happen multiple times, and finally found out one of the possible situations it occurs.   
---
 **My example:**
---
Right after finishing a trade for an item I’d been looking for since launch I did Uranium Fever.  
---
It finished, looted everything and while in PA I scrapped all the weapons, junk and then exiting the bench I opened the map and fast traveled to the Train Station to drop junk in my stash, the new weapon and log off.  
---
The weapon was missing.   
---
Now it was favorited, I’ve remapped my “drop” key to make it a huge PIA to drop items to avoid loosing things, and it was renamed, so I would have gotten a pop up if I somehow accidentally dropped it right?  
---
But I never entered the Pip-Boy, I used “Escape” to access the map, so how could I have dropped it?  
---
When looting?   
---
Just in case I returned to the Mines and checked every damn container, nothing, but there was one of the people who did the event still there, so on a lark I asked if he found a *Vamp/SS/90%RW Guitar Sword* anywhere (don’t ask, I collect what I collect).     
---
Real odd and specific item, noticeable...   
---
and shockingly he had.  
---
He told me a bag appeared when I fast traveled away, and he figured I got it from the event and didn’t want it.... 
---
Even better, he returned it....  
---
I’ll say it again, **I never entered the Pip-Boy from when I finished collecting the junk to when I arrived at the White Springs Station** so there is no way I could have accidentally dropped it.  
---
Somehow the game glitched and dropped the item, Todd Howard only knows why, and I just got lucky and found an honest person.  
---
I’ve reported it, and have gotten no traction, but I can tell you, it does happen, so assuming your not trolling, empathize, it sucks.  
---
Next time it happens return to the last place you fast traveled from and see if you get lucky..
---
Odds are very good. I done the supply drop event at Morgantown Airport once and, after that, everytime i stopped someplace i would get empty supply crates dropping out of the sky at me. I had to log out when i fast travelled back to my CAMP and one dropped and blocked the only entrance inside.
---
I understood that reference
---
If ya find anymore could you plz sell me one I don't have one yet.
---
I see ppl selling their stuff for 1000s of caps each. I try sell everything i own cheap just so i can get rid of it.
---
The last one i needed was Tesla Science 1. A friend I was with found it for me. My suggestion is check spawns other than the ones you're checking, and get a friend to look for them with you.
---
I’ve built into a collapsed bridge with a cave, incorporating both elements into the build created a unique and fun base.  Found a server with someone else using the spot and it grew petty, but still a good location  #fallout
---
the point is that its impossible to grind that amount of atoms in such a short time, if they added more items you would have a cheaper alternative and wouldnt open your wallet to buy atoms with real money.
---
Only if someone points a gun to your hand and compensates $60 for each hour of your life you waste on this game.
---
One i think has been around for a long time and can be quite annoying is having to leave crafting benches multuple times. I cant be the only one........
---
Horde events tend to be either a grab it fast or be ready to be disappointed.  I have a good event maybe 1 in 20 times where someone knows to keep the boss alive as long as possible.  
---
I did a super mutant horde with a random about 2 weeks ago where we pulled 4 legendaries by keeping the boss alive.  
---
Eventually, we accidentally killed it, but it was a great time.  
---
Most folks just go for the boss because they either don’t know any better or are sick of getting nothing due to the folks who don’t know any better.
---
I was disappointed it didn’t get much attention, I’ve been cited multiple times in everything from Forbes to Juicehead for my bug roundups, but that post got no coverage...  
---
That said, someone is making exceptionally bad calls, and the choices have to be crushing the bottom line, and doubling down on one bad choice after another is a sure way to kill this game and permanently damage the reputation of the franchise.  
---
Personally know way too many people who’ve walked away out of disgust and have written off Bethesda until they prove themselves, which doesn’t seem to be happening anytime soon.  
---
There is hope still, but if they don’t do something soon they are going to see another major player die off (this would be the 6th I think), look at how few new posts there are week after week on this sub, and when we get new posts it’s rarely something positive.  
---
Bethesda/Zenimax needs to actually follow through on the multiple broken promises on communication and transparency, start listening to the community and responding in a reasonably nimble way (Dozens and dozens of mmos have done it for years, it’s not like it’s something new)...  
---
If they don’t, and keep going they way the listing ship is heading, I’m likely going out with player dieoff wave 6.  
---
(Rant off, sorry, lol).
---
Yup
---
They run 10-15k on the market.  
---
I got tired of not getting the drop so I bought them.
---
I juat tried it. First round was dope. Nothin really good dropped but plenty of 2 and 3 bangers..2nd 3rd and 4th runs..not one legendary.
---
You have to tag them to get exp. always been that way
---
Hey man I gave you some of my glitches/hacked weapons. Have fun getting banned, you dirty fallout first sellout. :D
---
Low level
---
I believe you have to do a small percent of damage to get the xp so you couldn't just shoot the scrochbeast queen once and get just as much xp as the people that actually killed it
---
you sell all that to the scrip machine is how you sell it
---
I think i might have a video explaining how, I've been using this trick since launch but rarely anyone seem to know of it:
---
https://youtu.be/nIXjTa4e-Gs
---
I've lost one weapon. And I'm paranoid about it now. I check for drop bags every time I use the pipboy now.
---
I'm thinking I may have put it in the script machine 🤔
---
This bugged me so much when mod authors did this after Creation Club. I totally understand their outrage, but removing your mods only punishes the players. Bethesda will not even notice
---
Same thing for armors?
---
Yeahhhh it’s literally just a camp bro. It ain’t that serious. Map76 actually had importance to the community and was utilized on a daily basis. I’m glad you’re standing up for what you believe in, but I think you may just want to check yourself.
---
A lot of what made earlyWoW magical was the (1) social cohesion provided by not only your guild (2) but also being a member of either the Alliance or the Horde, and how you (3) fought the opposing side in both informal skirmishes around the world and also in battlegrounds.   
---
\-That- doesn't need to be transplated here, exactly as it was in WoW. It's just an example.  
---
But if we're going to rebuild Appalachia, we need the ability to play with one another and against one another, and this requires systems that facilitate communication and formalize group structure.
---
If this involves furrys then it probably for the best........seriously I'm not judging. But furrys should be discouraged from breeding &amp; made to live outside the city limits.
---
Aten_ra has tried to help fix this game over and over again. Listing a bug report every time a new patch came out. To me he is a hero to this community. That being said when the post came out with Aten_ra and the other chosen ones getting to go to the developer studios, I didn’t get a feeling of good things to come. They weren’t allowed to speak of what they saw, but from what I remember it boiled down to them getting a preview of nuclear winter prior to release, which was something that no one wanted or asked for.  At the time we just wanted the bugs that were prevalent since launch to be fixed, which the chosen ones told the developers. Supposedly they listened to the chosen ones and assured everyone that happier days were on the horizon. Unfortunately that isn’t what happened, and now we are at what I feel is the darkest days of the game since release. It’s a shame as I have put many hours into the game, and always believed things would get worked out, but I no longer hold this view.
---
Euthanasia in the wasteland is indeed more brutal on account of the lack of vets.
---
Technically true, but if someone else tells you there's a bug and you have good reason to believe them (see: every update 76 has had, ever), you can pass it along for them as a sign of good faith.
---
Besides, if I was making a game and someone reported an exploit, while I would remove any benefits they'd gained through it, I would probably AWARD them some worthless commemorative cosmetic just to thank them from preventing others from ruining my game and cutting my profits when the customers who AREN'T ruining my game stop playing because it's not the experience they paid a hypothetical $60 for.
---
ok
---
Most games are fun with a friend. The majority of people that buy this game didn't like, but there is still a fan base here. The game is buggy and expect most of the new features and improvements to be locked behind a paywall. The game felt empty and alone even when playing with others, and the quest were boring and repetitive. Granted it was a few months since I last played. If none of these things bothered you, then give it a shot, but I wouldn't waste your money.
---
So you know about couriers and didn't use them because you're lazy, sucks to be you.
---
Dump it in the scrip machine.
---
Why can't we drag things?
---
Nuking NW should be the priority rn.
---
Yeah for sure. And playing through the story it felt like that was the direction. However you were thrown into the next faction without a blink and I just felt like that was a hug opportunity to expand into faction play and formal guilds. But eh. No.
---
Whitesprings golf club, West Tek, and Pleasant Valley Ski Resort.
---
If you're playing on a different copy you might have to redownload them, they might be in the atomic shop, or search fallout 76 tricentennial on whichever game store you use (Microsoft store on Xbox for example) and there should be a bundle of the tricentennial items, it might let you download that
---
If not, you can submit a ticket here and hopefully they'll sort it out: https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
A furry strip club, maybe.
---
Killing a whole team in less than 3 seconds doesn't mean cheating always but the rapid succession after does.
---
Twice ever I killed a whole team with all the explosive perks and a nice plasma throw if they were close enough. Downed them all and they just all died pretty much at the same time a few seconds later. Clipped it too. Was fun times before 76 became even worse garbage
---
If F1st and some atom store stuff were the things stopping you from winning, I feel like you may have larger issues. Perhaps some YouTube tutorials could help you. Is there something you need particular help with? Maybe we can offer some suggestions.

I believe it has to be found laying around outside of a container. Unfortunately, it is impossible to drop an item outside of a container.
---
Imho I blame the creator as much as I do Bethesda.
---
I don't know what he was expecting by continuing to help Fallout 76, a game that every week redefines the lowest point in gaming history.
---
If you're still playing this trash of a game, you're part of the problem. Grow up, move on and enjoy life.

Some things just don’t work! Ffr on a black powder is useless or on a harpoon that isn’t quad.. gauss rifles with ffr haven’t been concretely proven to me that they don’t work any faster but I don’t believe it helps
---
Awesome thanks. Most people would probably just keep the tricks to themselves :p
---
I hate that song too. Like it’s so catchy but the message is so fucking bullshit. Outing myself as a commie liberal now, gonna go hide before Liberty Prime finds me
---
There are 3 new quests available from train stations, just look for the posters :) that should be a good start, they'll get you moving around the map a bit too
---
1. Random server time outs (rare nowadays, but still happen)
---
2. Monsters that spawn but cannot be killed, either their health bar constantly refills or they're static models, some of which with heads missing
---
3. Big guns that won't fire when you press fire and ADS at the same time 
---
4. Repair kits not dropping when you kill Scorch Queen 
---
5. Daily quests you can't turn in
---
6. Achievements not triggering, like killing the Scorch Queen or *gasp* exiting Vault 76 (I had to make a whole new character to get that one, not that big of a deal, but it happened)
---
7. Liberators spawning 50ish feet in the air (that one's pretty funny because you can still hit them in vats)
---
That's just off the top of my head, things I've experienced in the last month. My point is, the game is not bug free. They've fixed a lot, and that's good, but some of these bugs shouldn't have been in the game to begun with, and I've only listed what I have personally witnessed.
---
Yeah there’s like 3 of them there
---
When I'm in my own world i do Uranium Fever every time, on public servers I don't bother. 🤔 Although if they changed the way legendarys were rewarded that would make things better. But that's not going to happen any time soon.
---
We have NPCs now selling us stuff...
---
Yeah a few new quests all activated by posters that can b found at whitesprings train station. Look for the three posters above the tinkers workbench just outside the shop doors. Plus there’s the burrows sewer/dungeon over in harpers ferry and vault raids which cycle a new vault raid quest every week (4 quests in rotation) u can do each one unlimited times but there’s 4 difficulties and some rewards locked by difficulty but u can only get those rewards once per day so ur de incentived to run the raid over and over multiple times a day. Instead do it once on each difficulty a day at most!
---
We will be getting companions that kind of hang out at our camps at some point, with quests and stuff like fo4 companions
---
Maybe they'll be able to
---
Ah yes, I ran into this bug too. Had it happen with a scorch beast corpse too.
---
BoS bundle Bos bundle BoS bundle!
---
Whats the second star of that dagger? If its swing speed might worth 2-3k caps if not scrip all
---
*Extermination is necessary*
---
I didn't actually talk about launch, I already remember that BGS said many times before launch that this was such an unusual endeavor that they absolutely wouldn't be able to get all the glitches before launch, and the beta was specifically made so they could do some more rigorous testing and fixing,
---
There absolutely was worse glitches before launch, if the Beta was anything to go by.  And I get how the Outer Worlds would be Less glitch heavy, considering it's relative simplicity.
---
You guys are all bugmen, consumer drones lmao. After all of this and you’re mad that there’s not more micro transactions available.
---
What about the Sea Captains hat...
---
Dont understand why there isnt item for item trading yet. So many other games have it and it's a literal necessity in a game like this
---

Why has ANYONE bought ANYTHING in Fallout 76? It's not a matter of opinion, the game is objectively flawed and has mountains of bugs, glitches and exploits to prove it. That doesn't mean he wasn't willing to let it slide if it finally meant he could have a private server to play the game by himself, a thing that games used to do by design, and unlimited storage, which is a problem Bethesda created so it could sell people a solution.
---
Also, the idea that you can pay for a service, use 20% of that service, discover that 40% of the service is broken (the 'private' servers and 'unlimited' scrapbox are more like 90%, but let's say they're only 2/5 features advertised on the Fallout First website, the others being the Atmos, Icons/Emotes and Cosmetics) and that the other 40% of the service is deceptive (the victim claims there are no discounts on Atomic Shop items like they were promised, which sounds like a failure of the service if someone else can corroborate) only AFTER you used the 1/5th that actually works and be denied a refund for that is outrageous. There's a reason ZeniMax is being forced by my Australian Government to refund people they lied to during the pre-orders: we don't take this kind of BLATANT shit from a private company.
---
This isn't even taking into account that the Atoms were supposed to be a bonus on top of the 'exclusive' features (servers, scrapbox, icons/emotes, and cosmetics). If you sell someone a meal and a drink, they finish the drink first and open the meal only to find out it was accidentally made of nightshade and feral cats, they'd be one hell of an uproar, especially here with the ACCC looking for the slightest reason to sue someone into the bedrock for those juicy legal fees. If it weren't for the fact that America's legal system is basically The Golden Rule, I suspect that there would be an awful lot of people starting lawsuits against Bethesda right now for the aforementioned counts of False Advertising, the same way there would have been an awful lot of lawsuits against Youtube and every company that has ever falsely claimed a video.
---
But the world hasn't been fair for twelve thousand years, why would it start now?
---
I play on PC, so I'm unsure if this will work on console, but I discovered that I couldn't respawn as Encryptid ended one time, much mashing of space bar and alt-tabbing ensued.  Then I discovered that I could use the mouse to click the [Space] at the bottom of the map to trigger respawn. Has worked every time.
---
I have one. I'll trade for a good bloodied weapon or unyielding piece
---
Buzz Brain isnt as easy as the rest (excluding Whoopsies) but those are all easy to get.
---
Sorry to say, none of those are worth anything except as scrip.
---
Nope that is something Bethesda has to prove, not me
---
"I'm not judging, just advocating genocide"
---
This hasn’t Happened to me in two months but I sympathize. ( I quit playing two months ago)
---
Id love the elder maxion outfit to make another apperance I wasnt around the first time.
---
If crouching actually changed the collision box maybe you could get in.
---
Seems unlikely unless you attacked the other player first
---
It depends on what you have, some things are worth a lot, some are just worth scrip price.
---
turn on pacifist
---
If the company gave a shit, they wouldn't have banned him, would they? Besides, it's not his job to stop the dupers, it's the developers. This is the same argument for why there are police forces and laws against vigilantism: even if it's unreasonable or outright broken, there has to be a system of checks and balances. Which is bullshit, by the way, if the cops and the law were doing their jobs right, we wouldn't have vigilante's getting involved in shit they should stay well away from if they value their well-being. But that's how it is.
---
If Bethesda was morally obligated to do the right thing, they wouldn't have banned the 900-hours guy without being exhaustive in their research and reasoning, then it would've been less of a shitshow. I say, let them keep banning people. In fact, let them ban EVERYONE. Then once their shit game collapses and we never have to deal with them again, people can learn to play games that don't deliberately create problems just to sell them solutions.
---
OMG This is a solid gold burn. I was doing research on the guy because of yet another argument he started, and his history is worse than I imagined.
---
It happened to me before. Almost quit the game but a friends convinced me stay. You should always do trades through a good medium with karma checks and reputable middlemen. I only wasn't cautious once after countless trades and I got scammed, so always check my friend. Don't worry you'll eventually get the same weapon if not better.
---
You can tap the fire button to shoot faster however it does not affect the charge speed of each individual shot. In my personal opinion you're better off going for a plus 50% limb damage or plus 10% aim down sights damage.
---
Damn! Think I'd rather the supply crate then a rain of dead scorchies.
---
xD I stopped playing when the collectors bags started arriving... Yes I was one of them who got one... POS.
---
At this point just hoping to find the few plans I dont know yet (dense combat where u at) and looking for decent unyielding right arms and right legs
---
Like the multitude of times I just chill in a bush let everyone thin themselves out then take out the last two or three. Not at all hard, just time consuming.
---
Doubt but if so I'll buy that
---
Tested this out two weeks ago https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/do41fc/goo_and_ash_piles_respawn_as_naked_immortal_and/
---
either scrip them or sell them in your vending machine for a hundred bucks per star. i find almost any crappy legendary will sell at those prices to people who need the scrip.
---
You're right about that, there's an unfortunate amount of harassment going around that shouldn't be happening. There's a lot of blame being thrown around toward First subscribers about how they're ruining the game, and that's not appropriate. I even said something like that myself, back when First was initially revealed, but I've since realized that's the wrong way to be about it. People who sub to First have every right because it's their money, their choice.
---
Selling gunpowder is just wrong
---
No one likes a scrub.
---
Bet that doesn't happen again lol
---
alphabetically, or in order of importance?
---
Then you have a bad taste in games.
---
I've played Fallout 76 and Outer Worlds and TOW is magnitudes better than Fallout 76.
---
I genuinely think that if this changes Bethesda will let us know before it goes away (if at all).
---
I thought this was hilarious.
---
Thank you. 
---
Tiny phone, fat fingers, freezing temperatures. You get the idea.
---
All go to scrip machine unfortunately
---
I like how you got downvoted even though you are right.
---
&gt;You mean the ones you have to submit a ticket multiple times, so that you get something other than "Goto WoWhead to check what your issue is?"
---
This is a garbage take. Their in-game CS isn't the same as their out of game CS. Both of which are pretty good overall.
---
&gt;The same company, that shit canned its CSR, after "Record Profits"?
---
They periodically do that anyway. Wasn't related to profit margins. That "take", if you can even call it that, was debunked within hours.
---
So what would you consider being worth alot? Ive been selling level 50 3* weapons for round 100caps
---
You're welcome, I will now delete my correction.
---
Stand? What?
---
Let's not get pretentious. This isn't some political movement. It's a game. Take your "stand" by not playing the game, not buying any future ones &amp; encourage your friends &amp; family to do the same.
---
If you paid the sentry bot helmet with the science scribe outfit it has a sci-fi kind of look!
---
Lol of course not that means adding interesting content
---
Earn it as we all did.
---
Why would that make them assholes?  If I were a subscriber I would hope for a new outfit each month.
---
I actually reported it to Bethesda about 10 months ago, but I think they have more important stuff to attend to :P
---
Fuck Bethesda.
---
Leaks said they were possibly gonna add more items every few months but I'm not sure if they'll take away old items to get people on the fence to impulse buy or just add the new ones in with the old ones.
---
Watch as Bethesda ban him because they knew he was datamining and doing illegal things. Datamining and making it easy for players on online is cheating. If people didnt know about this then the people that do would have a advantage.
---
I play ps4, I know it's not much but I have a tse submachine gun you can have to comp for your losses, I'll be online monday through Wednesday.  
---
Psn: Ye_oin
---
If it's not your speed I'll drop a line here to you for anything bloodied I get from the purveyor. I understand your pain and greatly sympathize.  It's a total bummer and theres not a good means of trading on an item to item basis.
---
It depends on your build and play style.
---
I swear, shit like that is my life. I've ruined having the jump on people SO many times
---
BYEEEE!!! CAN I HAVE YOUR GEAR PLS:)))) YIU'll BE BACK
---
90% of games: full price, with almost full price again for season pass/all dlc
---
Fallout: full price yeah, but all dlc free with every other payment being optional cosmetics or extremely basic utility items 
---
Scrap kits: don't scrap weapons and armour, 90% of what adds to weight, andyou're never more than a few minutes from a workbench, even walking overencumbered.
---
Repair kits: only repair to 100%, the queen drops better ones that repair to 150% and can't be bought, and weapon artisan and fix it good perks repair to 200% for a laughably small amount of resources.
---
F1st tents: same as scrap kits, you can't even break down weapons and armour at them.
---
Scrap boxes: Yes, unlimited junk is helpful, I will admit that, it's the only utility item that is actually worth paying for.
---
But it's all 100% optional, and not even needed to enjoy the game. Yet the company, which needs to make money to feed, house, and clothe the people working on the game, gets so much more trouble from people, particularly those who, like you, haven't even played the game. Get a copy for $10 on eBay and give it a try.
---
The old rug trick still works with windmills btw. You place a rug then one of the legs of the windmill to overlap the rug. Blueprint it, place the blueprint in dirt. Then you can pickup the rug and place the windmill on for instance a roof etc.
---
Example can be seen here:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCZ9toQZTV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCZ9toQZTV8)
---
No problem. This trick makes it a lot easier to line up foundations with existing structures as well. No more fiddling with the height, just place stairs and build down :)
---
Only downside is the fact that you need foundations to remove floors, just a heads up.
---
Managed to lose with a missile launcher! I swear I hit the guy directly from like 50 yards, with the explosives perk. He just runs off!
---
As random as anything in this game :P
---
I prefer Westtek as it gives lots of gunpowder and stell from the super mutants.
---
I can do 10 runs and not get a single legendary, then on the 11th I'll get 7-8 3 stars. Very random.
---
Must be a pretty long phrase in Spanish
---
This comment section is hilarious
---
Wow, this guy
---
This is a complex subject that I will not try to fully cover.  Price legendaries at least at scrip values 10-20 per scrip seems to be the norm.  Consider the perks certain ones are worth much more, Bloodied being king.   This is something you just have to learn by observing other players vendors, reading forums, especially the trading ones, but be aware the trade forums prices are much higher than in-game, but it helps you learn what is desired.
---
Uninstall the game. I did.
---
This spot?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa9IEKyI7gA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa9IEKyI7gA)
---
What do you need?
---
I found a treehouse literally in the middle of deep water. Lets you place a camp and everything, but when you fast travel to it you get placed \~200m away from it on the cliffside, so you'll have to swim for 20sec or so. Not cool :(
---
I don’t think my fragile internet could handle that, or just the servers in general lol
---
This was painful to read
---
Soo.. did *anyone* know what this Club Fuzzy was? Never heard of it myself and I check here all the time.  
---
But uh yeah if this is the hill you choose to die on, okay then.
---
It's on the ps store but it costs money. I just submitted a ticket.
---
Yeah I had a feeling lol, glad I could help and I hope it works out for you :)
---
I think it takes smaller/lesser known people more courage to do something like this as it impacts their life more than anyone else’s.  I’m on board with you.
---
Too bad they won't ever allow mods in 76. Just another broken promise. They really seem to not like the idea of 76 being enjoyable.
---
oh i thought it was this map that closed. everything is fine then
---
Your post history says otherwise, lol.
---
They have so much shit for the Atomic Shop that hasn't been released, yet they keep bringing back old stuff.  (imo they shouldn't remove atomic shop stuff at all, its kinda stupid, just add better categories so it's not cluttered and we can buy whenever we want)
---
It's a French translation of the original comment, as /u/8I172 requested
---
If you're referring to the first photos not updating, I was doing it wrong. Not a bug. I didn't realize they needed to be taken at specific locations. That was my bad, I should update that.
---
Exactly. The graphics might suck but the game more than makes up for it.
---
Yes but it's gonna cost you an extra 4.99
---
What goes around comes around
---
This
---
If someone kills a whole team in a few seconds it can just mean they were huddled together tightly and a explosive knocked them out or automatic fire. Which is easy to do. Two teams is suspect could be them working together illegally and grouping together or them fighting and being killed in the same manner when already weak. Three teams is pretty much where you know they cheating if they didn’t get lucky with a nuke.
---
Yeah right
---
No NPCs were needed from launch...same with a text chat option. I think it's still shocking that this game doesn't have a text chat option...yes there is a mod for PC users and console users can I guess use the text options for their consoles? But there should be an in game text chat...they want us to interact with each other...yet they deny us a text chat? Like...what? How did that ever make sense?
---
What he saying is beg more mate
---
Even though I've seen series of Fallout and play a bit of it. Arigato gozaimus! Thank you guys for saving what was left of it! :3
---
Right now I'm buying cheap plans I don't have. By cheap I mean under 100 caps.
---
I'll sometimes buy event items if I missed out on any (like for Meat Week).
---
And then cheap mutations.
---
I sell bobble heads, magazines and plans. Plans sometimes get bought but most of the stuff I sell is bobble heads and magazines.
---
What bugs me is the prices of things people sell...bobble heads at 100 caps? I sell at 35 caps. How I make my money is farming cloth/leather and then spamming the crap out of civil war top hats to resell at train station vendors. 12 caps a pop with that perk card that boosts prices. I can easily make that 1,400 per day if I have enough cloth and leather.
---
As of right now I think so they are adding more ranger armor though the riot paint just released. and the elite ranger and the actual riot ranger armor along with what I would say is the desert ranger armor was data mined
---
Stashing junk before a SBQ fight  doesnt help with the flux that you get as a reward for the queen event.   I think that's mostly what hes referring to.  I end up losing that damn flux everytime lol
---
Fair point. Either way, same applies.
---
You never played madden and the money they make on packs is insane.
---
Anything over 30k
---
You can get the military paint
---
If you were getting downvoted to start with it was the trolls that have plagued this sub since before the game came out that are either.  
---
A. People with such shitty lives they scan this subs new section and downvote everything.  
---
Or B. Bot accounts set up to do what i said in A
---
I'm not saying I agree. If I made it home with that flux I'd feel like I won the lottery. It's rare lol.
---
&gt;so I’ve never bought it
---
Much like almost everyone that's been bitching and moaning about it for the past year. The subreddit gets periodically invaded by people who have never played the game and decided to hate it before it ever came out because of something they saw on a clickbaity YouTube video or something. Meanwhile, those of us who play the game just keep on playing and enjoying it. 
---
The outcry that exists against it is mostly by people who were never going to play the game anyway. It doesn't really impact the actual experience of just playing a game for fun.
---
I have fallen into the earth in Flatwoods before. I dont think I dropped my junk when it happened.
---
Because you are totally every other person on the planet.
---
I've seen it, I've had friends have to go through it. I've also had friends and myself have the single GM that can fix it cause they read the ticket.
---
&gt; and not loose faith in Bethesda as a whole.
---
How many of their "fuck ups" and plain greedy moves will it take for you to lose it then lol
---
Less people play now. So there are less groups. Setting off nukes solo is not that appealing.
---
They mentioned that someone shot him and he returned fire. 
---
They agreed to PvP. So this post is stupid.
---
Again. I've just as many anecdotes as you do that are completely the opposite. You're "totally every other person on the planet" I guess?
---
I have 5 characters loaded with the fruits of what one character generates.  It’s all meh to me. And it was a typo anyway. I meant to say 20c/ scrip anyway 🤷‍♂️
---
Wut
---
In flux of the pricing then ?
---
I think it's more because groups/teams launch in private servers.
---
Not sure it’s a club if there’s only 2 members
---
He said he read about it on another forum and then, "tested," it. He then claims he discovered it, later.
---
Don't buy into this game he's playing. He got caught with his pants down and he can't handle the consequences.
---
&gt; There are people trying inside Bethesda, trying very hard to make this right, to stop the slide and make our voices heard.
---
I’m sure of this as I’ve always been this way whenever working in a customer service position. I’ll jump through whatever hoops I can to fix your problem, even if it means staying late, losing money myself, and even risking being reprimanded by superiors. And as someone who handles a job this way, it’s always like I’m swimming upstream. I’ll spend two hours making sure everything is perfect only to have the same customer call in and have all that good Will and work thrown out the window by someone who is incompetent or someone going by the book and offering to sell when it’s clearly inappropriate (but obviously what the corporation would prefer you do instead).
---
I have to believe there are other people out there who do the same and I know I’ve encountered a few of them in my experiences on the customer side of customer service. 
---
But it’s always someone fighting against pressure from above to just move on, fill a quota, or get to the next customer to hopefully try to sell them. It’s the nature of big companies. Most people that work for them just want a paycheck and can’t be bothered to give a shit. You just have to hope that enough people willing to do what’s right for the customer are in the right places to get those things done, because major corporations would rather ignore the problems and try to move on to make the next sale.
---
The Bethesda Choice brand follows a strict algorithm to maximize your profitability as an indentured customer,  it’s not the best choice, it’s Bethesda Choice.
---
Someone else already found it. That's how this guy even knew it existed in the first place. Read what they said. They even tell you this themselves.
---
While PACIFY works on pretty much anything, you will only get the TAME option on single, random spawn creatures. There are specific parts of the map which may spawn a tameable creature. I usually server hop these spots.
---
Nobody else clicks on the name seeing a post like this? Day 1 on reddit come on he probably doesn't know how or what to ask for!!
---
If I was on xbone I'd come make and mod all lvl 20 armor and guns but I'm ps4 sorry dude...
---
Bye
---
I’m just going by games like fortnite and other battle royals games there can’t be any collusion it’s especially noticeable in singles. Of two people who aren’t fighting but fighting as a team and gathering together. You either fight or separate from each other. It’s usually a reportable and bannable offense in these games. They watch the replays and it’s easy to see. If Bethesda wouldn’t do anything about it Xbox considers it unsporting behavior and can be flagged and reported. Other you get parties of people working together in other to have an strong advantage of 8 versus team of 4. Death match games are similar.
---
It runs for more on PS4 than XBox. Not sure about PC.
---
What?
---
so you basically gave it away to some stranger?
---
I sell diluted for 5 caps and almost never get them sold.
---
Everyone in that Greenbriar bunker has betrayed them by now.
---
You on x box?
---
Reported.
---
Thats the mall right?
---
Seriously. Why is there no way to share your photo album to the fallout website or something.
---
I'll cap your head with a hammer first.
---
Ditto. What'll be real upsetting is when The Gourmands and MEAT close up shop aswell.
---
I'd be down for that haha. Maybe people wouldn't drop as many care packages, I don't mind them just feel bad taking people's stuff I don't need lol
---
I honestly hope that if Bethesda offers some token gesture like "We will restore your accounts now", that he tells them to get fucked. Too many companies have pulled shit recently, and then when called out on it, have backpedalled slightly. That's not a good precedent to set because it encourages a "try screwing people over, maybe it will work this time, and if it doesn't, no harm no foul" type of community interaction.
---
Blizzard and Gitlab come to mind as recent examples.
---
I agree with Vidarval. Variety is the spice of life and I would love for them to make more cash in the atom shop so they try fewer stunts with fallout 1st sub rewards. Personally I would like to see more post holocaust themed items. Immersion breaking items aren't my thing. Having said that they should put in whatever people will buy imo.
---
No one is stealing your flux it disappears if you die right after the fight.
---
Wastelanders is going to be shit. Any potential good content (don't kid yourself) will be overshadowed by horrible bugs and be an unplayable mess.
---
Don't hold out for wastelanders. That's just silly. This game is dead and there's no reason to hang around for it
---
Also flux can be stored in the 1st scrapbox so no need to sell anymore
---
Do it
---
I'm looking to but that plan also because I have done that event many times and no drop. I can't find anyone selling it.
---
Yeah sorry lmao
---
I have not observed this, as much as I tried, I can specifically say in my experience, relogging from a private server *does not* respawn anything. Can you describe your steps in case there's something more to this please?
---
Anyone who legitimately believes Wastelanders is going to be anything even remotely good is delusional. Even if Bethesda was somehow able to craft a masterpiece of world building (if Fallout 4 and Skyrim are anything to go by, they abandoned that art long ago), it will be either paywalled like crazy or hidden behind an insurmountable of bugs. Don't hold out for it, you're wasting your time. FO76 is dead, for all intents and purposes. There's no point playing it and I would wager reddit gold that the servers will be shut down completely before the end of 2020.
---
Personally, I will only buy from a player owned vender, but sorry to hear
---
Found a charred ghoul with no head, the inside was transparent and you could see through. Found it at Red Rocket in Bog Town.
---
Bye.
---
Lol.
---
lol its not a dupe, its simply being over the max carry weight and the game wont let you pick up any more items and it drops whatever you tried to pick up back on the ground AND the original, so theres an extra copy. the mines are disarmed when this happens so they cant go off, its a stupid glitch thats been happening since meat week.
---
The problem with that, is beth claims a 10% tax from vendors, so people either have to add in that to the item cost, or suffer
---
I helped a guy yesterday defend his power station, when he was struggling, took my junk when I died, tried to PVP, he wouldn't.
---
Spent a bit back and with messages, he didn't see the issue, it wasn't much, I said it was the principle, just don't do it.
---
In the end, he hit me once to knock me off the roof, meaning we could PVP, and spent ten mins hiding from me,panicked when I got to him, hid again, and jumped out to kill me with a hammer, then DC'd as he knew I was just going to get above him and shoot him, straight up combat logged.
---
So I feel you, OP
---
&gt;cAnVaS bAg
---
Oh i didn't realized that, I thought it would drop because it label junk items
---
It's all crap. I'm a subscriber &amp; haven't seen anything diffetent &amp; I play everyday.
---
Chat is coming for the low-low price of $7.99/mo.    
---
Also only visible to other premium members.
---
its a bug and its happening all the goddam time. the game has a max carry weight of 1500 + your normal carry weight, and if you go over it, you cannot pick up anymore items.
---
if you do try to pick up a throwable item like a mine, when you click it first it disarms, then you click it again to collect it but instead of going into your inventory, it drops back onto the ground in the same place as the original, so they kinda spill out from the same spot if you load into an area where someone clicked the same mine over and over and over, the new mines generate from the exact same spot and "rain" out from seemingly nowhere.
---
the most anyone can really use this for is to max out the robot vendor at 1400 caps.. which really isnt much. you could make and scrap meat cleavers for the steel but its way too slow to be worthwhile. 
---
I wouldnt pick up hundreds of mines though, that might get you flagged
---
Just another bug or poor design unfortunately. Rip the millions of flux lost to that one Yao guai that flys in and smacks all the bloodied players looting the queen 😂
---
OMG me too! Pack it up guys, nothing to see here
---
This comment created a beautiful image in my head of some poor fella in an office somewhere 😂
---
Nope. I go public for trading. I'll spend hours in public. Not get bothered at all.
---
I'm a subscriber and I have had no grief whatsoever. I havent even seen anyone else having trouble either.
---
I've used the emotes in front of others. No negativity at all. I've worn the coat in public. No issue. My scrap box is in my camp visibly and it doesn't put players into a bad mood (nor has it affected my sales - they are as normal, and actually a bit better than they were, but that could be coincidental). Same with my tent. I was expecting at least some spoiled food or something but no. People either ignore it or use it.
---
Not saying grief doesn't happen but I'm wondering if it is all blown out of proportion.
---
A nice edition to the game would be a dupe method
---
Why was the content removed?
---
lv1 leather pieces give back the same materials as it costs to make, so when super duper kicks in, you get extra free steel, even "infinite steel" as some people like to say, but its incredibly slow, slower than any normal way of farming steel so its not a problem. the throwables "dupe" is just a max carry weight glitch, if you are holding 1500 over your normal carry max then the game puts whatever you tried to pick up back on the ground, and the original. so as many times as you try to click a mine to pick it up, the game spits out an extra mine in the exact same spot.
---
this glitch has been widely reported and clearly bethesda doesnt care. its been here since meat week returned and its the second time this glitch has surfaced.
---
You seriously think Beth give a shit? The only people being hurt here are players.
---
I've seen some for sale but not as much as I used to.
---
Could be several factors in play. I've not seen many nukes go off recently. The odd one at prime but that's about it. Players may well be launching them in private worlds, so less players to gather them when all is said and done.
---
Add to that stable flux can be stored in the scrap chest now, so there is no need to sell off excess.
---
I play pretty much everyday and I ain’t seen any of that rubbish.
---
yep, another bug, and then you have those server disconnects just when you're trying to loot SQB when you find out she had  Ulracite  Jet pack plan on .
---
If you need ultracite plans I have a few hundred in my vendors. I’m on Xbox.
---
It's not a bug. It was intentionally changed because of folks whining about folks picking up their bags at the queen fight so Beth changed it to where now no one gets it if the bag drops lool
---
Hey now, F1st aint the only ones with bots. I aint spent a dime on this game since pre order, but I buy atom items with the daily free atoms.
---
I feel like it's the people beyond upset with Bethesda trying to split the community in half. Or some stupid like that.
---
Have you looked out for the mod as well as that would sidestep the flux requirement? 
---
I half remember picking up the mod you're looking for at a Watoga vendor recently. It's probably still in my vendor. I'll have a look later if you're on xbox?
---
The first day of the subscription I had a couple players give me a thumbs down when I used the robot and mothman emotes but other than just another normal day in the wasteland.
---
That's why you dont give your item first. Plain and simple. Being overly trusting is being incredibly stupid.
---
Dang I'm sorry that happen to you man, I understand you too.  I got attacked by group of players, I was in Pacifist mode and wasn't near a workshop.
---
 I was farming for bunch of repair materials,  ended up losing it on death by them. I guess one of them felt sorry for me and tried to give back my stuff when they realized I was farming stuff. 
---
They thought I was same guy that wipe them earlier because my name was similar to other guy
---
He only gave me 3 out of 10 junk items then he and his 3 friends dc. I was like dang
---
I don't even know how I was engaged in pvp. I think it was either glitch or something
---
Not sure about that - the plans for it (prototype version of it) are only available through that computer in the enclave bunker - if that doesn't imply affiliation I don't know what does.
---
More likely this is being held back for atom shop events (also probably like BOS stuff)
---
I won two games in a row my first time actualy trying nw to be fair it was with lvl 200 Guys
---
Venomous pointed out what they are doing, it’s actually the business sales structure of Disney and apparently works exceedingly well. Why Beth need to do this? Honestly no idea. I’d rather work towards certain items and be inclined to spend on others. Now after watching their sales tactics, it always seem to return at discounts or goes in vault on discount. So why would anyone buy at full price bar those that MUST have it before anyone else in a game without chat
---
Amen!
---
Nope not even once.. But people are happy to use the tent.
---
Oh! okay they change that
---
I got The Whoopsies on Highland Marsh. Interacted with the Mirelurk eggs until a infected spawn showed up, let it bite me for around 20 minutes.
---
Nope, never got griefed, people are being normal as usual. Some stare at me because they like the armor but thats about it from my experience.
---
Heck, even the super high level players dont give a hoot about you, they only want what you are selling and bugger off.
---
also I misread your and thought you saw a bug where the Yao Guai was literally flying! ah hahah
---
If your just wanting to beat the quest line and dont want to grind legendaries grab a set of power armor and get the auto stimpack mode for the chest piece. Carry enough stems and you wont die very often. If your looking for legendaries I'd just serve hop and farm the white springs club house/ public events if you dont get anything worthwhile just scrap the junk legendaries for scrip and try your hand at gambling with the purveyor.
---
I heard it all stemmed from magazine that is known for not having its facts strait but i did see a rage chronicles video and guy was flicken people shit sayin if they wanna farm to go to private servers haha but thats it
---
lol the answer is one of those 2. I remember getting hung up on it as well. I'll check again tomorrow and report back if you haven't solved it yet.
---
Maybe I’m crazy, but I get really suspicious towards all the corny feel good “this is why I *still* play” posts that come out right around the time Bethesda fucked up again
---
Nothing fancy but since your asking here's how we tested (sorry if formatting is weird I'm on phone)
---
1. I hosted private server with 1 other friend
---
2. we both went to west Tek and gooified enemies outside (we didn't test interior cells but I imagine it functions the same)
---
3. I remain on the server while said friend leave and rejoins server to force respawn the enemies
---
4. Enemies respawn nude unable to be damaged/regen health similar to damage bug and teleport around randomly in a short radius (about 6m)
---
Hope that helps and a theory on the teleporting part I think it might be a spawn point but I'm not sure. Any further questions il be happy to answer if I can
---
No happend to me on pc multable times
---
Don't wander too far south east until you feel more confident.
---
What type of build do you have? (heavy, melee, stealth Commando/rifleman) 
---
There are people on the here who who may help you  along the way with build advice and help you explore higher level areas
---
Due to family commitments I don't get on regularly, however if you are on XB1 I would be happy to be bodyguard/tour guide.
---
Already know there some “gamer entitlement wah boo hoo” comments in here
---
Create new char, grind for new brewing station and backpack and abandon game for another year, if you're not a fan of time limited puzzles ("raids") of course
---
Because people still dont know that this is a thing ... Sunshine Meadowns Industrial Farm (West of Flatwoods), you can create canned foot in it.
---
Subscriber here. The second day, this mid level tried to use his MM Gauntlet to destroy my vending machines. Fail. 
---
Other than that, nothing. In fact, I’ve noticed that many higher levels also have it.
---
?
---
On my low level (below 50) characters I don’t think I have got a drop from the purveyor that is above my level. I think she gives you a weapon closest to your level that you can use at the moment
---
Not until your character is level 20.
---
Why is a level 2 rolling any legendary?
---
i usually play solo, and i have ended up in pvp situations with and without fo1st, not just in workshops, but also at my camp 
---
however, people need to realise pvp still exists, even with pacific mode on you can still be murdered, this game is not unforgiving like rust/ark is, but people can still kill you 
---
this fucking civil war bullshit doesn't exist, pvp is always going to be part of fallout, call it grief or start to realise the context of the game and its possibilites 
---
fallout is still fallout, post-apocalyptic nuclear war, expect to be raided and do something about it
---
Nope I haven’t had anyone trying to grief me in a public world, and that’s all I play in usually. I’ve placed my tent up with people around and they run into it for the stash, cook food, sleep and what not. I haven’t had a problem
---
Do you like wanna provide some context? Not going to blindly clink on a link, even if it is youtube.
---
Melee + Heavy Gun, Power Armor (beginning with lvl 15 raider PA) and look for a steel-deposit with water source for your camp, and you are good to go. If main quest leads you in a region with difficult enemies head back to western regions and do side quests etc to lvl up.
---
I could survive if i were to pay 14.99 per month
---
:D, that pretty funny about the part where you not siting in your private world. I feel like in adventure most people keep to themselves and also depends on person too. Thanks for telling me your part.
---
Please stop spreading misinformation with what looks to be a smurf account.
---
If you pay 14.99 you won't be week
---
🌝
---
Playing the Burrows was the first time i encountered this, that's why i highlighted it, not sure about the rest as if happened wasn't so remarkable. But i've tested it, and if you go across the Burrows and wait a bit should be enough to make them meat piles.
---
And yes, bloodied but not so frequently one shots
---
🦄
---
🤡
---
No 🤡
---
I like the mothman theme emote, it sounds pretty cool and also the Riot Gear armor. I feel like alot of folks are mostly friendly with only a mini group of baddies. Thanks for telling me your part.
---
There’s a small market for it good low level legendary stuff, and I have an insatiable appetite for legendary enemies and have lots of scrip fodder to spare. I delete my 4th and 5th character repeatedly to offload scrip I cant get rid of at the end of the week. 
---
I just got my third fixer plan and was curious if I should read it on my low (3rd) alt or not.
---
Farm legos and dont worry🤡
---
Thanks 🤙
---
🤔
---
Yeah no 🤔 that means adding content
---
I know that some of them are redundant and don't affect anything i.e. Increasing intelligence when u don't have the ability to craft either way, bugged highlighting of enemies, explosive vent which doesn't work at all, was wondering what people had put on themselves so that I can save me the hassle of trying to figure out what synergises with what well
---
that's cool, I think I might sub for that riot gear
---
you farm legendaries you dont even need becouse the content you play endgame can be easily done with non legendary items. So you just walk around, waste ammo or pretend to be vendor with nice camp. That is really the only thing you can do in this game.. Also you can try to collect all plans / costumes.
---
Oh okay, That mothman emote is pretty cool
---
I was con convinced I put one my left arm armor in the script machine after it went missing even though I carefully check what I deposit.  
---
this makes more sense to me now as to where it may have gone 😤
---
Thx, that’s quite a business you got there, lol.
---
That's nice, the tent looks cool with the sleeping back, cooking pot and scrapebox
---
Oh okay!, I been saying on the replys but yeah that Riot armor looks pretty awesome. I guess it attracts attention and all
---
No, it stands for Bush Riding I'm pretty sure.
---
Not yet still waiting for those famous class war to reveal itself to me
---
wait till wastelanders drops, you can 100% they'll litter it with new raider and wasteland cosmetics.
---
also you can bet Christmas will be ~~held hostage~~ **sold** to us
---
Valley Galleria should be the Atom Store, but in game person. All on display and updated. Go in to shop. They could even charge for entry.
---
lo, Yeah that makes sense on the magazine for not having it's fact straight.
---
Delete the game
---
Encouraging people who get turned on by dressing up in cartoon animal costumes not to breed, does not equal genocide.
---
Also, furrys aren't a race anymore than people who get turned on by lamp posts are
---
if this was on PS4, you could have reported their PSN and hopefully got them punished as slurs are a pretty big no no on their terms.
---
This is not the reddit you're looking for.
---
dang sorry that there you met a unruly person. Yeah I been seeing 50+ having the set. I like the armor as well
---
And now, I am very sad too...
---
&gt;Never in my gamer life I played a game which the cost is less than 20$, for hundreds of hours of gaming, regular updates...And fun.
---
How many games you played "in your ~~shill~~ gamer life", three?
---
Oh that's nice of you, It definitely good to see players help each other out.
---
oh!, I agreed it's totally rubbish to attack someone for subbing
---
It happens to me even if I'm not over encumbered sometimes.
---
With that being said I wonder if the free states helmet that was added with the outfit offers head protection.
---
Oh i see your point
---
They weren't exploiting it for gain but to "test" it before reporting it, which is still fucking stupid because either way you're messing with something you shouldn't be messing with. If they'd just reported the bug without repeating it on their own multiple times they wouldn't likely be in this mess.

Can't be bothered to go through the comments history.
---
I was told one of the pumpkin racks is also a rare drop that sells for a lot but I’m not sure which one is the rate one I obtained them all during the event but have no clue how to price them.
---
I thought the whole thing sounds out of place so i just want to ask here about it.
---
Worth it
---
I think it was out of place piece, I came here to see what others were thinking about it
---
Man i'm burning through caps fast traveling trying to find someone [xbox1] who is selling that plan.
---
Not a thing. I’m part of 6 discord’s and no one from all cross platforms has said they have had any negative interactions cause of F1st. 
---
I even have a friend who openly says in game this guy has fallout first get him. Others just laugh and give the thumbs down. 
---
The class war is fake news drummed up to get people clicking on articles or videos. 
---
I think it all started around release when I read a Reddit post when a subscriber mentioned he did the emote in NW and everyone came running to punch him. 
---
But hey, it’s NW lobby. Everyone runs around punching others 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Well... I put the camp as a test to see if people would grief like some people were saying. But nothing happened other than what I said first😅
---
i believe because this is the prototype its not finalized, if i recall the oil rig a few years later birthed the X-01 meaning they would have carried on the development and likely changed their flag later on when they ran their new flag.
---
though with the amount of retconning anythings possible, after all Fallout 4: Nuka world had a Nuka Quantum X-01 on display which goes against the lore of the X-01
---
A bit late of a response, but I'm surprised that no one brought up that the [space suit from New Vegas](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Space_suit_\(Fallout:_New_Vegas\)) offers the same radiation resistance as an [advanced radiation suit](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_radiation_suit_\(Fallout:_New_Vegas\)), *and* is better armored. So there is already precedent for rad resistant space gear in the base game
---
Invite everyone at the event to team up with you. If a nearby teammate kills any enemy, you can loot it as if you killed it.
---
lo, I had feeling that news was out place, but I want to see what everyone's else thoughts on it. yeah the nw lobby yep everyone is punching for fun or something. The emotes are pretty neat to hear as well.
---
That’s a Fallout 1st perk...
---
I don't think he was cheating. specially because this is on PS4.
---
at 2:20 you can see him coming out of his hiding spot. lots of "natural" sinkholes in the map because, well, Bethesda.
---
So if I can get rewards once per day which difficulty should I run for the first time? How hard is it?
---
it's just a youtube link, chill.
---
I'm on Xbox sadly. Also if I make a new character how would I get the rewards from NW on my main?
---
Milk the Brahmin, kill the Brahmin, cook the Brahmin, shit the Brahmin
---
One player gets free 12 month sub to fallout 1st.
---
He won't. Anybody who'll put up with as much as fO76 has done will go crawling back at the slightest chance.
---
*i laugh at his pain.* Anyone continuing to give Bethesda money deserves exactly what they get, and I feel no pity for those drones.
---
They have item for item trading though... At least on PC. 
---
Unless you are calling the trade window item for cap trade (simple you offer your item for ____caps, then they offer their for the same amount. Yeah you might lose out on the item they offered, but you'll have caps at least.
---
Mod plans for raider armor can be common &amp; found easily...but the plans themselves for crafting raider armor are some of the rarest game.
---
You get one chance per character...as you finish Rose's raider questline...for like less then 1% chance to get the plans.
---
After their possible suspension they will make petitions about "unfair ban", which is totally appropriate — is that what you're implying? I'm not sure this Map76 fella is guilty, it's only a rumor.
---
Unless you're telling me the canvas bag fiasco, the doxxing of peoples information, and the nuka cola ordeals were all made up, I don't personally have to play the game to stand on principal and say i don't want to support this company.  
---
Fairly certain all the gameplay shown of the bugs aren't faked either.  Based on that alone, regardless of the fun factor of the gameplay systems/loop, the quality of that fun will not be very high.  
---
Bethesda wasn't a company i was expecting to do this, but other companies has taught me to not buy games day 1.  Why am I here?  Loot boxes started with one game and other companies picked it up because of the psychological effects and how profitable it came to be.  Now their's a playerbase who's showing willingness to stick around through all this stuff and doesn't look to be shying away after the announcement that theirs going to be a shop locked behind the subscription service.  Their is a level of insanity behind the idea of telling someone they have to pay $13 for the privilege to buy some stuff.  Is it not bad enough you have to pay for the right to host your own game on a non-persistent server where the host will still feel lag, and you have no settings sliders to personalize the experience?  
---
Business decisions be damned, what is bethesda themselves doing to bring in a bigger crowd?  Wasn't this supposed to be an MMO experience.. which requires players?  Private servers surely lowered the player count for those who actually want the MMO experience they were supposed to be delivering.  And after all this the biggest 'hype' thing that was coming to the game for free has been delayed.
---
I'm not saying you can't be having fun.  Not even saying you wanting to support this games future is a bad thing.  But the fallout community, regardless how they feel about the game, simply deserves better.
---
That requires the devs to actually do they’re job. That ain’t happening anytime soon
---
&gt;I believe that most people are basically good
---
you only have yourself to blame, really. that's not even naivete, it's willful ignorance. people aren't good at heart.
---
Atoms make it totally worth it, everything else is just icing on the cake.
---
That's good nothing happen, I was wondering does the camp itself comes with music instruments or you have to built it there yourself? I saw one player was playing her guitar or something and I wish i could join in with her to have a band :(
---
They already did by unbanning them. They showed they didn't break any rules or they would remained banned.
---
Why they did add a clown costume?
---
Yes, by checking if the memory is modified. That is what ever other major online game does. Most won't even let you modify the memory in the online games. So the fact you can do that in this game isn't the dataminers fault that this game has shit level anticheat software.
---
dickhead is an annoying dude, i can't pull myself to listen to that guy
---
It doesn't, it is based on the "seed" given to your character at creation of the character.
---
High Intelligence stat...complete any and every event.
---
Claim as many workshops as possibly. Then it turns into an endless chain of workshop defense quests that rack in xp.
---
CE has been being used to read memory addresses since this game came out, and just now they decided to ban these dataminers for pointing out a massive security breach in their game.
---
Oh no, I'm good, I feel like it's gift feeling every time I farm the scorch queen for the plans with people. I just over heard one guy saying he saw a jet pack plan for Ultractie power armor and couldn't reach it before we all got server dc. Thank alot for your offer dude :D
---
This is shit posting you moron.
---
I don’t do the raid daily but if u have a crew of friends willing to run it a few times do it from easiest rolls hardest back to back. Basically here’s the breakdown
---
Easy- no time limit and u can NOT get the new power armor and urban scout skin (strangler heart)
---
Medium- there’s a time limit and u can get the new armor skins I just mentioned above
---
Hard- same thing as medium just harder. 
---
Also when it comes to medium and hard and this time limit I mentioned it’s like this. U go into the first puzzle room and it give u let’s say 5 minutes. If u escape the room and continue to the next room then whatever time u have leftover will carry over and give u extra time for the next room. Also repairing pipes gives u more time so it’s a good idea. I recommend using a high health tank build and recognize that the real priority is to progress through the rooms. Don’t waste time focused on killing things and lastly communication goes a long way. There’s a later part of the vault raid that sees u have to press multiple buttons spread around the room in a sequential order. If u fail it takes u back to the start of that rooms puzzle and then just know that the order of those buttons doesn’t change so I’ve found it helps to have a piece of paper near u or something.
---
Wow...
---
You really do leave out a lot of information.
---
&gt;90% of games: full price, with almost full price again for season pass/all dlc  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Fallout: full price yeah, but all dlc free with every other payment being optional cosmetics or extremely basic utility items
---
90% of game where you pay for DLC, actually deliver you the DLC.
---
Fallout has delivered slightly over half of the proposed DLC (free or otherwise) from their 2019 road map.
---
Repair kits can be purchased at any level and at any time with an immediate benefit. Super repair kits you have to fight the queen for, so there's a time sink there. You may want to do it, then that's cool. If you don't, you can buy your way out of that problem.
---
Scrap kits save you time in that you don't need to travel to break up and store junk. Workbenches (if you happen to be lucky enough to be near one) don't remove junk from your inventory. It's kind of a moot point in general because of scrap boxes but it does free up junk inventory in instanced locations.
---
Survival tents are a free fast travel point that costs nothing to place or move and allow you to maximise xp efficiency with sleeping, cooking, and the most important thing you left out, storing scrap without having to spend time travelling anywhere.
---
&gt; But it's all 100% optional, and not even needed to enjoy the game. 
---
Not needed to enjoy the game is the biggest load of BS that I've read for a while. There are numerous accounts of people talking about how much more fun scrapboxes have made the game for them and how much space it's freed up to the point that they don't really worry about inventory management anymore.
---
There isn't a single thing you've said that cannot be trivially shot down in flames.
---
It got moved into adventure as well.
---
NW rewards go onto your account, regardless of which character you use. I roleplay my main character as a passive person who doesn't want to fight...so it made sense to make a new character who fights.
---
Lol it doesn’t matter the post wasnt about pvp
---
The 110 damage cap is in adventure now as well. That was the point, It isn't just pvp now.
---
Imagine that.
---
Definitely right about needing a better social system in F076. Destiny had a lot of flaws but they did make it easier to work with others and I hope that eventually Bethesda will get on top of their system.
---
Community outreach is a cash sink, it doesn't make them money. This game must be cheap as fuck to run so the $100 yearly memberships must be keeping them above float for them not to be reacting.
---
Face it, theres a lot of people out there with money who are looking for an identity and Fallout is providing one.
---
Nuked whitesprings, killed everything, logged off to Main menu, waited 10sec, joined private world again.
---
No point downvoting, lots of others who have reported this to work.
---
PS4.
---
Been that way for almost a week now:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dtbuwm/as_late_as_today_ive_seen_comments_on_the_player/
---
Got my trappers in locked chests and random world spawn.
---
I just wish they'd added ESO's social features before they added a sub to 76.
---
I'm still enjoying playing, but I'm starting to grow even more disillusioned, especially with all the things that could/should have been implemented being ignored in favour of Monetization.
---
I am boycotting this game till they add the promised text chat tbh
---
Dude... thats Player VS Player, in Adventure mode. I just did the queen with my bloodied unarmed build hitting for chunks of her health, how is my damaged capped at 110. The post was about armor for bloodied melee builds and nobody even pvps with melee. Adding 110 pvp dmg cap makes sense but overall would be game breaking. I literally thought you were trolling dont you understand what your saying.
---
add more stuff so you can pay money to a company that sees you as nothing more than cattle to milk? you’re quite a character
---
5 years on reddit i had to explain that jeez
---
I downvoted cause this is a useless request that adds no value. Not only do a small amount of players even have pets (I’d guess less than 10%) but this is for people with existing pets when they get a new one? Yea way bigger fish to fry.
---
You get to keep the box, but you can't add anything else &amp; I guess you'll lose the tent
---
Wait I did not get your answer.  
---
Do they have item for item trading on PC? Or it is only selling items for caps that is available?
---
If that was behind the large building somewhat center map, I may have been in that round. Hid in a bush a couple yards away (and above) from a blue man just standing there, either glitched out, or afk. 
---
The next safe zone was only 10-ish yards away from where he was standing, so I moved to the next bush and watched the fire consume him. Got taken out by the Scorchbeast myself.
---
Signed, a lvl 13 Bush Wookie still without a single NW kill.
---
Happens to me daily what’s your point
---
on PC nearly everyone has it so no
---
Unyeilding gear?
---
Yeah
---
Hey, really sorry to hear this, that’s a legacy weapon and is irreplaceable - if you want to hang around with a good bunch, some of whom were trading before Vending existed, a mixed bunch from all walks of life then simply send me a message on PlayStation. Explain that I reached out to you here, we’ll see if we can get you a good bunch to watch your back. 
---
My PSN is DragonbornMcQ and I stream, hence why I’ve asked for a little message as I get quite a few random messages online lol
---
&gt; the doxxing of peoples information
---
people dox themselves on a daily basis by using social media
---
and tehre was nothing relevant anyway the last 4 digits of a card at most
---
Probably cycle it out. They wouldn't want people waiting a year and buying a month, and getting all the same benefits as people who've paid throughout.
---
Yea i think this bug only happens to people that are utilizing radicool and armor stats to increase weight. When your dead they don’t give bonus, thus making you spawn at 76
---
Funny how they never reply to you its a circle jerk. Mods need to start banning these threads.
---
&gt;Noo... I'm just sick of companies continually pulling this bullshit and instead of people telling them it's bullshit, you still have the cash cows whose money says "it's ok to be greedy we'll still pay"
---
The only thing I saw that was remotely grieving was someone made a sign at their CAMP that said "Fallout 1st" and next to it was a Vault Boy  pointing the way, but upon closer examination he was pointing to the edge of an extremely high cliff right next to him.
---
:/
---
The patches that introduce more bugs than they fix? I mean hell PA still has a chance of locking up your game, mischief night was so buggy it caused crashes for like 50% of console users, the gunfire SFX from sentry bots is STILL bugged and can loop endlessly even though it has been claimed to have been fixed in multiple patches, yet never actually was, scrapboxes deleted all contents, private servers aren't actually private, dupes are still happening from the rollback method that has been in the game since BETA, hackers run NW, etc.
---
What exactly did those 14 patches add? Oh right extra MTX.
---

---
One of my best games was me sticking around for 20+ minutes and I got 0 kills and saw no one, and that was in a full lobby. Figured out early on that surviving is where it’s at.
---
I would like to see that
---
&gt;90% of game where you pay for DLC, actually deliver you the DLC.
---
because you paid for it and they have a financial obligation to deliver it
---
&gt; Fallout has delivered slightly over half of the proposed DLC (free or otherwise) from their 2019 road map.
---
well thats teh catch 22 of free content ,you didn't pay for anything so they aren't forced to deliver content on a specific date
---
does this harm the game? yes but at the end of the day they owe you exactly nothing since you didn't pay for anything 
---
&gt;Survival tents are a free fast travel point
---
im literally always at the cap limit even without the perk that reduces travel cost
---
I didn't understand what you meant by item for item.
---
PC you offer an item for caps.
---
It isn't the Dallas studio, it is the Austin studio, the studio that prior to fo76 only made one game and it was cancelled.
---
ES VI and FO5 will still sell like fucking gangbusters....
---
ROFL, are you claiming he is just a hater? Dude used to be the biggest bethesda fanboy prior to patch like 12. He finally just got enough of their crap and can't defend them anymore.
---
&gt;The subreddit gets periodically invaded by people who have never played the game
---
i heavily dislike those kinds of people and they are the norm sadly
---
drones that can't form their own opinion
---
There are circumcision videos on YouTube. No thanks.
---
people have no idea what P2W is
---
Dude you seriously need to check the persons you are replying to post history, they used to be well known to be the biggest fo76 fanboy on this subreddit. This claim that people who are taking issue with the game is just because others said so is such a tired old excuse and doesn't work anymore, as most of the people calling out their BS are former fanboys that are just unable to continue to defend their shitty actions.
---
We need NPCs too. They are the soul of a Fallout game, even more than radiations, mutates creatures, or terrifying bugs. People say New Vegas was great, but how great would have it been if there were no human NPCs, no consequences, no choices and dialogue options ? The NPCs are needed for the RPG aspect of the game, and the social system is needed for the Multiplayer aspect of the game.
---
Seems like someone crouched with camelean to me

bullshit. an interactive online map has no advantage over other players lol.
---
You would have to go through your Consumer Authority to enforce NZ law.
---
&gt; because you paid for it and they have a financial obligation to deliver it 
---
You say this as if Bethesda would act any differently if their DLC was paid. 
---
Do you think for a moment that Bethesda wouldn't have delayed Wastelanders if people had already paid for a season pass for all the proposed DLC? It's either that or release it rushed and considerably cut down, which they've demonstrated on numerous occasions that they're willing to both rush something out and cut down features (prestige levels ring any bells?).
---
&gt;im literally always at the cap limit even without the perk that reduces travel cost
---
That's a textbook example of an excuse, not a reason. Still doesn't make the tent's free fast travel or other benefits for that matter any less relevant.
---
Impact bug? I know anti armor doesn’t do anything with explosives...
---
Happened to me yesterday too and it's a joke among my friends how I DONT mod....I think it's a glitch.
---
Just do it.
---
Well actually he did answer the OPs question. If you read his last sentence where he clearly states “I enjoy playing fallout 76”. Pretty clear cut answer if you ask me. Also yeah the OP should move on to something that clearly isn’t making his life depressed because that’s all I got out of read this thread.
---
No
---
I also lost a TSE lever action to a scammer. What was his name? Because the guy that scammed me has multiple accounts wich he scams people with.
---
The Sheepsqatch Mascot outfit is probably as close as you'll get for now.
---
X-01 was a concept at the time T-60 was being developed, which is why it’s called “prototype” specifically in this game. The Enclave didn’t start using it until around 2215 when the the first suits were developed but by this point “Prototype X-01” became the “Advanced Power Armor” as a result of a research project 17 years prior. But even then the Advanced Power Armor didn’t become mainline until 5 years later.
---
Depends on what you are looking for in a game
---
“I’m sorry your honor I was a loyal customer I only robbed the store at gun point and shot the clerk to show them there security was lacking, I didn’t mean to” 
---
it’s the same thing as this person using an exploit then saying because they are a loyal fan nothing should happen, they knowingly used a exploit, it doesn’t matter at that point.
---
I was griefed once a few days after it was released.
---
It's in the mire somewhere
---
I have enjoyed it.  But look around for a cheap copy.
---
Ever heard of frontier development from elite dangerous? They give next to no info at all about any future updates
---
On any power armor there's nothing better. than calibrated shocks on legs for more carry weight and optimized servos on arms. 
---
Torso depends what you want: jetpack and stealthboy are self explanatory but you'd want high agility/ action points (and probably power user perk to make fusion coreskast more than 2 minutes lol) Emergency protocols if bloodied, medic pump is just auto stim , reactive plates reflect melee damage and help kill enemies when ganged up on...
---
And helmet either targeting hud or recon sensors. I've always had targeting on x-01 and t60 that I use most and never noticed any problems.  What did you mean by bugged highlighting ?
---
They are a game developing company which relies on their community to do well and make money and they can’t do that if they don’t have a community left which if they keep going the way they are they won’t have a community. They didn’t seem that bad on funds with the atomic shop with purchasable atoms or the shop back in fallout 4 whatever the name of that was. I don’t really give a shit what happens in fallout 76 right now because I stopped playing it because of its terrible state it’s in. And do you really need to insult EVERYONE that disagrees with your opinion. I mean I know it’s the internet and I should expect stuff like this but come on it’s not necessary.
---
Trappers can be found in tent random spawns around the world see them all the time in the mire. Also read that savage divide messganger events can give you raider?
---
Nope.
---
These questions are as popular as the good old ones, is fo76 worth buying or I've been away for xyz months what's changed lol
---
&gt; Didn’t you guys say you’d quit playing after FO1st
---
 So you think a bunch of whiny children that made a bunch of whiny posts is a reflection of how the community really feels? Wrong.
---
 Most of the people who make these posts including this one have never even played the game.
---
 It's mostly regurgitated hate from their favorite YouTube kid. 
---
 The game is going strong and there are tons of players online who already have the subscription.
---
 I will continue to play and pay my subscription until I see fit.  The only person's opinion I've ever cared about when it comes to video games is my own. I love the game.
---
&gt; Personally know way too many people who’ve walked away out of disgust and have written off Bethesda until they prove themselves, which doesn’t seem to be happening anytime soon.
---
I personally fell in love with Bethesda with Morrowind on the Xbox.  I've stuck with Bethesda since then, never shying from their faults and always trying hard to give the benefit of the doubt.  Fallout 76 has really been exceptionally trying for me.  I do genuinely enjoy the game, even with the bugs.  But the choices BGS has been making, particularly in regards to how they treat some people,  has had me deeply questioning if I can continue to support them as a company in the future.  I've seen BGS try to score some cheap cash in the past like with the horse armor 'dlc' in Oblivion and the first time the opened up the mod shop in Skyrim.  I've also seen them make light of their mistakes and try to make things right when the community smacked them with the rolled up newspaper.  But FO76 has been, as you said, nothing but doubling down on bad decision after bad decision.
---
I've been actively boycotting Activision for a decade for their sleaze and have been boycotting EA for nearly as long.  If Bethesda doesn't snap out of it and get their shit together, they may lose my support permanently.  It really pains me to think, let alone say that; but it is coming to that point.  I can't even begin to say how many thousands of hours I've put into their games.  Ceasing to be a customer of theirs would be like ending a chapter of my life.
---
I'll can the melodrama here.
---
Hell no!
---
Filling up the Shop would crash the Bethesda servers.
---
Well to be absolutely clear I’m D E F I N A T E L Y  a drone who can confirm the Ranger outfit will remain available after your subscription ends and will rotate out in a couple months time like the “asshole” Bethesda is. Let’s not forget Zenimax does the same with their lootcrates and monthly statue on ESO so maybe they’re assholes too but that’s business for you. 
---
A recent data mine showed the Fallout 1st subscriptions exclusives code(item name?) several of which are camouflage skins for the Wood, Leather, Metal, Marine and Combat armours and two (as we’re aware right now) Ranger skins called the Riot Ranger and Desert Ranger. There are also two more Ranger outfits that will likely be the rotating rewards for subscribing again or being a subscriber at that time, those being the Elite Ranger Outfit and the Advanced Ranger Outfit.
---
Better to wait for the launch of Wastelanders DLC. You'll know then whether or not Fallout 76 is worth buying into.
---
The end of scammers, wouldn't it be nice
---
no it won't, have a friend stand in the server next to the bag or it will all disappear.
---
I refuse to pay that much for a plan. Looks like Ill be farming Encrypted till then.
---
I remember seeing a bunch of people dancing with the 1st emoji during the Halloween event and everyone was enjoying it and having fun, no grief
---
[Here is the updated trailer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5QGkOGZubQ)
---
That's the one 👍
---
You lucky lucky bstrd. Share the disease.. What technique did you use.
---
If what you're looking for is a mindless grind plagued with bugs and stability issues, yes.
---
Absolutely.  I'm waging all the people who said no have never played it.
---
I've spent about 600 hours playing so far. I continue to enjoy the game but it is still quite buggy. The exploration is great, the quests and events are fun. But it does still crash fairly regularly and there are still plenty of bugs. Ask yourself what your expectations are and what you want in a game. If you can get past all of its faults, 76 is a gem. If not then Outer Worlds is also worth buying.
---
No, spend the money elsewhere or just throw them away. Just don’t give them to Bethesda. They do not deserve them!
---
You gotta tell Providence Equity to tell Bethesda to fix their game. they are the shareholders for Bethesda and zenimax.
---
I've played since the BETAS, and bought the Tricentennial Edition because I thought this game had huge potential. Now it's clear to me that Bethesda isn't interested in making Fallout 76 a good game, but a trap for the whales.
---
Does it bother you?
---
Went to Highland Marsh, killed the queen and other mirelurks that spawned, hatched the eggs, got at least two diseased mirelurk hatchlings that spawned, then let the little fucker bite me repeatedly until I got the woopsies!
---
I should have taken a screenshot of the exact spelling.  There was either a capital I or a lowercase l in the name.
---
I disagree but you're entitled to your own opinion.
---
 I have also played since Beta, almost every day.
---
I think they are making the wastelanders update the best they can possibly be.  I am excited for it.
---
 I don't subscribe to your hate and pessimism.
---
Thank you. I will give that a go,
---
I'll just have to put an asterisk next to the completed challenges.
---
Really sucks for Fallout first members. You gewt 1,650 atoms every month and nothing to spend them on.
---
I don't care about your opinion. I'm just proving your absurd claim wrong.
---
I disagree. I think it's worth buying now.
---
I think you would get more out of the game by playing the year one story and reading all the lore. 
---
 You will understand what happened and why everybody left.
---
 Year 2 all of the people come back and it will be a brand new story.
---
Welcome to the wasteland.
---
You do keep the box. You're free to remove things if your subscription lapses, however you will not be able to deposit anything into it without a sub. 
---
Any atom shop items you purchased are still usable. The tent however will not be placeable after the sub ends. Whether it spawns in in its existing location afterwards I'd anybody's guess, but mine is that it won't.
---
r/badtrolls
---
or dont die
---
I’m gonna check today. I was gonna check tomorrow but I dont hop into adventure mode too often.
---
I don't know shit about the whole Map76. If he was using a cheat program to do what he did, then hell yes he should be banned. My comment was directed at Garryests comment. He was saying basically If the dude was going to cheat, why would he explain how he's cheating. And you can't brag about showing a cheat/bug that can cause you to be banned. I was explaining that, 3 cheaters, using exploits, knew that were on stream, knew they were being reported and the stream was clipped, went and showed off the exploiting. One dude flew in the air. So him saying that the guy wouldnt have reported the exploit and endanger his account, is wrong. I had 3 cheaters do it. Intentionally. Had another guy, who WAS a streamer, doing it. He was reported. Why would he do it on his stream, in front of everyone... cause he knows in the end, even though he did cheat he can use the excuse I was just showing an exploit for you guys to know. Even though that exploit has been recorded, reported, multiple times.
---
It was glitched. For some reason they don't always despawn when their owner leaves the world.
---
You failed the lesson on reading comprehension didn't you? When did I ever claim that I hated you? All I said is I disagree with you. 
---
 Did you know you can disagree with somebody without hating them?
---
&gt;If the company gave a shit, they wouldn't have banned him, would they?
---
Uh... Yeah, my thoughts exactly. 
---
&gt;This is the same argument for why there are police forces and laws against vigilantism:
---
No it isn't. Furthermore, this isn't vigilantism. It would be if the guy tried to punish or apprehend someone for cheating, but just figuring out how he did it and then reporting it dirrectly to the cops once figured out isn't vigilantism. 
---
&gt;I say, let them keep banning people. In fact, let them ban EVERYONE. Then once their shit game collapses and we never have to deal with them again, people can learn to play games that don't deliberately create problems just to sell them solutions.
---
Sounds reasonable.
---
You can't get that from the perk can ya? I made it once and it's still sitting on me. I should be making that stuff all the time.
---
&gt; PA still has a chance of locking up your game
---
I stopped playing months ago because this bug was so prolific, and like many my build revolves around being in PA. My last play session I got stuck for half an hour during the first meat week, I was actually having fun for once, interacting with other players, crazy I know. Came back after restarting and the social tab lost the people I was playing with, haven't been back sense. 
---
Wastelanders is their last chance to fix this game, after that I just don't care about this series anymore, I've had enough of these people wasting my time.
---
I only have to see a comment of you from 20 minutes ago to see what you think about those who disagree with you *about a freaking videogame*.
---
Look, I'm not really interested in your childish back and forth. If you are frustrated, try talking to someone. I will be the better man and say that we agree to disagree.
---
Good talk.
---
I love collecting the little robot models lol.
---
No. Almost a year in still bug ridden, under developed and under QAed. Content wise - mile wide, inch deep. Still incompetent support and crappy community communication. Cash store works wonders though.
---
Small chance that wastelanders will improve 76 when released next year, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
For now - spend your money elsewhere.
---
Oh if only I clicked links from random people, you might of got me there.
---
 I'm just going to assume it's a video of your favorite YouTube Kiddy regurgitating the same hatred and vitriol that you seem to spew.
---
 No thanks!
---
Different studios, developers, project leads. At this point I doubt that Todd is involved with 76 at all anymore. And he is a good game designer, despite the flak he's getting for being the company's face.
---
On the other hand - the already had this exact same experience with ESO, which was quite bad when launched, how hard it is to learn from past mistakes? But instead they seem to adopt ESOs monetization methods, instead of the things that made that game good. 
---
I too supported 76 through thick and thin, but lack of any substantial improvements made me uninstall back in august, after seeing that awaited vault raids are a glorified version of "where's Waldo" with neverending enemies.
---
At this point I have little hope, that wastelanders will do anything to rectify the situation.
---
You get to keep everything you got for paying for the sub. Like everyone else has mentioned, if you let your sub lapse you can continue to take scraps out your scrapbox but, you not be able to put any more in it.
---
I’m the same way, the only downside is, atleast for me, once I throw in the towel for whatever reason, I’m done, full stop.  
---
Once those who pour their heart and soul into trying to improve things loose hope / get disenfranchised...  
---
Keep fighting the good fight, if we don’t try no one else will.
---
It was a great story. But now it's clear that it was a PR move to soften the backlash. Make it seem like they cared and would make changes.   
---
Turns out neither of those things were true.
---
 Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
I'll try to not be rude like other's here, but do you actually play other games? Like other games services, like overwatch, fortnite, any other form of MMO, MMO-lite. Like I love the fallout universe as much as the next guy, but 76 has honestly had a content drought since release. This game is not well supported, and bethesda haven't shown signs of changing that other than some posts on a website saying they'll do better, only for them to go back on their word.
---
I really want to stop bashing this game, I want the product originally sold to us to come to fruition. But bethesda have shown no sign of being able to physically do it. It'll be a year in four days to the original release, compare other games to their first years of content and it's honestly a shitshow. Even Destiny 2 which had massive issues at release can't compete with this travesty, and again that game at least released hours of polished playable content. What have we honestly gained in our first year with 76? A broken battle royale mode that no one asked for? 
---
Will it get better, probably? But we'll probably see Fallout 77 before they somehow get this mess to function properly to where an average gamer won't feel like his time is being wasted.
---
Dupers got unbanned too so those people getting unbanned doesn't tell anything
---
Hey I hear you, and if I didn’t talk occasionally with people at BGS who are trying to change the direction of things I would have tapped out long ago....   
---
And before the knee jerk “it’s their job / PR response”....
---
When someone’s trying to help on their day off, or at 22:00 on a Friday night, keeping in mind these are salaried employees, so no OT, it means they care, they are trying to make a difference
---
Going through comment historys is kinda creepy right? And isn't totally relevant to the conversation right?
---
What Bethesda fails to realise at this point is that fans are returning wallets.
---
Or they do, but think that "returning wallet" means it'll come back however hard you throw it...
---
r/cringe
---
I’m here, I’m 19% health, and I’m proud of it, baby.  I don’t need your conversion retreat weekend.
---
Used to work with bank related stuff. You see, Chargebacks should be a last resort thing honestly. Regarding Bethesda, I don't give a fuck about their well being after being such pieces of shit with customers, but when it comes to small businesses, they are constantly fucked over by processing companies. If you make a chargeback, the business is going be deducted the amount for the dispute, and they will be charged for the chargeback process itself.
---
Honestly i'd rather try contact the company first, if no response or they act like cunts, then you should chargeback and tell them to fuck themselves.
---
Shit. I know what I'm doing when I get oh. Thanks!
---
I collect Halloween candy and teddy bears 😂
---
Did you try deploying PA into the room and entering it?
---
Wrong again! On the cusp on Gen x and y.
---
 I'm guessing you are millennial.
---
 Easily offended and hate everything.
---
It seems Bethesda went out of its way to make this game as tedious as possible is why they didn't include that feature.   Spend all your time repairing, feeding, watering,  etc and get locked up in that monotonous rinse and repeat  routine to see that we are playing an alpha version of a game still in development.
---
This is the best idea
---
It froze me as well, and i’m the one using it. Lowering the amount of cores with downcore control in your bios helps.
---
Lowering the amount of cores in your bios with downcore controls helped for me.
---
Except the dupers were never banned, they were suspended, suspensions end, bans don't. The fact they were wrongfully banned is demonstrated by the fact they are already unbanned. LOL
---
I'm surprised they didn't actually flew them in just to steal their souls and feeding into an altar of Todd the Defiler.
---
The spawns come in waves during the event, so the nuke would have no effect on their health.  Most people typically fight the queen outside the nuke zone anyways, so the sundew grove or your spot of choice would still be full of live enemies.
---
ok boomer
---
The finished on patch 14. If there are no customers no more work needs to be done. Hopefully get nominated like EA for worst business of 19/20.
---
Ok sheep.
---
Considering the game is meant to receive several content updates over several years, it would be hard to pinpoint where they are considering there isn't a finish line
---
Agree, i fucking hope this shit of a company sinks forever so the licenses end up in some COMPETENT hands instead.
---
Screenshot on this post claims this dude was suspended. So they were never banned after all, just suspended. So ending the suspension would have no meaning. They were never banned to begin with, suspension ended. So how did Bethesda prove they were innocent again? lol
---
Ive never seen Halloween candy in game b4 unless i have just looked over it and ignored it.
---
Thank you, I still have a bit left actually, so doing some more decorating. After I finished the video, I added a cigarette machine, news paper dispenser, and a trash can to the outside area, kind of like you see at the others.
---
&gt;Why its not happening, I just can’t grasp.
---
I have an easy answer. Lack of resources. They’re probably devoting the least amount of people possible right now, and are instead focussing on Starfeild and other titles. I would be curious to compare how many people worked on Fo4 and 76...or stayed on through the full run of each.
---
Ghouls need love too.
---
It clearly says 'suspension'. You didn't mention a thing about 'indefinite' suspension. I see that you like to move your goalpost a lot.
---
&gt;Except the dupers were never banned, they were suspended
---
This is the exact quote you made. Would you like to refute your own claims now?
---
nice joke haha
---
I've been at it for 1300 hrs and still have 4 magazines I need to complete my last 2 magazine challenges. WickedyChickady has a great Youtube video on farming for magazines.
---
Won from the Monster Mash event. Ever do Load barring? You get tokens and turn em in for a prize at the end.. same deal with the candy. There is an terminal inside the highschool where you exchange it. Most people don't carry the candy around.
---
Hey there /u/Valseek,
---
I was wondering if there was any update to when this bug might get addressed. Any new news on this one? Hopefully next patch (fingers crossed). Thanks in advance for getting back if you can.
---
It comes with a bed, stash box, scrap box, banjo and a cooking station. Unfortunately you can’t add anything to it and the nobuild zone around it is I think the size of a normal camp so you can’t build to close either
---
With a +limb damage effect and the Grenadier perk they're still very useful for support builds
---
haha. This is the 76 equivalent of getting SWAT-ed.
---
One of the benefits of a max budget camp build is that your teammates can't deface your walls.

I always wondered if logging into these games was like worshiping the Stargate Ori or something.  What exactly increases a companies' profits by us logging in?  Also never understood leveled armor or weapons.
---
I didn't think of that. good idea.
---
there are far worse things on youtube, though. like people performing "sex change" ""surgeries"" in the name of """art""".
---
Not sure how to explain an "item for item" trade better than it is, tbh, but, well... it is when you offer an item for another item. Not sure if it is even possible to explain it somehow better.
---
I collect bloodied weapons for personal use :)
---
Edit: also the shiny tie mr fuzzys
---
You're asking why there is a lack of something in Fallout 76.
---
Most likely the answer is the Atomic Shop.
---
The thing I see with the Burrows is the same thing I see with Arktos and the Vault Raids.  They look great.  They sound great.  And they are all let down by extremely basic, bottom-of-the-barrel quest design based around ideas that are either uninspired or fundamentally bad.
---
It's not *all* bad though.  The Sheepsquatch stuff in Wild Appalachia was solid, along with the side quest mysteries.  The seasonal events are also pretty good.  There is someone in that group who knows what they are doing.  And that person is probably off working on Wastelanders while we get stuck with the B-team.
---
indeed, ESO had the same rough patch being a an Elder Scrolls MMO. Especially since their DLC was still full price, still today. 
---
i remember there was a alot of hate back then but now ESO is very flushed out. I mean i havnt touched Elswyer yet due to busy and to many other games in library XD.
---
Right on. This has probably been done but I wana make a comic shop at the unstoppables billboard
---
What's this little image you've got there after your sentences?
---
This game will never have text chat or guilds. After wastelanders release you will know why. It will be 2 hour content similar to wild apalachia with no end game. This game will die out in 2020. this game is specificaly made to make easy bucks of whales.
---
Most of my communication is in the Xbox app or discord. I’d rather be typing through an in game interface. I bought a keyboard so I could do that with ESO. I just have no interest in using voice comms for the game.
---
I thought about putting a magazine rack in the bathroom lol.
---
lol k
---
In a world where Purdue Pharma exists, whose opioid epidemic is directly responsible for the killing of over a hundred people every single day and tens of thousands in total, EA is *nothing*.
---
Ok boomer
---
It just works
---
You meant he stoped supporting people that keep supporting the game because Bethesda screwed him?
---
oh....
---
That makes a lot of sense, since once I respawned I was easily able to fast travel.
---
Yup, have only had a chance to finish it once but of the plan first go.
---
Yeah, I was happy with the DLCs and paying for the sub for the benefits. Despite Cyrodiil being a lag disaster, the spirit of fun was there. I’m hoping wastelanders is an evolution moving towards that goal.
---
Alot of people left here are whales, nobody with brain plays this game anymore.
---
Thank you
---
I just use the prisoner collar.
---
I heard it turned completely pay to win to stay afloat, I see the same thing happening here.
---
I don't; some people are fans of this game, and just like people who dislike the game attack it, so do those fans who are offended defend it.
---
Hell - I like FO76 (although I don't excuse its many bugs and failings), and whenever the torch brigade comes out in full force I'll sometimes drop a comment or two in support of the game.
---
Well, good luck waiting indefinitely.
---
It is nice doing one violent night and uranium fever without dickholes ruining it.
---
I left ESO last year for FO76. Up until then, purchases were still cosmetic except for xp scrolls which didn’t really matter when you have 700+ levels. 
---
The sub system was for crafting items. 
---
I’m more curious about the launch year, how it was, versus what it was able to evolve into.
---
I desperately hope they let people control their own third party servers, letting them mod in things themselves. This game could be crazy good for RP but that would require big changes.
---
You're right, the only capabilities we have are our mics, we need typing.  On another note, I was in one of the player made brotherhood of steel clans, those guys were a bunch of weirdos.
---
If you like being stealthy, it may be time to invest in some perks like Sneak, Ninja (for melee) or Covert Operative (for guns), equipping whatever guns you have with suppressors if they are available, and shadowing your armor.  Stealth characters can get significant damage multipliers.
---
But if they gave the Atom shop a fair chance then they wouldn't have needed Fallout 1st. 
---
And people clearly asked for fridges and Fallout 1st features /s
---
Lmao you can buy xp? I think that's the most contradicting thing in a video game ever. Man I wana like Bethesda but they just get worse and worse.
---
Jesus, inventory management in this game is all kinds of fucked up. I've seen some other interesting bugs (dropping copies of quest items I'm carrying on log in like the broken uplink for the main quest for example), but this is a whole new level of awful.
---
Bet this bug has been in the game since day one, too.
---
No it isn't. There are things like 5 day ban or 30 mins ban. Where are you coming up with all these messed up terms? Seems you are kinda new to gaming or internet in general
---
unyielding with +1 strength. Its broken like everything in this game. I can powerattack for 20k damage
---
I used to say the same thing. But Bethesda genuinely can't be trusted. They e doubled back too much, not responded too much. One in a hundred bugs slipping through is 1 too many
---
Definitely a bathroom bundle, toilet, bathtub/shower, and a sink!
---
How can I hang up a please wash your hands sign, if there isn’t a sink to wash your hands?
---
Amen brother
---
Never.
---
For that matter, I've yet to see it happen for anyone else either.  As far as I'm concerned, this is fake news.  I'm sure there were some instances of it in the beginning, and I'm sure there are some "Raiders" playing this role now, but it's not the epidemic that sites like Polygon are portraying it as.  It is, as far as I'm concerned, fake news, which is predictable considering the source.
---
And before someone says "Oh, but you're Lv. 320, so people knew to leave you alone," this was on my alt, who basically had 1st starting around Lv. 20 and was ripe for griefing attempts.
---
Also, for all the protests, 1st seems quite popular.  At every SBQ battle I go to, someone sets up the TENT, and it's too small to support all the players queuing up to use the Scrapbox after the battle ends.  We'll see how it is come next month, because a lot of players might have subscribed just for the outfit and Atoms, but I would say 1st seems to be the norm rather than the exception at least for players who regularly run the SBQ.
---
&gt;The company is already winding up development on this one
---
Do we actually know this though, I think everything is just best guess on our part. They could pull the plug on this game or develop it into something amazing still, who knows?
---
If you are on xbox i can put dense on any form of armor that has a plan for it. Gt is the same as here minus the underscore.
---
not to mention that on PC the "add friend" and "invite" options have been bugged for like half a year
---
Personally I have no interest in Battle Royale game modes, so as tempting as some of the rewards might seem I think I'm just going to avoid NW personally.  
---
Hope anyone who does play enjoys themselves though, not hating on it just not for me :)
---
It’s a boost to what you earn. I’m not arguing against your principles, but it truly doesn’t impact other players. You’re not getting an explicit edge on anyone, because if you’re engaging in pvp you can select a variety of options including running with caps on what levels you play against.
---
Have a Turbo Man style figure but one of the fallout characters.
---
I just hope that focus on 76 won't take quality away from future single player games.
---
Do you know how much stable flux weighs? 1 lb each. That means with your regular stash, you can hardly store more than 10 each. Which is necessary because most PA mods cost a lot of flux. With your scrap box, you store infinite.
---
The thing is, you can live without a refrigerator at your house, but do we? But we don't mind living without wearing Armani suits everyday.  Your argument has zero logic.
---
He's like "look at this abomination" ...while having a giant insect head lmfao.
---
right? It used to be a full priced game with non-cosmetic microtransactions. Now it's just another microtransaction-based piece of \*\*\*
---
Thanks for posting that. I was thinking about you the other day, I'd read your original post about speaking to Bethesda and was interested to find out what your current thoughts were. Makes me sad that things are going downhill with barely a whisper from them.
---
Just make sure you have done the quest up to that point, as it will not drop if you haven't.
---
imagine downvoting this
---
literally the most requested outfit ever is the one they locked behind the membership
---
Have you tried re- equipping them from the atomic shop ? This happens to me time to time after the Halloween event but I can always find them &amp; re-assign them again. 
---
Reported to Bethesda support but haven't get any response yet.
---
There is absolutely no way outer world's Is as complex as Skyrim or Fallout 4, from size of the world, to depth of the world, to combat, items, lore, enemies.
---
It's absolutely complex, but not AS complex.
---
And "next to no bugs" isn't true. Like with any game, the bugs you as a player experience aren't the whole amount of bugs in the game.
---
Lastly, having a bumpy time after launch is normal for any online game, even if you try to say it's ridiculous. Ark had one, Red Dead online had one, Anthem had one, CoD Modern warfare had a lot of server troubles and forced people to DL a 56 gig day one patch to play SINGLE PLAYER.
---
Judging 76 by the standards of what is or isn't ridiculous, just cements the idea it's not.
---
Started a new character. Did Final Departure and got Somerset Special. Went to equip it, load it, and POOF. Gone. 
---
Mind you it was a level 5 since I got it *too* quickly, so no biggie. But, yep, gone, nowhere to be found. 
---
Sorry to hear your bad news. 😩
---
Every piece of content they added into the game the past year genuinely feels like it was ripped from the game originally and rehashed as “DLC.”  It actually would not surprise me if that is the case.  All of it is forgettable and able to be completed in like three hours.  We literally got alcohol brewing as a “DLC.”  That should have been base game content!
---
Maybe it’s just me but I am waiting for Wastelanders.  That will determine whether or not I uninstall the game for good.  Just because it is delayed does not mean it will be good.  Remember the first Meat Weak was delayed and that was the most boring and tedious event.
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
three weeklong holiday events with camp and cosmetic rewards (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but it's coming out early next year
---
Mate the people on this reddit are completely blind. They don't realise the damage Bethesda have done, they see the good parts of the game which are basicly a result of the community. 
---
You'll get zero support here.
---
The situation is same, but completely different games. I hope FO76 can make it, just like ESO did, but ESO's tricks won't work here. They just have to fix it from zero.
---
Prewar ceramics, vases, teacups and saucers, ceramic kettles.
---
the bad thing really is not just becuz the game is buggy, but becuz they r tryhard to be EA, there thats the biggest issue
---
So is it good idea if i feel my character isn’t lucky, i delete it and start over?
---
When did you stop learning the plan after completing the quest that unlocks Encryptid? I did that one when it first came out and learned how to craft it at the same time I was awarded that L30 Fixer.
---
Dude! This fixed it. Thank you so much.
---
yeah i found Cryodil you really needed a good army to follow plus the lag.
---
Its explicitly against the rules though. I never seen it happen.
---
We don't know. We can only speculate. Knowing how successful fallout first has been and how atom sales have been would give us some sense of whether the game is profitable. The minute they conclude they can't make money off this game to a degree that would be better than other endeavours, it'll wind up.
---
I'm most pleased with player vending truth be told. Was one of the first additions that confirmed that Bethesda listened to our suggestions, we all remember the posts asking for brewing but that's a little questionable that they wouldn't have come up with on their own. Player vending was a community suggestion
---
I prefer canned dogfood. For the taste.
---
They could sell it for 1500 Atoms but then who will be interested in the membership? Scummy move from a scummy company. I used to hate EA but at least they deliver top quality products and only then they try to overmonetize.
---
ESO was a million times better than this with way more content and an actual enjoyable pvp mode
---
Insects shall inherit the Earth!
---
This is moron posting you shit
---
They measure progress in $$$ if they didn't then even Bethesda would have to admit how little they have improved F76
---
Vault 79 is probably related to gold, based upon previous teaser images for Wastelanders, and the atomic number for gold.
---
lol i have this image of beth tying fo76's shoes at the start of the race, but when it starts the laces are all tangled and knotted
---
better than it was, not as good as it can be
---
I use her farming runs and still nothing lol
---
Yup, it is just rare.
---
What a whale
---
Hahahahahahaha! Nice to have money.
---
Paladin Danse is real upset right about now.
---
Done the same way but while in vats?
---
From what I learned he was banned for using a "cheat engine" that detected the bug, not because he reported it.
---
They walked off the starting line then released a patch and went back. They have been doing that for the last year. Someday they may actually start the race but so far they are still debating whether to start or not.
---
In the first year though? I’m not disagreeing, just trying to clarify.
---
Sadly the atom challenges get screwed up like that. People think it has something to do with playing NW. 
---
Now there really isn’t anything to fix it to my knowledge. When it happened to me, I messaged support and they told me to reinstall the game. When I did that, it didn’t fix it and made my game run even worse. 
---
As well they will not compensate you for the atoms you can’t earn. 
---
Thanks Bethesda!
---
Stopped supporting the game is one thing. Completely shutting down his website and doing this is another.
---
He has made it a spectacle.
---
Maaaaaybbbbeee.... for money
---
Huh, this explanation is fine. I agree with you.
---
Bethesda can't understand basic things like a text chat let's not get our hope up.
---
Yeah first year pvp was awesome before they halved damage. But it wasn't for everyone I'm sure a bunch of people had a bad time.
---
What power armor do you have on? I recognize the helmet and chest but what are the arms and legs?
---
Happened to me yesterday for some reason on PC, Atomic Shop fixed it.
---
Just because skyrim and Fo4 had a janky engine doesn't make it more complex. Don't get me wrong i love the games but they are notorious for bugs and crashes even today (ran it to a bug were the game crashed several times in a row two weeks ago, no mods...). And combat is a weakness of Outer worlds yes, but skyrim isn't winning any medals in that department either. As for Outer worlds bugs i know my experience isn't the end all be all but i haven't heard about any bugs besides the one in tartarus. The games you suggested aren't excusable either, with ARK having major sever problems, red dead online's horrid economy, and Anthem is just dead. EA kicked it aside and removed it's roadmap. and even requiring a day one patch isn't terrible. but CoD MW hasn't had enough time for us to see if activation stuffs it up or not. But 76 has had horrible glitch's. Like the new private worlds being janked, or how even after launch someone found a room full of items like the ones from skyrim and fallout. This game is ridiculous in how Bethesda has handled it, and it's state in general.
---
Same happened to me yesterday and I opened a ticket. Looms like I have to do It again.
---
I wanted to complete the challenges though.
---
There actually is. In the Military Wing of the Bunker if you look in the back area behind Modus (Vendor) you will see a line of X-01s which are painted in Enclave paint. Sadly its just a set piece as there isnt any In game paint in the Power Armor files that match that style.
---
Cyrodiil in theory is what I’d like for eventual FO76. I want players and NPCs with objectives, without being a travel sim, like cyro seemed to me.
---
That burnt toast ghoul beaver
---
Um... Imperial City came out 2 years after launch and Battlegrounds came out 3 years after launch. I think you’re not accurately remembering how barebones ESO was at launch.
---
The damn thing was worse then the SBQ.  Everyone was dying left and right.
---
Large scale pvp would be amazing. Maybe faction based conquest?
---
I've stopped playing until then. If Wastelanders is any good I call that a win at this point.
---
Maybe, just maybe, the spectacle is part of the plan.
---
If it got at least one bethesda supporter to the point of start to think about the whole problem, it was a successful spectacle.
---
Or someone edited the OP after I commented 🤷‍♂️😂
---
I think stealing the general theme of alterac valley from WoW or fighting waves of ghouls to secure objectives before the other faction in another city, or combinations of scavenging and destruction of defenses.
---
No i remember. But I played Cyrodiil and that's basically it. Imperial city was fun but i still mained cyrodiil. Aside from balancing and adding different vendors its basically the same
---
Smooth skin....
---
It’s the liberty prime power armor.
---
Lol support builds. I think everyone rather do 20x the dps. Which is why I haven't seen anyone using these weps for a year.
---
Looks like X-01 mixed with liberty prime.
---
&gt; develop it into something amazing still
---
That is some seriously naive optimism. I'm not trying to insult you, but there is no hope for this game other than Bethesda/Zenimax selling the rights to another company and I see it going F2P before that happens but the reality is even with F2P ain't nobody gonna start playing this game now.
---
You've seen what they can do with a years worth of dev time. I want to say "literally nothing" but I'm sure someone will point out they added small shit like the punch bowl and vending machines like those were game savers.
---
Uhh most people already quit since last year.
---
It works perfectly, just put your stuff into a suitcase or cash register and switch characters. Also, the timer is at least 15 minutes before you lose your connection to the server, but I wouldn't suggest testing the limits if you're muling stuff.
---
My argument says the scrapbox is more like the armani suit than the refrigerator tho. The most similiar thing I can think of is the "Ridge Wallet".  
---
Might be useful in the part where you save a lot of space, but it still isn't something you can't live without.
---
I haven’t, not yet anyway. And I’d imagine the grief squads have mostly moved on if that was even true in the first place
---
Well, he didn’t get me and a lot of others. But most importantly don’t think the devs are going to either. Definitely, could have been dealt with better. 
---
What he has done, is nothing short of blackmail and a stunt.
---
They tripped over the line and keep falling as they try to get up.
---
Should be noted that this is because the X-01 was, originally, developed AFTER the war BY the Enclave. Since the Enclave doesn't exist yet neither should the X-01 so they had to invent some hoops to jump through so they could recycle the X-01 from Fallout 4.
---
Well that is the best argument for OPs point. Thanks.
---
Do you not realize this is completely false, or are you being intentionally untruthful and manipulative to push an agenda?    
---
I report bugs. I do it all the time. No one is getting banned for “doing just that.” It sucks, but they got banned for using an engine. I don’t agree with the ban, but how about being an adult when making an argument?
---
Fantastic job. Mine isn't nearly as nice looking, but (if you're on ps4) you can use my setup for ideas.
---
Hey man!! I was just there yesterday and discovering it organically well I got to say this place is bitching! I could only look into the train station from the windows in since it was locked but I basically had to doubletake and think hmmm that’s not actually normally there and as good as it looks that isn’t a Bethesda made thing. U could have fooled me. Good work man👍🏻
---
I have to say,  For me, disconnections are hardly a thing anymore.   For the first few months it was at minimum once a day.  So there's that.
---
Here checkout my current build, I integrated it into a bridge. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwMnok4cr\_w&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwMnok4cr_w&amp;feature=youtu.be). Its difficult to integrate with buildings, mainly because of enemy spawns. There are however plenty of underpasses and caves that have no spawns in them.
---
2 in the head and their dead
---
Nice.  Where do the black pillars come from?
---
eso had way, way more missions/quests, fleshed out systems/mechanics (eg provisioning, research, guilds (and guild skills)), and an interesting framework to expand.  i playd until about imperial city, earned caldwell's helm before one tamriel, and then took a break until clockwork city came out.
---
i think 76 has a better world/environment and junk/loot but is missing pretty much everything else at this time.  for example, in eso u can do daily crafting writs, dungeons, and anchors; 76 has dailies, but they're kinda scattered and sometimes just break/disappear w/o completion.  another example are the events, eso has new and different events/promotions constantly whereas 76 gets some warmed over meat week.  (i love grahm and chally, but damn, sometimes i'ts more like meet weak, amirite?!)
---
the really interesting task is to take what makes something like eso enjoyable and translating that into the fo76 format.  it just felt sometimes, like fo76 was the lowest effort possible to emulate success.  idk if is b/c they are operating on skeleton crew or just dont care, but it shows in the product.  i was aghast during the clean appalchia that the website didnt update over the weekend; i get that there are humans who want weekends off, but y isnt that kinda stuff automated/integrated.  again, idk if skelton crew or they just dont care.  we'll see with the dawn of the subscription era what will happen tho, and whether this title earns the support of PBS viewers like you
---
The only door that’s locked is the office door. The others to the vending and workshop are unlocked 😉.
---
Dev have nothing to do with this shit, start to point fingers to producers, that's better. Dev do what they are ordered to do.
---
Producers will be hit when supporters thin down.
---
This was not the move that will solve the problem, but his move is supporting whatever MAY solve the problem.
---
r/fallout76settlements
---
Haha the immersion is complete!!!
---
Semantics 🤷‍♀️
---
They post/pillars are in the stairs section. There is a trick to get them on the exact corners 😉
---
At Biv's Place
---
yeah there definitely is that feeling of "swashbuckling adventure!" seeping all through the world is ending and the "help me obi-wan, you're my only hope!" quests
---
You'd think that, and you'd be wrong lol. Just because you don't see it happening doesn't mean that it doesn't happen
---
Thanks I’ll share it there as well.
---
Ok thanks
---
"They called it a "new frontier" and "pushing the envelope," completely disregarding the repercussions. Can't you see the same thing is happening again?"
---
Yes, a collection of 1 star pieces is a fine starter set, and unless you're picky about the armor type you can probably build a set for under 5k just server hopping and checking player vendors.
---
Bring back the Drill as  a legendary drop  there :).  !!!
---
I respect your opinion, even if it's wrong.
---
all my different flavored perk pack gum, and i'll pay a pretty penny for yours, too!
---
I actually got it last night without even trying. Now for Whoopsies
---
This should be the top comment. It perfectly captures how there has been a little bit of forward momentum some of the time, but a heck of a lot of going in the wrong direction as well.
---
Throw in an Assaultron as the bouncer, and a Gutsy as a heckler.  Maybe have a few Mr Waiter bots milling about as well.
---
Perhaps as a little mini-event.  Throw in a few computers. The higher your hacking skill, the more off the rails you can get it.
---
couldn't say really, it is true that when kill some mutants fast enough they splatter into static chunks of meat, that stay in the air where the body supposed to be, but these are no problem since it have collision, and you can loot them, but that's all i know. Maybe is because explosive legendary effect? Most high damage weapons out there have explosive attribute
---
This is all based on opinion, and I have to add more to this shortly as I can't scroll down for some reason.
---
This is a very good question.
---
Ive played eso since beta and I can say without a doubt ESO was much more fleshed out and realised then FO76 at launch. It had MANY theething problems yes, but it knew what it want to be: an MMO based on the elder scrolls lore. Zenimax did an amazing job despite a hostile launch, turned it around, fixed the bugs and continued to deliver content at a steady pace. A year into it we had plenty of communication from the Devs and plenty to do. From the beginning it never felt 'Bethesda'; the bugs felt like standard MMO testing shortfalls, similar to the same ones WOW had, like quests bugging out etc. (seriously I was there for wow beta and jeepers people have forgotten bad mmo launches)
---
FO76 feels nothing like ESO. It doesn't feel like Zenimax, it feels amatuer. Zenimax at this point and after everything they went through and learnt from ESO release wouldnt be making these heinous design choices, saying one thing and doing another, not promising to fix bugs or completely ignoring them, coming out with garbage mtx items, turning PTW...
---
For a moment my mind created the sentence "Give head to the dead" I immidiately felt awfully filthy.
---
If you're only getting 590 dmg from a bloodied DCG there's something seriously wrong with your build and/or gear. With a couple pieces of unyielding gear, the adrenal, talons, and twisted muscle mutations, and 1 point for the radicool perk you should be putting out well over 1k.
---
Listen. You’re arguing with a guy who intentionally implied they got banned for reporting a bug, instead of a cheat engine. He knows he’s being untruthful and manipulative. You can’t talk sense to someone like that.    
---
He’s just going to deflect it and be more manipulative by ignoring the point of your argument and spouting more propaganda for his agenda.    
---
Also, he used the term shill. That’s just embarrassing at this point. Though, he does have a cool bandwagon. I like the flame stickers, the glittery “shill” painted on the side and the aftermarket muffler tip the doesn’t add any performance, but makes it louder.
---
Just wondering how long? And how much you have total? Like a rought number?
---
That’s very fair. Thanks for your detailed response. I came to ESO year 2 maybe, so I didn’t have the launch experience.
---
Player vending was originally planned for launch. You can see the old designs as buildable objects in the camp in a trailer (they looked like the ammo/med machines at train stations), and they mentioned it in interviews.
---
You get thousands of the things for free. Last time I logged in, I had literally dozens in my inventory just waiting for me to send them to the next alt I want to level. 
---
ESO does some not-great stuff but you don't really know what you're on about if you think the XP scrolls are the problem lol.
---
I feel like a real tough point is there’s no *fun crafting grind for unique stuff.*
---
In eso you could buy unique styles, but there’s also a ton of unique stuff you can aim for, vendor hop with purpose, and have a good network of people looking for similar stuff. Guilds alone would have been a huge gain in 76.
---
My friends are still finding "OWO" tags that I placed on their mules' camps months ago.
---
Why don't they look like the ammo/med machines at train stations though?
---
Just adding more random fetch quests to give unique chems or ammo would be beneficial.  *find me four skulls for a bone chime* would be *something*
---
Sorry, bud. Your request for reason and honesty has been denied. You’re in the wrong neighborhood for that.   
---
Also, he knows that. He’s got an agenda. He doesn’t really feel like his agenda can survive if he and his friends are honest, so he has to try to manipulate and mislead.
---
SBQ is simple. Shoot the big bitch until she dies then loot the corpse. Everyone involved can figure that out. 
---
Encryptid, even with the loading screen info, is a shitshow as half the people involved don't know what they're doing. People grabbing pylons who are woefully unprepared for what that entails muck it up as one or more pylons get grabbed by people who can't hold it for more than a few seconds.
---
I'm sure DLC will be *free.
---
**Free with Fallout 1st*
---
Their intention doesn't matter, break the rules, get the consequences. If you come across rumors of an exploit, you report it and that's it.
---
I'm guessing they just got redesigned after they were pulled from the launch build for whatever reason. I think the new style looks better anyway.
---
A foot
---
I agree with ‘social systems’. Let’s say they don’t want to give a text chat, for whatever reason - people spamming, feeling more free to be offensive over text, being ‘immersion breaking’, whatever (not saying I agree with any of these). 
---
Well, then they should have at least made the emote system  far more robust and communicative. No “sorry”? No “I have to leave”? No request ammo/specific scrap or items? No hold on/wait/afk? if you ever tried to have a conversation with these things, you quickly see how limited they are. 
---
And if no text chat, how about a bulletin board we can place in our camps? How about being able to have messages on our computers?
---
Honestly I was disappointed with the announcement of NPCs, I thought it was a bad cave to a criticism I never agreed with. If they made player interaction as robust as you described it with factions/guilds etc, with a better way to communicate for those who don’t want to use a mic, there would be no need for them. This isn’t f3/f4/nv, the style of the game was always supposed to be different.
---
Except those stupid claim tokens weigh 0.1 each. The candy is at least weightless.

Lol does reddit count? I just got called a "whale" because I decided to spend my hard earned money on a year sub.... 
---
Sorry but fact of the matter is, subscribers are helping bethesda further the game and make it better. We are essentially kick starters for their broken game. Don't get me wrong it may seem unfair but if you enjoy the game and wanna spend money to help bethesda improve on an mmorpg for some quality of life features and exclusives I don't see a problem with that.
---
Wait. So they got banned for reporting the bug or for using the cheat engine?  I haven’t seen you actually answer that. Do you mind answering and possibly siting a source?
---
Yup it's liberty prime with x-01 head and torso. Together with the blue headlamp is has an enclave vibe to it.
---
Also shuts up prime, he talks out of his torso ;)
---
Cheaters get banned. Thats what happened. 
---
 Just because some kids report it on YouTube doesn't make it true.
---
 Everyone is basing their "facts" off of one side of the story.
---
ESO still has mandatory attack weaving so by default FO76 wins lol
---
Thanks! I'm on PC
---
Aren't you doing exactly that?
---
Did y'all ever play qwop cuz that's the race beh is in .
---
Too bad the Mk19 breaks so freaking fast. I've got a Bloodied Fire Rate one and the speed with which is breaks down is asinine, especially given the relatively poor performance compared to rifles and other heavy guns. 
---
When you throw in the cost of its ammo (40mm aren't cheap to make) I just can't see running it consistently. Gatling Plasmas and Lasers are far more economical and don't break anywhere near as fast (though my BE Plasma seems to break if you so much as hint at using it).
---
Beta should probably end when wastelanders get released. Oh wait they released this mess a year ago, nvm.
---
Trading as usual here. Hopping from one camp to the next at the speed of sound.
---
Fun!
---
It’s the old bug related somehow to NW since i stopped playing NW couple months ago I never had this problem again
---
Well 1st is just a copy of ESO Plus so it wouldn't suprise me.
---
You have to power up the computer first before you can use it. It’s downstairs in VTU I believe.
---
No problem ! :)  Glad it helped.
---
He reported a cheat by using said cheat. So in a way you are correct.
---
I wasn't basing it off Bethesda side because they haven't made a statement about it. From what i have seen they don't ban innocent people.  They have ways to check these things now. Obviously they didn't like what they saw.
---
Just started playing after around 3-4 months of not playing. It’s way better than it was! Loving the new Vaults and missions!
---
I forgot about the Vaults! Now I have a good reason to log in today haha
---
This happens pretty frequently when you play Nuclear Winter before the reset. It’s not a guarantee- I’ve had it happen to me randomly when i havent touched NW in weeks before- but playing NW BEFORE collecting your daily atoms at the very least seems to exponentially increase the chance of this bug happening.
---
Play another game
---
Complete them first before jumping into Nuclear Winter mode. It's the only way to prevent this from happening again. 
---
It was a known bug since months ago. Dunno if Beth r interested in fixing this glitch.
---
Indeed, and there are many reasons why people might not want to use a mic. People uncomfortable with their accents or ability with English, people with speech impediments  or other disabilities, people in noisy households, people just playing with headphones in situations where they need to be quiet. If people can’t or don’t want to use a mic, they shouldn’t be missing out on part of the game.
---
Jetpack on arms.
---
You can’t compare them because ESO is a WoW clone RPG while F76 is more of a Destiny-type or RPG/MMO-lite type of game
---
Entirely different types of games
---
I was looking more at launch troubles, perception, and how attention to the game seemed.
---
I love the way their bones crack .... or was that their skin?
---
I got the pylon thing from the start. I will say I never expected how much damage the thing puts out so I was one of the unprepared.  Even after one guy grabbed all of them and hid on the roof shack, it was still a really tough fight.  I did appreciate the difficulty and hope that they add more stuff like this but it also seemed to be a resource sink for ammo and meds.  At least they are introducing mechanics though!
---
Yeah you can server hop
---
non lore coherent skins wont become franchise aesthetics, they're just a fun little bit of customizability which dont effect game lore whatsoever. i dont see from where you are pulling that skins that currently and never have effected game lore and future game aesthetics will do so.
---
Also these choices shouldnt be limited to single player as the whole point of customizeability in 76 is to make yourself unique and stand out from other players and not just be one of the masses
---
Happening to me too. Suspected it might have been because I’ve been grinding nuclear winter for those rewards. Every single one of today’s challenges autocompleted. :(
---
You have to be prepared.  With enough DPS backing me up, I can generally take all three and have the event finished with about 5-15 super stims used depending on how the others do taking her down. With a good team I've had runs where I only needed to hold the pylons for maybe a minute and she was dead. 
---
Without this kind of preparedness though, it can have an enormous ammo and med cost. 
---
Field Surgeon and First Aid make all the difference. Favorite supers and use them directly if you're gonna take the pylons. Once you have all three, it's the only thing that will keep you alive.
---
I've said this many times already. He was checking if the exploit was real before reporting it, instead of wasting Bethesda's time with an exploit that didn't even work.  If he wanted to take advantage of it, he wouldn't have reported it - but he did. And Bethesda banned him for helping them find an exploit they didn't even know existed.
---
My main issue with the game is : it still has too many bugs. Don't get me wrong, I play everyday and enjoy it. But my point is they should fix the major annoyances/bugs before adding new content.
---
I'm not talking about the minor glitches, as I know there are many. I've been playing FO76 for around a month and here are the most annoying bugs I encounter while playing multiple hours everyday :
---
1. Quest markers not updating or displaying the wrong place to go.
---
2. Sound going on and off randomly. Not all sound (at least in my case) but some sound effects like footsteps almost getting muted. It can happen any time, and sometimes the sound comes back to normal after 5 minutes. On other occurences it takes up to an hour.
---
3. ** Most important ** : entire game crashing. I play on PS4 and in my case it's usually this : the game suddenly comes to a halt, then I get the ps4 blue screen announcing me Fallout 76 has encountered an error. Basically taking me back to the ps4 main menu and I have to restart the game. There are days it doesn't crash and other days it crashes twice. I've been playing for about 1 month and my best guess is I got around 15 crashes.
---
In short : Bethesda, if you are reading this (I doubt you are), please prioritize fixing the major bugs before adding new content. Basically the crashes and freezes on ps4 and/or other platforms and the quest markers not updating or showing the wrong location. 
---
That's the only point I want to make, and I believe it's logical to fix major issues before adding new content. In the meantime, I still have fun playing this game, but have to cope with those major annoyances...
---
To answer the original poster question. After one year they have not come far enough from the starting line because the 2 major bugs I just mentionned are still in the game.
---
You have your tag as BOS so you have no room to talk.
---
lol patched server hopping?
---
how would that even work?
---
I had challenges that were the world ones. That never completed and gave me credit. I'd try once in while to go to the last one on the list and cause it to set, but they wouldn't. What was stinky was they were for high atom amounts.
---
i started playing on the free weekend.  i can see a change in  the game. like  when they changed the “even timer thing” it seems like a lot less disconnects
---
Still haven't heard both sides.
---
I think we have. One side reports an exploit, the other bans him for it. And that's all you will hear.
---
They'll probably just throw it in the atomic shop or lower prices at vendors.
---
"Vault(s)"? As in plural?
---
What are you a ghoul? Take that armor off right now paladin!
---
Project Paradise is my favorite event. Gt X Kalomn
---
That's not very Country Roads of them!
---
Well since you are basing your conclusion off of opinions  I will do the same.
---
 I think Bethesda saw that he cheated a lot more than he reported and that's why he got banned.
---
This made me want to play fallout 4 again, brotherhood forever!
---
I wish it was just semantics.
---
-_- i think the daylight saving is what mess me up. Usaully  they  drop at 10am cst but now they drop at 9am.
---
Often suggested, since the B.E.T.A. and nearly every MMO has had it since the dawn of time, no clue why they've not gotten on board...
---
Along with the bobble heads and magazines, my display cases are full of:
---
Teddy bears, Mr Fuzzys, teapots, a couple of vases, beer steins, sheepsquatch skull, mega sloth claw... both color garden gnomes, items with souvenir in the name...
---
I have the 4 bot models, but haven’t put them in a case yet...
---
Yes. For what little play time me and the wife have, we snarl at the social panel functionality every time.
---
And I respect your opinion, even if it's wrong.
---
Yeah I’ve noticed thanks for understanding
---
ESO had more literal content but it was all mindless questing. Some interesting stories were told, here and there, but 76 has the same thing except through holotapes and terminals.
---
ESO did have quest lines, however, that persisted across the map for guilds and the main quest and every individual area had its own main quest/story to follow.
---
There was definitely more to do than in 76 but the difference is that ESO was a theme park MMO, which completely changed the Elder Scrolls formula (for its benefit for multiplayer), and 76 is an attempt to adapt normal FO/ES style gameplay directly into a multiplayer title. Literally, "what if you could play Fallout 4 with friends?"
---
I think people tend to forget that every multiplayer Skyrim mod feels exactly how 76 does-- janky and awkward. Even worse because Skyrim wasn't designed to have multiple players.
---
ESO had far better PvP even if it was garbage in the first year, no comparison, however.
---
Can we get the game actually fixed and make it better so people like me can have fun playing it
---
 I bow to you O great seer.  May your infinite opinionated wisdom watch over us always.
---
Nah it was more like “I’m sorry you’re honor I snuck a gun in and then immediately turned it in to show that security was lacking”
---
They were just trying to help and Bethesda couldn’t see that
---
That's really cool
---
Always, son.
---
In your hypothetical, is it significantly cheaper too since you removed two major components?   If so, then yes.   If you're talking about the same price for less, then no.
---
Is there any other way to play the game ? Yeah is part of the game and design .. don't get me started.
---
Technically there's two, Nuclear Winter and Vault Raid
---
Some stuff that was patched ages ago doesn't work but for ther most part, yes hopping is a core part of ther game
---
new as of this patch or?
---
I fear for your mental health ;)
---
Yeah. I shouldn't have to be holding all three pylons AND be primary DPS against the thing while hiding on the roof to avoid the fake sheep squatch claws of the cabin while everything else is shooting at me. Had to do that like 4 out of the 5 times I did that event and I'm not doing it again after using  30 super stimpacks and 80 normal stimpacks. Low level players upscaling the boss is what drags it out so long
---
You know, I never really mentioned the engine when I brought up complexity. 
---
Good way to show me that you aren't ready to properly talk about it, and instead just wanted to complain.
---
Lol I realized my mistake ツ
---
No kidding bud.  I just don't get their thinking sometimes.
---
lol thanks for sharing, this is so funny
---
TBF you can't help it if the fake decides to target you when you grab the pylon and practically instadowns you.
---
Yes because a week after a controversy they forget that Bethesda is an awful company now and they go back to the classic “add this” and “Bethesda is making an effort” attitude
---
Eh if they were a comparable size to ESO that would be ok with me. Eventually West Virginia is gonna feel small and stale if it isn’t already.
---
You would prefer this game as it was at launch?
---
True, but the ones I'm talking about are the ones who get killed by the pylon itself or the other bots within seconds of becoming a conduit. A ton of people who do the event are completely ignorant of what it entails, and more importantly, how badly the pylons will hurt if they decide to "help" by taking one.
---
does ESO have a duping problem like 76 does? Literally every single new item gets mass duped and spreads like wildfire. EVERYONE has a Legacy gatling plasma. EVERYONE has a godroll Fixer. nothing in 76 is rare or unique because the game has almost zero anticheat.
---
During Mischief Night, I was playing some funny music and sound clips in area chat, and a guy comes up asking me where one clip was from and I explained which youtube clip I made it from and took the time to make sure he found it, he thanks me by dropping a legacy gauss rifle on the ground as a "thank you", which i politely declined. Then he asks me if I had anything I wanted duped... which I also declined. 
---
I'm still blown away by that interaction and how casually some people can break this game.
---
The only people playing on xbox are levels 60 and up. In fact its rare now to see actual new players.
---
To be fair, that's a feeling shared by most players for most games.
---
Entire rereleases with new content, bonuses, improved gameplay and the like are considering 'selling content that should have been at launch' many times
---
How bout you go to another sub with that negativity.
---
@L50, I was running in L45 excavator...and didnt get out of it until about L138.
---
Take your time.  I don’t think I finished BotB until about L100, and, believe it or not, just did fire breathers last night (at L151)
---
I understand, your first few SBs fights will be terrifying
---
A combat rifle is sufficient to take down a L50 SB.  It’ll take a few minutes and about 250 rounds to deal with the SB and its escorting scorched,  but it can be done.
---
Put n your power armor, Equip the best weapon you have and run the whitespring cottages and the laundry area behind the buiding.  At least 2 of the critters should be legendary. 
---
Do the uranium fever event.  That should get you a legendary or 2 as well, adn it is easier than the WS cottage loop.
---
Some player vendors sell unwanted legendary stuff at low prices.  (Under 500c)
---
They should have just made Fallout Online and it be a clone of ESO. That would have made plenty of money thus supporting the game. Not a Fallout 4 mod.
---
You know I agree with this, not it's bad though choice to listen to a few people but let's be honest, a selected few would push for what they want or think is best. But what the whole community, which would of been cheaper to do as well.
---
Yeah, I think if the small QoL things that made ESO easier it would have been better for FO76. If I wasn’t so invested in my interest in the FO lore, the reading of notes alone would have killed a lot of my interest. I don’t remember *anything* besides hard mode or achievement questing being as irritating as trying to read text in 76.
---
Don't blame me for the insane amount of bugs in this game.
---
How dare you suppress liberty prime. Filthy communist
---
I would LOVE ports of maps. I don’t want to be *in ESO* with mobs and lore, but I would enjoy more physical space to walk across. That’s kinda hypocritical though, seeing that I’m level 255 and still haven’t walked all zones completely.
---
Free sub to all for a week? Interesting and didn't know that.
---
it's a corporate decision. the atom shop was supposed to finance continued development. It failed; nobody buys the stuff (because most of it is overpriced ass ugly or boring nonsense that no one ever asked for, e.g. woodsman outfit, denim suit, cryptid enthusiast etc) but there goes expected revenue. So they put in an optional sub model with QoL/gameplay improvements and see if that works.
---
You clearly can see how they slid down the rabbit hole because it wasn't working. I can't even call it greedy, because it's obvious they weren't getting revenue. Not with ugly outfits and boring paints, plus it's not like this game is flying off the shelves.
---
Observe:
---
Originally stuff was put on the store and stayed there.
---
Then they moved to timed/limited store items to go after that fear of missing out money.
---
Then they moved to stuff that directly affects gameplay
---
None of these things worked.
---
So Fallout 1st came around.
---
I upvoted because you included an explanation, thanks 🙂
---
ROFL, a 5 day suspension or 30 minute suspension aren't "indefinite" do you even know what that word means or is it too big for you to understand?
---
Aye. I tried to point out that ESO evolved over time. Which is why I feel some/all of what ESO has might be offered to 1st over time.
---
yo mama so fat, for every step she take she need jet
---
   Try going into your PS store history.  
---
It will show when you redeemed the tricentennial item code to start with, and should also give you the option to download it again.
---
Less bugs but the core endgame loop is hot garbage.
---
They've moved away from what was promised.
---
Replying to both of you.
---
Yes I do expect to see the equivalent of an ESO mansion in FO76 1 day. It will have to wait till we have some kinda instance affected housing. Be it underground or what not.
---
Haha unfortunately I’m on Xbox.
---
I’m not sure, but there’s definitely issues with multi account bots that farm zones for resources. I don’t know if they fixed it. 
---
I guess I’m the only one without a fancy fixer. I did trade for a FE gat plasma though. 
---
I think a lot of the cheating spreads through curiosity.  The lack of hot fixes is surprising. I tested the trap disarm a while ago, thinking, *there’s no way that still works* I don’t know why I was surprised it wasn’t fixed.
---
Edit: that’s to say, two weeks should be plenty of time to hotfix something out. I was truly hoping it wouldn’t work, because if it’s easy to find as a TOP result from a search, that should be an easy target to stop.
---
Depends on your style -
---
as a melee, I like optimized bracers on the arms and motion assist servos on the torso. (+2 STR)
---
as a hoarder, I like calibrated shocks on the legs (+50 carry weight per leg)
---
and I also like a targeting hud (highlight living enemies)
---
Which small and large dungeon you are talking about besides the raid. Serious question.
---
we dont have one painting for the raider pa at this point \^\^
---
For me it's Nuka-Cola products all they way I have about 50 of each flavor, the T-51 Nuka-Cola Armor.
---
Since I'm only recently getting back into the game I now how to collect enough ingredients for Nuka-Shine and to collect the plans for the X-01 Quantum paint scheme
---
It's a chance to go to the dlc areas of the game, dye costumes, and become addicted to the crack bag... I mean craft bag, which gives you unlimited crafting item storage. It stays in there until it is used thankfully. Happens probably every 3-6 months idk
---
True, I bought ESO with the Morrowind DLC on sale (15€ I believe) and it took me 40 hours to finish all the quests from the DLC, and I still had all the content from the base game waiting for me. If they want to copy ESO, they should start from there
---
Executioners explosive weight reduced LMG. It kicks ASS! But I barely ever use it because it is SUCH an ammo hog...!!
---
Its a good leveling weapon

#GhoulLove BABY
---
I know people won't believe this, but what I'm fixing to say is 100% the truth. 
---
Bethesda has one of the most thorough and skilled QA teams in the industry.
---
Go ahead, laugh, but they really that good. The issue here is that they pass the bugs to devs and leadership, and they slap nearly every ticket as KS. (known shippable) In addition, finding the bugs isn't the issue, it's getting management to okay bugfixers the time to actually do their job. This was a big deal with fallout new vegas where Bethesda severely hampered obsidian with a very small window for QA and bugfixing. A similar issue happened with Batman Arkham Knight. EVERYONE, especially the idiots at Warner Bros knew that game was messed up, but they felt it was "good enough" so they slapped everything as KS and kicked it out the door. When you deal with a bug like saaaaay, a memory leak, one of the ways they handle that is to leave a console on overnight, come in the next day, inspect the code and see why it crashed. Well, if your team is given two weeks of bugging time, how many of those do you think you'll be able to find and fix? Better hope you have a ton of devkits! (spoilers, you don't) 
---
Another issue at play here is the pipeline. Some bugfixes may make it into one build, but not the other due to there sometimes being multiple forks in testing, so the work they put in essentially wasted unless they go back to the build and yank that bugfix out and put it in the latest and hope that gets compiled into the next one as well. 
---
In conclusion, if you ever play a game and find a bug, or something like in anthem they put part of the hud over the jetpack's cooldown gauge and you thought "Why didn't they find this? are they stupid?" They *absolutely* found it. Either resources were too small and they had to choose their battles on what they could and couldn't do, or they didn't care, stamped it's ass with ks and kicked it out the door. 
---

---
Well, they could just run off into the wasteland but apparently we’re meant to witness a violent execution￼ for some reason.
---
Not my point.  And i think he said 'we'tested it, makes me think it was a duping exploit in which case he's an idiot
---
They still don't have basic features like text chat and they're charging us for things they've been promising all year like increased stash space, so despite some awesome added content, like player vending, it doesn't feel like it's gone far. I feel like I'm still waiting for the game I thought I was buying.
---
Are you sure? I did think dataminers only read game files not in-game memory, but it appears they can do both. I found a post on this subreddit from 1 year ago with a comment that says:
---
 **Lots of anti-cheat watchers - windg x96debug ida cheatengine MemoryHackers etc.. do not get near this thing unless you want a ban.** 
---
There is even info on how CE is detected when running Fo76. You can google it. This is dated from 14 June 2019. Fo76 anti-cheat looks for the exe's **name**, so there's no chance that anyone could have used CE without getting an automatic ban, if this is correct.
---
My favourite weapon TODAY  is my bloodied, +33 vats accuracy, reduced weight grenade launcher. My explosive expert just aims to the head. Never a miss.
---
No problem.  I prefer a diplomatic discussion over keyboard warrior shit.
---
I imagine it's like screwing a thanksgiving turkey that's had a fair bit too much!
---
Get used to solo. Not many new players are coming.
---
And the hate doesn't stem from the beginning. It stems from the end
---
The throwable dupe has been back since meat week too. Piles of mines and cleavers are commonplace.
---
Even strangler armor is common, I know tons of people who have it and casually say "oh my friend dropped a set for me"
---
Get insult bot up on that stage!
---
For the most part I agree and already wrote a dissertation elsewhere on my thoughts of the scrap box. 
---
Honestly I think it would have meant more money for Bethesda overall if the scrap box portion was free to all and not part of the sub. PW access is more enticing if with the scrap box. If everyone had the scrap box free, more might decide to sub a month to fill it now and then on PWs.
---
Also scrap kits from the Atom Shop would have value if everyone had a scrap box the kits could send our junk to. Subs don't need them as they can tent at will and never have to carry scrap.
---
I know... But I have five high level characters already. Don't want to erase one. It hurts. I did it before, and he was the only one who ever learned the Fixer plans. 
---
Lowest level is 68. And he loves explosives.
---
Who cares if they listen, if they dont implement any of this. Only new things they release are more macrotransactions. They want to squeze out the remaining few players and then ditch the game.
---
Means to an end, everything for the Enclave!
---
Ad victoriam, Brother
---
I might give it for free to a low level rifleman.
---
Doing what? If PvE - it literally doesn't matter. At all.  
---
PvP (does it even exist anymore?) - PA is not viable.
---
I remember a few months ago someone wanted 100k rounds from a friend in exchange for a bunch of TSE laser rifles. 😒
---
Use a mic?? U can get them for almost nothing problem solved ur welcome
---
&gt;—&lt; this much
---
The problem is that what makes a bloodied build so viable is the unyielding armor that goes along with it.  That’s where you get the huge damage increase.  Radicool does boost your damage but in combination with the unyielding gear.  In PA your just gimping the meta
---
I love this. Only thing i would've done different is putting the vendors where the trader usually is.
---
It has a timer, and stimpacks aren't infinite. You'd be better off using a full set of autostim if you wanted to heal, and if you play bloodied, the optimal armor is either bolstering, or unyielding, so bloodied in PA may as well not be bloodied.
---
Okay, from that perspective the addition of Fallout1st isn’t quite so bad. I had given up all hope of enjoying F76 again but this post gives me a reason to not walk away completely.
---
Everything can go rare, since Wastelanders might be a game changer. I had a lot of trouble trying to find army fatigues, because my five characters had sold theirs after camp McClintock.
---
It isn't correct, go look up what eckserah the dataminer who posted about being wrongfully banned and then unbanned. 
---
They have been using CE since the get go, hell the NW hackers use CE and don't get banned and they actually do cheat, not just view memory.

Have you ever played QWOP? 
---
About that far.
---
Then you could only have one 😉, unless you did the multiple windows with vendor machines behind like some people. Original thought was to have them outside on the dock/platform.
---
its an old bug/feature that was there, went away, and now appears to be back.
---
core is removed from the chassis when you exit armor, and put back in when you enter. The enter animation even shows inserting a core.
---
I dont think you ”lose” the core on exit.
---
If you are using a gatling (laser, I think) it uses fusion cores.  Vats and jet packs also eat cores.  If you do not have power user and batteries included, I recommend adding them.
---
Batteres included reduces weight of cores, power user reduces consumption.  I live in PA, and get well over 6 hours out of a 50% core
---
I dislike that yongyea never actually brings up stuff when something positive happens with 76 (remember how big of a hit the battle royale and the free week was and he didnt make a single video on it?) But always quick to jump on the hate train, although this is one of the cases when im actually siding with him pretty much completely.
---
tried to solo a quest for the brotherhood where i have to find those radios 
---
4 scorchbeasts up there, killed 2 and i had to return to my camp to get more ammo, however, there were another 3 scorchbeasts at my camp, so i quickly took my plasma gatling gun and killed them all after dying 5 times 
---
so i decided to finish that quest when im higher lvl or if anyone wants to help me
---
To have more i would've put one where the vending machines are outside.
---
WoW clone? Have you played either game even?
---
Sure makes it nice when someone pops a survival tent near the fight.
---
Elder Maxon isn't born for another 165 years though
---
Good Vampire’s weapons too. Get one of those and be judicious with when you kill stuff or shoot at her and you can maybe get through the whole thing without stims
---
good points.  im thinking the vault 94 armors are first, tentative steps towards that, but its still a very long way to go (esp for all us non-PA types, haha!)
---
 I seldom see it in player vendor, probably have to buy or trade for it on a market sub or discord.
---
I have t51 with emergency protocols, with nerd rage and full bloodied build. Under 20% health heres my resistances
---
Dr 546
---
Er 606
---
Rr 310
---
T51 with emergency protocols is much tankier than probably any other armor, but one of the best parts of being bloodied is unyielding giving like 35 perception and agility, or 40+ strength. 
---
A set of armor with sentinel or cavalier would probably make you tankier than power armor, and you could keep your rediculous stats. Flat damage % reduction is much better than more damage resistance. The only bloodied build I use power armor for is my heavy gunner, because of the stabilized perk, and I dont need the stat boosts for vats or sneak. Rifle users or melee users benefit too much from sneak and vats/strength boosts accordingly. 
---
It would be a good backup if your build isnt optimized and you need to be tankier. Or just for use in nuke zones
---
They don’t need to charge for them

He's like the pinnacle of clickbait hate youtubers. No thanks.
---
They were banned for cheating, and rightfully so.
---
Yeah, I need to get on that grind after I finish possum stuff.
---
So we just gonna completely forget about all the promises they made about FO76?
---
Unstopable how?  I run bloodied and pretty much have to run PA to be viable in big fights like the sbq and imposter.  Still get oneshot by the imposter even with energency protocols, dodgy, serendipity.  I can tank the sbq but the adds can sneak up on you really easy.  Its a tradeoff really.  In pvp high dps weapons and gamma guns still bring you down pretty quick.
---
I'm more of a synth guy ngl
---
Basically the hate comes from those of us who bought it full priced at launch based on the promises and claims made by Pete and the developers. 
---
A lot of those claims turned out to be BS and we were super pissed off. We really wanted the game they promised. 
---
Many of us were willing to give it a chance nonetheless and still played, but then got massively pissed off by the folks who kept blindly defending the game by denying any complaints made against it.
---
It's as though their logic went "I like this game. If it was bad in anyway that would mean that my judgement was bad. Therefore it must be perfect. So I must argue against any claim that claims it has flaws." Its not a new line of denial, and one that annoyingly shows up in every fandom to be fair.
---
So you all DTF?
---
It was an laggy imbalanced mess ruled by vampire bat spam and teleporting wizards. And that is if you could even get passed the infinite loadscreen and get into pvp.  
---
And it is still laggy and imbalanced.
---
Here is a thread posted LESS THEN 24 HOURS AGO on /r/elderscrollsonline.
---
&gt; So  I recall back in 2017 and early 2018 when you couldn't play a game on  the weekend because of lag.I haven't had much of any issues with lag  until about August. Where it seemed every second day lag was awful.
---
&gt; Now  it is easily ten times worse to the point where PvP and PvE is out of  the question. Constantly hitting 999+ when I try any combat. Weird thing  is it just started this Friday when the golden vendor hit.
---
I played ESO very early after launch and personally had no problems with it. I loved it a lot and still do, same as F76. However ESO was released as more of a completed base game than F76. Even though I rarely criticise games, I've had times where I dropped F76 for a while because the bugs were so annoying, the stash weight limit was so obnoxious and etc. Now I've come back and really appreciate the changes they've made, but they still have a long way. The game should've AT LEAST come out in the state that it is now, and it's still far from perfect. Waiting for the next big update and hoping they release their roadmap for 2020 soon.
---
Wait a little bit and see if the game gets better
---
Error; Classification: Enclave unknown

---
Well. Chat was requested in the first closed beta I attended. And promised. So I would not get my hopes up. 
---
The Devs appear to be more keen on bringing in their own pet projects, or advancing the monetisation of the game, than making it more playable. Given the fact that bugs reported since Beta have not been fixed.
---
Lotta people running Wasted on Nukashine I see nowaday. It’s nice

You have no proof that it’s funding the game

Actually happened to me twice last night on Xbox as well. So THAT’S fun.

This is my reaction as well.  It doesn't take too much to be "unstoppable" in PvE.  Power Armor can certainly do it.  And if you're Bloodied, while you're gimping yourself by not using Unyielding armor, Emergency Protocols will give you survivability.
---
I completely agree with your points. I mean come on some of these bugs have been around since the start of the game. This is the main reason I refuse to purchase any extras ie atoms or fallout first etc. They either are unable or unwilling to fix these bugs and they have a major impact on my enjoyment of the game. In truth I am playing less and less of the game, I still enjoy it but these unfixed bugs are slowly pulling me away from the game
---
Ah yes, the little indie company Bethesda
---
This is what puzzles me really. Bethesda has access to Zenimax, and their experience running ESO - yet the only thing they took from it is the monetization model.
---
ESO was very troubled first year, but still it was rich with content, and more stable. Even back than, it gave you A LOT to do. 76 though, is mile wide and inch deep. Key difference is that devs listened and did a complete 180, turning it into arguably best MMO on the market today. Yes, better than WoW - I played that close to 15 years, so I know what I'm talking about. To this day ZOS is very involved with the community.
---
Main issue I have with ESO is that it locks so many cosmetics behind a paywall, without means to acquire them in game. For example - mounts. Yes, you get a free horse, but if you want a camel, or guar or what not - that'll be a tenner. I won't be surprised, if 76 will take this approach as well (if it already didn't, I uninstalled after that disappointment of Vault raids was released).
---
Lol, I find what Bethesda is do is a really big shitshow but the only reason I play is because I actually have fun doing the quests (when there not glitching). And I'm an original player (,since beta) but because of the horrid experience i had with beta I stopped playing for a few months but then the wastelander update was announced I thought that this might be a new start and that they fixed alot of bugs (which they did). Even though there are still some bugs it's a really good game and even though they charge a crazy amount of money for *cosmetics* it's still a fun game. Final price of the rant: one of the main reasons I originally bought the game is because it looked fun, I still play it because I don't care about the politics and alot of the people that. (But I still dislike the the way they wipped out private world's)
---
Oh and here's why I think they shouldn't do the BF thing, 1. higher levels will farm this and won't let lower levels get anything
---
2. People will follow you to your base and destroy it if you get the reward 
---
3. Finally, this could turn into a really big glitch, which would make the "fans" even more mad
---
Nerd
---
Well, it depends on which elder Maxon are we talking about
---
Most of the hate I’ve seen is from people who have never played it. Some have and some of them even have legitimate complaints. But certainly not all and I’d be willing to bet most of the hate is from people with 10 or less hours in it or haven’t played with a group.
---
Different elder maxon...
---
Might be, I stopped playing after that disappointment called Vault raids was released.
---
Atoms.
---
If PA - no reason to go Bloodied. Just pick up Junkies for constant 50% damage bonus and you're good.
---
Is it less buggy with fallout first
---
The easy fix is for Bethesda to keep track of refunds and not let people refund FO1st more than once.
---
Also, I think it makes sense that he got caught up in the ban, but I think his problem is that he CAN'T get it straightened out because their customer service sucks.
---
And I don't think he owes anyone anything, and this is a tool he has at his disposal to make bethesda listen to him. Also, if you're this soured on something why would you want to keep doing it?
---
Serendipity doesn't work in PA. Nor does dodgy.

---
What does that have to do with anything, the game still needs to be bringing in more income than it cost to maintain and expand.
---
Sorry but it is not clear from what he is saying in that post. Also, NW hackers are using aimbots or other programs not CE anyway.
---
Exactly. So how is something like 30 mins ban possible when ban itself is something indefinite? It's like limited unlimited power. What a clown. That's how you sound like
---
Really the main reason for the office and it being locked, is so my character can go in there and relax, and not have to bother with people coming up to do random trades.
---
People that bought the game and don't play have as much right to be here as you since they bought the game in the first place. As a customer, they have the right to air the grievances.
---
I not going to say that Bethesda has not done anything to improve the game.
---
 I will say after 2000hrs of game play. My biggest concerns are the glitches, exploits, and the fallout first memberships. 
---
Yes they have added new content, but really how does it fit into the fallout loure. It becomes more like a grind festival, apposed to a DLC, or a addition to the games loure. 
---
I get it, to each there own. 
---
Mind you I would have liked to see more interesting stories added to the game. 
---
Instead of vault raids, and pioneer scouts the way it was added, and let not even get into the nukashine addition.
---
 They honestly don't feel like they are telling an interesting story line, that fits into the true west Virginia loure. It kind of feels like a half fast joke. 
---
The balance in the game has only gotten worse as time has gone on.  I am still finding my self getting killed in unfortunate circumstances jurring PVP. 
---
 We can sit here and argue for hours about builds, and what cards I should have, and shouldn't have. The honest truth is that its it's far from balanced. 
---
Fallout first membership, I have no issue with paying for new content through a membership. 
---
Mind you I have also supported this game though thick and thin. I have put my time into this game over the last year.
---
 Now you expect me to support a membership that has nothing to offer me in new content. 
---
In addition you want me to pay for a membership when the original content has been broken and half fasted with no end in sight?
---
 Say what you want, I don't want the option to play on private servers. Sure, I have no problem with you paying for your own private sandbox. That is only far. 
---
 I want to have some of the benefits, I  feel that I deserve for being a dedicated player, that has put up with a lot of bullshit from this game over the last year,  not to mention the hundreds of dollars I have already spent on this broken down golf cart.
---
 Like the endless scrap box, And a few other benefits that all players should receive. 
---
Lastly as member of this community, I want to be treated with dignity and respect. 
---
No more lines of bullshit. Be straight, keep your time lines in order. Test content before release, fix all the glitches. 
---
Stop treating us like donkeys chasing a false carrot. Ask us what we truly want from this game, and don't assume what we want is half fast content, and memberships to benefit a select few, and not the community in whole. 
---
And let's not forget about what are true objectives are from this game, to rebuild Appalachia. Keep the loure of this game in par with previous releases of the fallout   franchise. 
---
And just maybe you will regain the loss of your broken community, and just maybe the majority of us will come back to support Fallout 76 as it was intended from lauch. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best!
---
Questions:   
---
How much weight do you typically carry?  You might have to give up on the qol perks to get a more optimized build.  I tend to be pretty scavvy myself but over time Ive gotten more selective about what I pick up.  With bloodied, radicool, pocketed armor, a backpack and grilled radstag, Im usually good until I can get home to sort/scrap.
---
How many points do you have to respec?
---
How often do you play?
---
No.. but they have to pay their people to add content.
---
Then what’s the atomic shop for? Get rid of one or the other, it’s disgusting that we have both
---
To add, in a nutshell - just run PA, as collecting a full set of good 3\* Uny armor is a pain in the ass. Pick yourself up a good Junkies 50cal, pref with FFR - that's it, you won't need anything else to destroy anything in game, PvE-wise.
---
I'm a simple Hooman, I see Monty Python, I updoot.
---
to check how bethesda manages to fuck it up another time and upset the community again
---
Isn't it my turn to make this kinda post this week?
---
Proof?
---
Just figuring out why those creeps call us that now...
---
So you would rather everyone have to have the subscription and not be able to shop in the Atom shop with the free Atoms.  Seems weird.
---
absolutely disagree, the dead world of the game has gone as far as it can.
---
Yeah good questions. What is their current SPECIAL? Do they use VATS a lot (or want to)? Would kinda dictate what build and perk cards to recommend.
---
I am wondering the same thing, we had two non-legendary Queens today.
---
The private servers seem alot less laggy for me
---
The game has issue itself, but since I grew up in a mostly hillbilly area (Roanoke, VA). This game hits close to home. The weapons, the feel, the music, everything brings me back to where I grew up. I don't care about physics or the story. It makes me homesick.
---
I think they have done a good job with new Content but with new Content comes new bugs and it doesnt seem they move on to new content without properly fixing old content
---
That's only because there are less people with differing ping. As they aren't servers, just separate instances they won't be any different aside from just having less people causing server latency.
---
And Swamp Itch i've gotten from sleeping on a mattress in the wild
---
Just bought a aa expl vats lever for 4k
---
This is awesome
---
It feels like the last update that had proper direction for the game was the one for Lying Lowe, since it added a few new locations, a new enemy, and some "new" (really just variants) items as well.
---
After that, it felt like Bethesda hasn't really been putting much effort into adding content towards the game.  Yes, we have player vending and stuff now, but other than that and a few events, the rest of the year has been immensely boring, and hasn't particularly done much to advance the content of the game.
---
I was hoping for at least a new content addition that would tease/lead into Wastelanders, but it seems like the developers are just fooling around at this point.
---
He is full of rads and in nukezone
---
No absolutely - I do the same thing. If you put up hundreds of resources in a workshop to make a little camp, you should be ready to defend it against other players.
---
You select “Yes” to PvP in the dialogue window. I don’t have sympathy if you lose your junk and workshop. You agreed to that potential outcome...
---
ah!!! This is amazing because this is actually the house of my friend! I'm too shy to make my own post, but I also took a few screenshots with my character, and one with my friend!  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/IHS3vnO](https://imgur.com/a/IHS3vnO)  
---
I can't wait to see my friend reaction for being feature here ha!
---
I like junk. Scrapping, bulking, collecting, selling, and buying junk. Fallout junk hoarding is fun.
---
Fallout is a collectors safe place and therapy for irl hoarders. (Probably)
---
May I suggest a secret? When Two shot weapons were nerfed to not include 100% damage, they purposefully left out Two shot Explosive weapons like the grenade launchers and fatman. If you want something that beats your Bloodied one, get a TS auto loading with good perks. The only issue is it breaks quicker, but that is counteracted by higher damage and insane hits in vats.
---
I horde low level perfect weapons If i can get em cheap in hope that one day we can upgrade or raise the levels of items.
---
People who bought the "Base" game get "Base" services.  Why is it so hard to realise this?  This game is amazing!  Ive enjoyed it more than any other game out there.  Play it kid, dont listen to all of the negative press, play it for yourself.  The servers are full so youll meet a bunch of people
---
&gt;Why ruin the community for people still playing?
---
Because that's what socially/psychologically dysfunctional people do when given an open forum with no prohibitions against griefing. The internet has been a huge boon for them.  I'd bet that the average chronic complainer here has  2 to 3 accounts doing the complaining.
---
It's that way *all* over the internet in *any* forum where the moderators don't care to implement anti-griefing rules.
---
For a *much* better experience try r/fo76FilthyCasuals/ where the mods have basically said "take your griefing elsewhere".  It's a community of people who are just having fun with the game and support each other having that fun.  Try it and don't look back.
---
There's no requirement to own/play the game to be on this subreddit. There's also no rule against (rationally) negative posts either. In fact there's a whole different subreddit for that where the main rule is "no negativity" and "No complaining".
---
This sub (and related subs) is the most consistent place to get news (positive or negative) about this game and Bethesda in general really.
---
EDIT: I'm sure these people definitely have a reason for downvoting completely factual information that's providing no bias for or against the game. It's almost like people hate it when their view is challenged.
---
Ok, thanks for the insight. I was on the european servers as well when i played. Unfortunately i am pleased to hear that.
---
Now with your experience in the modding and datamining departement (and probably many won bets about predicting how Beth would mess up patches) what's your prediction about Wastelanders? Is there a chance for it being as promised or do you even see them being able to deliver something like that at all with their development practises?
---
Well... 
---
It’s in a much more playable state now than when it was at launch. Plus, the new content was cool to experience the first time, and added some new functionality/events (alcohol brewing, Encrypted). The Battle Royale was obviously them cashing in on the trend, but I think they handled it well, and I have fun playing it (RIP PC players though). But the raids were done terribly, we all know why.
---
I’m excited for Wastelanders, but with all of the controversy that has surrounded this game, I don’t think 76 has travelled very far past the starting line.
---
Do. You. Prefer. The. Game. As. It. Was. At. Launch?
---
Mom said it's my turn to post this question.
---
he cheated made a salt post and tried to get a refund after using his atoms
---
he played himself
---
I am running EP on my X-01 with Suppressor and a Suppressor’s Gatling Gun so pretty tanky on top of lowering enemy damage. SQB does almost no damage but certain Legendaries and Mirelurk king/Queen combos have some attack that melts me whether I have shot them or not. 
---
Not my ideal build at all, Just haven’t picked up anything better yet. Hard to be both Bloodied and unstoppable but that Strangler PA could do it.
---
You can check my post history: I dont ussually post here.
---
Yet I have the game, I dont play it but check this sub periodically. 
---
Why? My wife bought this game for me becouse I love FO76. I tried it and thought it was shit, but I believed Bathesda would finish it at some point.
---
So I check from time to time. To see if it is the correct moment for giving it a second run. Not so far (I believe) 
---
I appreciate both fans and criticist becouse they offer a balanced perspective.
---
I do lol
---
That’s alright, I once hit a glitch that had a supply drop spawn everywhere I fast traveled. I’d FT and boom, five seconds later, it’d spawn next to me like a loyal follower. Got my first taste of Wastelanders ahead of its time
---
They hate it but they still may buy it 👌
---
Whatever floats you're boat . But I wouldn't wanna go down on a ghoul
---
With a max of 8 players and no one hopping worlds compared to a regular server with more players and a consistent need of players hopping worlds alone is a huge factor.
---
None. I must be wrong.
---
i don'T hate it i don't play it. i laugh at people that do on this subreddit. this is better than any comedian
---
It is if the ghoul happens to be their cousin.
---
How dare you introduce logic into this chat
---
Full disclosure I’m a fallout 1st member so take this with a gain of salt. I have really been enjoying the private server, it has made my experience way more enjoyable as I’m not into PVP at all for open world games. When I take a workshop I can keep it and farm mats at my pace and just enjoy exploring my own world. I have some friends that hop in with me every now and again it it’s fun when they do. But I just enjoy the alone feeling I get playing solo with no outside interference. That’s just one aspect I understand the more hardcore players are gonna have much more valid things to say that I probably can’t relate to right now.
---
You can easily assess the problem when cheaters and dupers can openly brag about their methods and advertise themselves in onlinemarkets as 'the better efficient' duper without any fear of consequences (because there are none) while people from the community that are trying to help finding and fixing bugs get banned left and right
---
Much smoother for me. Quicker load times as well.
---
I've had the crates respond to grenades before, the actual grenade, not the explosion.
---

Cause their skin is rough and ours is smooth.
---
I'm good my dude - Thanks for caring &lt;3
---
One year later and I think they've finally *gotten into sight of the starting line* and sometime in the next few months they might be able to start the race.
---
That makes sense😂. I remember when i got stuck in that room though. The train station hadn't loaded in fully and o thought"hey look the door is open" and then I got locked in and the trader locked out. So i took his job.
---
After a crash I've lost whatever I was wearing - a complete armor set including under-armor. Contacted support and they said tough luck.
---
Lol I hate when spawn points for other players are in the most inconvenient spots.
---
Tell him the enclave already had the two bobbleheads he sold them. They are not pleased.
---
Why are you downvoting me?
---
No offence, no issue on that, just wondering.
---
It doesnt, unless you have two computers or systems and have two separate games. Right now there is no way in game to transfer anything between your characters. Also if you have friends you trust you can use them. I would never rely on containers or stashes around the map, heard too many stories of crashes and reboots only to have others find your stash and bye bye all of your items....
---
Didn’t say that you were; you made an unsubstantiated claim and I asked for proof
---
Learned plans can't be transferred. In our terms  a pack mule is a person who carriers what they can find, a courier is what you need to transfer physical items that you can equip, eat, or drop. Besides weapons painted, those won't drop, they get destroyed.
---
Thing is, Wastelanders isn't going to bring major changes to how the game *plays*.  If its not compelling enough to play now, its not going to be compelling because the quest dispensers are now shaped like people.
---
Once you go dead, you don't go red.
---
But this forum _does_ have anti-griefing rules. It's just that Negativity/Complaining =/= Griefing.
---
Out of all the comments in this thread (at the time of writing), you are one of three that tries to mock or insult one or more people. Yet yours is the one that's being upvoted.
---
That's a shame. I have so many plans and recipes my new player could do with.
---
**grabs Alabama flavoured popcorn**
---
Not a spawn point. I ran in and then the door loaded in. And it took me a while to get out cause i forgot fast travel existed. So i eventually got someone to kill me.
---
I thin thier bank accounts have gotten much fuller.
---
Find a friend with a private server and use a container there.  Risk involved to be sure, but I’ve had maybe 2-3 “oh crap” scenarios versus hundreds (well over 100) successes.
---
If you were on PS4 I’d invite you to my server.  Maybe try the filthy casual sub for 76, may can find help there as well.
---
They were banned for **verifying the validity of an exploit**  before reporting it. 
---
As in they literally shot the messenger telling them the bad news of a potentially new exploit.
---
Ah gotcha lol
---
Huge difference between criticism and constructive criticism. 
---
What we see the majority of is the first with no intent or suggestions or reasonable ideas to offer to try to improve the game. They just say they’re done, uninstalling it and using language like it’s the end of the world usually in a very disrespectful way. 
---
Constructive would offer solutions based on the whole not individual experience. 
---
Example: Bethesda should separate clothing and armor when you hover over player vendor locations.... this is constructive since many are frustrated going to a camp that says 36 “armor” pieces and it’s all asylum dresses and hates and NOT armor. This would help the overall user experience. 
---
Just criticism; I’m done with this trash, F**k Bethesda and 1st subscribers. All this offers is well... nothing... doesn’t explain anything. 
---
People should offer constructive criticism with solutions that could grow or be incorporated into the game to better the overall user experience... 
---
That’s the problem... not enough of this.
---
Your ugly is showing.
---
Great idea, thank you.
---
Yep we have been asking BGS for a long time now but it does seem like they care to help us out....
---
i think everything will be forgiven and forgotten once Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6 launches. :(
---
I expected to see people sad someone else is leaving, instead y'all are making fun of them. Considering what now constitutes a large % of comments on these threads in this sub I'd say none of toxicity has left even though people are leaving by the droves.
---
interesting, were u on pc?  my experience was on ps4 and that was a while after it came out on computer so i figure we had a lot of those fixes.  i remember the angry joe review when it came out how broken it was, to be fair.
---
add'ly, most recently, its almost unplayable for me as i couldnt transition from area to area w/o crashing, so its not like eso is a perfect game either, haha
---
 I don't think  anyone over 10 years old watch that youtuber
---
'aNy dIsSeNt iS pAiD sHiLl'
---
I use a friend and go to their base after joining their world drop all my stuff I want transferred into a bag. Have your friend interact with the bag then log out join their server and go pick up your stuff simple as that. Work for all items
---
There is... X-01 Military Green OD paint in the bunker, it’s a plan always there.
---
If you have that private world subscription you can drop items in a suitcase and back out/switch characters and your items will still be in the suitcase.
---
This sub used to bring it up but now they've gotten complacent. It's back to defending Bethesda again
---
Hope that they will turn it around.  I guess I should just unsubscribe.
---
&gt;it feels amateur
---
Yeah that's exactly how we can see they've gone and packed their stuff, it's probably only their new amateur studio in Austin that's currently working on it alone, newly acquired by Bethesda before Fallout 76 development should start,had no own game released before Bethesda acquired them and cancelled their current game in development, no experience in Bethesda's spaghetticode of an engine and even tasked with adding never intended functionality.
---
If I was ever to found a studio and hire the cheapest people I can find, throw them infront of some mess of a code with no experience, that's EXACTLY the type of game one could expect to come to fruition from this.
---
I'm not entirely blaming the devs as they might be trying their best but there's only so much you can do to fight a fire when your company only allows you a wet tissue
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Use this tool to give us an idea of what your build looks like. Improving your build may make a ton of difference. If your build isn't optimized you won't be doing much damage and you will be burning through ammo.
---
Are you using power armor?
---
Heavy guns can be viable, bloodied heavy gun builds can be really tanky if you have the right power armor, and do tons of damage per shot so it would save you ammunition. Crafting ammo is part of the loop of playing heavy guns, and I personally enjoy using them.
---
It all depends on what you enjoy, automatic rifles are leagues above semi-auto rifles for damage.  I would suggest making a sneak/vats rifle build if you decide to go the rifle route. 
---
Bloodied rifles rely on stealth and are typically very weak dying in one or two shots, but they have really high agility/sneak and won't be detected by the enemies so they don't get hit. Bloodied commando's are amazingly powerful and do insane damage. They typically only have 1 strength and can't carry much
---
But all of these builds have a little wiggle room and you can add a little utility here and there, if you don't want to min/max completely
---
Yes, censor all the haters! No, to be honest...
---
I was a huge Fallout and Bethesda fan. I looked forward to Fallout 76 the hole summer 18 and i played it for about 150 hours. I had fun despite it's flaws. I can only speak for myself. I'am a still here, because Fallout does still mean something to me even though Bethesda has destroyed it for me. I don't want to ruin anything for the people how still have fun and/or even paying 13 dollars a month.
---
As an information source for Bethesda, this forum should still have a place for all the people who don't like how this game has turned. They should not troll their comments in posts which are a different topic, but there should be also a steady stream of critical posts and discussion. I think it is very important to remind Bethesda that a lot (not all) of people are very unhappy. 
---
I don't have much hope left, but still i have some little hope that Starfield will be a game which is fun and not just a cash grab purely design to monetize the last drop out of it's players. Therefore critial voices matter if Fallout or Elder Scrolls means something to you.
---
They have yet to make progress.
---
100% positive this post will make them remove it... if they’re that much of an a**hole why are you buying it or playing the game?
---
Also a very valid point...
---
I know. It's pathetic. How could they not have any real anti-cheat? 
---
With what we've seen from Beth, my guess is that they sadly wanted to cut down on costs. But this is pretty unacceptable.
---
There has been multiple threads lately about this, I'm sure Bethesda know about it, but it seems they either just don't care or don't know how to find out if someone is cheating.
---
It should be clear if someone is cheating, like nobody can consecutively kill the entire server within 30 seconds of match start unless they are cheating.
---
People have reported people multiple times with footage, who still play and cheat.
---
Sad to say but if you want a fair NW experience, consol has little to no hackers.
---
It was talked about endlessly since NW was released, but since Beth doesn't seem to care - what's the point.
---
They know. Which I think makes it worse.
---
Do they need to interact with the bag?
---
No problems on fallout first I've had my workshops up and running for over 13 hours no lag or blue screens .
---
I always have them do that so I know it stays there in the base
---
Ah that seems easily enough - putting my character through that shit for Atoms seems worth it lol
---
I don’t think people say they think Bethesda pay people to leave supportive comments because they actually think it. They say it because it’s a way of discounting any anecdotal evidence against them. Because they feel insecure about their stance on the matter.   
---
It’s the same reason bandwagons happen, many people have strong opinions and that’s great; but then the boot-lickers and the opinion thieves come along and make a valid and grounded opinion into a sludge of fallacious argument and misguided outrage.
---
&gt; It's just that Negativity/Complaining =/= Griefing.
---
When 60-80% of the front page posts are negativity than , yeah.... it's griefing.  If I'm being upvoted than it's because I'm not the only one who sees the truth here.
---
Also I'm not mocking or insulting *anyone* except obvious griefers - but if the shoe fits, Pal ...
---
I stopped playing since fallout first came out. I’m a level 255 and yeah BGS doesn’t give a shit about the community. Especially after banning the Map76.com guy, in which he helped the community with maps of the locations of in game items and would find exploits and report them to BGS.
---
Huh.  Come to think of it, I've never noticed serendipity proc when in PA.  I THOUGH I've seen my AP go down while taking damage though.  Are you sure about dodgy?  What do you reccomend for those slots? Im thinking more points in adrenaline, 2 more in bloody mess and then Ive got 1 luck left to fill.
---
Remember when Bethesda was semi respectable?
---
But that should be the bare minimum for a AAA, $60 game with microtransactions.
---
are synths born?
---
Rough like sandpaper
---
Smooth like silk
---
Is there a limit to how much you can leave in a bag in one hit?
---
they were found using cheat programs ...yes they were not using them to cheat they were just using them to find the bugs but the anticheat system doesn't have anyway of knowing that and they are sure as heck not just gonna take someones word for it
---
[protectron] Why are Gutsies so angry all of the time?
---
Cause they're not very *Handy*.  Ba dum tss. 
---
[Gutsy] I'm starting to get angry. YOU WOULDN'T LIKE ME WHEN I'M ANGRY!
---
You realize Bethesda doesn’t care about the community anymore, right?
---
Even though they have made lot of fixes, I have lost my respect for the company. It is still glitchy anyways, and what they've done with the microtransactions is absolutely disgusting.
---
Is that a quote? That sounds like a quote.
---
Bethesda already has your money I really don't think they care about the hackers
---
No limit just remember your mule can only carry so much weight as well as stash so much
---
Yeah I'm sure that one guy running an explosive weapon build significantly reducing the groups TTK is proud of him self. Or being useless in solo.
---
I'm fortunate I have yet to see anyone use such weapons since last year, since it's a waste of space.
---
There aren't many good builds in this game, everyone is PA Heavy Auto or Commando Sneak. That's just a fact, they plan on fixing it in the big patch which sadly keeps getting delayed.  The only way the overnerfed shotguns are halfway decent is with Strangler PA but that crashes PCs....
---
Oh console def has hackers still, a lot less than PC like I can get a few games in before something pops up but its still a problem
---
Look, all I am saying is that we support them by buying a subscription. Can we agree that content isn't made freely by employees. Like they just come to work and go don't pay me today but I'll add some new wastlanders content.
---
Plenty mmorpgs charge a monthly subscription. I don't see how this is any different. They do need to fix bugs forstmost and foremost. But I do enjoy they small things here and there.
---
IMO Power Armor in PvE is good for heavy weapons or if you want to melee aggressively without having to worry about the situation. Just facetank whatever whenever. 
---
Bloodied in PA is massively eclipsed by non-PA builds. Just go junkies.
---
I have had sent a ticket to Bethesda multiple times and u/Ladydevann says the team is aware.
---
Holy Cow, we were promised "all future content and features free". We were lied upon, speaking of "Base" game is revisionist.
---
Way to go Switzerland.
---
Probably idk lol also hi Raptor :P
---
That's not the point. Fallout 1st "fixes" many annoyances with the game. For real world money. 
---
Creating hindrances to compel people to buy the fixes is lame.
---
Nah I'm on Xbox man
---
Free speech, if mods want to put up a sticky that says only ass licking of Bethesda is allowed on the forum I will leave. But if I am wasting time online and want to throw a few negative comments on here that is what I am going to do, especially because Bethesda is laughably bad now.
---
This game has been a huge disappointment and I am worried if they think all is rosy they will be even worse for future games which is sad since they have been my favorite company for years until FO76.
---
&gt;Ruin the community for those still playing.
---
You guys are ruining the entire gaming community for everyone by continuing to support the practices and behaviors of Bethesda. The entire industry was holding their breath and watching to see the results, and all of you guys just have the green light for companies to exercise the same shitty, money grabbing practices.
---
You guys are receiving utterly sub-standard services and are lapping it up, and consequently we are going to see other game companies following suit.
---
All of you are so short-sighted in the name of convenience but there are still people willing to try to get you to see where all of you are messing up.
---
I like to watch new video games develop, and I've literally never seen an actual witch hunt where a large portion of the population rise up and target others for buying a subscription to the game being played, there is a reason why I haven't seen it, and there is most definitely a reason why it's happening now.
---
Wonder how much obsidian or Electronic arts  is paying you guys.
---
it comes up every single day.. multiple times per day...
---
He works directly with the community managers &amp; helped close a MAJOR security flaw (Login Info sent over the internet as Plain text), he was caught in an autoban &amp; it took Bethesda 2 weeks to fix it.
---
Constructive criticism, Bethesda should stop robbing and pillaging their customers and focus on making good and enjoyable games. Then they will sell millions of units and DLC and make money like they used to, instead they are joining the AAA Legion of monetizing games into obivion (not the Mehrunes Dagon kind).
---
Telling half the story makes it easy to dismiss it as Bethesda being right and people trying to just get karma from those that don’t bother to dig into the story.  There’s more to it than “reporting bugs”.  Lead with the whole story and this becomes more credible, but since NOBODY on the anti-Bethesda side of this incident does that, it shows that what really occurred is pretty damning.  You’re not doing the banned people any favors with this post.
---
It’s like finding a trump bashing story that is actually not true.  You have to sit back and wonder “with all the true shit out there, what kind of loser has to make shit up and shade the truth.”
---
Will do! When she is not doing some... ghoul experimentation.
---
I love the cha-ching sound when something is sold.
---
Except this isn't the official forums, it's a player community.
---
But it still begs the question - why bother?
---
Lol hi😂
---
I bought the game and I did not buy the subscription, so I am going to keep posting salty comments until I reach my sixty dollar value. I would say the game gave me about 30 worth of play so it may be a while.
---
I wasn't aware of that sub, thanks for the link.
---
The children of atom has entered the chat
---
I think you can get it at whitespring station.
---
Your dismissal doesn't invalidate the playstyle, it just outlines your ability to think creatively. "That's just a fact" to you, but have fun playing your dps murderhobo
---
If you’re on PC it gets brought up all the time.  PS4 or xbone, not so much.
---
It will kill the game mode. Beth people don't seem to be worried about it.
---
Lol ahahhahhhahahahha
---
Staying subscribed because you are looking for information is perfectly valid.  I'm more talking about the people that literally just post negative stuff and have no intention of playing the game.
---
They don't care
---
No hackers but 20 fps
---
I find it odd how you can state anything you said as fact.
---
You have no clue if anyone hasn't played the game, their hours played or if they're solo or not.
---
Plus it shouldn't matter, that's just cherry picking whos feedback that matters
---
Yet your comment is heavily upvoted.
---
THAT behavior on here generates alot of hate
---
That's not happening at all. Most people including youtubers have bought the subscription. You only have to play the game to see it.
---
&gt; Just criticism; I’m done with this trash, F**k Bethesda and 1st subscribers. All this offers is well... nothing... doesn’t explain anything.
---
Exactly.  It's shitposting, essentially.
---
That’s criticism based on personal opinion rather than the community as a whole. Since what seems like the majority have the subscription (even for a month). 
---
Bethesda isn’t a non profit organization, it’s a for profit business so why would anyone expect them not to be profitable and grow? 
---
Growing also means more people could get hired and more services overall especially if they want to expand which most business want. 
---
Keep in mind the subscription isn’t required or honestly needed to play the game and complete all quests. 
---
Most games have some type of monetizing factor, even the YouTubers who criticize it are monetizing their videos... now that’s irony.
---
Bethesda or Reddit? Cause either if not both is true XD 
---
It's just a crazy idea I had and I wanted to share.
---
the bigger they are the harder they fall.
---
Revisions are not allowed?  Things change daily broheem.  Someone also said "If you like youre healthcare, you can keep your healthcare...period!"  Howd that work out?
---
Man i like your idea and respect you but bethesda are fucking hacks and they really don't care about this cool idea of yours
---
There was no reason to verify it by trying it out.  You just report the exploit.
---
Right... I read and even vote up ones that offer suggestions that would work even if I don’t agree with them since many would like it. 
---
Trashing the game or players especially offers nothing...
---
What anti cheat system, lol? Same one that prevented several hundred duping waves? Or the one that cleaned cheaters from NW? Don't be ridiculous.
---
They demonstrated exploits then reported them.
---
That behaviour is bannable.
---
And they spent the atoms fallout 1st gives then asked for a refund which is simply asinine.
---
Stop karma whoring.
---
Yeah you got me there, the fps is embarrassing for a AAA 2018 game.
---
As much as the game hasn't quite reached and grasped our high expectations, I still think they made it pretty far, just in a different direction. But, the majority of the setbacks are in one of two things, their bad decision making or their limitations not being overcome. I hope it gets better.
---
Sounds like you are on the ps4? I'm on the pro and experience  at least 1 or 2 blues screens every game session as well as menu freezing on the public servers. so you believe it has bettered your game experience I'm not talking about stash or tent just straight up gaming with less bugs?
---
Does this unit have a soul?
---
Time to unsub
---
Bethesda is banning players who use cheat engines. There I fixed it. Fucking hive mind apes
---
The one that whacked that guys account when he used a third party program
---
I appreciate it man, I definitely do. But yeah as of late Bethesda has been in a bad light. Again, just wanted to share. Could be one of those things that picks up traction. As long as they don't make it something like the fridge. "Get the enclave bench! Now repairs items up to 300%!" Only 700 atoms.
---
My pleasure - it's a breath of fresh air away from the complainers.  You'll find a vibrant and active community just sharing their goofy fun of the game.
---
Unsub bro
---
Because if it doesn't happen to one person on reddit that makes it uncommon.
---
By the same token i can say the game is very stable and big free because i never crash.....
---
Lol ahahahahahah then it is managments job to hire people who can work better with unknown tools and fire your sorry ass 🌝 learn to do you your job better you guys are a fucking disgrace 😸
---
I am on Netflix watching that movie where Samuel Jackson and the Owl from Watchmen are neighbours. 
---
You just wait for me.
---
Hello, Patchcord Adams.
---
The game released broken and incomplete, can have some sympathy for the server stability issues (they really screwed up their inventory code and it shows, I vould regularly crash the game based on my inventory count).
---
To make the game playable I started making character than ran light, craft or sell everything and move onto the next map point with low amount of items so the game would not crash in the middle of action. Them the game got so buggy I stopped playing for a few months (did not help that trade interface was garbage and it was still months before vendors came on the scene).
---
I have not played in ages, from what I read it was barely worth my time. Then Fallout 1st dropped a deuce on the game and I am bailing. As long as I have hard rrivr space it will stick around, maybe wastelanders will redeem the game, but I am doubtful.
---
Have you tried paying 14.99 p/m?
---
Exploiters, not hackers.
---
No console has been hacked while being up to date and online.
---
Memory manipulation like on pc doesn't exist
---
Indirectly by using a private world
---
Large amounts of negativity is not griefing. Even _100%_ of negativity wouldn't be griefing.
---
As far as this subreddit's rules and Rediquette is concerned, if it's not targeted attacks, racism/sexism, or hate speech, it is allowed whether you personally agree with what they're saying or not.
---
&gt; If I'm being upvoted than it's because I'm not the only one who sees the truth here.
---
That just means more than one person are judging based on their personal opinion towards the game. That's not exactly a good thing or the "truth."
---
&gt; Also I'm not mocking or insulting anyone **except obvious griefers**
---
So you're mocking and insulting people based on their opinion (and your definition of ~~complaining~~ being a "griefer"). If the mods cared as much as you want them to, that means your comment should be deleted for the same reason.
---
They made more money with a single player game then all the nonsene of fo76 put together. So for their owners i suggest go back to what they are good at.
---
ESO was a shit show.  The quests were boring AF.  A lot of them you could not finish. The regions were all level locked by difficulty, so you were shoe horned into staying in an area until you leveled up. The Guild Quests were shit. I left about 8 months out of pure boredom and frustration at the lack of communication and content.
---
There wasn't really much of a crafting system or really anything to do at all. When I say shit show, I mean grade A, makes 76 look good, shit show.
---
EDIT:  I went back 2 years later and things vastly improved, played for about 6 months, quit, played other game,s came back again. Like any MMO, you tend to consume the new DLC and then move on again, so that was my pattern.  ESO today is a really well made, meaty experience. 
---
But launch ( PC ) - consoles didn't launch till over a year later, was a disaster.
---
Does the game experience less bugs
---
^ 100% success using this method
---
It's a little better but I still disconnect once a day on average. (PC with a 1080ti, 32gb if ram, i7700k, no mods and no Reshade, pure vanilla.)
---
Na.
---
Lol no
---
I'm shocked this logic is so prevalent here. 
---
The basis of it is fucking scary. 
---
Imagine if China thought this way. Oh wait, they do.
---
Should be about 1200 caps as well
---
Dont think you can sell it can you?
---
If you can find a way to sell it, you’ll be quite rich!
---
Yes there is, why flood Bethesda with false reports if it's possible to potentially verify it? They are removing a step and saving them time and they banned them for it.
---
Not to mention reporting a bug or exploit without it actually happening to you is silly. "My friend experienced a bug so I'm reporting it even though I dont know if it's actually a bug or my friend misinterpreting something going on."
---
That's because it's exceedingly rare on consoles. It's significantly easier to use aimbots and cheat engines on PC.  Even if we see something that looks fishy on console, it pales in comparison to the rampant and blatant cheating that occurs on PC
---
Doing the same kind of cheats on console could well get your entire PSN or XB profile nuked for breaking TOS.
---
They still have a ways to go. Its gotten better. They just need to be better with communication with the community.
---
Hancock is the reason, hottest ghoul around, next to Charon.
---
Not a damn thing cause you can't sell it. All of the NW rewards are flagged as Atom Shop items meaning they're account bound.
---
Thanks a lot guys !
---
\- I'd like to use VATS, I really never used it.
---
\- I tend to have between 160 and 240 of weight in my inventory
---
\-&gt; Here's my stats for now :  [https://imgur.com/a/9IwpGq3](https://imgur.com/a/9IwpGq3) 
---
I'm looking for a cool rifleman (semi auto) build since i've got like doubleshot handmade, explosive rifle or things like that (these legendaries are not very well optimized but are the best I can have for now !)
---
I think they tripped over their shoe laces at the sound of the gun. Then got up, removed their shoes, and started to run the race backwards.
---
Then chill on the hate. It’s just a game.
---
Dodgy does work in power armor, serendipity doesn't. I max out adrenaline on all my builds and bloody mess is a must have for everyone.
---
This flawed argument that Fallout 76 is some kind of massive assault on gaming is geting stale quick. Sounds like a branch off of that gamergate debacle by this point. 'wE mUsT rAllY tO dEfEnD gAmInG'. Plenty of other games out there use microtranscations similar to the Atom Shop to support continued development and plenty more still have subscription systems. Which isn't even getting into the existence of MMO's which a good number of Console titles, Fallout 76 included, are slowly inching towards some form of MMO-lite, as one way to put it.
---
Random tent spawns is correct.  Something to note however is there are two places lowbie accessible where the random spawns happen regularly.  Just past the Overseer's Camp on the road to Flatwoods is a pickup truck.  Just past the pickup truck, off the road is a small clearing.  That clearing is one random spawn site.  The second is east of the Overseer's Camp, not too far from the Slocum's Joe.  There's is a house with a weapon workbench by the garage, and a safe in the house.  The drive way has a consistent random spawn.  I server hopped for quite some time farming the Trapper Armor plans.  Generally it's a Tent surrounded by Ghouls.  Sometimes it's on fire.  Sometimes it isn't.  Pro Tip:  If you find a bomb, pick a wire to cut and run like hell because it's almost bound to explode...
---
There are other maps
---
I'm also on the pro .. the public servers lock up every so often but on private everything runs smoothly . I think Bethesda are doing this on purpose to move people to private by throttling pubic servers
---
Exactly 0 caps.
---
It happened, it reported the day the subs came out that people were being targeted.
---
Didn't this guy have half a dozen accounts anyways?  Or is that a different one I'm thinking of.
---
&gt; Large amounts of negativity is not griefing. Even 100% of negativity wouldn't be griefing.
---
Yahhh... no
---
&gt;So you're mocking and insulting people based on their opinion 
---
And you are putting words in my mouth and ascribing unproven motivations to me ... which come to think of it makes that shoe fit pretty well, Pal.
---
Go have your last inevitable word - not responding again [to this ploy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning).
---
Save the Strawman for the C.A.M.P. Garden
---
Hey thanks bud'
---
I'm totally tired of being a heavy, last year my first character had this build, I did the same build on my new character because \*reasons\* (idk why) and now i'm just tired as hell x)
---
Automatics make more damages than semi auto ? I've always witnessed the opposite :c
---
And yeh i'm more of a scavenger (I provide for friends, my GF, try to help new players by giving them cool weapons of their lvls etc ...) My stash is also always full but i'm working on it :D
---
Also about the stash I try to sell interesting 3\* legendary weapons but got no answers so they are hidden in my stash until next sale I guess
---
Since this never happened to me and I have no idea why, I can only suggest switching the view of your pip-boy and try to see if it persists.
---
The computer for the queen of the hunt daily in the more for killing a cryptid? Why would I need to go to VTU?
---
Bruh my bad I'm so dumb forgot that this was necessary now
---
Oh and also sorry, I forgot to mention that I would like to play without PA !
---
And I already have a lot of 556 and 45 etc \^\^
---
Pull up r/fo76FilthyCasuals They have a Discord where i'm sure you could find people to link up with. Barring that, You could always try making contact with other players your level around the world
---
Many players love the single player like Fallout 4 for example but wanted that experience with friends... boom... FO76. However certain instances refined that to the subscription so now they can really happen. 
---
That move was successful as was ESO PLUS subscription so why would they go back?
---
Only thing I could see I’d a modified version of adventure with 0 PvP, player vending without any other players to include friends do a true single player but technically they have that with the 1st.
---
And even IF someone did manage it, Sony or Microsoft would shut that shit down almost immediately then issue a patch to prevent it. It has far too wide of implications for their entire network.
---
Yeah, I had the same issue. I filed a few bug reports with the CMs, so its on their list. I hope it gets fixed in Patch 15.
---
0 since it can’t be transferred. Atomic shop 1600 atoms but highly doubtful it will ever be there.
---
Depending on the interest of players, I think Bethesda will charge around 700-1000 atoms, if It does appear on the Atomic shop.
---
That's the worst comparison I have ever come across.... Your comparison is bad and you should feel bad..
---
Exactly this! They always seem to leave out key details ...
---
&gt; Yahhh... no
---
According to the definition of "griefing", yes. Negativity is not synonymous with griefing.
---
If you have your own definition, you'd have to tell me because I wouldn't know, and I wouldn't agree with it anyway.
---
&gt; And you are putting words in my mouth and ascribing unproven motivations to me
---
===
---
&gt;&gt;I'd bet that the average chronic complainer here has 2 to 3 accounts doing the complaining.
---
&gt;&gt; it's a breath of fresh air away from the complainers. 
---
What is it if not judging people based on their opinions? This is without you using the word "griefing."
---
Unless you're going to tell me complaining is also griefing.
---
&gt; ...which come to think of it makes that shoe fit pretty well, Pal. Go have your last inevitable word - not responding again to this ploy.
---
Insulting me based on "unproven motivations" and then running away. For some reason I'm not surprised.
---
EDIT: If you're going to edit your comment after you said you're done to try and imply I'm harassing you, I might as well do the same. Your link falls apart because I didn't initially ask you a question, nor did I ask you for evidence.
---
Negativity/Complaining =/= Griefing.
---
As it applies I'll throw this here. After your comment above I had to add the following to a few posts on the official boards.
---
 I've written at length on how the scrap box changes FO76 due to the  "survival" type game play &amp; mechanics at FO76's core. I'll continue  to speak our specifically against the scrap box as sub locked due to my  belief some utility is to much to lock to RMT. However once the 1st sub  is offered for a week free to all for the 1st time I won't post anywhere  on the subject again. 
---
I'll go ahead and say it now before anyone asks after the fact.
---
Yes I'm happy now that the scrap box is EFFECTIVELY free to all. It is still imo  game changing utility but at least equally applied.
---
Placing this post in a few threads it applies.
---
I just tested dodgy, can confirm.  Snagged 2 more points in bloody mess, and Ill work on adrenaline but need some more lvls, as ive been kind of frivolously spending points on grenade perks for no good reason.  Thanks for the input.
---
Yeah it's a rare item so you won't find it in player vendors. But they are traded on the market sub.
---
But do NOT just drop the items. There's a chance the bag can despawn. Had this happen twice to a friend who tried to do it.  The first time he got lucky and someone else in the server with him was still able to see what was in it even though he couldn't after coming back in. The second he was alone and the items were just gone. I loaded in to help but the bag didn't even appear for me.
---
You tried the best, now try the rest.
---
You guys really love to cherry pick information. Sure other games have in game shops and subscription services.
---
But those games offer much much better services for the costs that are presented, while you guys are stuck with giving content suggestions and it being sold back to you guys.
---
 Broken promises, broken content, and even though you guys have had a mass exodus of players the level of toxicity in these threads is still the same. I dont even see the same level of salt and language used in this sub than I have in the almost 10 years I've been playing league of legends.
---
PC players have to deal with rampant cheating because Bethesda was too cheap to use an up to date engine, have to suffer through match after match of doing nothing in NW to get rewards because every match is filled with hackers. 
---
But that doesn't matter because **you** got your free atoms and cool ranger armor right?
---
Its more stable due to less ppl on the server.
---
Same game code wise
---
Always use the suitcase
---
We both have mics. We both also have keyboards. What--are you 2018 Blizzcon?
---
That really only applies to melee. Gun builds don't get much benefit from unyielding other than the crit bar filling faster.
---
Yes it happened to a few people but now  you can see subscribers everywhere.
---
They say its fixed and i haven't lost anything
---
Forever wondering when people will stop spreading lies and misinformation
---
Thank you!
---
“Hey guys I figured out how to rob a bank and I was able to steal $100k!”
---
*Gets arrested*
---
“THE INJUSTICE!!”
---
You're not wrong. 
---
I maintain, however, that allowing for players to rebuild, and the requisite systems for this (as opposed to stupid bullshit) would breathe life into it for the first time.
---
I really enjoy this game, but the bugs ie blue screen crashes freezing in menu, sound bugs, to name a few have a major impact on my enjoyment of the game. This is not negative criticism  and I have no ability to offer solution's to these bugs I'm not a coder . These issues are fundamental too me, these go right to the heart of a properly functioning game. Is it too much to ask that a game be in reasonable playing state. Many people just say well that's Bethesda and we cant or shouldn't hold them to a reasonable standard and my response to that is why not? It;s simply not good enough to have bugs still present that have been around since the game began, I like the game and will continue to play but I will not stop pointing out that functionally it is an inferior game. Many people have become frustrated with these issues and express that frustration in a way you may find difficult to accept but are simply their feelings/opinions. I accept your view point to a degree and you should always be welcome to share it.
---
Well, to be fair, Nuclear Winter is still considered Beta regardless of its popularity or how long it's been out. They're still trying to tweak it. 
---
What they need to do is collaborate with some other studio on how to fix the issue. Surely Zenimax has someone under their umbrella of companies that could help there.
---
I’d watch the whole set - over and over again 😂
---
Prime it. Creating ultra 308 is dirt cheap.
---
Unfortunately no not forget but see the writing on the wall perhaps.
---
I'm not 100% on the following having not played ESO someone else can correct for errors if so.
---
At the first point in time ESO started selling "Chapters" subs had already been a thing for like 2 years with "Free access to all DLC". Someone please do correct if wrong. 
---
That means ESO Plus members were effectively under the same "promise" we see shared here for FO76 yet still new RMT locked content even subs have to buy was introduced.
---
Semantics arguments imo but Chapter/DLC/Update is all the same thing to me damnation.
---
It's still a community Bethesda pays attention to, which means that it's still a vaild place to air grievances.
---
Nice to see Stevie Wonder on Reddit.
---
Real answer? Schadenfreude.  
---
The game has been such a mess for so long, to see it continue to spiral down in flames is fun.
---
The issue is that there is no anti-cheat. Likely because they didn't want to spend the money.
---
Each one of the people banned has at some point eaten bread in their life.  Please don't eat bread.  Bethesda will ban you.
---
Security researchers do this all the time and it's perfectly normal. If you discover a bug or exploit you document it, how it works, and how to replicate then you send it to the developers. Companies that want to get hacked act the way Bethesda did by punishing those who do this. I hope you don't have any credit card info stored with them.
---
If your using guns that can be suppressed, getting covert operative and using sneak attacks can increase your damage a good bit
---
If he was alive
---
Yes. *crying*
---
ah of course they are....so you recommend it then for smoother game play
---
Bethesda *Pleeeezzzzz!!!!*
---
About an a football field backwards
---
U can use It on a alternate account on pc
---
Yeah, most high levels have a mule so storage isn't even a thing. I haven't bought the sub, but was thinking about it. Not really needed for us.
---
But but Bethesda promised everything for free!  Blah blah hate blah blah glitches blah blah FO1st blah blah.  Every damn negative post.  Go play Outer Worlds if this game is so bad.  I myself love FO76, and will continue to but atoms and subscribe.  Ugh, im hungover
---
We don't know what kind of anti-cheat systems are in place. What we do know is that bans are not effective. A banned player can simply create a new account and play on the same machine with the same hacks installed. 
---
They need to implement a system that blocks prolific cheaters by machine, not by username.  If they see the same cheats occurring on multiple accounts from the same computer, block that computer from ever connecting regardless of the username that attempts to sign on. 
---
Even on console I've met countless people who have been banned and have banned characters yet still play. They just created new accounts and play on the same console. Get multiple bans?  Block that individual console from ever being able to sign in.
---
Actually this idea (along with the suggestions in the comments) is utterly hilarious and I hope someone at Bethesda runs it up a flagpole. They could use guest comic voices for some of the Protectrons and jokes.  I'm thinking it would be a great April 1st event.
---
Hell, they could even make it a Fallout 1st only special event.   I bet a *lot* of people would pay twelve bucks to hear Protectron-Mulaney do a one minute set at Biv's
---
It's a great game and like you I really enjoy it but at level 168 I find little to do other than farm legendarys etc. The persistent bug also have a tendency to impact game enjoyment for me, some have been around since day one and it seems bethesda has no interest in fixing them, Enjoy your time in the wasteland.....be careful out there
---
Yeah for smoother gameplay yeah . Still having a unlimited scrap box and the survival tent also makes the game alot easier . Remember to save those atoms up ...
---
well I kept my healthcare because I liked it
---
Mmm... just thinking about all their skin de-gloving as you pound that shredded roast beef.
---
You are picking apart my choice of words. Bethseda is a game developing company. I obviously wasn’t referring to the coders.
---
Is there a way to report people?  On Xbox I've seen obvious signs of two teams working together...
---
I've mixed up with the other one - evasive, I think? My bad.
---
Thank you for not lying, I wasn't sure until I read ngl
---
Love the lore and setting. Dislike the server instability and bugs.
---
-5" Bethesda cant fix their games that are 10 years old, let alone "finish" them
---
Reading the replies here, this game deserves it's playerbase.
---
I have heard reports that players are being grouped in servers with players who share similar connection pings.  
---
I am a PST (west coast) player.  While my friends list allows me to join EU players, I find the odds of being randomly paired with those friends is extremely remote.  
---
Yes, you can server hop.  I find the servers I hop to are frequently redundant.  Meaning, I leave the server I was on, but pay attention to those who were online with me.  Roughly 1:3 odds of being rejoined to a server I was already on.  I will frequently join my friends and hop servers in that fashion due to the above findings.
---
Oh I get the dead scorchies all the time lol.  First time it happened it freaked me out.  Then they just kept falling every time I fast traveled...
---
*liked.....ha!
---
Its is funny when you see the people that ask for refunds wonder why they cant play the game anymore, its almost as bad as the people theat write poor reviews for F/OUT 76 and say they will never play it again, log a support ticket the next day with Bethedsa lol
---
Don't test it yourself before reporting it
---
Most enjoyment I got from 76 is free 75gig on my ssd after uninstalling it.
---
if its that upsetting surely stop playing?
---
I've certainly have had matches with hackers but its not most of them.
---
I play for the community/friends I have made.  I continue to enjoy the game.  If you decide to play, bring an open mind.  I think most people who try it will be pleasantly surprised how much fun they have.  
---
It is buggy.  Doesn’t change it is fun.
---
Like tears in the rain
---
If there's an Insult Bot roaming Appalachia, then there has to be a community of them somewhere
---
I guess it's the same sort of argument as Skyrim without mods right? Buggy and repetitive, but fun to just run around and play in?
---
im watching my favorite franchise burn to a pile of ashes from the front row ;)
---
It looks fitting with the environment (although it is missing the name), but i wonder: how have you built all that with this skimpy budget? No exaggeration, i have only two water pumps at my camp, no plants at all, no turrets or traps, and i still can't build more than one vendor, leave alone the option of powering them up.
---
*Skyrim without mods is still a complete game with quests at least*
---
I think the story stook for a couple hundred years:
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/zvlGlLl](https://imgur.com/gallery/zvlGlLl)
---
And there it is.
---
At this point, there's really no discussion. 
---
I'm out.
---
They are so far from the starting line it's a dot in the distance, it's just too bad they went in reverse and still haven't managed to get this game ready for release.
---
Watoga probably. 
---
Hey!  This event could be held in the Watoga Municipal Center!  Spacious room, tons of bots wandering the town, mortal peril for most visitors. A fun time for all.
---
Ever watch someone try to play QWOP for the first time?  That's about where Bethesda is.
---
First 50 hours are cool with exploration and stuff, then it gets stale, and recently these last months bethesda has been acting real fucking annoying so i might hold on to that purchase if i were you
---
Ah yees, the infallible "fun with friends" or "you haven't played enough".
---
It’s really not that bad, FYI the garden is not part of my budget, as that was pre-existing in that area.
---
" I’ve been following this fiasco from the beginning. "
---
Why don't you try it instead of being a tool. That's the saddest part of this voyeur generation, some of you are led like sheep. You think we'd be playing this game if it was even half as bad as you say? I think EA is one of those companies that's led like amazon (destroying C&amp;C and the buy up of Westwood).
---
Put food on your favorites wheel and eat and drink that way. They'll probably never fix it, but it's gotten to the point where I have a cannibal character that just drinks from streams
---
Well the bugs certainly make it less fun.
---
Hmm. With the exception of NIRA from FO4, there aren't any Protectron class bots with personality modules that include an alternate voice AFAIK. Then again, when did lore consistency matter in FO76.  
---
Regardless, having actual comics do the voices would be cool. Bethesda used to be able to pull in some big names to do voiceover work. Do they still have that kind of clout?
---
Skyrim has better questlines. And any game is more fun with friends. 
---
I'll say this. I play the game. I don't know if I truly enjoy it.   A lot of it is pretty frustrating. But it fits my addictive-ish playstyle. The monetization is the worst Bethesda has ever done by a large margin. I'd say, if you're a Fallout fan, play through the main quest. But don't spend more than $20 on this game.
---
Don't matter if it's complete if you can get a game breaking bug that doesn't let you progress in 10 minutes tho lol. I remember when I got it on Xbox is 2011 I had to restart my saves 3 times before I just got into the habit of having 900 save files lol.
---
I could only imagine walking into Watoga only for a bunch of Protectrons in Greaser jackets to start insulting me.
---
 What does my Charisma have to be for the "No u" speech check to pass?
---
Bro we laugh in the end. I never was a fan to begin with but I've had a good heartly laugh at what bEAthesda did to bend these mindless pieces of bread over. 
---
I admit I'm bad at fps but this is as good as artifact and anthem ppl downvoted me too but those games are #1 now arent they hahahahaha
---
You need to add “genuinely curious” to post topic.  That seems to be all the rage here.
---
Reminds me of the amount of times I've left mounted owlets in people's camps to freak them out. Even once maxed out a workshop's budget with them in very annoying places because I knew a guy would try to steal the place from me. He thought he could pop down some turrets and realized the budget was maxed.
---
I actually had three accounts, oh boy, dis' gonna be fun!
---
I think you were unlucky, Skyrim was never broken like that for me or, I’m fairly certain, in the court of public opinion either
---
Except in the early days when we used to have the stretched out enemies that occasionally was fun.
---
Even better, a Sentry Bot bouncer.
---
This exactly. Bring in x amount of an item to get certain unique ammo types of your choosing. Same with chems or even foods. It would get people out and exploring and it would allow certain junk items to really gain value to be farmed and sold.
---
No worries man.
---
I think half the people who cry, whine, and complain can't even rub two shekels together to even buy the game.   They just need something to complain about online because their lives are void of love and positivity.
---
Try out world of Warcraft instead I switched to that and enjoy it way more.
---
Who’s upset?
---
Now that would add to the entertainment. Have some (1 in 5 maybe?) spawn as a Comeditron, painted to look like they're in casual wear, "attacking" anyone who comes in range. 
---
If you kill the bot, it'll have a ticket in its inventory that will mark a misc quest to investigate the municipal center, where you'll find out more info about the event. Perhaps have it happen at night time (in game).
---
To start, Frankly, I barely use the Atoms I have. I only dip into that when an Item is relevant (combat gear backpack(pre1st), armored skull gas mask(pre1st), scrapbot) the Ranger armor is pretty secondary to my interests for private server access, scrap storage, and the utility of the tent.
---
If you really want to suggest i'm cherry picking, let's go deeper. Minecraft Realms, Players get a server to play with with friends, they don't get anything else. Ark Survival Evolved, 10.00 a month for a server. DayZ also appears to have a private server system established now. Ark gained it's private servers well before 76, so why wasn't there a massive outcry against the paid servers for that game? or is it because it's not stylish to hate on Ark large scale. When that game is plagued by Hackers and exploiters on a scale that makes 76 looks like childs play. 76 sure doesn't have armies worth of players spending literally all their time duping up a warmachine.
---
CAMPs are about to be expanded in the Private servers. Of interesting feature note i've seen, is that players have found that Private servers can be used to safely trade gear across alts, as long as they rejoin within 5 minutes and they'll be put back into the very same server. No such benefit for typical play. For the people who actively buy Atoms, the sub is a significantly cheaper source for them over time than the typical Atom purchases.
---
I know for a fact that you don't have any hard data to back up a claim that the player base has dropped. If your basis is on the 'this game bad i leave' posts, those are a cookiecutters dime a dozen lately. Frankly I suspect only a quarter of them were actual players
---
As for toxicity, are you really surprised? This Sub gets brigaded on the daily, to the point that a sizable chunk of this community migrated to another sub entirely. When people are spreading falsehoods like 'inventory theft trade glitch' and the brand spanking new 'guy who used cheat engine on an account shouldn't have been banned' narrative, people are going to get testy quick. Now add on the brigaders accusing anyone and everyone of being Betheda employees if they don't conform to the 'bethesdabad narrative'
---
As for whatever is going on in NW on the PC side, no one knows just what Bethesda is doing there. It's readily apparent that the local community managers are under orders to not discuss it. For all we know their staff is stretched thin on that issue and addressing it is taking time.
---
When they announced FO76 I was super excited but also expected it to have a solo version, kinda like offline play. To this day I still think it would have been much better off if it had that option. I think this would be a great way to get the community happy again (well maybe not happy, but a satisfied change). Of course I think that option is now dead with FO1st, maybe they’ll come up with something but I can only hope.
---
I think there was also a patch I couldn't download so that might have been part of it lol.
---
You are right though, it's unfair to charge for something that's not a full game, which is part of why I'm curious. Like is it that it combines aspects in a way people can't get elsewhere? 
---
Like basebuilding and mmolites? Its it the lore?
---
I have a Scrapbox in camp and i've never seen any reactions to it when people pop through to hit up my vendors. I don't have the Ranger Gear on, so i'm a little more lowkey out in the world. Unless it's a 'one of us' moment where i'll click on one of the emotes
---
I've suggested such an idea a while back. The DJ could be a pre-war ghoul, perhaps a veteran or just a former resident of the area who would spend some time reminiscing about the pre-war days, talking about what it was like in the first couple years, the hardships he faced, what it is like being a ghoul, and perhaps even some "guests" on the show. The guests could be like an interview with Rose, Grahm, Biv, a staticky broadcast from another state discussing how they are faring, and maybe a rare one from the Overseer with the comment from the DJ saying "You look more worse for wear than I do", perhaps alluding to her being in a ghoulified or scarred state.
---
great POST.. I love the Q&amp;A section.. classic..
---
Please be free for fo1st players.  This would create a massive donkey show.
---
Punching is par the course in the lobby. No different from using one of the paid emotes in TF2 in the Blu Spawn pre-match
---
You don’t align with F1st’ers blind fanaticism.
---
Got me maybe 25 times for the first, now i have 5 spare ones.I decided to modify my build to be able to solo the event and now im kinda addiced to it ;)
---
Multiplayer, Fallout-style basebuilding I’d reckon. Before the game released, me and a group of friends were gonna form a forest ranger faction that had managed to survive on the surface since the bombs fell and clean up the wastes, but y’know, the game released and that plan collapsed pretty quickly with the minimal option for deviation from the constant vault dweller backstory.
---
I’m not sure how many would complete certain events though like killing the queen by themselves.
---
you can survive in a nuke zone with the hazmat (which he had) and enough stimpaks.
---
I'm on PS4 too. We should start an Encryptid event group. Everyone keep sharing the cost of the key card. I'm pretty sure I have one I've been saving for when I see enough high lvl players on the server. My wife and I play it every time it shows up, and 80% fail due to not enough people playing it. PSN is imaloserbaby68. If you want to get something like that going, I'm down for it.
---
I also check EVERY single vendor on every server I get on for the plans and have not seen them for sale yet :(. I wish Graham or some other vendor had them. I did get a bad roll Fixer from a vendor for 9,500 caps and freaking love it for my stealth commando.
---
Because we can't allow for bethesda to use/spread the aggresive monetization and horrible optimization to other games of theirs like for example Wolfenstein: Youngblood
---
This is awesome! Really great job!  
---
I would love to come across this while walking along the tracks :D
---
I have a bunch of vintage nukashine lol.
---
Thank you, if you’re on Xbox, you just might.
---
FUCK THE QUARIANS. LONG LIVE THE GETH.
---
I mean events like these would be the reason why people would go online to play with others, it would help encourage it. An ability to play offline would help those who have a bad connection, or just want a solo experience (appealing to both groups of online and offline players), of course if you want a full experience going online would give you that. I was hoping they would come out with this earlier this year which is why FO1st disappointed me. This feature would make it almost pointless for them to do.
---
I like it because I roleplay. even in Fo4 (and specially in skyrim) I ignored the main and side quests and focused on my own story, which mostly just involved fighting off the wasteland and growing into a monster who literally eats aberrations for breakfast.
---
but I can see why the lack of an actual main quest would turn most people off. as for the online component and ugh, friends, I play in spite of it, most definitely not because of it.
---
I see what you did there :)
---
I genuinely cannot tell if this is satire
---
This is not how we speak to people.
---
Yeah. ESO did not launch on PS4 until a YEAR after it was out on PC. That first year was a total shitshow, basically just a beta test for console launch.
---
The issue isn't that they need the money for this though. They just don't want to be forced to take responsiblity for their misstep, and are nickle and diming the community just so they don't see and red in their ledger.
---
I don't think people are asking them not to monetise, they're asking for value. I don't mind purchasing DLC for a game, I do mind purchasing subscriptions for convenience.
---
Lighten up, Francis. Don't make us sentence you to death by toothpick.
---
Emergency Protocols is beastly on Power Armor, I run it exclusively on my armor sets. I've converted all my friends from jetpacks. Poison is still super deadly though. It's about the only scary thing left.
---
The only downside is missing out on +15 to all stats (minus endurance) from Unyielding armor.
---
For me it was when the 3 out of 4 of the squad spawned into an area that turned out to be a hotspot. 4th guy was on the fringe of the map and said 'well have fun dying'. Yeah, he got taken out by someone out there. While I managed to slip out of the feeding frenzy that was my spawn zone
---
Do tell the most ive seen in a Player own shop (pos) lol is around 30. I have supplyes to make a bunch but to lazy lolol
---
WHat a sad sad whale
---
Would reinstall the game for this. 12/10
---
And this is what happens when your opinions are formed via groupthink...
---
No, your lack of a sense of humour is.
---
Ironically, text chat is easier on Xbox or (I assume) PlayStation because of the built in messaging functions automatically being tied into our profiles. The platform that most needs text chat is the one completely lacking it.
---
I just did a huge unload from my main to my mule. My mule is always outside the lewisburg station over encumbered af. I go on my main, go to lewisburg station, crouch beside the blue lunch kit outside the station beside the locked suitcase (it’s bottomless). I then bring up my map and take pics of 5+ players on the map for their GT, then I dump my shit and leave the sever to swap characters. Once swapped I go to my friend section and search for the GT of the people in the server I just dropped my shit and join their session. I then spawn a few feet away from the lunch kit with all my stuff. Easy peasy just make sure your in stealth mode and there isn’t anyone near you
---
Blocker works too. Very useful.
---
TLDR OP doesn't want beligerent free loaders posting. No one does, making a thread about it won't change the fact, Clearly Bethesda has things to fix so even beligerent post serve  the community more then this reactionary thread does to an uncontrollable force. You can't tell who bought the game on a forum.Rally cries for positivity are nice but....
---
i feel like you contribute to the same thing that you are fighting against OP. You are not saying anything that hasn't been said and you don't frequent the positive sub. It's an open forum and people are allowed to state opinions, some may get down voted but what does that matter to anyone. I get downvoted for posting fan art I worked hard on because the concept is obscure....that's just reddit for you.  Yes constructive criticism is nice but I don't feel it is necessary and I also feel that it falls to deaf ears where it really counts anyways. I've had tonnes of front page suggestions that never see the light of day to any dev team for many games on forums, it's great to get community support for a good idea but being implemented is a long shot.  People on reddit get downvoted for suggestions let alone criticism. Like posting on this forum you could say before the BR was released "I think it would be cool to release a 76 F2p BR so they can make money on skin sales!" And you get a -15 post because people hated the concept of a BR the first 6months.  
---
We all post some negative stuff sometimes and we all downvote fools we disageee with for what ever reason sometimes but I don't really see this thread as a positive one , it's just finger pointing and game blaming. Not like I or anyone else make better threads but maybe just stick to r/fo76filthycasuals. I personally enjoy seeing opinion based threads though so what ever, nobody jas a moral high ground for it. The more threads (even when negative) that come out saying get it together the more likely the developer who listens will change to something the community doesn't have to make those threads about. Beth doesn't have that. They have a rockin Series (Fallout) and abuses it in a lot of places and treats it nicely in a few others, but in no way are they pampering or perfecting it imo.  
---
I don't like their form of monetisation but they have a right to do it. Like you are walking down the street and some homeless person is yelling at you to give them money but there is also another homeless person busking on the side of the street with an instrument they built or a talent they acquired (Juggling, magic, joke telling). Each day the yelling guy gets more agressive as you tell them no. F that person, and alot of the time I feel like that is what Beth  does and sure some people will make a thread "F that person who just yells at you aggressively on the street, they are so rude!" Others may make a thread "Maybe that guy should take up one of these 8 skills, I'll suggest it to them and see how it goes!" A follow up thread may be "I suggest those thing and that yeller just kept yelling at me"  they may then post a thread " F that yeller on the street they annoy me with what they are doing, It makes me not like going down that street anymore"     Well OP  here you and I come in just saying.  This is not the first street for pretty much everyone and not the first yeller for most. Some people get yelled at in more annoying situations then others , Like you are a fruit stand owner and that person scares off your business, or use the atm near that location and that person is most insistent because they know you just got money" those are the people that snap one day when their patience is pushed to far.  
---
Some peoples patience is just being pushed to far and ya it seems silly for a game to do that to people but it does and and most people don't want trends like that to continue in companies thàt set an example to others. Just like you don't want a yeller turning the busker into a yeller (because they make more money, or it looks easier to do, or the law makes busking illegal, etc) Yup they need to make money, but no they don't have to do it in the worst possible way.
---
For me I look at it like oh that's cool, if they add this feature and this monetisation route  they will make people happy and make money, but if they go this other route and add this different way to get money it will piss people off and yup it will get money but I bet in the long run it hurts the brand and will lose money. Bad faith business is usually pretty easy to spot and I see a lot of people on the forums defending bad faith business, some defend REALLY SUPER GREEDY bad faith business too, but then people also are out there making threads like "I hate super greedy bad business actions such as 1,2,3,4,5", I also hate these bad business practice's of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 that they are doing". Do I as a reader need to see the OP also go " And these are my solutions to these bad decisions!"...No, I do not.
---
I will pay money to good games with good faith business. other people) will pay money to bad faith business (Youtubers for instance will pay to get an advancement in a game even if there is a controversy because it will get views for instance). Most people are upset with 76 because the vision of the game and how it could make people happy is being a rug pulled from under their feet (I'm just talking about the upset people, I know there are people perfectly content with whatever Beth puts out and will defend it no matter what cause Fallout is the best series!) 
---
If it's making you salty then deal with it and if it's your hill to die on, then die on it. Personally I'm boycotting Pokémon Sword and Shield, the company lied, the work was lazy, and the trend from the last 3 releases showed me what this and the next ones will be like and I don't want to support it. Bethesda is doing the same thing but I feel like Bethesda needs to show they won't be doing what they did in Fallout 5 that they did in 76 for me to not Boycott it. I have hope these companies can get it together (Some people argue they don't have to get anything together and a perfect already, to which I disagree) but when they clearly aren't then they don't get my money.
---
To watch this garbage fire of a game burn even brighter as bethesda comes out with progressively crazier shit and yet ppl still somehow support them.
---
EDIT: Oh and btw the ppl that ruin anything here are the whales that keep spending money on this and still playing it making bethesda think that this is all worth it so gj being gullible i guess, i will continue to watch what scam beth comes out with next and you defending it at least, it will be fun
---
How about you learn to have a discussion and stop rallying to quash any negative criticism
---
Corrupt data. Try reinstalling if a restart doesn't do the trick.
---
I think for me, it's because it plays like Fallout 4, but doesn't really have an "end."  The whole game is very self-directed and the random activities of other players can give you lots of things to do when you run out of ideas yourself.
---
I also see it as a somewhat natural extension of how Skyrim ends up.  In Skyrim, you can own a house and essentially "live" in the world.  This is the same idea, except it's Fallout, and you can put your house pretty much anywhere and customize every little thing about it.
---
Compared to other games like it, such as Destiny, I like being a person and not some faceless suit of armor.  I like being in a world that has a bit of style to it, rather than a kind of generic sci-fi mishmash.
---
As soon as you play it you will understand why we do.
---
Well, I’d be willing to buy that bloodied radium off of you
---
Whale of a time!
---
I was joking
---
This. Blocker is a must have perk in literally any build.
---
It’s a Fallout game I can play with friends.  It’s my favorite Fallout game to-date.
---
My my you are so childish. So even if 100% of the criticism is one way (the way you don’t agree with might I add) than by virtue of it not being how you feel it is automatically griefing? My lord who hurt you?
---
PREACH
---
1500 caps each
---
Its a shit game,  give it time and you'll see
---
Damn, you can solo that??? What lvl are you? How do you take the conduit without dying?
---
Trade the first too, scrip the last two.
---
Especially, I wouldn't sell the radium for caps.
---
There are three posts talking about them on the second page of the sub where I found yours. I sympathize, but for us console players it's a non-issue and for y'all it is a tremendous issue. I imagine some of my fellow console plebs have started downvoting them because it's starting to be a bit much (hence multiple second page posts, but no front page posts).
---
I see bloodied going for 1000-5000 caps. I sell low though to move the 🏋 out of my stash.
---
Depends on your game style
---
If it’s competitive PVP - FO76 May not be the best option.  When players say “broken” - it generally refers to PVP mechanics and the PVP mode “Nuclear Winter”
---
If you enjoy PVE - then the game has a lot to offer.  It’s a large beautiful (eye candy) world to explore (after 1011 hours in the game I still didn’t explore all of it).  You can play solo, with friends or make new friends.
---
For Fallout fans the game offers lore, some answers and more questions.  Go through the story line, explore, build, fight (“Kill. Laugh. Love.”)
---
The community is amazing.  Even those who complain do so because they loved the game (can’t get so angry about a game you don’t care about).
---
Everyone has high hopes for the upcoming Wastelanders DLC.  After 1000 hours, it’s still my “go-to” game... with all its problems and imperfections.
---
It was worth the $80 (for me).  It’s more than worth $20-25 that you can get it for now.
---
Be well Wastelander
---
“Stop voicing valid criticism because a few people are okay taking it from behind”
---
Not going to drop any amount of money on a chance unless I'm sure...
---
Consider yourself lucky. I lost 150k+ ammo
---
It seems like all the people who blindly support the game just wish to alienate us people who voice criticisms
---
Gotcha.  So you're asking other people to form your opinion for you?
---
 Not sure how that's going to work out for you since some people love it and some people hate it.
---
The only one who will truly know if you like it is you.
---
Put machete 5k and drop it over time.
---
If you’re PS4 id buy the radium 10k.  Probably not what you could get on trade subs if your patient tho.
---
PA is mandatory if you play a heavy build.  If you want to be “tanky” you probably want power armor too.  
---
If you care about maximizing damage, then you probably don’t want to be in PA.
---
Why use 76 for that then?
---
Like let's say that Fallout:Miami dropped tomorrow; would you change games?
---
I’d rather they be unique items tied to the quest though. Unique items for gated things already have an iffy past on 76.  *looks at 5k caps deathclaw hide in someone’s vending machine*
---
That’ll learn them ! 😂
---
I think they confused it for scorch beast dna daily
---
Dodgy does indeed work in PA.
---
Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
I have no problem selling them for 400 caps.  When I'm low on materials to make them then the price goes up to 475 or 500 caps.  When I have excess materials, I'll drop to 325.  I've had people but 6 or more at 450 caps a piece.   So it varies.  It helps if you can have all of them in the vending machine at once.  People like a selection.
---
Serendipity doesn’t work in PA, Dodgy does.  Pick up blocker too, if you want more defense.
---
Clearly you mean the first Maxson. He would have to bring the cavalry all the way from New California, but it would be worth it to crush such heresy!
---
Haha that comment didnt go down well. I agree whole heartly with you.
---
So you’re protesting the game...by playing the game... ok
---
No.
---
I bought a moon cake that tasted horrible. My g/f and I took our pieces sat for a movie, both took a bite and it was not yummy...could we return it? No. Did it look like it was going to be tasty? Yup. Could I go on the pastry shops forum and post that the moon pie was a strange flavour that we both did not enjoy,? We have that right sure, it may help people or the shop. That is pretty analogous of the situation. They bought 76 thinking it would be fun, it was not to their palette.  Maybe by posting Bethesda will find out they are adding sour grapes to vanilla iced cream by accident or adding wine to the milk on purpose and people don't like the taste.  It may be an acquired taste for them but they advertise it as milk, not wine milk and people like to speak out about that kind of thing, espeçially if it's not on the ingredients list and the container is not transparent.
---
I'm just going on what I've heard, i don't even know if these protests are being held
---
Yeah, don’t worry about what others say.  To me, FO76 is the best Fallout game, period.  I’m sure plenty of folks disagree, and that’s cool.  I enjoy playing the game with others.
---
I keep playing the game because despite its many and major flaws, and absolute idiocy of Bethesda with regards this game, I actually still manage to enjoy it. 
---
I think that any fan of the fallout series will enjoy fo76 to an extent. The map is huge, and interesting. The story and quest lines are lackluster, but still held my interest as I did them. I enjoyed finding out what happened to the people of Appalachia, but wish the lore behind it were richer. If you liked building settlements in fo4, you’ll have a lot of fun designing your own camp. If you enjoy character creation/development and role play, there are many customization options for character appearance, pretty much exactly like in fo4, but with the added bonus of being able to wear whatever clothing you want over your armor. So you can look great and still have your armor buffs, which is great. I’m personally a huge fan of the legendary system in this game. You can find one, two, or three star legendaries. So a single weapon or piece of armor can have up to three legendary effects on it. 
---
If you like playing with other people, this would be a great game for you. Not so much if you like to play solo, but it’s still possible to wander around by yourself. You can complete almost every objective by yourself if you’re well prepared enough. 
---
To enjoy fo76 you’ll have to have a lot of patience. The quests and challenges are buggy as hell. So are the events. The game will randomly crash on you. It will be at the worst possible moment. The game will dick you over, like a tick sucking the life out of you, at times. But honestly, the game is fun, and that’s why we put up with it.
---
My protest was to delete the game. But I guess this helps to *sarcastic face*
---
You know, with a catapult, you pull back the stone, and you keep pulling on the sling, thinking just a bit more to get the furthest reach? Bethesda did that, except they pulled so hard with the Atom Store that the sling broke and the game never too off.
---
Good thing you're not trolling there Pal 🙄
---
Thanks tho for demonstrating *exactly* the kind of thing the aforementioned sub disallows
---
damn i thought loosing 400 was bad
---
Legot dumbest possible way to show displeasure
---
Hmm... Ok I think I get you. You like the grind but also having that nice house on the waterfront...
---
If another genre could give you that would you swap? Or do you specifically like the rusty, radiation infused apocolypse setting.
---
I've heard No Man's Sky actually has base building now and that it's bordering on good.
---
What you’re padded sub disallows a counter point? Congrats on shielding yourself from others point of view really gonna make lots of progress that way eh?
---
We don’t know that the subscription is paying employees. Also FO76 isn’t an MMO
---
They’re basically still at the starting line.  If they released a patch tomorrow that fixed 100% of the bugs then FO76 would still be a really below average online mmo-light/looter shooter in terms of gameplay, content, balance, economy, etc.
---
I doubt that any of the senior developers for this game play this type of game.
---
When people offer constructive criticism, find bugs and build free tools for the game - they get banned by Beth here. So yeah. Keep on sucking Todd's dick.
---
Best place to ask that would be [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=market+76&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari), you’ll have search the sub on your own since we can’t say it.
---
I just noticed you branded me as a troll? All I did was provide a counter point but if that means I’m fishing for some reactions than so be it.
---
Have fun in your snow globe kiddo
---
Ok. Thanks!
---
We don’t hate the game. We hate the business practice and lies that Bethesda is pedaling. They turned a broken game into a quick cash grab rather than fixing it up. And every update seems to bring in new and old bugs. Actions speak louder than words, and the actions Bethesda has taken say a lot about how much they care about the players opinions. It’s all for money and that’s the bottom line. 
---
Now a simple solution would be to update us and talk to us. They haven’t released an ITV since First was released. They aren’t transparent and they don’t tell us why they did what they did. Nor are they telling us about bugs they are trying to fix. It’s like being on the titanic and the ice berg hits but no one sounds the alarms or tells people what to do, they’re just standing around looking at what’s happening.
---
Ultracite because it's generally pretty nice stat wise and because it looks nice.
---
&gt;level 1
---
“If you don’t like it LEAVE” is the Most childish response to criticism ever. Grow up.
---
Turkeys are quite fatty .... I think a Cornish hen probably comes closer. ....skin stretched over bones
---
Rifleman is super efficient and can kill almost every mob in the game in a single shot with an Instigating a Lever.
---
Commando is strong, will do more damage on a long fight (SBQ), and wastes more ammo.  
---
I have one character who is a Rifleman and one who is a Commando.  I prefer the Rifleman because it just feels cool to head through a place and be so lethal with 1-shot kills. You feel like a stealth assassin. No doubt Commando can handle the same stuff, but it doesn’t have that same feel.
---
The drama is definitely way overblown. The worst that’s happened to me was some guy followed me around for like twenty minutes shooting my house and shooting at me and trying to get me to fire back, which was annoying but not a big deal. I just ignored him. Don’t even know if it was specific to first, but assume it was since he was thumbs downing my stash.
---
That happened a few days after first launch but hasn’t happened since. Now, I swear I see more people that are first members than those that aren’t...especially in NW.
---
So cheating?
---
Literally who?
---
Those can go for 10,000s of caps on Facebook trading groups

---
Wait, what armor is that?!
---
Post shit moron you this is pod racing.
---
Trust me, you don't want to find out. Use that money for something else.
---
T-45B all the way. Just a generally grim look all round and I like that
---
Untrue... those that were banned as if recent information providing issues were using cheat engines and then doing it... which technically is against the TOS, additionally many are temp not perm from reports out. 
---
“So yeah” Getting rude with comments... how mature... grow up and act your age. You’re a great example of my post! Thanks for proving it! Haha!
---
Same dude
---
They've not made any strides or improvements. They've only accomplished alienating the fans. Gouging them/us for money and given us broken promises and so on. The only positive for me was uninstalling the damn game and tossing it in a closet.
---
strangler heart, it has the nice well rounded defence of ultacite but has that small amount of bonus damage. mods suck though
---
He used the exploit in game. He cheated.
---
"Blinded by hatred"? Really? No, I'm for holding the company accountable to the horrendous decision-making and policies they have and continue to make that screw over their fanbase and consumers in general.   
---
Banning the accounts of the people who tested to see if it was true and then informing Bethesda of the problem is a terrible decision because it tells the few people still playing the game that if they see an bugs or exploits they shouldn't report it or risk losing access to their accounts. Really smart policy there huh?   
---
About the Atom refund being refused, there was a post about this topic a few days ago with a user in Australia and I support the reasons on why it should be given. I don't think either of us are going to budge here so I won't speak much on it.   
---
You can believe that it isn't for monetary reasons but to me, if I have the choice to spend money on upkeep of my site built to support a product or company I feel jaded towards or shut it down you bet I would take it down. Even if it isn't that much money being lost why should I continue to support the practices and products of something I don't believe in anymore?   
---
You can say the website owner is 'weaponizing the community'. Whatever you want to call it the website owner feels justified in removing his site and support for Bethesda's FO76 because of the decision-making and actions of Bethesda.   
---
Apparently you have a very different take on what happened and aren't going to change your mind. That's fine, but don't assume I have some sort of 'blind hatred' towards Bethesda. My views on the company and their actions have been sour since FO76 was released and the company hasn't been doing anything to earn back any goodwill since. I'm not being weaponized, the only reason I'm here commenting is because your views are very different from mine and I felt the need to respond. Beyond that? It's not as if I'm suddenly going out and protesting Bethesda because I read about this whole situation on the internet.
---
Because everyone else is jumping ship. You see more subs but that doesn’t mean it’s increasing. You’re just seeing the only people comfortable with a shit game
---
I would suggest replacing blocker with bandolier, take 1 or 2 points of charisma put 1 into luck for escape artist, mabye consider swapping in mister sandman for action boy when in night. Get some powered armor with chemleon.
---
If you're going to insult someone's intellect, you should at least use proper spelling.
---
Ok nine year old.
---
I'll give 2k for the machete

https://youtu.be/6k_iq2f2UQw
---
This video goes very in depth and should give a place to start.
---
Auto rifles do more dps. Semi-auto weapons do a lot of damage per shot but the fire rate of auto rifles means they do way more damage over time. If the enemy you're shooting takes more than one shot, then auto rifles are much more powerful. They are really good for bosses like the sbq.
---
If you need more space you can always make a new character and get some friends to help you transfer stuff to their stash. Thats what I do with stuff I'm not using. Just make sure its people you trust.
---
The build you have right now is pretty weak, and I could see why you are using so much ammo. Your missing all the heavy gun damage perks, you don't have bloody mess, and it seems the only damage increasing perk you have is adrenaline. 
---
Not trying to be rude, just keep this in mind when switching to rifles, get all the damage perks you can. That should be priority and will make or break your build.
---
Your endurance is good, but your gonna need to move points into perception, agility and luck, preferably out of intelligence first, then out of strength. 
---
You should have 15 perception with 9 of those points being used for rifleman, expert rifleman, and master rifleman. Or commando, expert commando, and master commando if you do automatic. Then you need tank killer for extra armor penetration.
---
This is one reason why your heavy build feels weak, you only have heavy gunner, so your only doing +20% damage with heavy guns. If you had expert and master heavy gunner you would be doing +60%. The stabilized perk is also really important for heavy guns, and makes it the only build that power armor is encouraged.
---
Bloody mess is universal and should be on all builds, it adds +15% damage to all weapons.
---
Here is my stealth rifle build, I swap out the commando perks for rifleman when using semi-auto rifles.
---

---
All of the perks in perception, agility and luck are there for a reason, they all increase damage, increase my sneaking abilities, or make vats better.
---
ZOMBIE LOVERS UNITE!!!
---
Dang, this is a shitpost, right? Please tell me you’re joking...
---
I’m not joking.  Like I said, it’s my opinion.
---
I wonder why your friends aren’t gonna play it... 🤔
---
I have a question, I recall that yall mentioned that there was a problem with the valves near the end of the 3rd raid, are yall aware of which valves are intake and which are outtake? Also, there does seem to be an issue if you turn more than whats asked. P.s.s, hi
---
Lmao you’re far gone. Have fun funding future shitshows with Bethe$da!
---
they gotta use the voice of the BOT STOP
---
They're just trying to "troll" but it just makes them look like more of an ass. In some Overwatch groups, on other websites I frequent, you always have that dude telling you how bad the game is and how they haven't played for a year. I guess it's their daily entertainment value when someone comes along to ask "then why are you here?"
---
It also trivializes important causes too. You wont believe how many of these "trolls" cite the Blitzchung incident as the reason they quit Overwatch....two years ago.
---
Honestly all you can do is just ignore them and only give attention to users who provide more to their post than "it's bad lul"
---
14 over a year is pathetic. That’s just over 1 a month.
---
Jesus fuck me my camp sucks
---
How the fuck are they gonna test if the cheats work and provide the fucking evidence if they don't use the cheat..??? You people are seriously beyond fucking help.
---
I don't see any protests in my Private Server.
---
pretty similar honestly.
---
I like how you’re so fragile that you can’t take ANY negative opinions about the shittiest game of whatever year it exists in.
---
Yeah, had some huge issues yesterday. 
---
Fucking unimpressed.
---
Firstly, fallout 76 is a lot of fun.  The world is incredibly detailed.  There’s a TON to do.  If you want to play as a lone wanderer the whole time you can.  If you want to group up, you can.  There is so much lore... it’s like living in an online Fallout 4.
---
There’s a bunch of real money cosmetics and some real money pay for convenience luxuries, but the vast majority of it you can farm “atoms” by doing stuff in the game.  
---
Yeah there’s a boatload of annoying ass bugs but nothing that’s really game breaking.
---
This bug has been around even before NW. Their shit support linked me to an article to "follow" for updates, which was last updated in March. I haven't touched NW since I got fucked and can't earn rewards anymore months ago, but I still get this fucking bug. Yes I'm salty I lose out on free atoms.
---
Aten-Ra does the bug round up. Id start there
---
Dont get reference sorry. Sorry just saying talking to people is far better than sending a message, hearing someone's voice actually say thank u is far better than a heart emote, i know in this day and age people and their texting but eventually u have to actually talk to some one and this person went out of their way to show u a good time and when u had the opportunity to actually thank them with words out of ur mouth u chose a heart emote. Just saying people ask for more tools and dont even use the ones right in front of them. There is far more value when u actually talk to someone and who knows u could have started a friendship now u will never know.
---
Shotgun support is 100% everyone's favorite teammate in vault raids. For a few hundred shotgun shells you can just cripple every enemy in the vault and not have to deal with constant respawns.
---
Yes look here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dip1ec/humblebrag_solod_mostly_the_imposter_sheepsquatch/
---
Im level 448 but the key is a full set of troubleshooter armour and a vampire mini gun.
---
If the server crashes everything we have built gets deleted and we have to start all over.
---
This server would be awesome. Imagine there were a lot of enemies everywhere and you have to work with other players to survive because you couldn't beat all these enemies on your one.
---
That would be so much fun and more apocalyptic.
---
There's an even better way to protest Fallout 1st: Just don't buy it. Keep playing the game and don't spend a dime. Speak with your wallet not your armchair protest
---
I have the key for the dome so I just went and grabbed one for you, my GT is the same as my username here if you want to add me.

Instigating is a great effect for the first round you fire :)

"It's not that bad."

"It's like spraining an ankle but sharp instead of dull and much worse."

"Just do it yourself lol."

Kind of a big deviation from what you have but I drafted this up:

---
You could replace sneak with Action Boy, or Bloody Mess with any of the criticals / AP regen in VATS chance or Tormenter or something. The real pain will be shifting points away from I and S into P and A for the build I made. I also put down like all the mutations pretty much, with Class Freak all the negative effects are pretty much nullified.
---
If you’re going Bloody, would need some shuffling for some more survivability.
---
Bethesda is running like a first timer playing QWOP.
---
What the fuck is "Club Fuzzy" and why should I, Bethesda, or anyone else give a rat's ass? lmao

Ah PC unfortunately lol

Just searched for you and said no match
---
Nm, i used o instead of 0
---
Are the purchasables a selling point for you personally or more just a warning for me?
---
And yeah it sounds kinda fun put like that. Although I've always preferred fantasy, is the theming a big part of why it's good?
---
Like is it good because it's an MMOLite Fallout 4, or a Fallout MMOLite with F4's engine?
---
You must be a real treat in debate. K you win. Don't care. Enjoying my fo 1st! :)
---
Move 1 str to agi for the 1 point sneak card that my old mind forgot the name of.  Also get gun fu, even over sneak.  Armor weight adds to detection so 5 weightless pieces with ultra light build and you’ll not need sneak, but gun fu is amazing.
---
If you get a weapon with bonus crit damage I believe it will not stack with perk card to a point so go for GR sprint.  14 luck is what I run.  I’m debating moving to to 15 with a floater point I have in int just to take 1 point of the crit card.  I swap sprint and 4 leaf situationally.
---
Dump long shot for concentrated fire.
---
Get 1 pt travelling pharmacy and try to find weightless gear with reduced drug weight (good luck).
---
You’re very similar to my build and it’s served me well.
---
Yes that's why nuclear winter and adventure severs are full
---
You’re welcome to browse my history and see that I’m capable of discussion. I’m just sick of 1/3 posts being ranting hate, or just straight up rude, like your comment.
---
Alright... don’t know what I did that tipped you off.
---
X-01 is my favorite looking in game. If we are going by ANY fallout then the Tesla Armor the enclave uses in FO3 is my favorite.
---
These are great ideas! Especially if it adds to the lore and story of what was going on in the area while we were in the vault, can't seem to get enough of it :)
---
It's harder to motivate people to give constructive criticism when Bethesda either ignores it or sells it back to the player. Or does something which makes the experience even worse...
---
Don't scrip the L30, I'd buy it for my mule that I've had for a long time.
---
It keeps failing to find world
---
Liberty Prime cause of the catchphrases!
---
How was my comment rude? The OP expressed his views that if Bethesda does not hear criticisms that he fears the next game will be even worse, that’s perfectly valid view point. The only person here who is not willing to have a discourse seems to be you, with your “unsub” comment. To me that looks like a blind dismissal of anyone who does not share your views.
---
I'd be open to it, but like I said, there's something specific to the way Fallout 76 does things that I find appealing.  I don't think you ever see your character in No Man's Sky, and a procedurally-generated world will never have the warmth of a handcrafted one.
---
How the hell would an in-game protest even work or be effective.  Just log in and stand around with protest signs?  Sounds pointless.
---
Excavator, I only use it to loot ore veins and collect it back into my inventory, it's awesome it only weighs 10 lbs, that's half of what my "weightless" handmade weighs!
---
I'll be on later if you want to join my private server so you can safely transfer stuff if you don't have anyone else to help you. Just send me your gamertag if you need to and I'll add you so you can join:)
---
T51b or bust.
---
It's a terrible day for rain.
---
Just save it in case you ever want to make another character??
---
T-45 is my favorite by looks. T-51 and T-60 tied for second place
---
I am not afraid to spend a few bucks on a game that I spend a lot of time in so it is a positive for me.  There are those who disagree so I tried to frame it neutrally in order to allow you to make your own mind up.
---
The “world” of fallout is my second favorite franchise ever, it is a major selling point for me.  All of the negatives do not outweigh this part from my perspective.
---
It is kind of a hybrid of a FPS and a mmo.
---
i'm not sure if i will download this game again to check wastelanders, i'll probably look at reviews first, but it was definitely a good run
---
[PC] I love this game, even with all her bugs.  I usually buy a new game every month but since 76 came out its all that i have played (well except for a few skirmish matches on C&amp;C 3 Kanes Wrath).  Ive never been big on MP games, but i love everything about this one.  Glitches, disconnects, and bugs have never bothered me, maybe because they have been few and far between in my experience.  I dont mind paying for atoms or for the subscription, its worth it to me.
---
Thank you so much!  This is the kind of input I’m looking for!  I already have a full set of weightless, each piece has bonus ap. I’m going to strongly consider your suggestions and I’ll post a new build when I get home from work.
---
I'm still here lurking because I want to see how Bethesda proceeds with the Fallout 1st stuff in the near future. I don't feel like playing the game until I'm incentivized to do so with 50% off purveyor or they release unlimited scrapbook for all or anything else that makes it worthwhile to spend my time. I'll come back when the NPC stuff is added for sure, though.
---
So far my server sessions have been nice and quiet.
---
It's an abomination!!!
---
Yes but I was talking about the folks who don’t even own the moon cake but they bash it enthusiastically because others said it didn’t taste right.
---
Nothing everyone is entitled to opinion man.
---
A mule is the offspring of a male donkey and female horse. So I would say no, as it wouldn't make any sense
---
So much protest in my bottomless scrap box and 1650 atoms a month
---
Very true! But I’m talking more about the “criticism” shown here under my thread by one user who can’t handle any others opinions so has to go on personal attacks... I used the word “criticism” very loosely here in favor other ways to describe it.
---
Once you shoehorn a fucking battle royale mode into a Fallout game, stand back and declare something as outrageous as "Development.  Starts.  Now", it's all over but the suckers and 90% off Black Friday sales.  What the hell happened to Bethesda, man...smh.
---
I'd argue development never even began on this disappointing trainwreck.
---
Same here Xbox one. Cannot equip the bag at all.
---
proof: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N052fUJ4zho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N052fUJ4zho) (yes i know one guy showed up at the end..)
---
Should be.
---
Yes. But it's not armor. Its clothing. You get no benefits outside of looking cool. I'm sure you know that, just wanted to make sure.
---
I think there is a very good chance the "Wastelanders" portion of the game will be like Nuclear Winter, absolutely fantastic, but with a couple critical flaws.  
---
$100 says Wastelanders will be a separate world logon along the lines of Adventure mode, and the polish on the locations and NPC's will likely be high, but the core game flaws will still be there.
---
Ty
---
I havent lost anything.......yet
---
I only play NW but to answer your question, there is nothing else on the market.
---
Why don't you have a mic yet
---
Liberty prime with x-01 head and torso. Together with the blue headlamp is has an enclave vibe to it.
---
Because everyone else left. And the people that have stayed are so far disassociated away from reality it isn't funny. The mental gymnastics done to explain away and invalidate the arguement of the people angry with Bethesda.
---
51b for the dr, the pauldrons, and the nuka paints :p
---
Happened to me once when I dropped a whole bunch of bulked material in a lunch box, just when i logged off I saw a guy came toward me and was checking all containers and trashcans. Too late already. When my mule logged I literally saw the guy standing by the lunch box, picking everything up apparently, i couldn’t even imagine his joy. He emptied the lunch box and logged right off. I think he realized it was someone else’ stuff.
---
Well the helmet gives the same benefit as a gas mask
---
So then by that logic the accounts of any support member replicating a bug or exploit should be banned too since they are cheating.
---
Lol you can tell all the sensible Fallout fans have fled the fandom when giving genuine criticism is accused of being bought and paid by another game company
---
A whole robot comedy club with multiple events that spawn
---
Go to the Fallout-76 file and try to run it as an administrator.
---
 I don't feel as bad for the players that are losing all their loot and having other bad consequences for supporting Bethesda still
---
Melee... It's consistently the strongest build in the game.
---
Seems to be a lot of that lately though
---
Looks good. Only thing your missing is escape artist, and mister sandman. Escape artist is great for when you wanna move up by sprinting, or if you get spotted. Mister sandman only works at night but I'm lazy and leave it on, its definitely worth it.
---
I would recommend at least 1 point of gun-fu so it auto-swaps targets for you. But its not necessary. As others have said, you should be fine without the sneak perk. With birdbones giving you extra agility and weightless armor, you should be extra sneaky.
---
NCR Ranger outfit and Mothman dance

I suggest using LFG on Xbox, works much better when looking for people to play with

Started this build yesterday morning and finished up this afternoon.

I'm playing on PS4 and every time I decide I want to play again, I turn it off after 5 minutes. I don't get how the new Modern Warfare for example runs at 60FPS while this game is on 10-20 on average. I'd be fine with it if it was only 30 fps but constant, but in it's current state it's almost unbearable for me.

anything that works with semi auto rifle setups (rifleman line)

ARE YOU HERE FOR MY  S O O T H I N G  VOICE
---
A roast battle with the insultbot would be amazing:
---
You have been insulted. Thank you.
---
What platform?
---
If you’re xbox, I would take the Drum for 1,000
---
They probably don't play the game. I don't think they could tolerate the amount of bugs it has.
---
Ballistic bullets are almost instant. Energy not at all.
---
This game makes me feel like a vault test subject
---
A while ago.
---
Thank you all, guys !
---
It's not that I feel "weak" with my heavy, it's just that I'm bored x) (I have the legendary .50 machine which makes 40% more damages if enemy is below 50% of health and a two shot minigun of which i'm very happy to have !)
---
But Rifleman is very interesting for me. Maybe next character i'll do shotguns. I have a two shots combat shotgun which is quite nice with the other stats (don't remember very well).
---
But can rifleman play with shotguns ? Like the rifles perk cards add damages to shotguns too, isn't it ?
---
But its true. For instance, would you continue eating at a restaurant where the staff is being rude, condescending and insulting you? I know I wouldn't. I would walk out of there after telling them off and making a huge complaint and I would never go back. But on the flip side if you decide to stay and take in all the verbal abuse, well them it's on you.
---
Well I'll be damned lol that's crazy!! Awesome good job.
---
This is a horrible idea on the face of it! Have you thought about a job in BGS Austin's management? I think you'd fit right in.
---
Just some events that spawn legendary enemies or have a chance to drop something nice. There is not a "correct" way to play a game and I enjoy what I have done so far. Why do something that you don't like?
---
Someday, maybe they'll bring it to us ...

[](/chuck)I love how many times people add "supporting Bethesda" to these like it's some kind of political stance. I can't speak for everyone, but I play the game because it's fun, it'd still be fun if they never updated it again, it'll be fun when they add more to do. There's a ton of nice fun people I talk to on the regular in game too, so that's a nice bonus, but for a long time I avoided other people, and still had a blast.  
---
Why do you play video games?
---
Meanwhile I'm the exact opposite and at lvl50 have almost fully explored and done the entire main plot xD
---
Nice but what platform?
---
For the sake of the argument, having met some of their people, lets say I agree they are that good.
---
Letting the KS stamp get put on some of these bugs is a QA Failure in almost every industry I've worked in, From being a Systems Admin to working in a Drop Forge 20+ years ago.
---
And for the sake of argument lets say someone above them is putting a KS stamp overriding their rejection, again in most industries, once they begin to hemorrhage reputation and most importantly **money**, the person who overrode QA and put a KS on the issues would be brought in and held accountable, be it VP or QA's manager, because in every company above small business there is a chain of custody for these things and eventually when the same person makes enough bad calls they pay for it (yes yes there is always "Teflon Bill", but even he is starting to pay for the mistakes of the past)
---
Having been in a QA and final assembly position, more than once I forced in critical fixes that were not approved and almost always snuck in a couple small non-critical ones..
---
I bet my job, but in my mind it was worth it, and as a result of taking the risks and proving it was worth it eventually
---
Also respect they have too little time, way too many demands, and most are doing the best they can, and understand the issue with forked Dev.
---
But it is possible to do better if the process is changed, dozens of MMO's before them have proved that, hell even ESO did.
---
# Regarding Forks...
---
I don't accept that, and I mean no disrespect.
---
Again every job I've had the people allowing these forks to diverge this significantly would have been fired.  Understanding the limitations of Creation Engine / Kit and the fact it's harder than XEdit to see changes from the original master they need to start thinking outside the box because there are ways to work around it...
---
**-Open a dialog with the Xedit team again:**
---
As has happened in the past, and work on streamlining a final version of XEdit for '76.
---
Use this version to automatically run a Delta Patch before pushing a change live, the time it takes varies on hardware, but left to run overnight you are left with a manageable file with only the changes listed, *and comparing them does not take that long, I know because I've been doing it.*
---
**-Use a "Confirmed Fix" system:**
---
Put confirmed fixes in a secondary ESM/ESP and use those in the final compile before sending for final testing to make sure those fixes get merged in.
---
This ensures each time a ESM gets pushed to QA and then live the tests from the previous fixes get included.
---
You can do this for BA2's as well, from every file type from Material file to Animation files.
---
**-Make changes / hotfixes in a secondary ESM/ESP:**
---
Tons of other games have done it, and this engine supports it, hell they can hard code into the EXE which files are allowed to start, so adding is doable.
---
This will make it easier to test changes, a snap to roll back (just change EXE's), and quarterly or twice a year push a major ESM update that rolls up these smaller fixes.
---
**-Work with the Community who has been BEGGING to help for free:**
---
Which press is worse?
---
"Bethesda accepts help from the community" or the headlines they've made repeatedly over the past year?
---
Most other game companies have been rewarded and lauded with praise when they work with the Community, I mean look at HBS's Battletech team, they've been working with the Community, specifically with the RogueTech crew and the results have been amazing.
---
**-Accept the information from the Community:**
---
Some of us have been sending in ESP's with overrides including fixes, mostly "low hanging fruit" that could easily be rolled in after a quick verification.
---
Mod authors have offered tested and safe mods the include features and fixes for free....
---
And before we go down the "how do they know who to trust", some of us are known factors.
---
Do we make mistakes?
---
Hell yes, but we usually find and fix them quickly, and if we actually got feedback and communication with the Dev's the quality of what we would submit would rise significantly almost overnight.
---
# Additionally......
---
Until they have public test servers, or a much larger testing base, many of this game breaking and critical issues will keep being pushed in.
---
Without a much more diverse set of hardware / software builds AND a more diverse group of testers we won't see the improvements we need.
---
# I admit there is allot of Armchair Quarterbacking going on here.....
---
We (specifically me) are far from perfect, and it's easy to judge from the outside looking in...
---
Those of us who think creating mods gives us an insider's perspective are even worse (and I'm one of them), without question...
---
But we have a year of a few high points but far far more disasters and going on FIVE major "Player Die Off's" I'm aware of, so something has to change or this game will die and it will remain a Black mark on Bethesda's Reputation for years.
---
I honestly have a great deal of respect for those working inside BGS, and I saw the passion they have with my own eyes, you can't fake that (easily)......
---
But passion alone won't keep a ship afloat.  
---
but then again I could be completely wrong
---
010010110011 0011100110101011
---
0010110? 
---
110110!
---
Ground pounder reload speed works too even though it's for auto rifles
---
My bad...will edit
---
I thought this would be subreddit for court-ordered refunds from Bethesda
---
&gt; edit: can people stop criticizing me over rumors that i heard, i just felt like it might be an interesting thing to take part in. if you don't have information on whether or not they are happening then you don't need to comment 
---
No person is above criticism and you sorely deserve it for a lack of critical thinking towards whether the rumour is legitimate and whether you should act on such flimsy evidence.
---
I think you learned a life lesson today.
---
I believe that also takes a good bunch of time :)
---
theres a bug where a direct shot with a fatman for instance does next to no damage, you HAVE to shoot the ground near them to deal the damage
---
Thanks
---
Plasma definitely has travel time, regular bullets don't seem to. If you use vats sometimes it'll just hit them around a corner or through a hill anyway
---
Ok tips on this? I’ve been trying most I can get is 150xp per round
---
Edit well I last 20 min just hiding and got 500xp.
---
Wait. You're saying you don't like doing quests, the core to any Bethesda game?
---
Wow. I'm not even upset. Just genuinely shocked. 
---
I guess each to their own.
---
Even today with all the updates it still seems short of a alpha in gameplay and content
---
I bought this game at launch, and I still enjoy it.  With the amount of play time I’ve gotten out of the game, I have zero complaints when it comes to value. 
---
Do I have complaints? Yes. Are there bugs that piss me off? Yes. Despite this, this is my favorite Fallout game to-date. I enjoy that there are other players. I’m a big trader of gear, and enjoy that.  That alone adds massive depth to the game. 
---
If you don’t enjoy they game, I understand that. I do.
---
The thing I don’t understand is why people who dislike the game are still posting here. Why aren’t you playing another game you enjoy and discussing that?  It seems that many like to convince others that the game sucks. The proverbial, “Pissing in another persons Cheerios”.
---
Why are you coming here and not Bethesda's official support? Have you even tried?
---
You say that, but there is a good chance it doesnt work at all
---
Too wild of a wasteland for me but great idea OP
---
Currently Ultracite but eventually plan to get strangler heart
---
Unless they tell you they didn't buy it, nobody would know, and as soon as they do tell you it invalidates their argument.  So making a thread saying "Don't hate on moon cake if you've never tried it" seems silly to me  cause there is nobody who is malicious enough to do that, which would be stopped by posts into the void.  If the companies moon pies got a bad enough rep to have randoms look into the forums and post that they too think it is bad (Even though they have never had it) at least that attention will go to the shop owners into looking at why it is bad (gunk on the machine, salt instead of sugar) or maybe the owner is just negligent or has an acquired taste for motor oil and adds it to the pies cause they like it, even if it is dangerous. It still adds visibility to a problem.
---
Sure they same people may go I not a random shop and hate on a random  cinnamon roll type but there would not be a broad and reoccurring outcry by many different people, just that one goof doing it and people would be able to notice over time or experience it for them selves and call out the lies. 
---
I don't feel like people criticising this company are lying, the opinion came from somewhere that made them vocal, maybe they didn't buy it, but they saw something that irked them, to be 100% randomly criticising something is very unlikely and not impactful. 
---
Some people are famous bakers saying the pie tastes bad, some people have never baked a day in their life, others are experts in moon pies specifically and many have never tried one before.  They all have different established norms of what is except able tastes but I'd argue the majority of people would  give reasonable criticisms based on experience.
---
Ya a famous chef can say something tastes horrible when to everyone else we think it's fine.....that's an outlier.   Sure regular people could say it  tastes bad and some famous chef says it tastes great!..that's also an outlier.   
---
I don't feel like criticism of 76 are outliers, people who haven't bought or played the game have at least watched gameplay or read about actions and compared it to their experience in other games.  Like you can say a moon pie is horrible because the owner puts it in a box and shakes it to bits but the picture on the box shows a normal round looking pie, you may go on a forum and say "I saw that pie too, looks horrible" they didn't have to eat it to criticise it . They didn't even have to buy it. Sure it may seem negative but it helps the industry. You could argue people posting "Don't call this pie horrible, be more positive, if you've never bought it your opinion doesn't matter and stop posting, moderate the forum from these people" nobody can tell where the lines are because it is blurry and even if the poster of that message tasted the pie and didn't like it, they are upset out the negativity and want something done.    
---
My issue is that if you see a shop selling 100s of tasty items but week after week keep stocking more and more moon pies and people start saying buy the pies or they will go out of business!  And the backlash is "Sell us tasty pie and you won't have this problem" it can be annoying sure, but what ever.  Ya love raisons but hate the moon pie, well here is our raison verson of moon pie! But Beth has been releasing it with the same bad taste in a flavour you like and glitches cause that pie to not have raisons each other week.   Going on a forum and complaining about not getting raisons on your gross moon pie ie stupid.    Complaining that the moon pie is gross from the start is better.   Selling tasty pies is the best.
---
Some business pad the bread with saw dust...it saves them money, the taste may not be noticeable but ethically it's wrong.   If you make a post saying "F putting sawdust in your flour! To scam us" I don't think that needs to be constructive when it's common sense and a punishable law.  Bethesda has straight up broken some laws and they ride the thin line on a lot of stuff, you don't need to have bought the con to see it. There is nothing stating only fools and rubes can complain. 
---
TL:DR you said "If you don't buy the pie don't cry".  I said " Stop selling gross pies or you will lose business."
---
 (This is most sad when the shop has a favourite of yours but goes out of business because of their obsession)
---
Not really -   it's basically the same buggy game you pay for with some extras ie stash box /tent .
---
But other than that it's OK.
---
Cause it’s still fun? All games have their downsides.
---
Bethesda made it that way. How did they expect to make a battle royale without any kind of anti-cheat?
---
:D same. Been playing since tricenntinial edition. Almost a year in and haven't discovered a ton of places. Have done maybe a third of the main quest and tons of side quests to do. Just finished the Sheepsquatch questline, had great fun. Having a blast just grinding and building . Love the events (bugs aside). Imho great game, great fan base.
---
A word of caution. I'd look through the comment history of anyone that speaks very positively of this game. 
---
Some people here are known to be absolutely blind to anything negative about the game and may dupe you into buying something that this game just isn't.
---
Oh yea? Well Bethesda ruined Fallout for me. So now what Marci.
---
that will cost 700 atoms
---
I would imagine there were not enough players in survival to warrant the energy when it could be directed towards Wastelanders.  They need to come up with a decent solution for players who want to pvp.
---
You should try to be better informed before posting something like this.
---
Nice camp very well made bro can you do an updated version when its 100% complete?
---
Nuclear winter, log for scrip, and go around collect lead/plastic/steel/blood.
---
They do exist. I don't remember if there were any in Fallout 4 off the top of my head, but there was [Button Gwinnett](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Button_Gwinnett_(robot)) in Fallout 3. He had a different voice.
---
It was quieter but rather than make Survival something worthy of people's attention, they just dropped it.
---
Its fun
---
Believe it or not, most of the hate come from people that absolutely love the Fallout franchise but hate how this game turned up to be. Most of them feel betrayed and being let down. They are absolutely entitled to an opinion and here is exactly the place to share their thoughts. If you don’t like negativity, just don’t use social media of any kind.
---
It’s a fun game and I enjoy playing it.
---
First off, i dont play anymore, but its not because of the game itself, but because of something Bethesda have done.
---
If it wasnt for this, id still be playing because the game had ALOT of potential, and if the devs sort there shit, it could be an amazing game. But at the moment there's too big of a gap between what we were promised, what the devs actually want, what we want and what the game is, causeing the game to be in constant flux.
---
1. B/c its fun.  
---
2. Even at L151, there are still things I haven’t done.
---
3. Just like any other (FO) game, it has its share of bugs  and quirks.
---
4.  Many of the topics being complained about have not or do not affect my gameplay.
---
Without knowing player numbers and stats it is hard to say, they do need to come up with a better solution than workshops.
---
Felt like it was going well until fallout 1st where they took a mininuke knockback sized step backwards
---
I can, though are they ever really 100% done? Lol
---
You have to frame the question correctly.
---
For a lot of people who are critical here, they're former players of the game and former fans. They'd love to do nothing but get back into the game and praise it but it's just unconscionable to do so right now.
---
So some hang around to try and push Bethesda to do the right thing and call them out when they don't. Some in the hopes of seeing positive improvements worth returning to the game for.
---
It's really not that hard of a thing to grasp.
---
Sellout? I've been warning players in-game to stay away from Fallout 1st as it feeds greed.
---
Sure, it's a good game based on a good concept (Fallout) but it has a lot of bad decisions and technical issues. Glad you found your zen area. We can always improve.
---
Excavator has served me quite well, to include fissure primE and SBQ.
---
Wore it exclusively from L45 through L138 or so.
---
Now that I have my weight down, trying out some of the other armor, but still revert to Excavator when I bounce off the weight limits.
---
Why
---
I'm not a 1st member and I wasn't going to give loot to 1st members either. I was mostly thinking about the lower levels for whatever else I couldn't carry.
---
You’re my favorite. 🙀
---
Exactly. :)
---
Yes, it is bad the 30% would be better, but with the damage cap it stills seems not worth investing in..  Mutants needs a buff as well, perhaps 5% per mutation max 20% or something.
---
There is a lot to criticise about the game and the devs behind the game. 
---
You're at level 9 right now. You won't get it for a while but I hope for your sake, you never find out. Ignorance is bliss.

That would be hilarious LMAO. Holy Scrap.

Facts
---
Woo hoo C&amp;C!   Been playing since Tiberian Dawn.  Red Alert 3 was good.  Last good C&amp;C game.   Have you checked out OpenRA?
---
Wasn't aware of that one. The GOTY version of 3 was so buggy on PS3 as to be almost unplayable and I never finished it.  
---
Regardless, they're quite rare and having several in one place would be a bit weird.
---
I wonder if it will get better with Wastelanders. I mean there will be a lot of NPC’s it should work on right?
---
Yeah it should be +40% to negate people's use of assassin's armor lol
---
Good chances are it'll be part of fallout 1st.
---
Awesome...I'm waiting for more pics.
---
So i've never heard of the game QWOP before reading through these comments, and I watched a video on it for the first time.
---

You guys are harsh lol
---
No i havent, ill look.  They are doing a remaster on the originals...i cant wait!  I didnt like RA3 that much though.  C&amp;C2 tiberian sun was my fav
---
https://youtu.be/mw7Gnv6a0fQ
---
I didnt encountered a freakin cheater yet ! And i play on pc...  you just unlucky dude !
---
You see them lots in gaming news because they make for easy clicks. And lord knows neither they  nor the game they made are perfect. But here’s the thing, the people who like the game know it from playing it, not from gaming media. 
---
Christ, that made me sound like a gator!
---
We here at Bitchesda are delighted to announce that following the release of Wastelanders in 2020, you will be able to purchase a subscription to our anticheat service for just 200 dollars a year!
---
That feeling where they reached a starting line is because they haven't actually started with completing the game.
---
They launched the game while they were still in the Athlete's locker room. They might make it to the starting line when Wastelanders launches. We'll see.
---
Ah ok, yeah I did notice that the camp closest to where they were disappeared.
---
Ok if you are on pc, do usless items inside and i will buy one by one for 1 cap and play an earrape version of MONEY MONEY MONEY, MONEY TALKS !
---
Level 118 here and I just finished sheepsqautch quest.
---
It is a fun game. I have fun playing it. Most of the time I don't see the drama, because I am busy playing the game.
---
Personally I am a bit at odds with the general design direction of most cash shop items. Most of those items are rather peculiar. I wonder who they intend to target with those stuff. If FO76 were for a young audience, then some cash shop items might be able to hit a nerve, but I perceive it as such that FO76  players tend to be older and more grounded.
---
Party and fun stuff is important to keep our sanity in the wastelands... i appreciate colourful and playful items to fool around with. But what could I buy, when I want to get down to business? There is not much to choose from.
---
Momentarily the coolest looking stuff for me seems to be the red stove, the freezers and the whitish water purifiers. But I am a heavy drinker and my Camp is a farm for the good stuff... even if I liked a piece of housing I would have difficulties to fit it within the camp limit...
---
The designers for cash shop items are without a doubt crafty and skillful. But just so few items are well rounded and balanced that I would get attracted to them.
---
You keep doing you and happy gaming
---
I don't want to even want to get into the damage cap.. I mostly want assassin to be boosted more then mutants. having mutants weaker but also effecting pve not just pvp. But im all for boosting every effect lol
---
I [saw this camp today and it made my jaw drop. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/dugatc/came_for_the_shopping_but_it_was_the_art_that/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Its a great game and it's fun. Simple as that.
---
I don't expect you to understand since you haven't played it.
---
Normally 20 hours...
---
Wow. Some people have caps...
---
That’s basically what you do, spawn in somewhere remote and stay crouched. Pick up weapons when no one is around. Hide in bushes, behind rocks, whatever you can.
---
U have more pics?
---
I only do NW when they put limited time things behind it I want. Then when I do its grab a gun, hide, run from anyone shooting, watch for snipers and average 300-500 xp a match. The perks to loot extra ammo and first aid are nice too.
---
Idk but I kinda doubt it. Its specifically damage against players... NPC means Non player characters
---
Well I got my first win 3 weeks ago. I got the last kill and had a total of 5. It felt good.
---
That would be a good balance for both effects
---
Sadly no, server disconnect. I’m glad I got at least one photo to share. Maybe I’ll find it again, I’ll be looking!
---
Rifleman perks for damage, and it's also considered a silenced weapon and can benefit from Mister Sandman.
---
I agree, specific damage boosts without penalty (like Junkies and Bloodied) should always be higher than general or they re pointless.
---
Still that 1000xp/per hour. That’s 14 hours to grind for the suit.
---
True lol
---
I personally hope the game dies. At this point it's wasted money and manpower. Hopefully they put more effort into Starfield and ESVI or else thats game over for Bethesda.
---
It's almost a finished product, so hooray for the slippery slope of ever-lowering standards, I guess.
---
In Fo4 the assassins prefix related to human NPCs so it’s possible when NPCs return it will be adapted back to cover both.
---
They're probably like my 9 year old and just fucking refuse to try anything first
---
Completely read that like a Protectron, lmao
---
I really want the pink sprinkles power armour paint but I just can’t sit though it all might try it with a double xp weekend. (Which we should get at least.)
---
They said also lot's of things about Fallout 76. Wether it will or won't have an online component, i'am scared what the monetization of this game an the ingame store will look like. I just don't believe there won't be an ingame store. For me Fallout 76 obviously is a training ground on future monetization of there games. Given how far they have gone in the last few years the future looks very grim.
---
Eso was no where near as broken as fallout 76. Also they stuck to only cosmetic microtransactions. Eso had players work towards an end goal but there's really just a story line that you could beat as fast as you wanted to with 76. When eso first came out you could only do 1 main story quest for every 5 levels. Eso also has a fuck ton  more area to explore.
---
I think for me its just seeing it not destroyed. I think Charleston would have been so cool had it not been washed away.
---
There isn't another game like it and I find a game like this fun
---
It's been an issue since shortly after launch, and it's hard to understand why they've not make it run a checksum on server side to atleast make it **hard** to do this..      
---
What is killing me is the worst offenders keep getting unbanned for "lack of evidence" (even with countless video submissions and matches that end in 10 minutes with them killing 30 people....) when clicking on any of the provided links or GOOGLING some of the UPN's will turn up videos if for some reason people failed to provide them.
---
That's interesting but that would pretty much make mutants and assassin the exactly the same perks
---
I'm genuinely curious, how do you get that high level without discovering a significant portion of the map? (Especially if this happens to be your first character.) Do you just run the legendary farming route and nothing else? Whatever you're doing, that's certainly some dedication!
---
clown costume
---
There isn't another game like it and find this sort of game fun
---
Well if hope that the Assassin got a boost too! They’ve talked about balancing in Wastelanders so underpowered effects can expect a boost hopefully.
---
Summary, ESO had more content on release in comparison, however the bugs and brokenness was pretty similar. It was unplayable with friends, quests frequently broken, no end game so in some ways worse and in others better.
---
That would be pretty cool if the engine can handle it without erupting into flames.
---
I have two.
---
Cliffside, my main character's camp: https://imgur.com/a/d9dou4q
---
The upstairs is less detailed than I'd like, but I hit max budget. Actually, I hit max budget on both.
---
Mayhem Arena: https://imgur.com/a/JSSshr4
---
For this one, I focused most of the budget on the arena. There's a second floor above the shop, but it wasn't interesting enough to screenshot.
---
Edit: Posted this before I saw that you edited your platform in. I'm on PC. You can still check out my work if you like.

Well i meant like history revision like the turkish, chinese or sovjet government di. Very sorry, how healthcare works in the US. I'am from a more country were health care is mandatory and every has it. There is not an opt-in or opt-out. And if you don't have money to pay it, government will pay it.
---
Companions will come with wastelanders. I assume they'll protect your camp and not just walk around while it's being attacked.
---
  It is cool when you see a team roleplaying.
---
Agree....  
---
The amount of downvotes I get on my "Bug Roundups" because a good chunk of the fanbase sees anything like that as criticism blows my mind, still.
---
Oh ok, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to see something in particular. I prefer the wilderness in this game significantly more than any of the town areas.
---
Gets it this guy does
---
Both very nice...second one is better  imho
---
That is awesome
---
Since the thread was made I can add this info
---
I own a ps4 and ps4 pro
---
Both have fo76 installed. The pro was bought new with fo76 and both are used at same time to play with a friend. 
---
The pro crashes at least if not twice or more. The regular ps4 maybe 2-3 times since we started playing (last year level 175)
---
So re installed and did all the things google searching says to do. Still crashes a lot on the pro. 
---
The other games I play in the pro never had any issues. 
---
I’ve given up being upset with it and just expect it now.
---
Maybe a broasted Cornish hen?
---
Thats called socialism and you can keep that
---
Honestly, it’s doubtful
---
They just wrapped up the Halloween event after all...
---
And I realize the percentages wouldn't negate each other, I just didn't feel like mathing it out
---
Join discord communities that focus fallout 76. Im in WVR, and i tend to help people since im done with the game at the moment. Here gies a discord link:
---
https://discord.gg/Hd7Wvux
---
Let me know if the link doesnt work, cause links expire and stuff.
---
Wow congrats. I see in your post history you were searching for an aaffr just the other day lol. Crazy you got one for caps as that's usually trade only
---
Yeah, they referred to themselves as "paladin Scott", "paladin Josh", "paladin Cameron" and "paladin Travis"
---
Crits only exist in VATS and when you fill the meter
---
I did the event today alone and got a fixer plan. It wasn’t really difficult I died once because I got to close and it saw me, but after that no issues.
---
If it weren’t for Fallout 1st then I would say they’re pretty far along, but now they backpedaled with that feature that should’ve been free.
---
Yeah I suppose so. Just thought it was an interesting topic.
---
Loose and containered items aren't on timers anymore.  They respawn after you pick up 180 and 60 items respectfully.
---
It could work as server stress testing. Lets say they make this mode avaiable 1 week per month. Then spending other 3 weeks to fix the worst problems found during active week.
---
Yeah, I'm reading these responses but I feel they're not truly answering your question.
---
1. Yeah, it is fun. **The scummy atom shop bull shit and bugs/crashes are not fun,** but if you enjoyed the gameplay elements of Fallout 4, this game has offers a decent amount of content to dig through.
---
2. Some of the community takes CAMP building pretty seriously. There are some really neat player-made structures out there that are fun to visit. Few other multiplayer games offer that kind of creativity for the playerbase. There's a suttle 'SIMS house building' sort of vibe to it that I really enjoy.
---
3. The potential is there for this game to become truly great. Some people have invested several hundred hours into their character. While it might be the right thing to give Scumthesda the middle finger and walk away from the franchise, there comes a pretty bad feeling of abandoning that character that you put so much time into.
---
nice idea. I support that.
---
Made some tweaks.  Thoughts?  I’m not a fan of day night perks so I punted on mister sandman.  Dropped long shot for concentrated fire for vats head shots.  I also picked up a couple quality of life perks I’m used to having.  2 points of sprint ap and lightening up the weight of junk.

I have not lost anything yet
---
Seconded
---
I soloed it today. Sneaky shotgunner. Used my furious shotgun, psychobuff and ballistic buck, some pemmican for the extra endurance and I used nuka quantums to stay alive from the pylons. I run Nuka Nut so nukas are insane.
---
You have to craft it first. Buying it in the Atom Shop only makes you "learn" to make it.
---
There’s a big difference between contributing to a conversation and people just whining or bitching which usually included personal attacks to those who hold a different opinion... that’s kinda insane. 
---
We can have different opinions but once they go personal... their points are lost.
---
You need to go to an armor workbench and you can craft them there.
---
Loot boxes apparently cycle after something like 180 of them. Might also reset after 20 hours like other more static things in the game do (vendor caps, scrip, etc.)
---
If fusion cores are your thing then taking out Sentry Bots is a quick way to get cores and a good amount of XP to boot. Usually about 6 or so patrolling the Whitespring, kill, loot, server hop, rinse, repeat. I also used to PA frame hop across the map looking for fusion cores when I was lower level. The PA spawn points are known and mapped, just need to search.
---
It would be fun to his how even more laggy and unstable this dumpsterfire can become.
---
You get the items from the atomic shop by crafting them in the armor work bench.
---
Probably a “year of 76” ITV that glosses over any sort of issues with the game and paints a lovely picture of millions of satisfied customers and consistently improving updates throughout
---
That is actually really cute! I wish I was there to see it!
---
My cow has been dying a lot more lately.. nothing else though.
---
actually, one of the updates brought third person view and some character customization for no man's sky.  Some planets on their are absolutely beautiful, but i get what your saying about a handcrafted world having more warmth to it.
---
BACKWARDS
---
Not nearly far enough for a year. 
---
Still some bugs in game from fallout 4. Lots of new bugs have been introduced or brought back after being fixed. Not much new content compared to what other AAA titles have after a full year. 
---
Bethesda promised open communication with the community and no pay to win stuff but here with are with pay to win stuff and no communication at all other than the very occasional "we are aware of this issue and are currently looking into it" vs at launch there was more communication and no p2w f2p type of mechanics.
---
Just feels like they are going in the wrong direction a lot of the time
---
Edit: I realize I listed only negative things, i will say the game runs a million times better than at launch. Very rarely do I disconnect now and there are much less bugs. Also, bring back night time! I'm tired of constant daylight with occasional stars
---
They are the Neuclear Winter hackers obvioisly.
---
I want those modular power supplies. Why on Earth did they remove those from the shop?
---
Yeah, they went back to their camp that was extremely fortified and only had the bare minimum of what a living quarters should be, they had bunk beds though.
---
W: people to post these in F76 Marketplace H: nothing but downvotes for those that don’t
---
They are so fucking annoying they speak way to slow
---
I go around and trade junk and I can say there's a little issue when I go to someone every once in a while one of us can't trade with each other. The easy fix to it is traveling to an event real quick.
---
I meant to.
---
I've never done the challenge as I play solo. I'm 372 now and want to get this. It can't be sold can it?
---
One would hope all of them, before and after every patch. Reality is probably closer to none of them, and they're playing Outer Worlds in their downtime.
---
They blocked everyone in the server except for anybody that could prove that they were part of the brotherhood, they were pretty serious.
---
r/nobodycares
---
T-51b for the looks and high DR/ER, and because it's simply the classic Fallout PA.
---
T-60 is my every-day utility PA, though, because it's so much cheaper to repair.
---
Horde mode. You hole up inside one of the shops and fortify it against hordes of ghouls and/or scorched.
---
Help a FO76 player understand, why do u post and sub if you dont play the game? Not a diss...
---
Devs do not play the game.
---
QA plays the game, but for limited amounts of time and in limited scenarios  - that's how software development  works.
---
One step forward!  Aaaaaaand 2 steps back.
---
And would be almost impossible since the console are still a secure platform. If they were hacked, like the jtag on 360 it would be all about game sharing
---
Or you can buy it as a bundle and get a piece of cardboard and a lamp with it for 1500 atoms?
---
Side note: Maybe take one of those chill pills man I’m not into the rudeness.
---
I'd like to see a skin that can be applied to all weapons of a certain type instead of one specific weapon. The black and orange Halloween turret skins are fine, but would have been so much finer if they could have been applied to ALL turret types.
---
I had it happen once. I followed him and recorded him. Sent the video, and even recorded the audio from when he used voice chat. Blocked him, and his companion (the account he was farming for on a throw away account.) Because you know he even said it.
---
Dont feel bad. Report, and get evidence
---
Fallout 1st exclusive club potential? I’m *certain* they wouldn’t do that
---
Not once personally.
---
Yep bonkers! Was not complaining at all
---
Honestly: I wouldnt stay... But ill also let everyone I see comming into the restaurant know about my experience.
---
Yeah, sure: i would dig that restaurant in trip advisor so deep as I can, and if I see someone commimg in, I would advice them to eat elsewere.
---
I can help you out, PM me if you still have it ..
---
I mean if they keep working they’ll reach in sometime summer of 2020
---
Two steps forward and they are still walking backwards. Should we tell them about the cliff.......  Nope
---
Kids today... amirite?
---
hahahaha, made my day :D
---
The Vault 94 PA. Even if it is unpupular, it has some of the best stats in the game, and you can reskin it with some of the paintjobs you have.
---
I steal junk, I'm a dick
---
Yeah, the only way to fix it is to restart the game (use task bar to close fallout76.exe from there). I really love this bug /s, especially when I am in vault 94 raid, got a disease, and then taking an antibiotic / disease cure can cause this freeze.
---
Ignore him, the cat peed in his cereal this morning ..
---
Obvious Concern Troll is Obvious
---
This is not the appropriate subreddit for this kind of post
---
Given there are no macrotransactions, no deluxe edition and other Bullshit i find 60 bucks very fair. I just like to remind you that the 60 bucks price today usually just gives you that base or lite game. Even worse you can pay 100 bucks for the ultra super ultimate edition and still have lots of things behind a shop. I find the Outworlds very refreshing. you have one price and you get the full game. And yes, i would fund additional dlc's for money. Remember the time where 10 or 20 bucks got you a full expansion, not just a power-armor skin?
---
Kids have built-in aimbots.  Closer to 50 than 10 it is amazing how much slower my reactions are.
---
That's me as well, I hide in the bushes .. last match I had a team of 4 running in circles looking for me, was hilarious .. but I suck as well ... I need a 9 year old to help me ..
---
Yeah. That's nice and I dont care.
---
The OP was asking where the conflict and anger was coming from. I'm glad your having fun, but that doesnt negate the anger many folks have. 
---
It also doesnt answer the question the OP asked.
---
Desperately trying everything they can to keep going forward but ending up going backwards behind the starting line?
---
Because that was my first QWOP experience
---
Without the -2 perception
---
Considering how it was during the b.e.t.a. and where it is now and all the events and content that's dropped in between l, it has come a fuckin long way. With still a ways to go. But huge amount of potential
---
This has been established. It has also been established that it was an accident. A mistake. So everyone please calm down.
---
Awesome ty
---
Errbody needs a 9 year old. They’re awesome. You can’t have mine though I’ve invested too much. Haha
---
I must be lucky. Only ran into two cheaters over three days of grinding the 14k xp.
---
For some of those I perks you have it’s situational—you don’t need to have scrapper or armorer or pharmacist on all the time.
---
Welcome to the sick combination of FOMO and sunken time fallacy which is now called "live-service".
---
If they can monetize it...
---
He just sort of dropped the controller and made a face like, “this ain’t hard dad”. I said hush your face, pick up the controller, and get back to work. Daddy needs that glowing skeleton.
---
My first character. Always fast travelling from farming position to another. I am planning to stop fast travelling entirely when I start questing so I would discover more places
---
Thats not a true equivalance. It's basically sunken cost. This is more like paying for a lifetime membership to said restaurant that are the only servers of a type of cuisine. Lets call it _"FallOffel"_, and every time you go there they contintue to tell you how they're working on their menus, how people love their dishes and that their service is A Grade (despite patrons saying otherwise).
---
Some people will continue to go there after hearing of a new meal being added to the list or an indtroduction of new decor, new chefs, a new layout, extra space for more customers etc, but everytime you go there, the service is just as bad. But you've already bought that lifetime membership. Then they tell you, btw, your lifetime membership is subpar, and if you really want to get the best exprience with benifits, there's a Silver Service Membership which is on a rolling monthly fee (this is FalloutFirst)
---
Makes more sense than “if you hate it, just keep playing it.”
---
You're welcome :)
---
Seems crazy to me to be asking for more content when you've only amassed like 20 hours of play in  a year lol. You're not wrong though.
---
He asked me how come I use “that thing that auto targets?” (VATS) I said well son dad needs that to ever land a shot. He rolled his eyes.
---
Iv been playing 76 since beta and i havent finished the main quest yet and i havent had time to even begin exploring the cranberry bog section of the map
---
Personally I believe they've just reached the start line and I don't expect them to have the gas tank to run the race.
---
A lot of players felt hurt and lied to with the release of 76, even before that with how they handled the beta tests, and those feelings linger.
---
I'm just glad I finally get my refund.
---
First off, I never payed for fallout first  
---
Second off I defend it because you have options beyond paying and you refuse to use them.  
---
Either use your stash, scrap shit, use your mule, or deal with your loot being taken from you in completely optional PvP.
---
probably wont get fixed for a few months
---
Yes even weeks after quitting the game (after the fridge). I don't know what's wrong. It's is hard to say goodbye to me favorite franchise...
---
better summary than mine, thanks.
---
probably because they were planning to reliese a bunch of stuff with wastlanders but it was delayed and now there is nothing
---
Last time I played I ran a suppressors Laser Gatlin with some EX armor (mind you I have barely two perk cards for heavy guns) I mozied down to the bog and literally destroyed everything mirelurk Queens scorch beast didn't matter. But yes my suggestion
---
Seems pretty straightforward to me.
---
 They tripped over the starting line at the sound of the gun. They half crawled half stumbled for a bit and once they composed themselves looked up just in time to run face first into the first hurdle. Gingerly climbing over the  hurdle they started running forward again.
---
Then they knocked over the next hurdle throwing off their rhythm and crashed right into another. Realizing they were falling behind and were almost out of the race they jumped up and began running, but now in the wrong direction. Now the only chance they have to hit the finish line is to stay on course and keep running backwards flipping everyone the bird that bet on them while doing it.
---
someone uploaded a video of an expert solo for the dead in the water mission, so it is possible.
---
that said its much easier in a team and you wont eat anywhere near the amount of resources for solo.
---
Im not sure what you mean? 76 plays like a better version of fallout 4. People weren't exactly up in arms about how fo4 played. People have no patience for a living game they want a shiny polished 100% clean cut no experiments just better graphics and the same old story kinda game. which they will get eventually
---
I'm sorry man. It'll all be ok. Someday.
---
Nice try for upvotes dude...
---
Meeting new people is great. But i can also feel for those people saying this game helped me through a depression, or los. Kerbal Space Programm once helped me through a difficult time.
---
They show up everywhere. If you kill one the corpse will follow you around like a lost puppy.
---
Every little bit helps. Thank you for taking time to reply!
---
Got that Karma Farma perk I see.
---
excavator is my dad but before that was here definently t 60
---
I'am so waiting on Cyberpunk and Kerbal Space Programm 2.
---
None exist.
---
Even the ps4 number assumes the game is active 24 hours a day equally
---
PS4 not active though
---
Yeah small houses south of Grafton steel. Good spot.
---
My youngest is 9 I'm gonna try this lol
---
Yeah yeah and you are just another dumbass who supports pay to win mechanics
---
It was a ghost town.
---
My goodness this should have 1 million upvotes. It’s genius and should be extremely simple to implement.
---
 I can give you about 4 reasons why I do (Albeit taking a break rn myself to play skyrim)  
---
1) It's fun  
---
2) It's fun  
---
3) It's fun  
---
4) Fallout first, and the many amounts of "Drama" is bullshit and doesn't affect me or my gameplay  
---
Youtubers make news constantly on bethesda because the community constantly projects small issues into large outrages and the bigger fish get fried first. Like the class war thing isn't a real thing, but people want it to be, and that makes youtuber news on a class war even more inevitable. Like there's TONS to make news about, like RDR2's historic shitty PC port, EA being EA with regards to their move to steam, steam cloud, remote link for steam...etc. But there's also alywas that one youtuber who despite saying he needs to make his titles better, cause they always look clickbaity, makes a clickbaity title anyways.  
---
Not to mention there's like a leak every hour at this point, and there's a whole site dedicated to these 76 leaks that may or may be lying to drum up interest (Bethesda accidentally made a skin for the ranger armor a paid thing, but a day before it was fixed, a site said that there'd be exclusive microtransactions for fallout first, then said a day after bethesda had fixed it, that they meant to make it free and he had told bethesda to fix it)
---
Upvote whoever then lol i dont care for the karma
---
Evidence towards this?  
---
Bethesda has said they'd readd survival mode once they were done tweaking it. It was a beta after all.
---
I dont trust it either as its a dead 89,000
---
I DO deal with it, i consider it lost TRASH and engage pvp anyway because i don't back down unless out numbered 3 to 1 or better.   the POINT is pay to win players DON'T have to DEAL with it with unlimited scrap space.
---
Success in NW depends in the first part on random luck and good loot when you spawn, followed by your team and you, voice coms are a big help.
---
The X-01, as it just has this meaner look to it compared to the others. It just screams "I'm here and I mean business" regardless of who wears it.
---
If it wasn't for the fact that the F76 version is quite weak later on despite supposedly being a superior armour to it's predecessors, I'd have gone for the T-60.
---
Of course, the T-51B is and shall remain the poster child for Fallout.
---
&gt; And for the sake of argument lets say someone above them is putting a KS stamp overriding their rejection, again in most industries, once they begin to hemorrhage reputation and most importantly **money**, the person who overrode QA and put a KS on the issues would be brought in and held accountable 
---
Testers don't "reject" anything. The testers submit a bug through the system, oftentimes not ever meeting the devs because frankly, in many companies testers are looked down upon. The bugs are given different classification depending on what they do and the actual dev team/leadership would decide if they would fix it or not, in many cases simply labeling it as post-release. All they're really trying to do is pass cert, and sometimes they would find loopholes to do so. sonic 3d blast for the genesis is an example of one such loophole. They had a crash handler in the game and certification stated they weren't allowed to have one, so one of the programmers changed it so that if any crash he accounted for occurred, it would take you to a "secret level select" screen. He did similar tricks with toy story and a mickey mouse game as well. 
---
One of the things you need to realize is that at game companies, QA is looked at as bottom of the barrel as far as staff goes, and they're often times treated as such. Bureaucracy lets incompetent people and practices rise to the top. 
---
Games need to be shipped in a certain amount of time. If a game needs to go out in time for the quarter, it *will* get shipped, bugs or not. I could go down a list spanning from the c64 days (Robocop by ocean is literally unbeatable because they set a time limit on level 3 that was unreasonable so you couldn't get to level 4 and find out it was broken) to modern games. (sonic 06) The advent of the internet has only taught companies and gamers alike to expect bugs because "They can always patch it later."
---
Companies slapping KS on bugs and kicking it out the door is not secret. It's not hard to find interviews with testers and devs saying "Yeah, they told us to do it." This is a known and well documented problem in the game industry that you can find yourself in many places. 
---
&gt; Again every job I've had the people allowing these forks to diverge this significantly would have been fired. 
---
Again, you're assuming competence at a base level we know doesn't exist. Every port of skyrim launched with nearly the same bugs that the original skyrim launched with years earlier. Even on the same sku, similar bugs were reintroduced to later builds. 
---
When you do open source work (which it's clear you do and are very familiar with) there is an immediate reaction when someone bumbles in and screws something up because you're not being paid to do it. It's not a workplace where addressing Ken's use of a / instead of a \\ ends up wasting hours of time. IF you have an issue with a person who is adding to the project, you can just give them the boot. They can't do that at a corporate environment, and if we're all honest with each other, most people wouldn't bother, because it's just more work, and if they reported them to a team lead, it would likely cause friction and they might even be told they're rocking the boat and to knock it off. 
---
&gt;Do we make mistakes?  
---
&gt;Hell yes, but we usually find and fix them quickly, and if we actually got feedback and communication with the Dev's the quality of what we would submit would rise significantly almost overnight.
---
That's because when you submit you put your name on it. People are going to see what you did, and most importantly, because you're not being paid for it, you're going to be passionate about it and protect it. That's the difference between the open source community and corporate. Everything you've suggested can be classified as more work, and the idea they'd take on more than their already meager team assigned to 76 has is laughable. 
---
&gt; But passion alone won't keep a ship afloat. 
---
What will keep 76 afloat is fallout 1st. What will keep it afloat is the atomic shop. What will keep it afloat are the people who just don't care and will gladly play and pay for it even with the bugs. What will keep Bethesda afloat are the people who will shrug their shoulders and buy Starfield even after their experience with 76. People will buy ES6 because they played skyrim, or because they don't care or know about what happened with 76. Bethesda will never learn their lesson because they keep making money, and in the end as long as you are making money, what else do you have to worry about? They knew when they marched out on stage to roaring applause at E3 they had *nothing* to worry about. 
---
It's sad, but business isn't a meritocracy. 
---
Sorry for the long post, but this is a very complex issue. In the end, laziness and incompetence is almost always the answer to why a problem exists, and in this case it's everywhere from the beancounters who say a game should only take *this* long to complete and it has to be out by then, to the people who are supposed to hold their staff accountable.
---
I'll take a few downvotes just to say i upvoted this post.
---
It's sad enough a fan of fallout can't recommend this game.  I'm fairly certain you'd want to recommend it if you could in good conscience.  I normally don't "vote" on posts, but i find it downright stupid that people are downvoting you for informing your fellow consumer on a purchase decision.
---
Its Xbox too...forgot to add to my list...a simple fix on Xbox is turning off controller for 5 seconds..it doesn't last long
---
Very thanks!! I am level 52, but completely a newbie (I play solo)... This tips are useful!!
---
Yesterday I got the jump on a guy sitting on a ledge.  Laid into him with my radium rifle, didn’t miss a shot, and he turned and killed me.
---
It’s not just you, NW has some damage/to-hot slider based on age.  I don’t know how the game knows, but it knows!
---
They can start a guild or something. They’ll be unbeatable.
---
There's been several psots about hackers, and in all likelyhood even if bethesda bans the ones currently on NW, there'll always be more. With PC, cheating, hacking, and aimbots are inevitable.
---
Oh.. yea, I killed 3 random ones that spawned at the train station near my base (just east of Silo Alpha) just like... 6 hours before that.. they hadn't followed me up until that point though .... and only this one spawned in my base after being there for 15 minutes. Weird!
---
Any sane company would celebrate their game at the one year milestone with some in game freebies, some for sale items, maybe even a QOL patch of long requested items.
---
I expect zip from Bethesda except a free player icon...maybe...
---
I was in a Responder role play group some months ago. Some of the best times I've had in the game. None of us were real pvp aces but we did a series in survival where for 4 weeks we played a narrative that changed with how the previous week went. We had pve objectives for each week too. 
---
I determined the narrative and even put together videos recapping what happened and what was ti come. Ultimately the turnout was not what I hoped and it was time consuming so we ended the narrative early and I left the group. We were real strong on Facebook discussion but not so much on game play lol. 
---
That's what I always wanted from 76. Fun role play and dynamic encounters out in the world. For a few weeks, I had it and really enjoyed it. Tip of the cap to these role players, I hope they are having fun.
---
Well that’s a big part of it sure. He got a gauss and chameleon serum. But still, his first shot accuracy compared to mine is night and day.
---
I've seen a mr handy and a miss nanny conversing just like the Google Home and Amazon' Alexa did, middle of the road in the Mire lol
---
One was black and other was white just like the home products lol
---
OK boomer
---
They refuse to try it because everyone hates on it
---
Thanks I can’t wait to get a higher level
---
People like that are what keep MMOs great.
---
 I have had that issue off and on as well.
---
&lt;3
---
Lmao I’m annoyed with y’all that it took this many comments for this to hit the thread
---
Free icon in Atomic Shop.
---
Yeah probably.
---
Cool. How many hundreds of times did you do the exact same thing without results even close to this?
---
That's why i can't play any of my characters at end game.  Its a boring crapshoot 90% of the time, loot is 99% of the time useless and the only consistent progress is building up caps to trade with so you can do that same task a tiny bit better when you do finally make that trade.
---
You're the one calling those bans, I've called them suspensions from the get go. So why you choose to use the incorrect terms is on you.
---
There has to be a Mr. Handy to do the ba dum tis on a drum set
---
Pay to win assumes there is a goal in 76, of which there isn't...
---
MMO and P2W don't mesh. MMOs uses pay for convience (As any ESO player will tell you)
---
ESO Plus gives you a unlimited craft bag (Basically like a 76 scrapbox for only crafting materials), a monthly crown stipend, and free acess to any future and current DLC
---
And I can guarantee that 1sters still deal with losing shit and junk since you never know when a PvPer wants to gank you. You're complaining that people who paid for something aren't going thru the same problems as you while ignorantly assuming that 1sters aren't going to lose junk or anything while you as a non-1ster are losing junk because of YOUR OWN ACTIONS. If you get ganked in 76 after engaging in PvP, don't cry about how you lost your junk because you chose to A) fight a guy b) refuse to scrap stuff c) don't manage your stash or your own weight too well.
---
I'am mostly playing on 2 midrange priced gaming notebooks (with RTX1050 an 1060). It is just more comfortable. I can play them in the garden, on the bed. I realized i use them more than my 3000 dollar, self build desktop rig. Bang for the buck was never as good in notebooks as it is nowadays. And for 1500 USD you get decent hardware for most games which is sufficient for about 2 years.
---
Did you tell him Xmas was canceled?
---
I’ll tell him after we get that glowing skeleton
---
Whatever it is, it will either be monetized, or impossibly broken (or both).
---
Probably both
---

---
I love approaching it from the north as well! Seeing the futuristic city rising above the flat bog, just towering over the wastes, still manages to impress!
---
Not sure if I should Lol or Cry.  
---
 :-)
---
Honestly (in my opinion) 76 current state is no glitchyer then Skyrim. But you know 76 in intolerable but Skyrim is a masterpiece...
---
You may want to check the beef_curtians ama in this subreddit(he is the biggest hacker on NW) they absolutely use CE in NW to hack, all the hackers do is change the name of the program to "spotify".
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cmgetg/ama_i_am_the_infamous_beef_curtons_i_have_been/
---
Also you may want to read the full context of what I linked, he is explaining that Bethesda can tell the difference between those using CE to view memory vs those that use it to modify the memory or ESM files.
---
specifically because Fo76 is so barren. there are no main or side quests to get in my way when roleplaying. I don't need to join X faction before I can access Y area, mostly.
---
the last time I played Fo4 I removed most npcs and quests and modded the game to focus on the survival aspect instead of the story. if I game like that released tomorrow I'd definitely drop Fo76. unlike people here I have to emotional attachment to this mess.
---
Not facts.  
---
This is your opinion. You're arguing that they turned the game into a quick cash grab by adding in a subscription service that's completely optional, and a in-game store that's completely optional.  
---
They did release an ITV after First was revealed, and why would they need to tell you well we released first because of so and so. Would you rather DLC was paid for?  
---
I guarantee that the atom shop and fallout first are paying for them to bring us free DLC as they promised.  
---
And patches do that, sometimes a new patch brings old bugs back, it happens, they'll fix them as they can.  
---
Bethesda isn't gonna communicate every time they ban a player or fix a bug, what, do you tell everyone every time you shit the bed?
---
Bethesda really should add in game matchmaking and factions/guilds that would help make things like this a regular occurrence.
---
It sounds like he’s played the hell outta the game.
---
Smart.
---
Idk, I just got back into the country after being super out of the loop because of work, things seemed to go real sour, real fast. I guess it’s because the game has many features that are subscription based now? That would be fine if this game was worth a subscription, but it’s very clearly not. Again, I don’t know the details, but as long as I can still play with my friends who are whales and do subscribe, I don’t see the issue.
---
There shoud be a side quest to find them joke books too.
---
ESO also had subscription to pay going on before One Tamriel, and you were blocked out of certain regions for random requirements.
---
What is the point of offering any constructive feedback?  Rather than fix the game itself, Bethesda turns those suggestions into more microtransactions.
---
Thing is, I used to be one of those few defending the game not long ago. I truly believed that Bethesda would do what was better for the game and turn it around. With Wild Appalachia I was *convinced* that things were on the right track. 
---
Sad that they have made so many bad decisions in such a short period of time.
---
ESO also did sub to play.
---
It is in fact BGS Austin alone as BGS Maryland is working on Starfield and TES6, Montreal is their mobile studios, dallas is believed to be their VR studio.
---
Especially agree now that Bethesda has a new reoccurring revenue stream in the form of 1st.
---
I would think they want those "free" sub atoms spent before each new package is added to the Atom Shop. Limiting what is available to buy means the people proven to be willing to spend more money(sub) have less reason to buy more atoms on top of what they get.
---
Going to link this thread to the official boards and add the topic for discussion there.

I believe Fallout 4 got praised for its gunplay since 3 and NV had some GOD AWFUL gunplay, if you weren't spamming vats half the time in 3, you were dying.
---
Yes I would rather pay for DLC, at least then the content was actually made and released on time. But it being free DLC doesn’t negate the fact that they are slacking in everything possible. Their paid DLC so far in previous games have been amazing. This free stuff is lackluster at best.  
---
Hey they promised they wouldn’t cross the cosmetic only line but here we are on the other side of that line. 
---
Patches bringing old bugs back isn’t common in most other games but Bethesda has a “first” for everything right? 
---
I never said anything about communicating over a banned player, you seem to be projecting here. Also I don’t know how often you’ve shit the bed to include it as an analogy but a simple “hey we’re working on X bug that people have been reporting, we’ll get back to you on it when we can” would go a long way. That took me 3 seconds to type. That isn’t asking for much
---
Oo
---
If I get killed by the lollipop guild, I'm going to take up sewing.
---
Bethesda isn't gonna sell the Fallout rights my guy, not even if this spinoff does go f2P, they still have many ideas for a mainline fallout game.  
---
And i doubt it's gonna go f2p, and people are still playing it and buying it today i'm sure.
---
yeah but people were claiming since months that some people of the other studios were responsible for quests and other coding parts for 76 before and during release but by now it seems if that was to be true by now every other participating studio was pulled from this project
---
I've got a plate and have no idea how I got it, but have desperately been trying to get the center piece for my display. How do you actually keep them in your inventory after event?
---
Ahhh, yeah. You get into a farming route and you just get used to it for sure. One thing I liked to do on my original character (who probably has discovered 95% or more of the whole map at this point) was to just go somewhere random in the world and start heading towards whatever is on the compass that he hasn't discovered. I still need to do that on my new main. You're gonna find a lot of 'em!
---
No... that’s 1500/hour. 20x3x500=1500. So I guess it’s more like 9 hours 20 mins.
---
Ps4 too
---
So you're saying if you pay 13$, you automatically create a bug free experience?
---
Even the normal Fallout enjoyment of scavenging and using up junk has so many limits.
---
Stash limit (unless you want to pay for Fo1st).
---
Vendor and overall caps limit which limits selling off.
---
Gear repair basically gets to the point so you don't actually need much resources.
---
Crafting system limited again by caps for selling off. 
---
With the current crafting system there's no point in craft gear to use (or sell to others) because they aren't legendaries.
---
Hopefully Wastelanders has some resource sinks to make finding junk have more of a point again. Even if it's as simple as a donate junk to them to move a meter and an aural pat-on-the-back from NPCs (at this point I wouldn't even care if it actually tied into any gameplay system, just a junk black hole and a thin thematic 'you're helping, thanks').
---
From what I've looked up, ESOs crafting writs does seem like a neat system.
---
Hopefully they don't eat up a third of the camp budget if they do. If I have to choose between 1 follower and losing a huge portion of my camp, I'm keeping my camp.
---
Confused by this, as with pacifist on this doesn't work against me. Does he own a workshop?
---
Also have a handful of challenges that are bugged and can't finish them ex: discover locals in the ash heap Im still missing Beckley even though I've cleared and searched the entire area dozens of times.
---
Oh dear god, my kids are gonna end up being gaming legends in that case lol (I'm not the best but I regard myself as fairly decent)
---
Craft at an armor workbench
---
It's awesome! And there are growing communities all over, Enclave, BoS, raider. I absolutely love it. Wait till you encounter a gourmand lol
---
*Exploiting* a cheat versus *verifying* its existence is a huge gap that you seem unable to comprehend.
---
Exploiting that cheat means utilizing it to have an advantage over others.  Those people should be banned.
---
Then you have the volunteer bug testers who replicate the exploit a few times to no benefit to themselves in order to record and report it for the sake of everyone's game experience.
---
Apples and oranges.
---
Craft it
---
The DLC for 76 has been released on time so far (Wastelanders was delayed so 2 out of 3 isn't bad)  
---
Also people hit bethesda hard for Nuka World and Automatron since Nuka world forces you to be evil to actually have DLC content to deal with, and automatron was a small DLC that could have been in the game, and don't get anyone started on the workshop packs.  
---
There was a interview done about the repair kits and scrap kits where they see them as a kinda gray option, which they are, yeah I can see how they feel P2W, but you're not relal wining anything by buying one and you could easily not buy them.  
---
They've been doing that in each ITV they release for every week they release one, sometimes they choose not to comment cause sometimes they don't want to step on Developer toes.
---
But we paid for the game, I’m going to hate it but it’s stuck in my library. Just like Flappy Bird
---
Oh hey this flamethrower let's me infinitely disarm it for xp and junk, I'll recreate this two or three times on different servers to verify it is exploitable then send all of that data in a bug report and never do this again because it's unfair to others.
---
VS
---
Oh hey this flamethrower let's me infinitely disarm it for xp and junk, I'm gonna sit on it for 4 hours a day power leveling and getting all the steel scrap and fuel I'll ever possibly need.
---
So this is the same exact thing to you...?
---
They popped red being hit by someone who is wanted while being sparky. Must not have been in pacifist.
---
At first, it was Maryland, Austin, and one of their other studios (believe it was either Dallas or Montreal) during like the earliest part of development, it was originally fallout 4 DLC that would introduce quakecode powered multiplayer to fallout 4, but since it became a bigger and bigger project, one that even broke the Atlas, they had to move towards a new prequel game, Bethesda maryland then gave the project to austin after they had helped them a bit with it, and then went to work on starfield and then tes6, which is currently Austin is alone on this one. Montreal is working on the mobile games (FOS, CK, and TESB), Dallas is either their VR studio or has a unannounced focus.  
---
EDIT: People will mention "Why not ask for help from ZOS (Zenimax Online Studios)?", well, ZOS is working on ESO until ESO development ends, and since ESO, like WoW, has expansions, I doubt they'll ever not be busy (Hell ESO just released Elsweyr)
---
I’ve found that selecting the favourites wheel deliberately fixes it so that next time you use it it works
---
Small, I believe, might be referring to The Burrows in HF and the large is Vault raid like you mentioned.
---
Me and my friends used to be enclave players but we recently turned to Being diehards.
---
Whenever my kid takes out a “noob” on Fortnite he says, “that was probably a dad playing”. I should probably ground him, but he’s seen me play.
---
The larger AP pool is noticeable for me when using unyielding.
---
Should have played today.  Most blatant cheater I saw in awhile was instantly wiping squads today..literally killed half the server by the time my squad died.  Fortunately I only saw him once, but he didn't care people knew he was cheating.  The harder to detect ones are the ones who don't use it 24/7 in a game.
---
IT KNOWS
---
Why are u gay
---
That would be the best little Easter egg
---
You might want to head over to r/fo76filthycasuals. They’re pretty chill over there
---
Back in quake 2 I was annihilating people with a railgun without a mouse, just my trusty pageup/pagedown keys.  I was crazy good in CS 1.6 with the Scout and TMP.  Now I'm in my mid thirties and arthritis is starting to set in.  I'm old. :(
---
Mostly it's fun.  Also to guage the state of the fanbase and see if fallout fans are still shilling their money to bethesda so they can continue to make shitty games and fuck us over
---

Nearing 1200 hours, and all 5 characters finished quests/story.  I think my lowest is 82?  Regardless I love company.  
---
I play later in the evening, pacific standard time.  I have a larger community of well established fo76 friends and always welcome new players.  I may be in my own private world, or public if I want to get some vendor sales.  Regardless of where I may be, your welcome to join me, or vice verse.  
---
I will try to remember to add you this evening and get some play time with you.

The writs were neat because they were a resource sink for specific cosmetics. Kind of like possum badges. However, they were a nightmare without ESO+, and a lot of dedication to finding plans.   Work and luck comparison to 76 would be something like: set up camp in a fissure. Craft 6 nukashines 3 hi-tech tables, and 4 decontamination showers for half a possum badge. (For some of the better ones)
---
Why not both? We are hoomans after all.
---
The only issue I have is people in NW can be a holes, I play alone a lot because my Mic sucks you hear cussing, drug use, etc when is the right time for kids to hear that Crap
---
Share YouTube video?
---
I think all Fallout 4 got was a very hastily written blurb on the title screen with more misspellings than your average Reddit post.
---
I'm not expecting much.
---
It's got this cheery dystopia thing going on.  "Welcome to the Watoga, the City of the Future!"  Even though it's falling apart and filled with homicidal robots, the chirpy voiceover never stops.
---
He didn't own one as far to my knowledge, all I know is the guy kept meleeing the guy to spark off ele-charge before absolutely decimating him.
---
PVP ? Would rather fight ghouls dressed as elves.
---
Huh? Yeah it dont work when they try it with me. Idk. I'm glad tho. Lol
---
There are actually a large number of spawn points for cores.  Thats in addition to  the dozen or so PA spawn points just in the forest, BTW)
---
Get batteries included to reduce their weight, and power user to increase their life.
---
ATM, a 50% core lasts me about 7 hours (I dont vats or have a jet pack)
---
some events reward them (line in the sand adn the one in Camden park)

Well we have a headset that has a “slider” on it that controls volume of chat vs game audio. So he basically turns off chat volume if he hears something inappropriate. 
---
And tbh I’ve actually found that I can hardly ever find someone with a mic on in NW anyway (Xbox). He’s played 6 matches so far and we haven’t heard a single peep. Ymmv

From a lore perspective, I actually love it. The more you wander around Charleston, the more you feel the evil of David's raiders
---
 In your Nvidia Control panel setting for Fallout 76, you should have Performance for the Power Saving setting and Fast for the Vsync setting. Seems to help.
---
I'd be happy to have quest or something to upgrade from the Pip-Boy 2000 to the Pip-Boy 3000. Maybe in Wastelanders...
---
It would technically violate the subs rules against witch hunting. Have  no doubt that people target cheaters whenever they can, so if it was allowed, the mods would technically be allowing targeted attacks on players.
---
I would assume thete considered witch hunting.
---
I think when they play it, their experience resembles the Private Servers, where timer lag and unresponsive Terminals aren't a thing, and so they don't fix them.  Time and again (no pun intended), these show up as problems.  Whether it's the Vault Raid timer, or something as basic as Jester refusing to let you ignite the Mischief Night fire, that lag doesn't happen on Private Servers.
---
There's the enclave military paint that makes it puke green.
---
You're better off leaving it with the prototype paint job.  I regret putting on military paint just to find out I can't go back to the prototype paint.
---
During the E3 free week this is exactly what I thought too
---
You can randomly get crits without VATS, but the critical meter in VATS lets you select when your next critical occurs. If you watch the top left corner of your screen you'll see a notification when your "hip fire" crits occur, but most of the time people don't pay attention to it because they're in the middle of combat.
---
They should tell you what rule you are violating when it’s taken down. My guess is either witch-hunting or click bait title. I don’t know specifically what you are referring to.
---
LOL
---
Ppl not running around in pacifist.
---
The amount of times I reached a marker only to realize it wasn't even mine all along. This would be something appreciated by the majority of players I'm sure.
---
Or through any solid object.
---
There's also the lovely insta-vats accuracy glitch...I swear it's a glitch.  If you attack immediately after entering vats before the percentages are locked in you'll basically have almost always a 95% hit chance, enemy ran behind a wall but you vatsed it at the last second and fired, your attack will hit them through the wall.
---
Works with melee though the lunge animation is what allows you to basically teleport through any solid surface.
---
I was going to cry “child labor” then I realized you were hooking him up with one of the most valuable currencies known to young men.  Haha in all realness though that’s awesome, and really cool you guys can bond over Fallout!  Cheers
---
Interesting post.  I’m curious if this is a new anti-underground effort vs. wastelanders setup.
---
I'm a fan of the T-51 Santa armor, especially with a jet pack. I like to fly around launching mini-nukes at scorched. It just puts me in the holiday spirit.
---
I'll answer that question after I've had my hands on Wastelanders for at least a week.
---
Did you play NW?
---
To be fair, it's called the sunk cost *fallacy*.
---
That is vault 79. The passcode is all 0s.
---

---
Watch some of my flatwoods general store videos. Definitely worthy of your caps
---
Not a thing
---
You can do sneak attacks. But sneak attacks are not crits
---
&gt; *Outside of V.A.T.S., critical hits cannot occur 
---
(**Fallout 4 only**) &gt;
---
~~unless something increases the player character's critical hit chance, such as with Overdrive, or if the attack is a Sneak Attack.~~
---
~~This can be confirmed by looking at the "Combat - Critical Strikes" statistic in the Pip-Boy. The number of critical strikes will always equal the number of times a Critical was activated in V.A.T.S. plus the number of sneak attacks.*~~
---
&gt; *Although the Pip-Boy counts a sneak attack as a critical hit, a sneak attack does not count as a critical hit for purposes of critical hit damage bonuses.*
---
Fun fact:  Railway Rifles have the farthest projectile reach.  They move slow over a large distance but they don't dissipate like energy or have a max distance like bullets.
---
You can literally snipe enemies outside of rendering range with the railway rifle as long as you shoot where they're going to be.
---
It's the only weapon I ever put a long scope on, the projectile travels what seems like 2-3x the max distance of any bullet or energy projectile.
---
I also occasionally get booted out of trade to display the favorites wheel...but that might just be me.
---
It wasn't fun it was pointless.
---
It wasn’t underground, there is a cave up there that connected the top and bottom, I had a little staircase through it but they added a floor in the middle and there is a key pad that lets you enter a code, like getting the space suits
---
You can't sell them but if you could their worth max caps at least maybe more as their not easy to get...
---
Memes and a glimpse into madness
---
It's a trap! Nice
---
I've had that place marked for so long, considering if I should move my camp there or not. I went there earlier today to show a friend of mine about the location and found it to be blocked off.
---
It would have been really cool to have a camp there and it saddens me a bit that I won't ever be able to. But also I'm much too attached to my camp in the forest.
---
You could spread the word so more people know not to play it on PC. Hopefully a low player count would show them they need to take notes from other companies that have made multiplayer games before and implement an anti cheat software.
---
Has to be new content then.  I’m curious if you can use a cook fire to glitch an underground base.  Try a wall on the outer parameter buildable limits and glimpse the internals.  
---
I’ll have to go looking tonight
---
😂😂😂
---
It's a real thing, a group on FB. It's made clear several times that its just a joke and that they're actually trying to get away from the hate that fo1st gets, as well as just 76 in general. It got blown out of proportion as is usual and at the end of the day, most of us just want to be left alone
---
It really grinds my gears when people compare TOW to Fallout. 
---
It’s made by the same people that made a couple of Fallout games, that’s it. That’s where the comparison stops. 
---
It’s no wonder they’ve prohibited talking about it, it literally has nothing to do with the sub.
---
Well, for some reason, younger kids have a easier time with BR type games. Why, idk. But it's the same with fortnite and all. When I play when kids are usually in school, I do eh. Better than usual. But on weekends and when kids are out? Nope. And I don't like losing to 10 year olds
---
death threats are not ok "even as someone who now hates bethesda I can't imagine giving threats"  
---
but the outer worlds comment made me LOL because you know a lot of players that gave up after the 76 lies and BS were probably posting about it
---
I dont think theres any denying that its a toxic sub, if the mods have been forced to make a "stop threatening to kill each other" announcement theres just no hiding it anymore
---
It's also bugged to miss a bunch at 95% until you stop firing and start again.
---
I've noticed this at 33.  I feel like I make it up in strategy and experience but I definitely lose on reflexes.  
---
There's a reason that you rarely find anyone over 25 in eSports.  It's crazy.
---
r/thathappened
---
I keep wondering exactly what kind of scam this is.
---
Your post history indicates that you made this exact same post 5 months ago.  
---
Don't know what you're up to but it smells bad
---
Trust me I get it. I could barely believe what my eyes had just seen. If I had known it was going to happen maybe I could have taken a video, but oh well.
---
We don't have many PVP events so
---
I'm level 140 and I haven't even gotten to the brotherhood quest line. I did a few of the main ones like following the over seer and Rose. But that's about it
---
The first time I read this, I thought you said you were 16 (years old) and you had a 9 year old son! I was like WTF?!?
---
But yeah. Welcome to the club, my 12 year old has been better than me at competetive shooters for a while now. 
---
I'll let you in on a little secret though... Download the Mega Man Legacy collection, let him get real frustrated and then show him how it's done! 😁
---
I want the game to be good, maybe they should have aimed for coop play. I had some really good sessions on FO76 early on when there was a lot to explore and I played with other people as a team. But the game got so buggy I would lose time, the economy has always been garbage (maybe vendors fixed it a bit), and they asked for more money but did not fix the game. Then shameless money grab, make Wastelanders good and free dlc I might come back and if I am blown away I may open up and buy some atoms (although the prices are silly so unlikely other than a couple things I really like rather than my usual buy everything completionist approach).
---
But Bethesda follows up with one scummy scandal after another.
---
r/nothingeverhappens
---
I still have yet to see any “game breaking” bugs in my ~140 hours of play. I assume I am just really lucky but the worst I saw was the T-Posing enemies in the Beta.
---
Nice deleting your post /u/mazterbelen immediately after I called it out - added your user name this time for your future scams.
---
When it first came out it was fun until all the cheater and bunny jumping bitches started to exploit the game, And I bet if I get on now all I'll see is dudes jumping and dudes cheating. At least on pc.
---
Sorry. Someone already helped me.
---
OK, Boomer!
---
The outta worlds one was put up because people there had already hyped it as being better then FO76 in every way.... months before it was released
---
So glad I was bright enough to quit this game after the first month of playing it.  Super great potential.  Super big fail.
---
