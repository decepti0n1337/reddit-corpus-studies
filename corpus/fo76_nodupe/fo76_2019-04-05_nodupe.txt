Some people just seem to love throwing around "pay to win". People seem to forget that there are perks to reduce costs. Not to mention that atom shop repair kits don't repair 200% like the one you get from a queen. Not to mention you can get atoms really easily. 
---
Honestly, even if repair kits were FREE in the atom shop I wouldn't care because I always like my armor and weapons at 200%.
---
---
---
Every day. Pretty much continuously. I’m trying to figure out the fastest way to rank up so I can get that sweet sweet power armor. 
---
Seriously?! That’s ridiculous! Didn’t they announce their intention of replacing them back in January?
---
I have about 932 beers left over from the last month's atom challenges. 
---
I'm going to take your cntrl c and v keys.
---
How tf are some robot stims “ pAY 2 WiN.” Not that I agree with what they’re doing but they aren’t pay to win.
---
This is nothing but wild fucking speculation that is undermined by the very first sentence in your post 
---

---
"We're exploring ways......"
---
If that's confusing, let me help. 
---
It doesn't say "These items and features will exclusively be available through the atomic shop"
---
Thanks for the downvotes, but seriously, I don't grief people or condone it.  
---
That being said, if you take your kids out to play with other kids, YOU FUCKING SUPERVISE THEM.
---
  
---
This guy made a choice to leave his kid ALONE WITH OTHERS ON A VIRTUAL PLAYGROUND.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
TL:DR - It must work the way it does because . . . Reasons!
---
I don't know for certain, but I have my suspicions as to why this happens.
---
I believe it has something to do with how time works in relation to server hopping.  The game appears to take the time at present and adjusts for time passed  based on the time on the new server you join.  So if you eat and drink and it’s noon on your server then hop to a new server OR logout for the day, when you enter the new server it checks tie time of day and calculates the time passage.  So if the new server time is 6 am, the game believes 18 hours have passed in relation to when you last ate.
---
Again I have not tested, this is pure speculation and conjecture.  
---
It may also be related to how time is displayed on your pipboy.  When ever you logout or server hop the date on your pipboy resets to October 23rd.  So if you have been playing on a server for several in game days you will notice the game date passes correctly.  Eat food and server hop and the game possible calculates time passed as being about a year since you last ate or drank.
---
Just a guess.
---
I don't believe there is a fix.  And the reason for this is because of the 20 minutes of game time that passes for each minute of real world time that passes.  If the dates never reset you would QUICKLY advance through fallout history.  You would rapidly catch up to Fallout 3's time frame, and so on.
---
This all relates to why time is skewed in the first place in fallout games.  
---
In fallout games the maps are not 1:1 in scale to real world maps.  So walking across the wasteland ruins of I.e. Washington DC would take much longer than the 15 minutes of real world time you spent in your living room.  The game adjusts for this by advancing time proportionally.
---
Again I have no evidence or proof, I am just thinking this out logically.
---
Time must work like this because of fast travel in the stand alone games.  If you travel a great distance, time must pass or fast travel would be tantamount to teleportation.  Which brings us to our next problem in temporal distortion for Fallout 76.  
---
In Fallout 76 fast travel IS TELEPORTATION.  It occurs instantly.  As far as I can tell for the same reason you cannot have proper V.A.T.S. when playing with other people, you cannot advance time for fast travel.  If you did, every player in a server would experience time differently, I.e. each person would see a different time of day, for some it would be morning, others would experience Night and so on and so forth.
---
So, why not just make the game time REAL TIME based on the current time in West Virginia?  Again we must refer to the scale of the map.  Again it’s not 1:1 with the real world.  You cannot walk across West Virginia in 15 minutes.  But time is not skewed enough for the amount of time it WOULD take to walk across the state of West Virginia.  The larger a world BGS creates the worse the time scale would need to be skewed to give the appearance of a good amount to time passage for distance traveled.
---
Unless they used a 1:1 map with real world time, and no possibility of fast travel. . .  But, this is just a game.  Kindly suspend your disbelief, it’s just easier if you do. ;). Oh, and sorry about your food.  Just think of it as a Tax on time dilation or something along those lines.
---
Right now is this a policy issue not to re-instate accounts, or is it a technical reason?  It seems they don't know what to do so they just don't do anything at all.  Beth hasn't made any announcements.
---
Thanks it gave me a well needed laugh. 
---
the downvotes say otherwise. again bethesda broke a promise. dont speak anymore on this issue.
---
Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad!
---
No wonder. They haven't added anything of note to an ostensibly 'live' game since launch outside the atom-shop (yes I understand it's a different team and most was already created...). We've had one fetch-quest, ONE new event and some humdrum alcohol crafting mechanics. That's it. The game came out 5 months ago - what the fuck do they expect people to do in it? Just shite.
---
Don't get me wrong, I really quite enjoyed my play-through and a bit despite it's glaring flaws. But this is meant to be an online game that keeps you engaged and I can't say it has, I've logged in twice in the last month, probably only a little more in March and got bored within an hour or so - and sort of resented the time wasted. I only still pop on here to see if there's news given this was a game I had hopes for.
---
Is it currently in the game? Haven't been on in a while. 
---
Not only that... but I know so many people who have been hoarding items in their stash for the past couple weeks knowing that player vending was coming on April 9...  now they (and me, also!) have to wait another whole month with barely any space to do anything.  
---
...and if you can, land on someones head.
---
Yup, this is one I picked up. The fish lamp and fireplace are also great.
---
I got holo tape play it all the time
---
Didnt they already kind of break the promise when they put out the superheroes outfit? Yes its cosmetic, but for a couple of days the outfits have stat boost on them. 
---
This game isn’t already dead?
---
Im on ps4
---
NoooOOOOOOOOoooo why didn’t anyone tell me?!
---
What system you on? I can send you the evidence I captured. Don't assume I'm just salty I got killed, I have plenty of video evidence that this player couldn't be killed.
---
Elaborate on what that armor does for a player, I don't know what it does but unless it regenerates your health constantly at an extreme rate, I doubt this player is legit 
---
New content this Tuesday tho
---
Again, my point was money per hour is a silly and childish way to judge entertainment. 
---
Because they probably do. Nobody is as original as we all believe ourselves to be. We have all been done before. And there has always been someone there to write down what that is. 
---
I got downvoted to oblivion for sharing this opinion.
---
Swing speed. Power attack is AP dependent and you run out. Swing speed is forever. 
---
Nothing wrong with all of this but PLEASE add it in-game too. Repair kits from vendors at train station, fridge / auto-scrapper and so on from quest recipes or world drop recipes or vendor recipes... I think them adding these items to the store isnt the issue, it's that they are potentially ONLY adding these items to the store.
---
I wouldn't mind the option to spend atoms on a minor convenience like repair kits (given that I dont care much for cosmetics) but only if it is readily available for caps in-game and so gives me no real advantage over anyone else.
---
Yes! I enjoy both of these, I really dig the firer. Also, I just realized you asked about skins, my bad
---
Not making a point just saying. Mobile repairing only makes sense in an area where benches don’t exist or if the new  Burrow doesn’t come with any.
---
Stop wining other games have em. U wasted a whole day writing this. Its gonna be ok. Nothing ever makes anyone happy
---
Don't waste your time with the bunker. It's grotesquely overpriced.
---
Yeah but they said it would take about 4 months or so, so hopefully, end of this month
---
This is basically a cosmetic. It's impact is 0. 
---
It's a hat for people that let's you know their dumb and lazy. Take their money.
---
You also easily earn platinum in game by selling the drops you get to other players. My boyfriend and I have a pretty stable stream of platinum and I haven't really played the game that much.
---
Thanks for the support everyone, love you all. &lt;3
---
So... Remember those lunch boxes that sounded like loot boxes? 
---
How much are we going to bet that they'll be available after these repair kits? -\_-'
---
Everyone, please; discourage this garbage from coming in. I can't any more. I really can't keep going on if this actually becomes a thing for Fallout 76.
---
Bethesda we know you see this please change your mind about this. Its a cool game mechanic but it should not be monetized. We are the ones keeping the game afloat.
---
Also, Watoga is an excellent source of Lead Scrap and Fusion Cell ammo. The Level 50 Protectrons are pretty easy to kill and give good XP and decent loot
---
Good, it's impossible to find any information since the top 1000 posts on the front page are aneurysms about repair kits.
---

Give up on this shirty game and this shirty company

Read the inside the vault on Bethesdas website youll get weekly updates and shown whats on the atom shop weekly

# I don’t know
---
Juicehead is one of the worst gaming YTs out there , all he does is give misinformation or rumours and gets super upset and makes his viewers do the same. 
---
Play to win, not pay to win.
---
Or I continue because I'm allowed to? That sounds better. Keep the internet tough guy speech for someone else. 
---
We get a new quest on Tuesday along with turret upgrades and all factions vendors at white springs now with a shared 1400 cap pool 
---
I'm so bloody worried now about those lunch boxes that were mentioned before. &lt;\_&lt;
---
I fear that they'll come after these if we let them.
---
After everything you still believed them. That's really the most remarkable thing.
---
I dunno about you. But I can think of several areas where there may not be a work bench around. Especially when there is a 1 in 5 chance of if actually being the one you need. 
---
I’ve seen a tse rifle for sale once
---
well I learned not to spend them and now I jave to unlearn it 😂
---
Which part?
---
K dude,  whatever you say
---
That's probably why they're offering the Improved Repair Kits as quest rewards: so that they're still *technically* correct... from a certain point of view.
---
They could give us a very specifically-worded definition of "competitive advantage" that would look like keeping their promise, but in the end their plans can change at any time and even an explicit statement isn't necessarily a legal contract.
---
Next logical step is plans for 3-star legendary. Just QoL change to save your grinding hours.
---
A pipe rifle?
---
Okay but that thing that's specifically designed to induces whatever, that's not fo76 and that's not what repair kits are.
---
I think it’s disturbing how quiet the CM’s are being about this. All these posts and I haven’t seen bethesda reply to a single one.
---
Tons! There is this bug that's actually a great way to get low level legendaries. After a nuke at whitesprings the golf club will sometimes instead on spawning ghouls it will spawn legendary eyebots. They are all level one and drop really cools stuff like a level 1 vampires bolt action. Few bloodied weapons as well. Ended up leaving them in the overseerers chest once and no joke a lvl 5 saw them and then gave me a thumbs down told me I was ruining the game for people. Oh well...
---
I'm gonna call bullshit. 
---
No pay to win was a core part of the reason you bought this game? B-u-l-l-s-h-i-t.
---
Or you always buy BGS games but now have a moral platform you can pretend from. 
---
They probably thought it was an early B.E.T.A. considering what a dumpster fire it was at launch
---
If you're upset about utility items being put in the shop that's a legitimate complaint. It is not pay to win.  Theres no advantage to repair kits, no one wants their stuff repaired to 100% and the good 150% kit drops in game only.  Broken promise of cosmetics only, yep, P2W, nope.
---
I will be online in about 1 hour after this post is up.
---
I'm not sure you know what communist means 
---
Take walk, get a hobby, it's not that serious. No game dev sells cheats to their own game.
---
And, as someone who's put several hundred hours into this game, who's experienced any number of issues with this game, I will honestly say I can't think of many youtubers who _only_ cover negatives about this game. (Yong? I think it's just Yong, and the few times Jim Sterling mentions it in passing). 
---
It's true that outlining the negatives is a common theme with youtube videos...but that's because there are _so_ damn many to outline. 
---
And yet every time a patch comes out, some of the people who get a whole mess of hate around here(say, Juicehead) put out _positive_ or at least _balanced_ videos.   He posts about bugs, but he also covers things they do _right_. And sometimes, he has to do a correction, but it goes both ways, I've seen any number of "Oh, I was to rushed to praise the update, it also broke this and this other thing". 
---
The sad thing is, this game _has_ a shit track record, it launched in a unfinished state, just about every update has introduced new bugs. (I still revert to the last faschnacht headwear item every time I server hop or log in, and half the time I don't have a head at all). So, if you're going to _fairly_ cover this game as it updates, there's _going_ to be some negatives. 
---
***"Bethesda boss Pete Hines doesn't want you to worry about them [microtransactions]. Speaking to GameSpot at PAX Aus, Hines stressed that Bethesda will only offer cosmetics to buy with real money, not items that can affect gameplay."***
---
Hi could I get a raider set with shocks and bright headlamp please!
---
They're going to spend their atoms from questing on kits due to lack of Ballistic Fiber and Screws/Springs, then when they want cosmetics, they're paying cash.
---
No a proper hunters rifle it was ps4 
---
Is it much bigger? 
---
What impact does it have sorry? It allows Bethesda to get a few bucks out of people too dumb and lazy to collect stuff to repair?
---
Well you're operating purely on unfounded speculation at this point.
---
Rofl no way! That's great u did that, screw them lol 
---
do you sell recipes for mutations? 
---
Twice too. 
---
Believe me, the wasteland nazi Enclave are far more likely to rope you into buying useless shit 
---
I've noticed an uptick in attacks on workshops.   I often get down voted for this, but I say it anyway: I think they should remove PVP  entirely from adventure.   That includes contesting workshops. 
---
Want the ammo factory? There's a server out  there where it's free for the taking. 
---
Juicehead is a person who just loves to complain and incite conflict, pretty much everyone who hates on this game because of the “bandwagon” of hating on it may watch juice’s vids. He literally drives the “bandwagons” with his clickbait horses
---
They never said cosmetic only, it only says they wouldn't offer anything with an 'competitive advantage'. Their original post is still up, I wanted to see exactly what it said. 
---
And your points don't validate themselves either. At this point you're just guessing at the future, I'm talking about what's actually happening right now.
---
Wouldn't want you to miss the opportunity to spend money! Anything for the customer ;)
---
Your inaction would have yielded a more inclusive community. My inaction would have let you troll with impunity. Learn about context...but nice try.
---
This is a good idea.
---
The game was starting to recover from the PR shitstorm that it had, this is going to expand that. 
---
As well as causing Bethesda to add more features to the atomshop.
---
&gt;I was trying to help you understand what people have a problem with
---
And if you'd actually read the thread, you'd find there was no such misunderstanding.
---
&gt; No need to be an ass hat.
---
Need some way to get across to you that reading the thread is a good idea.
---
This doesn't help me at all. Where's my pay to win stuff?
---
My characters have either Cannibal or Can Do so I don't even pick up food that can spoil.
---
I use melee weapons so unless the converter turns ammo into caps its not much use for me.
---
My stash is perpetually maxed out so I don't even pick up junk most of the time.
---
Ew. Maybe next time don't share the very first doodle you've ever done.
---
They're also not cosmetic, which was Bethesda's promise for the Atom Shop. 
---
Yes. It's all a big long con. Which will get worse and worse despite a community who will cry baby about every single thing they don't like. 
---
That's the problem here. This item isn't a problem. But you people are re-acting like it is. Instead of reacting when a big problem item shows up.
---
The result? We get less cool shit because BGS can't be bothered trying because even if it's got near 0 impact the community is going to need a diaper change.
---
I like to walk, take pictures, read books - but please, don't try to pull the BS argument that devs selling cheats (anything that's not cosmetic only, is a cheat) is any more OK than any other source of cheats, wallhacks, aimbots, whatever - it's not OK, period.
---
New info to me, thanks for sharing
---
I know they player tool all of them too maybe 30+ 1* lvl 1 weapons. I was sad but it's cool. I still farm them every time I see the bug.
---
Theyre also not p2w
---
Screws
---
Honestly would love this 
---
Repair kits in the atom store aren't cheats. The idea of that is ridiculous and makes me think you're a troll
---
I do not sorry.
---
Bethesda: "6/25 support the idea?  [So you're telling me there's a chance??](http://i.imgur.com/WHGi867.gif)"
---
Do you know what precedent is?
---
Don't forget the sparsley populated servers
---
Unclear on what's happening here...
---
At level 259 its always nice to find unkown plans since i have almost all and nuka cola quantum is cool even though theyre not that useful
---
Thank you, this is what i wanted to know.
---
What type of weapons were they dropping for lvl 1? I know shotguns dont start till lvl 5. I'm curious to know what actually shows up at lvl 1
---
I agree, this isn’t P2W but it clearly is a quality of life game improvement. I don’t want to see future QoL improvements sold in the atom shop, they should be added to the game for free. Sell better cosmetic items if you want more atom shop purchases.
---
of course. couple questions.
---
1. do u already have a raider PA with you that i can mod?
---
2. If u don't I can craft you the pieces free of charge however i would need the materials.
---
I can’t believe people are still playing Beta 76. Gave them lots of chances during the first two months. Purchased full price. Returned it. Reason: broken, can’t play. 
---
Uh oh.  If you're not in the circle jerk people get very upset.  Quick, start tagging mods and screaming 'pay 2 win'! 
---
Holy Forking Shirtballs
---
could also be another hidden "nerf" like they tried in previous patches before
---
maybe even in preparation for the refridgerators which they apparently intend to sell in the Atomshop....what a coincidence
---
Dude....that's deep.
---
Well if you’re looking for the one shot kill then the power attack is better for big foes but I’d go ss over power attack based on if you’re fighting game enemies a little pointless if you’re going for pvp since a majority run bloodied builds
---
I wholeheartedly agree. We need a response.
---
My thoughts exactly.  I've been waiting for the stairs that were datamined months ago for my camp.
---
They kinda remind me of a highly radioactive version of Bane!
---
So it would basically be mutant slayers assasins (in weapons) since almost everyone is mutated
---
I have a few pieces lol...I need 2 more I think; what kinda of materials do you need? I’m also happy to pay caps if you can do it if I don’t have enough mats
---
I was very disappointed about the player vending being pushed back, whilst obviously we would all like them to release a working version of player vending with the least amount of bugs, I think the community is starting to get sick of broken promises from Bethesda. 
---
Alot of pipe stuff,tire irons,boards. I still have the pipe rifle on another character. 
---
Player vending will wait another month basically 
---
Basic economics. They have priced themselves out of their own cosmetics market despite there being no competition.  
---
No since mutant slayers and Assad is are primary perks but it would allow mutant slayers weapons to be more useful
---
Same here this is just the bud of the rose
---
Erm....from game sales perhaps 
---
sugar &amp; vodka , to make hard lemonade 
---
NO!!!
---
Absolutely not!
---
You pay to gain an unfair advantage over other players, it is *unquestionably* cheating - even attempting to argue otherwise is "absurd".
---
How is it different from buying better armor that lasts longer, or a better gun that doesn't break.
---
There are many types of small helpful cheats you could sell that will inevitably be rationalized and excused as they are gradually ramped up to more and more blatant offences.
---
Ew
---
Even at low level, I figured out pretty quick it was way cheaper to craft new armor as needed (I was leveling up out of my old armor anyway) instead of farming ballistic fiber.
---
I thought that was just a given recipe once you pick up some brain fungus
---
I'm sure being tagged a few dozen times in a few hours will get them running to support you. This is not how you ask for help.  
---
Now, please explain how a repair kit is an advantage?
---
I had a mutant slayers Hunting Rifle lvl 1 drop to me
---
I can't believe people still make comments like this. 
---
Frankly, complaining about the number of posts is the only thing about this issue that remotely interests me.
---
u dont need it just get brain fungus it will appear
---
Pair this with class freak not helping the increased hunger/thirst that speed demon gives I’ve pretty much given up Speed Demon atm. And shit is still spoiling super fast.
---
I was so happy the one and only time I ever had the interaction option... until the milk spoiled. 
---
And you have to wait in a line for like 5 minutes
---
At level 55, I just entered the area.  I love the feel of the area and the way everything is coming apart.  The toxic lake is neat and it feels so different than the rest of the areas in FO76.  It's a desert surrounded by life everywhere else.  It reminds me of the glowing sea in FO4 for it's uniqueness.
---
If you do it right, she spawns AND you can fight her in a non rad area. But not everyone knows how
---
I'm low on materials myself so I wouldn't be able to craft them for you without it sorry. As for the materials heres the wiki link: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Raider\_power\_armor\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Raider_power_armor_(Fallout_76)) 
---
Don’t bring a reasonable grasp of economics into this puritanical wankfest.
---
Yes but it would have the same effect as assasins cause pretty much everybody who does pvp or survival has mutations 
---
Fair. But as long as you have caps and have been to the Whitespring. You can repair and resupply.  
---
I like the idea of repair kits. Just the inclusion of atom shop content. At least right now. Unless the new thing is requiring the use of them and the Atom shop selling of them is just to cover the server while people can get them and farm them. It just seems poorly thought of and equally poor of not including the grand scheme of it. 
---
I honestly can't agree more, and honestly just make stuff  like that plans you can find in the world in an update
---
It's not an unfair advantage. It's repair kits.
---
Preach👏
---
Plasma cores 
---
Explain how a repair kit is P2W?
---
Thx
---
Heh not me, I should prob get some

I collected 20 brain fungus and I dont have the soup recipe. I'm not sure what you mean?

And yes it would

GTAO's been out for 6 years now but is still getting constant updates and dlcs thanks to them loyal fanbase keep buying game copies and shark cards. Same goes with Skyrim SE. Money makes dlcs and updates

Wow another post of whining, games like Destiny, Destiny 2, and Metal Gear Phantom Pain were amazing and was because of micro transactions. I do take some of the responsibility that my generation raised of bunch of PC babies who want everything to be given to them.

Capture sunshine meadow worshop and make Salisbury steak.  Easy as perfectly preserved pie.
---
You can usually find dog food at mama dulces and if the feeding the people event is up you can get some xp boost stew too but that expires.
---
I've picked up about 30 and I dont have the recipe. But I've skipped absolutely every quest in the game so far due to wanting the level 50 rewards (I'm 23 now). So maybe its an early responders recipe I should have.
---
Atleast try hiw they feel, i guarantee you wont be dissapointed
---
When I did the quest in December, the markers never updated because of a glitched, and I kept running around in circles for hours. It was like my real world DMV experience. 
---
For long time players at high levels it’s no big deal, but gathering those things is not as easy for low to mid level players. 
---
Also, this is a QoL improvement that has to be paid for? Sounds like Bethesda doesn’t mind taking advantage of the community that has stuck with them for ages through all the shit show and the new people we have started to bring into the game. So it’s understandable people are getting upset.
---
Ok I think I have the mats
---
Are there pay to win repair kits?  And they repair a weapon to 3x their health bar?  Cuz I can repair to 2x at my camp anytime. 
---
Oh- the basic kit repairs to 100% and the ‘improved’ repairs to 150%?  Cute
---
Dewd, I have a 3*, TSE handmade and same CSG. It takes VERY little mats to repair them to 200%. So little in fact that the moment it's at 99%, I repair it up. 
---
The repair kits will probably be a couple screws, springs and steel/aluminum to make, otherwise it's just cheaper for me to do it manually 
---
Ya my friend can make some for me but I’m afraid that my starched genes will glitch and get rid of my mutation. It’s happened before at 2* starched genes
---
And track down items that a normal person would know to bring. 
---
Life is a constantly evolving situation. It's a little absurd to expect everyone to stay true to every thing they ever said. Repair kits are QOL and not P2W, as you said, and in such case there is nothing wrong with the company attempting to collect a little extra money to help finance the ongoing development and support for the game. As long as they don't add buffs or extra content there really is no harm no foul. Also, you don't have to buy atoms, you get a pretty crazy amount of them for free.
---
Ballistic fiber 
---
Well said 👍🏼
---
It's not.  No one wants weapons repaired at 100% and the better version (150%) is available in game only. You won't find a single post explaining how a repair kit is P2W.
---
Haven't even played the game, but was had thought they couldn't make things worse than they already have. Guess their greed knows no bounds. RIP Bethesda
---
Ultracite laser weapons. I’ve found maybe 20 tops since beta.  
---
Just waiting on the "thanks for the feedback! we'll forward this to the dev team!" post.
---
Moreover the issue is it is something they swore up and down they’d never do. It was how they got folks to buy into the idea of the Atom shop - emphasizing it would be for fun only and never to give players any sort of advantage. It’s a broken promise and that is 100 times worse than any bug or game issue in my opinion.
---
Yea but based on Econ theory Bethesda wants to find the optimal bundle for their consumers. I am inclined to think the same way you do, but Bethesda probably is paying some dude with more economics education than me and you, that actually has the data, and that’s job is to maximize revenue for Bethesda. This makes me feel like they are already at or close to their optimal bundle. 
---
Even though I support lower prices I feel like Bethesda is probably already doing what makes them the most money. Even if it doesn’t seem to make sense to us outsiders 
---
No you not understand how things work? All it takes is a bunch of "small" things. Then it becomes one huge thing and by then it's too late.
---
But the point is that you don’t have to fast travel anywhere to do it. In Survival fast travel isn’t much of a thing at all. 
---
I don't even care about the survival mode. I was discussing adventure mode. The dialog would let Bethesda basically keep their current system but let you and I avoid the problem by opting out 
---
I think you forgot your /s, and *yikes* if you didn't.
---
Oh gawd, the cringe in the title is what got me. Repair kits are QoL not P2W and there is a **HUGE** difference.
---
I got a bunch of good 1* LVL 1s that way.  
---
I'm just having some fun. 
---
It's insane how many people are freaking out about this. Chances are the only time you use a repair kit in combat is on accident.
---
I honestly don't know what's going on.  As you can see from the latest response they sent me, they actually lifted the suspension on my overall [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) account so I can still access all my other games.  Only my Fallout 76 account remains suspended for whatever insane reason.  I have a feeling one of their employees read my ticket, accessed my account to delete the items they claimed I had, couldn't find those items, and then decided to move on to the next ticket and forget all about mine.
---
I paid $60 to keep this game going and that's the end of my obligation as far as I'm concerned.
---
Hahahahaha i love watching you morons try to justify basically throwing away 60 bucks plus whatever the season pass cost
---
This isn't at all like doing it with stims. It's like doing it with steel, antiseptic and tic blood in a bag that you pay for instead of just going and getting it yourself. 
---
The version purchasable provides no boosts, only materials
---
These people are crazy! Why can't they let Todd get his retirement fund in peace???
---
You get my upvote and I’ll share in the downvoted with you, I’ve pointed this out on several posts today, can’t keep a game alive on sub par opening sales
---
Wait, so people are losing their minds over a lesser version of the kits then the one that drops in game and that lesser version isn't even buyable in the atom shop, just unlockable there?  I think I'll save my annoyance for something I care a bit more about like player vending getting pushed back.
---
This is what we need, more people willing to play as bodyguards. Awesome.
---
or maybe dont keep looking the otherway when a company breaks its promise and keep the bootlicker hail corporate speech for someone else? 
---
.
---
No you know what the impact will be? 
---
We'll get less cool shit. Why? Because at some point BGS' is going to just not want to deal with the backlash of releasing little extras that have zero impact on game play. 
---
So we'll just get outfits and hair styles, because God forbid they try to monetize gameplay aspects that have zero impact on other players. Otherwise they are changing the community's diaper Everytime they try something that even smells non cosmetic.
---
I agree. I said that this morning. Repair kits are just anything tweak/thing for survival. Sure we can use them in adventure more. 
---
They should have just slapped in on the atom shop for free lol they did for the poster for brewing. 
---
You did see that first section right bud? 
---
The part that said we're exploring ways, not we'll just put em all in the AS?
---
I think you're giving them too much credit. Big corporations don't always make the right decision just because they're a big corporation. 
---
Go genetic supremacy!
---
Sorry to hear that brother.  Hope things worked out for you.
---
Bethesda are habitual line steppers, starting with the entire early release of this game.  
---
They are lucky to have the fan-base they have even at this point, and yet they still want to see how far they can push it.  
---
Bethesda = EA 2.0
---
Musical instruments. Not the glorified interactive chairs mind you. But the accordions, violins, drums, mouth harps and the rest. That's the one thing that makes me stop and go 'neat.'
---
Don't know what you're reading but ok chief. They didn't personally make any promises to me. 
---
100% agree
---
Not the guy you replied to but a few things. While no, I wouldn't like to see more of that, however it's the lesser of two evils.
---
And two, Warframe itself is free so they need SOME kind of income since the game, is free. Everything is obtainable in the game already so to pay real money to just go ahead and get it earlier is, while still a bit scummy, is the lesser of two evils, game is majority co-op and like I said, needs an income if the game is free.
---
Fallout 76 is not free, has a lot of PvP elements so to add repair kits (as a start) which is ONLY obtainable through the Atom Shop is quite the difference between FO76 and Warframe, so for the OP to even compare the two is definitely not right in the first place, it's like apples and oranges
---
so you fondled the milk producing organs of his only friend while he was trying to defend you?
---
Also Idea for cosmetics:
---
- pipboy games. i'll bye them all.
---
- fireworks
---
- radiostations (yes, this is even worse than p2w, but hey, cosmetics)
---
And yes, current cosmetics suck hard, only couple of items are good, other looks like "hey, let's start from really bad item ideas, so there is room for good cashgrabs later on". If you start low, you can end up continuing low.
---
You can’t drop or trade atom shop outfits sadly
---
I sent you a friend request, I'm chetbrosley on PS4. 
---
The crossbows I have are a lvl 45* Furious crossbow.
---
the other is a lvl35*** Anti Armor with +250 DR while reloading, ignores 50% armor, and +40% bash damage. 
---
I'm home now and playing cards, send me a message and I'll pop on and toss em at you
---
At least one (a couple times I've encountered 2) at Dolly Sods Campground. It's the building to the WSW from Thunder Mountain Power Plant.
---
Gunmetal or silver skin for the Handmade
---
There’s your funding for the next quarter Bethesda
---
"if the game rewarded caps and not players..." I want to have slaves. I mean, they got slavers in the other fo titles.
---
Who in the right mind would pay to fix your weapons ?
---
Skins are cosmetics and I kinda get that but dang why would you make this an option a to pay :/ 
---
lol yeah okay, I've heard that bs before. Your formating says you're a regular user.
---
None, I was agreeing.
---
Do you not care about the monetization model of the games you play? It directly affects the experience you will have and the cost of enjoying a game. It's a core part of every game purchase decision I make.
---
Who wouldn't look into that and incorporate it in their buying decision? Like... it's astonishing to me that you live a life where these things don't matter.
---
Wow this subreddit is a fucking shitshow. I get what you're trying to say. You're right. Right now these repair kits are just the beginning. Soon enough, if this keeps up, it is going to end up like GTA V, completely pay-to-win. But alot of players just see it as nothing. But c'mon, did you not see this coming? Selling Mods? Small, shitty dlcs for Fallout 4? Releasing an unfinished game? Canvas bag shitstorm? All hints that Bethesda has grown greedy and forgotten what true content &amp; fun really is.
---
Too bad that once again, 15 hp on garbage clothes ment nothing! 
---
How much per mutation serum?
---
I dunno. I feel like not having to go to a workbench and repair is similar to not having to go to a bed and sleep. 
---
Yea but big corporations always want to make a lot of money. I think having someone like that on staff is pretty basic for AAA games with micro transactions 
---
I'd be more incline to chip in and really make my camp shine if Atom prices weren't so high. Sadly I make minimum wage and can't afford a $5 fireplace for my camp. Have to gring from challenges.
---
Hope so
---
I did it at 45
---
Lmao, y’all are still playing this sack of shit game?
---
Good job tho
---
They took a community idea and turned it on to a way to milk low levels. But sure let's not worry about it. Letting them slide on this will only be the start.
---
Yes. Except that this community is so on guard and ready to rage about every little thing that the huge thing won't go un-noticed. Or even the less than huge thing. 
---
This isn't a huge thing. Or a big thing. It's a non thing. But the communtiy is reacting like its a game genie that gives you unlimited health. 
---
Eventually,  BGS is going to stop giving a fuck and we won't get cool shit, because it if it even seems non cosmetic it's a shit show. 
---
Because this community isn't reacting based on the impact this non cosmetic (which is zero) they are reacting solely based on it being non cosmetic. 
---
What if they want to release a pip boy deluxe, that has additional customizable sorting features? Is that too non cosmetic? 
---
What if they have a master builder thing. It allows you to flatten a 6*6 area in your comp to build on? Is that too non cosmetic?
---
Ahh okay. Gotcha.
---
I know the post is in ill taste but it would seem like. Being that there wasn’t really anything in the game to be a prank.  
---
My rule of thumb is about 50%  or thats what you should expect on each death
---
I absolutely hate bloodied but I seem to be stuck with it since all of the good weapons that drop for me always seem to be bloodied.
---
My entire point of this thread is to point out that a lot of these legendary effects are not bad it's just that the game design makes them poor options. Take away the ammo cost and suddenly you will see more support people playing as Medic's or suppressor builds 
---
Could be like the party poster that’s in the atom shop, free
---
Here’s hoping.
---
How about the benefit of continued gameplay and content? I know that won't be a popular opinion,  but they do need to pay their employees...and dev talent is expensive.  Very expensive.  I know, I am a dev lead. Not for a game company,  but it doesn't really matter the industry.  There are so few people that can code at all, &lt;1% of the population and of that 1%, only about 5% are good. 
---
The simple, economic facts are the game has to make money going forward or it just won't make sense to keep it alive. Think about it. 
---
It's all in the post. Just gotta read it bro.
---
So, are they essential pointless, or are they helpful?
---
I'm typically spending a good amount of time running around with either a weapon, or a piece of armor broken for some time before I can travel somewhere to fix it, and, I have to get more stinking "Ballistic Fiber" each time my armor breaks, even though a new piece could be made without it...
---
So, I'm at a disadvantage compared to the guy who bought repair kits...
---
He paid cash instead of playing to earn it legit, to me, that is clearly "unfair".
---
Good job man. It’s not a race. Those that treat it like one run out of fun more quickly anyway. 
---
Game sales cover the cost of development and marketing and (hopefully) bring in profit. 
---
Long term support, server costs and free content cost quite a bit more.
---
The only way to sustain that is with a steady flow of cash, which this game (and just about every other online game) achieves with microtransactions.
---
I know nothing about business and even I understand this.
---
Hero
---
i never had the recipe for any soup..it requires basic ingredients..its not like a healing salve which needs blood leaf and a soot flower..u would need one for brain fungus puree tho which requires 5 or 6 diff items
---
cool. Ill be on in roughly 30 min
---
So release the private servers they promised and they won't have tip host every game. 
---
Yeah, now that I look at it, saying "horse shit" is usually a negative.
---
The ol' sunk cost fallacy.
---
Then buy them from the vendors or player traders?? Plenty of people sell heaps of junk for cheap. Repair kits are not the only answer. Personally I don’t mind the idea of repair kits but you **should not have the option** to purchase them with real money. That can be taken advantage of by some people and not others, and could lead to P2W.
---
That's really weird to sell these repair kits even though i can repair all of my gear at 200% for free well technically not free but at a low cost of my junk that i have plenty of laying around.
---
Then maybe they can restructure the atom shop to not be so ludicrously overpriced instead of being two faced cunts and going back on their word? 
---
I've been playing for long enough and I'm already enough of a hoarder that I just see this as heavier than my junk. Unless it takes advantage of my weight reduction perks and armor, I have no real use for it.
---
Drills
---
A better way of phrasing it would be they're missing out on heaps of other decent games, new and old, by pouring more hours into this blatant cash grab.
---
Which feature helps you cheat?
---
I'm curious if the player vending delay also means a delay for passive player CAMPs not being able to be destroyed by other players.  
---
I'm OK with them choosing to delay things they don't think are working correctly. Hopefully the delays mean they are doing things like identifying and fixing bugs in their new content.
---
Holy shit I'm slow lol I see what you mean
---
About 1 piece of armor breaks every .... 5 hours of play or just about there , chest piece more than the others, obvi. 
---
But I always wait till it gets below 100% and repair it up to 200%
---
The most expensive piece is the 5 Ballistic pieces it takes but I have hundreds so its not an issue  
---
Weapons,  my main melee breaks ... once every 12-15 hours of play, again repair it to 200%.  The worst cost in that weapon is steel at 24 and for my Ghoul Knife, it takes 4 black Titanium, again which I have hundreds
---
Probably the hardest to "farm" is my 3 star Deathclaw Zealot killer, which takes 18 bone - not expensive, just annoying and it one shots all scorched - except technically a 2+ star legendary because they usually heal to full even if I technically 1 shot them
---
You do understand that they said the atom shop was cosmetic only right? Thats the point for all the rage. Thats a big thing promising that the atom shop is for cosmetic items only then they are going to push to release a non cosmetic item? So we are suppose to let them go back on their word? I get wanting better stuff but have it released right.
---
I don't "support" it
---
I flat out don't give a shit
---
I've earned so many Atoms from just playing the game I don't see an issue with it
---
Welcome to the Endgame Content.
---
It's better than most, since there's no name-calling. It's a perfectly valid opinion of the game at launch.
---
I've wanted this since the day Fallout 4 came out and they never got the hint in the *six* DLCs they added to that game.
---
Essentially pointless in combat. Minor QoL boost outside of it. Therefore, not an unfair advantage.
---
Have you seen the list yet of payable non-cosmetics, the repair kit is quite literally the start
---
I paid 60 Bucks to a AAA Company that makes Millions through other Stuff besides games. Hit me in the face but i never paid for Lunchboxes in Fallout Shelter either.
---
That was before enough people dropped off the player base that they realized they would need to incorporate microtransactions into base gameplay to continue any profits.
---
So with the snap o matic, will we get more photo slots?  Right now it's very limited and I've already been forced to delete a number of photos.
---
No. I literally don't give a fuck about monetization models. 
---
Because I'm not a naive soap box gamer who thinks that their efforts/decisions will ever have an impact. Even when the gaming community as a whole pushes back and "wins" over controversial models, that win is short lived. We didn't just suddenly arrive here. Monetization has been a long haul, and one the game industry is and will always be winning. 
---
Well I wouldn't wanna stop someone from dyin more than 5 times when I'm cap farming now!! 
---
I think the issue here is that they could easily make tons of money off of decent skins, instead of putting functional items in the atom shop. Weapon and armor skins are pretty much all I look forward to when they update the store.
---
Because the real world is more complex than the environment and concept you are suggesting. Freedom is a very controversial and complex topic contrary to what it might seem. Many different agendas and unknow implications that certain parties would never allow to happen. 
---
Let me guess you farming for karma? Quit crying and let people like me who still work pay for this game, I work long hours and couldn't enjoy Destiny 1 or 2 without their microtransactions. If this is a problem feel free to get a job then you too can learn what it is to be an adult.
---
No. 
---
I used to play a ton of rainbow six siege and they have roughly the same model. You pay for the game, and all future content is free. Only difference being that new characters and weapons are given a week early to people that buy a season pass (maybe bethesda can try this?). Me, and many other players I knew were happy to throw down real $$$ for the cosmetics because we were passionate about the game and the cosmetic options were QUALITY. 
---
Fallout 76 doesn’t yet deserve the level of passion and it certainly doesn’t present many quality options. 
---
There is also a VTU Jumpsuit (Vault Tech University) which appear to be identical in stats to the vanilla 76 one. Unsure of the stats at this moment, but I have it unlocked so I can check.
---
This is not a free-to-play indie game. This is a $60 AAA release from a major game publisher. If they did not project their earnings correctly that is not the fault of the players and there is no economic theory that says consumers must pay more to  manufacturers in order to receive continued support of the product they already own.
---
I give a fuck about monetization models because I don't like getting fucked over, because the industry does a lot of unethical stuff and I don't want to support it, and because they *directly affect my experience of a game*.
---
It makes me sad that you don't care about monetization models, but that's your prerogative. Don't assume that other people enjoy getting a worse game for a higher price just because you do.
---
If the game don't make enough money, what we see in the roadmap is all we gonna get. Besides, nobody's making you pay real money. Just grind achievements if you don't wanna pay. Pay real money if you want a shortcut
---
Guess we'll have to begin writing our farewell posts now. 
---
Wouldn't be too hard. That's what they pay their artists and creative designers for. Plus, there is a massive backlog of things the community has been asking for since launch: clothes of famous fallout characters, enclave themed x-01 paint, winterized t51b paint, uniforms of past fallout factions like ncr, legion, etc (would be lorebreaking but not like that hasn't already been broken), more unique skins for each weapon, etc. It wouldn't be that hard, and any one of these would be enough to appease the community for a while
---
This subreddit is full of immature twats. 
---
I feel like we can thank Anthem and The Outer Worlds for that lol
---
It wasn't complimentary, it was part of what was paid for.
---
Honestly, today probably isn't a good day to try to get their attention, since they dropped the Repair Kit bomb on us.  This sub's pretty much a stream of new thread complaints about that announcement right now.
---
There is a recipe called Brain Fungus Soup. It requires 1 boiled water, 1 wood, and 1 brain fungus. I have it on all my higher level characters. My low level character doesnt, but I'd like to get it. I just dont know where I got it on my other characters. No worries, I'll just keep playing. I'll find it eventually.
---
Thanks!
---
I don't care about the items I lose, I don't care about the base damage, I don't care about my shit breaking. I think it's not that hard to dig a hole in the ground and bury a few caps. 
---
What is the issue? 
---
1. After all the crap we have had to endure from day of release, we deserve in game repair kits.
---
2. The more people spend real money on in game items the more companies will milk the cash cow.
---
3. If we could host a coop version of FO76 from our own server/computer there would be no cost to Bethesda. They made their bed now they can lie in it.
---
4. Revenue comes from game sales, continue to improve, expand and innovate equals more sales. (No Man's Sky a perfect example.)
---
Not going to down vote, each person has their opinion, ours just differ.
---
So lying is completely fine if it's just a little?
---
Probably yes some PC people have problems if they have a certain mod downloaded and the second hands are probably barely used because they probably sold it as soon as they bought it because if the bugs and glitches. 9/10 game tho
---
How many players did it take?
---
Trust me, I’m all about doing the challenges. I’m the only one amongst my friends that actually gets on and checks them daily and does them. I’m not worried about not having atoms or having to spend money to have some. I just want content that, if need be, is worth our money. But you’re not wrong, and make an excellent point, thank you. 
---
Part of me wanted to cry out and defend myself but you know what there’s no point in trying to reason with people like you. I hope you have a nice night and eventually get rid of this negativity.
---
Oh man, don't touch the ini on this game man  - its not going to get you banned , but the last patch alone they pretty much made all modders that had changed their ini fall through the world floor endlessly until they died 
---
Get used to Z and C because its the default key for everything in all the menus -  just bite that bullet.
---
You on PC I assume if you even have a ini  ?
---
Post up on the main bethesda forum and there are all sorts of helpful PC players: 
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/category/233/general-discussion?language=en&amp;page=1](https://bethesda.net/community/category/233/general-discussion?language=en&amp;page=1)
---
Biggest thing is just wander at first!!!   You can follow the main quest line to Flatwoods but after that, I wouldn't necessarily follow the rest the quests in order as some can take you to high level areas before you are ready
---
Look at your perk cards NOW  - you won't get them all but its important because certain perks you don't get until certain level locks, like Fallout 4 - so no point in forcing yourself to be a sniper for example , if you can't even stealth until level 15. 
---
Don't repair your armor weapons, they are too common early on. With some adhesive, cloth and leather, you can remake ALL your leather armor, and with steel and adhesive, you can just make your weapons 
---
If a high level player runs up to you, stop, press G to wave  or caps lock to talk,  he or she is probably there to give you stuff- its a fallout 76 tradition to lay gift boxes down for new players 
---
You lost me at the trust part
---
You seriously think that a company that delivered Fallout 76, *as well as* spit in the face of those who criticized it would care about breaking promises? Have you even aware of the last 30+ (unfulfilled) promises that Todd Howard has made (sweet sweet lies)? Where the fuck have you been hiding all this time, cause I want in so I can forget about all this stupid shit Bethesda has been doing recently. And EA. And Activision. 
---
I actually loved that one lolol 
---
Well you can get serums for 150 caps so its not that big loss but shouldnt be happening if you have starched genes 
---
Which would be ok if it were a finished game at launch. Even now, the content is lacking for a full price game and there's still a lot of bugs/ room for improvement. 
---
My son played the game for awhile but got bored quickly once we reached end game. He's not played in over a month and constantly rags on the game due to lack of content and all the bugs. I've used the roadblock, the frequent updates to fix issues and the fact that they're not charging for stuff beyond cosmetics as one of the biggest defenses to paying $60 for an unfinished game. Without that, I absolutely see his point. 
---
Ok thank you
---
Psst. I hate to to you this, but your giving a fuck about monetization models impacting game quality vs price?
---
Doesn't fucking matter. It's how it goes. Every time. That's why everything is shittier quality and costs more. Not just games. Consumers always lose. No matter how hard you try. How hard you care. How many other righteous gamers you have on your side. 
---
Why? Because you worry about this some of the time. Theses companies? Getting the most money out of you at the littlest cost is literally their job. 
---
Thanks Moth. 
---
It was advertised as a canvas bag, I paid for a canvas bag, I received a piece of nylon garbage.
---
People often complain about how often weapons and armor break, how the "weight limit" on Stash/Inventory can make it hard to juggle mats/weapons/food/aid to have a sufficient amount of each, etc.
---
Of course, fallout might not be as obnoxious as Clash Royale and other mobile games with delayed open "Chests" and "Gems", whatnot, but it does have SOME of that aspect to it?
---
Well I bought this shit at full price
---
Np
---
I fully agree.
---
“This game was built on our trust.” 
---
Was it? I seem to recall every fallout and bethesda related subreddit being toxic because FO76 was “total shit. The bag is nylon! Unplayable!” along with a few dozen demands the game itself be scrapped completely.
---
I’m perfectly fine with them doing anything they want. The feedback on reddit is useless, and we collectively made it so when bitching was more important than constructive feedback.
---
though that depends how they adjust their dropchances for the queen, rumors have it the queen is apparently also suppossed to drop good legendaries
---
How does it impact game play? Other than saving you another fast travel trip?
---
At least this guy was a little more creative about being a raider than the usually griefers I encounter time to time. 
---
What platform are you on? I May be able to provide a way to get you more pictures
---
Please add this!
---
(Full repair on all equipment on character, stacking with perk cards )
---
1. how many atoms (we get free atoms from dailys) if you can earn 1 full repair by doing 2 days worth of dailys its worth it. 
---
2. I agree it Should be Atoms and Craftable in Game. 
---
I couldn’t agree more. Excellent comment!
---
Microtransactions... really?  A company of your talents?
---
They arent atoms only tho there are ones that drop from the sbq
---
They can eventually glitch through the wall if you wait long enough. Took awhile but I finally got my 3* lvl 45 wood leg from a robobrain for my patience. 
---
So too was a purchase of the Unstoppable outfits which gave you a perk boost during their inception.
---
A lot of people would argue that game developers and their games were profitable before microtransactions, and they're really just a method to squeeze more cash out of the consumer post-launch. Nevermind that games used to charge $20 for whole expansions that would take a few days to complete,
---
&gt;Stop wining other games have em.
---
Thank fucking good there's some rational people here.
---
Repair kits are so obnoxiously non impactful that they may as well be considered cosmetic. 
---
"Yeah, but bro, you don't even need a bench to repair"
---
Which affected you how? That guy essentially just spent two bucks to not have to fast travel to camp one time? 
---
OP NON COSMETIC BRO!
---
Have you tried eating a raw brain fungus? You should get that recipe just from picking up the fungus since it's the "base" recipe. 
---
It's on Bethesda to give players details or else speculation will run rampant. Furthermore BGS deserves this hate. We shouldn't cut them any slack because they second we do they'll fuck up again and again and again.
---
&gt;  This should have been a completely separate mode where you have to make a new character to enter.  
---
I think this is something you will see in the future.  The reason they allowed existing characters in the Beta  was to see some of these broken, ridiculously  over-powered builds in action to see how badly the PVP is broken so they could fix it.   The developers even said so in a recent interview.   In which case, I think they made the right move.
---
At launch, it's been months so how's it still valid. 
---
You can scrap them. They sit in your inventory. You use materials to make them. These you just buy an option to press a repair button.
---
Look at all the data mined stuff. There’s a ton of that coming.
---
Wouldn't mind mind this at all. Also be able to craft torches. 
---
1-wood
---
2-cloth
---
5-fuel =1 skyrim torch
---
I could do without the recap but the only reason I watch his videos is because it’s more convenient for me to listen to a reading of news reports while doing something else, rather than having to read it myself.
---
Why? Some of us like to support the game and that includes paying since not all of us have lots of time. DLC isn't free, either we all pay equal amount or a bunch of pay a lot of it aka atoms shop. And no I don't need 20 outfits or Power Armor paint jobs.
---
This style of middle school apathy isn't as cool or insightful in the real world as you seem to think. Companies obviously respond to public opinion and perception, especially in entertainment industries.
---
Are you really surprised?
---
Lol and you think their big act of desperation would be repair kits?!
---
Nah. They said the game is doing "very very well" at PAX despite the controversy. They're not hurting for Atoms or game sales, no doubt. They just want to make *more*.
---
Because they've given everyone enough atoms to buy 2 or 3 outfits, and then only produced 2 or 3 appealing outfits.
---
Genius!
---
There's not even a set price for all we know its free just like the poster to start the Nukashine quest, wait till we get actually info not what YOU think. This subreddit just jumps at the smallest detail smh
---
I slowly creep forward sometimes just so that the weapon sights become visible and I can make sure I’m hitting straight. For me, the chameleon armour is more for hiding in plain sight when things like scorch beasts come looking for me lol
---
RemindMe! 4 days "Bethesda needs to fix this guy's account."
---
Well, it does explain the White Knight nerf a while back...
---
Usually companies doing microtransactions will simply fish for whales, because a whale will Steve way more than an average player. I'm gonna guess that's why F76 stuff is so expensive.
---
I'm curious as to what the VTU track suit stats are, as yes, it is indeed an under armor. The one being sold in the Atom Shop. Anyone got this? Don't really want to waste Atoms on something that might end up being trash. Guessing it falls into the Vaultsuit category, perhaps?
---
There's also a VTU Jumpsuit in the Vaultsuit category. Just checked the stats also, they are identical to the vanilla 76 jumpsuit, both in material costs to make/upgrade aswell as it's stats.
---
That is literally the only way they can backpedal and have a chance of people believing them. I honestly hipe they do this.
---
You can only farm a location once every 24 hours. 
---
Oh well I saw one mess up and she didn't spawn they all waited for it too launch then there was no boss 
---
Why drills?  Is there something cool or just because they are rare?
---
Not on console. The "sale" price is half price at most, for both e-store and retail. 
---
Ok, now im stumped. I hope someone else can fix it for ya. I'll keep watch to see what's going on
---
Honestly the game has free DLC and content nobody ever complains about rockstar and how GTA v does the same thing but on a way higher level
---
Wow you can repair armor if you spend money big deal
---
Its not like paying money for legendary loot boxes
---
Just when I thought about coming back to this game, Beth finds a way to make sure I don't want to.

---
Because that's the context of their comment, and where a lot of players' only had any experiences in FO76. Are people not allowed to bring up the launch anymore?
---
Well that's good, the only good thing about being able to jump between modes is that the weekly legendaries aren't exclusive to one mode
---
Yup I know that, last time was before the cooldown. Anyway thanks for the reminder :)
---
Was thinking of picking this game up because surely they figured something out and it might not be as broken or maybe just fun to play but this decision definitely will keep me away from a purchase
---
Thanks for that tip
---
&gt; Assuming there is no delay! 
---
Well there goes that one....delayed until Patch 9 in May
---
If you can one shot everything with the one you have, keep it. Otherwise, swing speed is really sought after at the moment. Take a look at captainoob on YouTube. He does weapon spotlights and he's very good at describing what works better and explaining the best perks to use. 
---
Camden park and black hole mine 
---
If they do they better be locked to survival otherwise there just going to transfer items from their main account and the problem stays the same
---
Do they? 
---
How's Microsoft doing after their Monopoly issues?
---
How's Disney doing after they pushed for extended copyright rules to protect their products which they lifted from others before them?
---
How's every tech company ever despite everyone being fully aware of planned obsolescence?
---
Quite frankly I’d still say the game is worth a buy especially at current prices. But these business tactics will definitely drive me away from the atomic shop.
---
Thank you
---
👍🏽
---
every now and then a legendary bot will spawn in watoga too.
---
The problem is more having the **option** to pay real money for QoL improvements and possibly future pay to win items
---
That was YouTuber ManyATrueNerd's solution to staying off the top 3 list. 
---
Blatant PTW. 
---
If a person can pay to do this instead of grind like everyone else, it’s pay to win. 
---
First Unstoppables happened, they gauged the outrage and said fuck it lets up the up the ante.
---
Now it’s not limited to a week advantage, it’s a payable permanent and on the run advantage.
---
What’s next? 
---
Hotdogs. Seriously. A little radiated spice and mm mm good!
---
&gt;Modern society has serious issues with corruption and consolidation of power - news at 11.
---
Raider armor skins!!!
---
The game was built on your trust? Fuck man the game was rigged from the start
---
5.56 ammo.
---
Don't yell too loud or they'll hear ya and delay those too then
---
Can confirm. I just did exactly what was noted above, and it took about five minutes total.
---
Sweet roll recipes will be available for 300 atoms.
---
Can you put that shell shock also comes from deathclaws.? Thats where I have gotten it.
---
That's your speculation or did they actually say that?
---
The amount of content is perfectly fine for a full priced game. Most full priced games come with 20-40 hours worth of main content. This game meets and succeeds that. The main questline is easily 20 hours worth of content, if not more. Then you have the side quests, the daily quests, the multitude of events, the massive map to explore, and all the gear to grind out...that adds even more. 
---
Whether or not you think it's quality content is subjective.
---
Yeah there are bugs, and there are bugs in every game. Does anyone remember what the beloved New Vegas was like when that game shipped? They have done loads of work at fixing everything, and relatively quickly. There's always gonna be room for improvement, there is always room with any game. People just like to zero in on the shortcomings, especially when it's popular opinion to do so.
---
And if your son hasn't played in a month, why is he still complaining? He hasn't seen any of the new content or bug fixes so it's not the same build he's thinking of.
---
Yeah I saw the death from above and went to wetoga to wait then once it dropped and I went there no boss apparently the guy who dropped it was just a idiot
---
What event did you get it from? I need those plans in my life.
---
Until they rebalance the way you find scrap like how they rebalanced how White Knight worked or  the rate at which food decays. 
---
You know, that unlikelihood.  
---
Welch has a few mole men who carry shotguns. I farmed that spot on my level 15 character for about 40 minutes and left with tons of ammo, materials and shotgun mods 
---
You didn't buy it for the canvas bag, you bought it for the power armor helmet and forgot it included a bag, be honest.
---
You didn't buy it for the canvas bag, you bought it for the power armor helmet and forgot it included a bag until the controversy, be honest
---
It stacked to 60 if your whole team had different outfits. Damage to raw HP is easily reducible by various perk cards mutations and armour increasing EHP.  
---
I agree that 60 hp is negligible; however it's the principal of that thing that is wrong. They said that the ATOM shop would be cosmetic only and would offer no competitive benefits.  
---
The Unstoppable's promotion was right on the border of Unacceptable as it was cosmetic; but while they were on sale, there was a competitive benefit to wearing them.  
---
The uselessness of the buff doesn't change that they unethically broke their promise.
---
Yeah yeah slippery slope, dogs and cats living together mass hysteria
---
I always get a kick out of the fact you can find hot dogs perfectly fine next to moldy food.
---
In regards to weapon and armor durability, I think they break fast enough. Making it faster would make everything so much more tedious and annoying. it would generate revenue from repair kits and make them more necessary. Also things are lethal enough, I don't want to walk ten feet and die from one hit from a SB.  I already get demolished 
---
Why should it be only aesthetic things? Name one game that hugely successfully with a monthly fee or items that help in game game play like this. Not to mention I have a job which Im sure lots of players don't have and micro transactions can be done without going overboard and help players like me while not making Bethesda create dlc on a 20 cent budget because no buys 30 different outfits.
---
Are they going to do this shit with the next Elder Scrolls? 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/an96g0/_/
---
So no lottery numbers? 
---
Your first mistake was trusting Bethesda after selling you an incomplete product 
---
Oh well, if they need to fix stuff before it comes out, I'm fine with that. 
---
Thank you for all the tips! Really enjoying the game 
---
Yeah it is pretty obvious that the repair kits are just a trial run to see the reaction.
---
If consumables are added to the cash shop like some trashy free-to-play mobile game I'll just uninstall and never look back.  I'm not afraid to admit I was wrong.
---
You had to literally equip armor that was useless, to get 15-60 hp. Keep bitching man. 
---
It was still part of it. For example I really like the bag that came with my RE5 collector's edition. I thought this one would be similar because they advertised it as such.
---
I myself valued it is maybe 5-10% of the package I bought. Definitely not the main reason, but it was part of the price.
---
Or that time I died 15+ times during the strangler heart mission only to get a legendary queen mirelurk to regen, get back to half health then freeze :) not one body looted that day
---
If you can use cash to purchase non-cosmetic items.
---
Plans and *effin' disease cures*
---
Repairing anywhere is more than a time saver.
---
Still though, nowhere near a big of a deal, it's a damn bag's material
---
They said you inspect the weapon, hit a repair button, and get back to the actuon
---
I payed 80. I overpaid for what I got
---
I can gladly continue to list a whole plethora of situations that had far worse perception issues for companies that led to short term change and long term nothing fucking at all. 
---
It's not about being cool. It's just the way it is. It's systemic. Gamers aren't going to buck the trend over monetization schemes. 
---
I hope so. But I doubt they do. 
---
Levers and handmades
---
It works
---
Enclave, Bos, Responder, Raider power armor skins. There more funding
---
Down
---
It just works
---
They are costumes. They are worn over your armour.
---
The material makes it useless though. This thing is CHEAP. I can just see it ripping if I tried to put anything in it.
---
PS4 saves every picture. Even ones I have deleted from the photo album. 
---
Though I agree 50 comes way too fast.
---
well they were just suggestions, weapon decay rate might not have been the best suggestion but I feel like the mode needs something beyond pvp to make the mode harder than Adventure. 
---
I guess they're going to implement them like the fermenter as in it offers it's "own" inventory which is still coupled with your stash but other players have access to this one and can buy items like current trading works, you put an price for an item you placed in there before and other players can come up, open the trade menu with the machine and buy your items
---
u/jessBethesda
---
u/Ladydevann
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
Cosmetic only!
---
But they didn't say if you have to craft them or not, you're just speculating that you don't. You can use stimpaks or radaway through the Pip-boy without going through the inventory, but you still have to have those on you.
---
Have you considered people might be more prone to buying atoms if the items there were cheaper and a couple items didn’t cost half what the game costs, translated to atoms?
---
Xbox - I’d love to set up a gaming pc but I’ll probably have to wait a couple of years
---
I got them from a Supermutant Horde Event in the Mire. The supermutant boss was near the fast-travel point at Harper's Ferry. I was extra surprised because I had read earlier that it dropped from the Queen and/or Cranberry Bog events.
---
It’s more fun playing survival with a brand new character- nothing to lose and the tension is insane. Just be careful and sneaky and avoid popular areas.
---
My fault, I skimmed through too fast.
---
I like most of your suggestions, those two I think are a but much tho. Maybe sleep could be added as a requirement, sleep meter regens faster at night or something 
---
I can probably help you with your build so your stuff will break less... Honestly this is the reason I'm offering this... That level 30-45 grind is brutal in terms of repair, and people stuck in it might think their only option is to buy these kits. In the post 50 game repair is a non-issue, and you'll only be doing once every few sessions and always have the mats for it... But unless you've gotten a character up there it can seem like an insurmountable task, and those repair kits might look like the only option.
---
Or there are just a lot of people tuning into this topic that haven't played since within a month or two of launch. I tried out the game with a friend when it came out on PS4 and not since then, so the commenter and I are in the same boat while reading/replying to this.
---
OMG YYYYEEEEEEESSSSSSS😱😱😱😱😱
---
The 2nd is probably better, not much will survive a instigating+power attack attack, and the swing speed is rather useless on an instigating weapon, as it only counts the first hit. You could probably kill super mutant warlords with the second, so farming west tek would be a breeze.
---
They need to move it from the reserved space file to it's own save file on xbox 
---
I just use them to use floating camps look good. 
---
People are freaking out because it's "pay to win" but I honestly don't think it is. It doesn't really offer any real benefits besides saving some resources and being able to repair your weapon anywhere, the benefits it does give are minimal at best. Plus in the Inside the Vault they even said that the improved repair kits are obtainable in-game, though hopefully from more sources than the SBQ
---
Great same platform as me. On Xbox, hit the big circle button in the center of the controller and hit Y (i think. Might be X) and the xbox will screenshot whatever is on screen. Just open your picture, screenshot and delete for room. It wont be available for the loading screen BUT you get to keep taking more
---
I’ve loved ‘Wouldn’t it be Nice’ since I heard it in the trailer
---
If I have "Repair Kits" I could entirely respec my character and not worry about lots of the different perks that I have now for resources, repair, durability, etc.
---
I wouldn't have to leave combat half way through to go fix something - just pop the kit and I'm back to 100% armor, or my weapon works again, etc.  
---
Maybe I don't need to keep supplies in hand like: Steel, Aluminum, Rubber, Ballistic Fiber, Adhesive, Screws, Springs, Nuclear Material, Leather, Oil, etc. etc. etc.  This would allow me to have additional weapons, ammo, other gear, etc.
---
Of ***course*** clever players are going to exploit this to their advantage in multiple ways!
---
Why not put them in your stash?  
---
As I see the wording in the fermenter interface that's probably how they'll implement displays anyway, "separate" inventories coupled with your stash which display whatever items you specifically put into them  
---
The repair kits are not cosmetic and therefore should not be added if they can be bought with atoms. 
---
Anything with plastic like laser rifles. That's 21-42 shells for me.
---
This whole thing is just a trash fire isn’t it?
---
Just wait until the inevitable post tomorrow titled, "Am I only the one not freaking about repair kits and just playing the game?"
---
Apparently you already forgot The Unstoppables week sale when they had a slight hp boost for wearing the outfits on a team. Point is what does it matter when it's just a bit of 'convenience' like other games have done. Even then you should have had no problem managing weapon and armor repairs since you can literally make a camp appear out of thin air.  
---
Also, don't use words like 'us' and 'we'. You aren't some group leader. You are speaking for yourself, nobody else.  
---
I agree but even if it were "pay to win" people are acting like it's a threat to their very way of life or something.
---
One thing I haven't seen anyone mention yet is yeah they are just repair kits but this is more then likely just a test too see how it goes and if it goes well then they will start to slip in more and more non-cosmetics. 
---
They have lied about this game at every turn when do you say enough is enough and stop supporting this dev. After seeing how they have shit all over there fan base Fallout 4 will be the last Bethesda made game that I buy.
---
Just when I start thinking about going back in they push me back out!
---
I’ve had this happen with horde events, it’s really annoying.
---
THEY DONT CARE
---
I think I got this from fighting a bee at whitesprings. I'm currently miss ONE disease!
---
Wow your shop, someone tell Bethesda they no longer own the atom stop. Or if you worried that you can't pay for any of the items then use the Adult start pack which includes but not limited: get a job that requires 40hrs+ and not asking your mom or dad for money all the time and you too can buy stuff from atom store!
---
It  finally let me beat that one but only with about 120 40mm grenades on lv5  demo expert. 
---
I'll give that a go. Thanks!
---
I’m interested. What are the other stars?
---
Do you're a troll like the other commenter? Cool got it.
---
They should just not buy it and move on, with so little sells of it, they'll get the message. Spamming the subreddit with little to no info, and making up stuff helps no one and is annoying.
---
I would gladly pass this joint to some of these people. Some of them need to chilllllllll. 
---
I just hope they actually fix stuff...because if we now trust them to polish it and it still releases with some huge bugs (where some modder might already have and win another bet again) there won't be much for Bethesda to recover that trust, having that one feature many want, delaying it in hopes of polished release and still mess up :/
---
This one mystifies me, and I hate rolling the dice on a vendor’s legendary item only to find it was shite. Please Bethesda, when you patch in player vending go back and fix this...
---
I mentioned a sleeping requirement, if I remember right that was in FO4's survival mode but that might have been a mod. I honestly don't remember.
---
At the very least they could make the game more difficult by just having enemies higher level than average, they don't necessarily need to change damage or armor values or anything. Heck they could even have larger mobs in an area or something 
---
Swing speed all day in my opinion. That thing will shred mobs. 
---
I feel like it already has. I've been in game all of 5 mins since the last patch. I confirmed fasnacht was over and noped out. 
---
They really should have timed it to have another new thing at the same time they took away the last new thing. Now I just can't be arsed to fire it up...  And this news.... Smh
---
Thank you!
---
I am low level still, but Cannibal was a literal game-changer for me. 
---
The other thing was a water purifier plan. 
---
Eating and drinking are nothing more than a chore. 
---
Pro tip: give up on having all your stims. Carry four or five because those seem to be the first to go. I killed a group and walked away with 178 stims. Be smart, don't get hit lol
---
Prepare to get owned, fake gamer (⌐■_■)
---
BETHESDA, WE KNOW YOU ARE STILL HERE, WE CAN HEAR YOU BREATHING!!!  WE WOULD APPRECIATE A GOD DAMN RESPONSE REGARDING OUR RIGHTEOUS ANGER!!!!
---
It's the internet, people overreact to everything so this is unsurprising 
---
For looks. You can put a half wall then the short beam on top so the 2nd floor doesn’t look like it’s floating. I use beams all the time. 
---
Are they going to put power armor pieces in the atom store 
---
25% faster fire rate, 25% less vats action point cost.
---
People who do probably don’t play much or don’t care.
---
Also, crazy how quiet Bethesda’s been on Reddit since this news dropped - especially after a pretty vocal last month replying to almost every post here.
---
It’s like they know this sucks and don’t wanna get assaulted by fans on Reddit.
---
I was itching to buy Skyrim II even before Fallout IV came out, the financial issue is on them for that poor choice...
---
I almost hated Fallout because I felt like it was taking attention away from the more important game...
---
They screwed up w/Fallout 76 in numerous ways, that does not at all excuse using sale of PTC to recoup lost imaginary profits that they expected but didn't get...
---
Is it fifty per character, or per account? Having them on my ps4 is better than nothing, but a massive library of rad shots and a constantly different loading screen of your own creation and memories seems like the best.
---
Still, just wanted to remind people that in real life its not that big a deal and they don't need to lose their crap over it.
---
Personally this is starting to feel like a cash grab more than something they really pour themselves into, I know they have jobs but they should really be doing something else than fallout 76 if they aren't going to be passionate and create quality entertainment. Just compare fallout 76 to the borderlands franchise, it's such a massive difference.
---
It makes me really sad because I've been sticking out for so long looking at how great Bethesda did with this game until I saw this post. I definitely got my 60 dollars worth out of it but that's definitely it, nothing more worth value. 
---
I hope Bethesda does something about this for next time they make a fallout game, I'm just losing faith with one of my favorite game companies and it makes me sad.
---
I really don't understand what you're trying to do here. Are you under the impression that some random person on the internet is unaware of corporate malfeasance? What you're saying has no chance to impact my opinion because listing off a bunch of stuff that everyone knows about isn't an argument.
---
Lets turn your argument around. Are you saying that there would be no meaningful difference between the society we live in and one where no one complained, no one protested, no one wrote letters to the editor, there were no activism organizations? Where everyone just accepted when they got fucked over and never, ever reacted to it?
---
Because there are two answers to that question - and depending on which you pick, you either have to cut the legs out of your argument, or admit that you're an idiot.
---
I had jelly fingers, can't remember how though
---
Actually you are paying for more features... repair kits don’t exist in the game.  It’s literally a new feature you’re paying for.
---
If Bethesda can 1.) stick to their schedule 2.) not overpromise and 3.) Not introduce paid time savers that break important game loops, then I think in 6-9 months, maybe a year, you'll have your money's worth, similar to any other AAA title with a season pass. But if they keep delaying content or if they cancel promised content or if they add even more time savers and convenience items (You'd pay good money for a functional fridge in your CAMP right? Or more storage? Or maybe a backpack? Customized legendary gear tailored to your liking? XP Boosts? Perk cards? Display racks? Or a million other things everyone wants.) then sadly I don't think you're get to realize your investment.
---
I'd name it the grave digger...
---
What were you hoping to get for it? 
---
Well for starters a non-broken weapon is actually better than a broken one in that one is usable and one isn't.
---
Absolutely unacceptable to add non cosmetic items to the atom store.
---
very true
---
Idk what’s your offer
---
I like it tho.
---
Repair kits are strong because they can be used anywhere. With this, you don’t have to carry around additional weapons, which saves weight, and may not have the same legendary effects as your best weapon. Additionally, you don’t need to run perks like luck of the draw or gunsmith/ makeshift warrior, so that’s potentially 8 more perk points to use, which could be used to further increase damage/ health. So repair kits are pretty strong.
---
cue Gozilla meme
---
Let them Fight
---
I wish this worked. 
---
It doesn’t. 
---
Source: any cash shop mmo is ever. 
---
Certainly would be true IRL...  We are recycling all over, why not bullets?  We did it in NV IIRC. 
---
You can earn atoms so it's not really a big fucking deal.
---
Long term private servers will probably become a major revenue stream.
---
Assassin*
---
And while the lesser tier is paid for, they offer a higher tier in game on queen, and in sure end game bosses later. 
---
This is a good way to lose some of the few players they still have.
---
Hmm. 3000 caps?
---
Just accepted and loading up now! And I'll take the level 35!
---
I really appreciate it!!
---
I like the Atomic Shop (currently grinding for that America PA paintjob)
---
I love the idea of repair kits
---
I'm just not keen on having paid buffs in the game 
---
500 or 600 more and you got yourself a deal
---
it also opens the door to “buy new x-02 upgrade for your x-01” shenanigans. 
---
Tbf , battlefront 2 got its scummy boxs nuked from exsistance cause reddit xD.
---
I'm getting on in a bit. I'll look for your friend request. What is your IGN?
---
Ok. 3500 caps. What’s your gamertag?
---
It is not a paid buff though. 
---
There's also the Guild Wars 2 model of tying cash shop currency with in game currency. So while they have exclusives, they also are unlockable for people who play enough. And you could just pay cash if you wanted to save all that time farming. It's more complicated than you'd think to pull off though because the exchange rates fluctuate based on how much of each currency exists at any point, but it does tie real world money to in game currency.
---
Fasnacht masks drop rates 1st delusion 
---
Then Player vending machine delayed 
---
 And non cosmetics for atoms For real Beth ? 
---
okay kid
---
I would love this! I already love the kinda scrap book motif with the loading screens, so this would make it feel like road trip pictures and I would be all for it.
---
IGN is Dharb. Thank you. No rush.
---
Welcome to the internet fam lol.
---
Well done, and great points made. I really hope Bethesda rethinks this whole thing and doesn’t go back on their word(s)
---
Source? I'd actually be thrilled to be wrong on this

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
I just read about the repair kits from the update notes and there are a lot of things I would like to point out.
---
First, there are two types, the basic one which will be sold in the atom store and an advanced one that will be event rewards.
---
Second, while the basic one can be used anywhere and not use materials, it will only repair your gear up to 100%. If you have the perks to repair it above 100%, those will not work with it. I would not waste my atoms on it since I would just use the workbenches at my camp, whitesprings, red rocket/train stations, or one of the others that are literally everywhere.
---
Third, I carry at least 4 weapons on me at all time so I make sure I can still fight if one of them breaks or runs out of ammo. I do have one gun that breaks after 10 shots, but it had niche uses so I am not spraying bullets with it.
---
Lastly, the nice advantage of the repair kits is not using materials to repair armor and power armor. On the other hand, in one day, I can collect enough of the rare scrap to keep them repaired for a month and I can repair them to 200%...
---
As for the Bethesda saying only cosmetic stuff in the atom shop, I couldn't care less. Eventually, they will incorporate the creation club into it and that will be extra context for cash. So as long as they don't take away something like scrap and require us to pay real money for scrap, they can sell ultrasite bullets in the atom shop. It's not like we have to pay money to earn atoms either.
---
My gt is sSharrpShooter join me or inv me
---
True but I just wanted to remind people about reality.
---
goddamn Zetans
---
i was wondering about the new customizable  backpacks anyone got any info when it will be implemented or any other info on it
---
All of them are common drops from SBQ. Almost everyone has learned them already so I don't think there's gonna be a demand for your plans. But you might want to keep an eye out for ultracite calibrated shocks and serum plans. Those go for more than 5k caps but keep in mind they are very rare
---
How about fucking integrity when someone gets on stage in an event and says the cosmetic shop will be cosmetic only ******
---
****** until we need to upgrade our bottom line. 
---
People can’t get refunds for this and they were sold a lie. That should cause people concern.  
---
There’s a concept of a “lemon law” which doesn’t apply to everything but maybe it should. 
---
Each is about 1k but thats the high side
---
I think the concept of pay 2 win is that if you pay more you will win over other player who didnt pay. What i think is that repair kits wont be pay to win because it simply give player option to won over time. Like you said vendors and player trades would option but it still take time to grind for something that they want or caps which is virtually same since you can earn atom point by playing game either way. I am not teyong to say you are wrong. I am saying if Bethesda put item that gives you like thriple shot or reducing ap cost that would definitely pay to win but repair kit is not yet ti call it pay to win. So i think i would like to see what future contents would be in the atom store. 
---
For now i got about 700lbs of junk in my trunk i think I'm going to be ok. Also i never had a problem finding junk for now without server hopping for certain junk i need and i don't hop that much. Food decay is not bothering me yet i got lead belly perk maxed out so i eat everything with no problems. Never used white knight perk so that didn't bother me when they nerfed that.
---
Interesting. Do you have a pic of that
---
You are the one declaring it as a paid buff to begin with. For anyone who needs to provide source material is you. I am using common sense along with many years of online game when it comes to buying content online. Repair kits don't buff you worth shit, especially since you have to go all the way into your inventory menu, inspect, then use repair kit option. If you are in PvP, that time spent going through your menu can get you killed. So no, it isn't an advantageous buff!
---
Cool, thanks for sharing your experience.   
---
I was curious what other online/survival type games you've tried cause I like some online survival games and also really love the Fallout series...except Fallout 4.   
---
I've always wanted something like a co-op Fallout 3 or co-op FNV.  I had actually pre-ordered F76 but then a few days later read the PC Gamer article where they got to play F76 for a few hours a month or so prior release and that article stated, "F76 plays and feels a **lot** like FO4."  After reading that I immediately cancelled my pre-order on Amazon.
---
After reading all the scathing reviews, seeing the different Perk exploits on YouTube, and seeing the Atom shop and microtransactions (abuse of the customer, essentially) I felt that F76 wasn't for me &amp; was really disappointed.   
---
I keep my eye on it though because the game is still essentially in development so it may turn into what I was looking for after all. Eventually.    
---
I just wanted a game with the *atmosphere* of Fallout 3 with the ability to run around and explore with friends but also with people who role-play "normal" wastelanders while others role-play raiders, and that's also a survival simulator.   
---
That game I mentioned, Miscreated, feels a *lot* like FO3 even though it's not. F76's atmosphere  seems more aligned with Fo4 than 3.   
---
How though? I can't get floors to attach to them that aren't foundations
---
Yeah unfortunately this happens a lot, you can still VATS the enemy through the way and when they die they’ll usually fall out of it, still super annoying tho.
---
Whether they decide to care will be entirely based on the magnitude of backlash. Kind of my entire point
---
Lovely, yet another reason these one time appearance limited times are just beyond dumb. They missed out on plenty of people who would've bought it, hell I'd even put up with an email that told me when new shit is out limited time.
---
Can't say enough good things about "Sixteen Tons" and "I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire," too.
---
Okay byeeeeee
---
As someone who was apart of the TakeBackMassEffect movement, I can absolutely tell you harassing, badgering, and tagging devs and community managers is the best way to get them to listen. The squeaky wheel gets the grease. 
---
Yeah I know. I was even thinking about that while I wanted above. It's never that easy.
---
I understand the idea of free market but people are passionate about video games. It’s like sports or actors or celebrities or song artists. People wanna see their favorite succeed and seeing them do something that will obviously receive backlash sucks. Video games are in a special position though as the fans actually get to have some influence on the product. Unlike movies or tv or songs. 
---
The mentioned bringing repair kits to the Atomic Shop in today's in the vault. You can see it in the launcher
---
Sorry, I asked for a source cause I thought you saw something that clarified their position. 
---
Unfortunate timing on my part.  Appreciate you checking out the thread.  I might have to try again next week when the drama has calmed down a little bit and I have a better chance of people seeing this thread.
---
Yep. I was thinking of finally coming back, and here we are. Bethesda is trying their hardest to ruin this game.
---
A stickied post would be amazing.
---
It ain't pay to win. It's grind to win. You grind achievements for atoms. If you don't want that, then pay real money
---
True but the backlash won't be as bad as the profit so if what you say is true then they should be happy for "their favorite" as obviously this is going to help them succeed...
---
Yup, these ones are just complete arse because they want people to not have enough atoms in time and buy them but all that happens is people weren't playing that one day and missed it. Dumb as hell either have them up for a lot longer or one day long on repeat every few days.
---
One day items cycled every Saturday or something for example so people KNOW when they're gonna appear.
---
Yes they are in the shop but they also are acquired via random missions in the map. 
---
Also my point still stands
---
The greater danger is that you have undiagnosed illness...why are you still playing it? That will get it's next fix the next time Americans dont vote for trump. 
---
Bethesda isn't going to change because of this. They added repair kits to the store in Elder Scrolls Online. There was the same reaction, and about a month later everything died down, repair kits were also highly available in game through regular play, too. They went through the same uproar in the ESO community... and then it died down.
---
They later added food, drinks, and XP scrolls to ESO, too. The XP buffs  already been datamined in game via the way of lunchboxes, too.
---
Expect Bethesda to focus on adding additional "convenience items" in the game. They're not technically pay to win, but... they're probably coming. They've had a successful history of selling them in one game, and ZOS was consulted during development of the game. This was probably a large part of their contribution.
---
Guess what I want, I want this game not to be about only being to win if you live off your parents. I work 40hrs+ and if I want a small boost I should be able to pay for it plus how do you thinks Fallout 76 is going to make free DLC? Let me guess the positive vibes you send them? No they need hard cash to get DLC rolling or this game is going down. Transactions aren't bad by default, they can be good for the every day player too busy with life along with helping pay for better servers and DLC in the future.
---
It also brings into question whether any other decision in the game is properly balanced or weighted against you to lure you into paying.  Is the food spoilage rate faster than it needs to be?  Am I getting less useful ammo than I should be?  Is the carry limit artificially low so I want to send scrap home?
---
Don't you put that evil on us.
---
It's Bethesda that needs to read the 100 post not you. See you in a few days though I understand.
---
Just like Pokémon go!
---
If you are showing level 46, but have perk points built up, you are not actually able to get the level 46 perks yet.
---
Example: you show level 46, but have 5 level up points, you are currently showing level 41 able perks.
---
Lord knows what fiasco would occur if they released it prematurely. If something isn't ready, keep it back until it is.
---
How about instead of flooding the front page with this nonsense we push up the real problems with the CURRENT state of the game like how bad pvp is, the many many many bugs, maybe some game optimization? 
---
Cosmetic and non-mechanical transactions can make just as much money. There's no *need* for them to do this. 
---
They are not buffs because they don't make your gear more powerful or repair higher than 100% condition.  To me they would actually be weaker since with my perks I repair my gear to 200% at work stations.  A better question is how ARE they buffs? 
---
Thanks for the help:)
---
amidst all the chaos and complaining, lies the calm between the storm.
---
Why worry about the future when today is certain
---
Sorry for the dumb question, I don’t Reddit that often. But these ‘repair kits ‘ ....... ? Are they to repair a weapon, or armor????? Either way, why does anyone care about this when you can just repair your weapon/armor at a work bench??? Especially those players that have the right perks?? It costs next to nothing to repair said item. I’m a little confused about the whole situation. And again, please forgive my ignorance. 
---
Yes, this is a nightmare. The mass forced opinion is starting to get out of hand.
---
Messaged you. 
---
Not trolling, just old enough to identify shit and wise enough to get my money back for a product that did not entertain. The building mode was the only thing keeping me in and I made beautiful masterpieces, but I kept getting builders bugs like 400% build limit bug and finally had enough of its bullshit. The company saw this and refunded me even after my return period. :-/
---
Ok cool ty 
---
Yeah it's a pain but I use the reflex sights and I've gotten used to where the cross hair is on it
---
The fact that you couldn’t find the report button in game leads me to believe you don’t care to understand certain builds that would lead to this scenario happening. You big mad bro it’s cool I get heated when I die but that doesn’t mean the other person was cheating. Join my game on Xbox and we can recreate the exact scenario I promise, bet I won’t take any health damage from you.
---
&gt;edging on pay to win
---
come on. you can't have it both ways. Either it's not pay to win, or it's not a waste of atoms.
---
That's the point of an up vote system. All reposting this does is push other issues into the background and get people to not want to even take a look at the reddit. 
---
&gt;Repairing items increases their DMG/DR thus granting you more power
---
but anyone can repair an item, not just those with a kit.
---
You get Decontamination Shower from the first queen you kill, although I'm not sure whether it's a Scorched Earth event drop or a queen drop. Probably not worth much because it's easier to acquire than the flux.
---
Those particular prime plans aren't popular, but the queen won't re-drop prime plans that you've learnt, so they have some indirect value. Learn them yourself and you'll increase the chance of getting a good prime plan, or one that you want.
---
Ultracite Sensor Array is fairly common and also not popular. I don't think the ultracite plans work in the same way as prime plans, so it doesn't much matter what you do with it.
---
But you can pay for more, which I take issue with
---
Yeah, it probably won't be super helpful for pvp or whatever, but it's a way to pay the grind away. And regardless, it's a foot in the door for Bethesda to start walking back its cosmetics-only promise
---
This post was meant to be more tongue in cheek than combative, my b
---
why would you covet a repair kit, that's completely different from weapon upgrades.
---
Repair kit on atomic shop its ok for me. I dont understand all the drama queen about that.
---
Gimme that sweet sweet karma brigade, momma needs karma for a better next life.
---
Holy fuck. 
---
Are you actually defending the concept that placing something which has even a minute impact to the gameplay outside of cosmetics is ok in a game which was promised to be cosmetics only?
---
I don't "Like" having them in the Atomic Shop, but I am not against them either. They only repair to 100% which is less than the 200% I am used to. The only use I could see is fixing my gun when I am not paying attention and let it break all the way on accident. Honestly, by the time I hit lvl 15 or so, I never had to worry about repairs like at lvl 1. I had so much extra junk I could fully repair all the time with no issue
---
Wait what are you fr?? I've been waiting for the 1 flux I need for ever now?? For no reason?????
---
Yeah, I suppose that's true. Maybe consumables would have been a better term? 
---
It sucks that the world will nvr be united in important issues because of this. If only we had perfect information. 
---
What the fuck does Trump have to do with this?
---
I got jelly fingers from a Honeybeast.
---
That drawing is about as good as the game is rn
---
The only thing a bunch of morons buying this stuff does is give us real players free DLC. Now, imo, the accounting on dev costs and income from the shop should be transparent, but obviously that's not going to happen. 
---
Repairing your stuff the normal way will still be there. The kits will be for repair on the fly so you don't need a bench.
---
These repair kits can only repair to 150%, why is everyone in such a fuss about it? I can repair all my shit to 200%, and it really costs very little materials. 
---
Granted, I've been away from the sub for a bit, and just had to look up what repair kits were after seeing all these posts.
---
Ya okay are you having fun shitting on people?
---
The open-world, post-apocalyptic, online game I've been playing has all of these except for the nukes and quests. It's more freeform: "make your own goals."  
---
The weather system and effects, environment, and graphics are absolutely AMAZING but you need a heavy duty computer to run it (Crysis engine).   
---
Also, *no load screens.* It's all one world. After all the load screens I've put up with over the years from the Fallout series, The Long Dark, Quake, Deus Ex, etc., having no load screens whatsoever makes an amazing amount of difference regarding world immersion.   
---
What's the most fun *public event* you've participated in in F76 so far? Kinda curious about that.  
---
For my understanding those basic kits will be entirely exclusive of atom store and for 150% and 200 % ability to craft those will be tied to scorched beast queen and quests or event ( plans )
---
Yeah. The perfect information bit is the biggest problem I think. No one can make a rational decision on anything if we don't know what's really going on.
---
Actually the ones you get in missions will be more powerful than the standard Atomic Shop Variety. The Atomic version repairs to 100% and the Mission ones will be 150%...both are less than the 200% you can do with the right perks the old fashioned way. The only way I would complain is if they made the Atomic Shop variety repair more than the 200%
---
I started with one foundation and did a staircase up. Once I had a floor on top of the staircase I just ran around placing those to make it look right. They snap to the side of the floor and go right into the ground if that makes sense. 
---
Right but which ones help you cheat?
---
I came back to my camp one day  to find some troubled individual wrecking my camp, I threw up the ??? emote, they continued unfazed.  Simple solution, I logged out, and back in, to another server, left the clown standing in the middle of nowhere, clicked on C.A.M.P. "repair all" and hand full of scrap, good as new.
---
Well, admitting you made the post just for karma isn't going to help your case. 
---
As a Gen Z would say, Oof.
---
Also good on ya for owning it
---
( this ) 
---
Cost 16 steel some aluminum some adhesive and other crap to fix something for an entire game sesión or 2 
---
Can’t repair them until they are broken.
---
There’s a difference. This is the playerbase that has stuck with the game through all of that.
---
well let's just hope they realize their probably last chance at trust with the community...now they have the chance to listen to the community and show that delaying player vending leads to a polished feature
---
Agree the real grind is there and even then we need enough challenges for atoms not only what is existent already “season” also should have atom challenges 
---
Yeah, let’s just sit idly by... I’d rather badger them and show the disgust than just accept it. 
---
If this was a single player game then yea that makes sense but this is a constantly maintained constantly developed online game. It costs a lot to be able to maintain and build up this thing between developers and hardware and other costs. 
---
The two seconds of research I did suggests nobody is worried about the kits themselves. But rather, it is paving a path to more non-cosmetics in the shop.
---
Bit number two is now you’ll be able to repair anywhere rather than only at work stations.
---
Give it a minute a bunch of people will come out of the wood work to defend it and sub sentiment will change.
---
I played every beta, and the week before the beta. I've also stuck through it ;)
---
I mean fallout 76 is cheap to buy so it’s not a high cost risk to see if you like it or not. The atom shop isn’t bad because you earn atoms in game as you play. The reviews were mostly bad because of the bugs but it’s been updated a lot now so it’s play exceptionally better than it did. 
---
Exactly right, my man 
---
I look around for them when I go in to sell to the vendors.
---
Lol I agree with you
---
You can try storing the CAMP item and placing it again. That worked for me in the past.
---
Yeah. I thought you were saying they will somehow make you stronger. And for the record, while I don't share your position on the Kits being Atomic Shop, I do hope this doesn't lead to actual Pay to Win purchases.   But we will wait and see. ESO has lots of similar items in their cash shop and it's not close to Pay to Win
---
Thanks. Ots just the next negativity karma bandwagon anyway.
---
I haven’t tried that. I’ll have too for my walls and stuff. 
---
What is this 6th post about this already about bunch of kids crying. Its obvious your just karma farming on reddit or you lack a job like any adult would have since a small amount of change is nothing to a hard working adult. Transactions help people like me who have to work for a living 40hrs+, everything including drinking water is bad in excess but without it you die just like this game.
---
So have I.. my point is that they have to listen to their playerbase now because it’s the people that actually like the game 
---
Not sure if you'll take my word for it cause I'm the original poster but I did confirm the code worked last night before posting it here.  I tried to add it to nukacrypt but I had some problems doings so. (Mostly user error on my part). But here's the silo codes. If you could add it for others I would appreciate that. 
---
F-5, H-8, M-9, N-8, P-9, Q-6, S-2, U-2
---
And the keywords/codewords are UNDERJAWS and TRIBUNAL.
---
This code had like 3 answers and I was up with my hubby till 3am collecting the code pieces and confirming it was correct. Haha. 😂😁
---
Camp Repair kit just 100000 Atoms
---
There is a good video of someone ( I think rifle gaming) nuking white springs in survival and it is insane! It’s like how WS use to be before they nerfed it multiple times! I played for 30 minutes the second day and after costing me like a thousand caps after being spawn trapped I called it quits lol. 
---
Don't worry theres a bunch of stuff planned for toxic valley later in this expansion
---
I like radiation fever I believe it’s called. Lots of good loot and it’s fun. 
---
Yeah if you love wasting those hours you spend at work on imaginary shit so you can smash those kids you are belittling.
---
For aesthetic purposes 
---
Fallout 1 and 2
---
I honestly wouldn’t know I’m not well versed in the trading economy of the game
---
So, to play devil's advocate, how about a situation in which there are fighting mutants while already limited resources?  If you have a threat that could harm your chances for survival, a raider wouldn't leave an established settlement for new threats to get the idea that this place is okay to settle down in. They would take what they could, burn it down and kill everything that stood in their way. While we get upset at greifers, we have to recognize that there are other options than letting it happen.
---
 The center button on your Xbox controller opens a menu that will shut off your xbox. It takes 4-5 seconds. I've had to do it to save my camp before. 
---
The environment that these teams foster holds true to how humanity destroyed itself in the storyline. It's nice that we have a pacifist mode and knowing that I need to be wary of outsiders creates a paranoia that helps me create new ways to stop them. 
---
Like someone said, if you want to build, do it in a place that is rarely visited. If it gets destroyed, you can repair all structures with the camp focal point. The human element is a welcome measure of apocalyptic necessity.
---
Pfffttt lol!
---
Yep, shoulda played it straight like all the others.
---
God dammit Todd, how could you do this in the most intense PvP game on the market?  If my teammates can repair fast, then bad things happen.
---
Really bad.  So bad, can't even say.  Baddy bad.
---
Especially with explosive weapons, you could probably slaughter a whole server with one of those before it broke 
---
You have to be below 30% health though for serendipity 
---
&gt;Also, crazy how quiet Bethesda’s been on Reddit since this news dropped
---
And how quiet their head of marketing has been ever since it launched.
---
Just a tip if you build a Decontamination Shower for yourself make sure you store it when you aren’t using it! I learned earlier today after getting mine people like to destroy them! Was a pain for me getting more flux to repair it. 
---
Christ pull your head out your arse yeah?
---
They already did those in preparation for this stuff, do you not remember the repair nerfs a few patches ago?
---
Highschool + gym + Summersville = shotty shells 
---
I crafted over 500 shells this way I dedicated most of my efforts today to get rid of some extra guns powder I had lol 
---
Such overreactions.  This isn't pay to win.  If a guy uses his credit card to buy 100 repair kits it does not affect anyone else in the slightest.  He wins nothing.  I would even say he lost.  We have the opportunity to earn atoms in the game.  What's the difference whether you grind for materials to craft them or you grind for atoms to buy them?  It's a convenience.  It's not the same as putting more powerful weapons in the shop that can only be purchased with real money.  Weapons that give an advantage in pvp.  That's pay to win.  This is just not.  
---
It's not pay to win. You can get advanced repair kits in game through normal means. You buy a plan for basic ones in the atom shop but you still have to have the mats to craft it. 
---
Lets hope you are right.
---
Todd needs a new yacht
---
OH AwSoMe TaNkS lmao
---
Remember, no collusion.
---
Well yeah, the game is far from perfect and honestly juicehead puts out fairly balanced videos but his entire channel is fallout, channels focused on just general gaming news only ever report on the negatives of the game because it gets clicks and everyone loves to hate.
---
I don’t have a problem with the way things are RIGHT NOW. if they change it from this, then I’ll take issue
---
Yes, but follow the roads, using something like a dragon. You will lose its CND before you get to the next bench. a repair kit allows you to not lose it before that bench. 
---
&gt;It’s testing the waters to see there’s a market for it.
---
This isn't "testing the waters". This was available in in Elder Scrolls Online years ago. They've had years of "testing" to see how these things will sell. They have the data and they've already done the math. 
---
If it you makes you feel better, repair kits were so easy to find in ESO sales didn't matter except for the laziest of people.
---
Aww ok 
---
Oh, honestly, I think this will blow over like all of the other non-controversies this game has kicked up. Bethesda has been pretty good about listening to their players throughout this whole thing
---
I'm still iffy about paid consumables, but like I said in another post, I was more trying to be tongue in cheek
---
Don’t you guys have cellphones ?!
---
Btw blades on iPhone is pretty good I give them that 
---
Sicko ,... tell me more ,..
---
Just when this game was starting to pick up positive traction Bethesda has to snuff it. Repair kits are just the start, Bethesda would sell legendary weapons on the shop if they could. They are already testing it on ES: Blades please people DO NOT BUY, let Bethesda know we are going to HOLD THEM to their promise of COSMETIC ONLY.
---
I understand your concern and im proud of you for taking a stand about it. I'm sure some of this stuff will change. Have a nice day.
---
Maybe if the most expensive item on the atom store would be perhaps 500 for the most rarest item I would those thing selling more often shit I wouldn’t mind paying 20 dollars ( 2000 atoms let’s say ) to get 4 season pay ( or grind ) kinda like GTA 
---
It's friendly unless they don't like something then they can be very aggressive. But it's better than a lot of others
---
The flux is included in the mod. It is literally what it is. 
---
"Boot" isn't the noun I would have chosen.
---
You should quit now, and whatever you do, don't look on ebay.
---
Kinda glad I stopped playing now. Haven't played since December. I don't really miss it. I certainly got my $60 worth of playing in.
---
ROFL @ "content creators". They don't produce video games, they just get paid to play them and run their mouths. They should call themselves what they really are - marketing whores. Billy Mays got a lot of attention too, but that didn't mean his product reviews were valuable.
---
Yeah.. Not everyone has the same feeling towards that game...
---
Like I personaly see it as pointlessand non-challenging.
---
Just give it a few days before their bosses tell them what to say. I remember when Bethesda "fixed" (broke a whole bunch of stuff) or announced something and the CM's were quiet for a day or two. Right now they're probably doing internal damage control
---
Sounded like a lot of people complained about repairing, so yeah, they've listened! Haha.
---
Looks Like i have a good reason To not pick It back up again
---
I've bought and played plenty of complete games. This was not one of them. It only took us maybe 2 weeks of 1 to 2 hours a day playing to make it through the main questline. The biggest hold up was grinding to get ammo and repair items. The side quests didn't take much time at all either, most of it was fetching items and grinding ammo. The daily quests, most of them are bugged or way too repetitive, especially now with all the get drunk and xx, complete xx drunk. I loved the events but 9 times out of 10 the only ones that show up when I'm on are Uranium Fever, the Suitors, the one in Flatwoods or a horde event. That said, I was really engaged and was excited for new content especially vending; unfortunately faschnat was really it for the new content short of pvp and Biv (more fetch quests). 
---
 While he hasn't played, I have a decent amount. He usually makes his comments when I'm playing, like why am I bothering. Despite the early issues, I really liked the game up until patch 6 or 7, the one right after faschnat ended. I started getting 3 to 4 "server not responding" messages every night. Issues with the reactors in the silo not registering repairs, disconnects in the silo, disconnects in the nuke zones. When that is your end game content, those issues get old, fast.
---
What do you mean a bee?  I don't know of any honey beasts or bee swarms near the Whitespring and I don't think they give Jelly Fingers anyway.  You mean like a bloatfly, stingwing, bloodbug, etc.?
---
What?
---
Next they will be selling 3 star legendaries in the atom shop for only 8000 atoms.
---
That would mean FoNV was the better of the series. And BGS can’t swallow that pill. 
---
This is blown way out of control. You guys are loosing your minds over nothing. It's just a convenient option for lazy people. They earn no game winning material from this at all.

Well that’s fine ^ ^ we’ve all got our preferences

Say, if I could buy a "repair" kit which let me not have to carry so much junk/store so much in my "Stash", so I could re-spec my character not worrying about cards which help me get more junk and make my weapons and armor last longer - I could focus more on perks which made my character do more damage, take less damage, etc., and I could carry + store a wider selection of weapons and armor making myself more powerful, particularly if there were big adjustments/nerfs - having kept more than one or two specific strong items that are now (relatively) much weaker I'm not at the disadvantage of other players who couldn't afford/didn't choose to use cash to purchase a ton of "repair kits" like I had.  This kind of cheat would appeal to me a little more than other types such as wall hacks or aim bots because I like to pretend that I'm winning because my skill is higher, but still feel like I'm playing.  After all, who doesn't want to "get a leg up" on the other guy, find some way to "get ahead" a little and win more than you lose?  
---
In addition to repair kids, if I could say, purchase a way to carry or store more stuff that would be a big "help" (I put it in quotes, because I wouldn't actually view it as positive - I've tried cheating in single player games in the past, such as editing my save file to give me more/better items, thinking it would be great if I could not die so much, but then found that the game was no longer fun once I cheated.  I have not cheated in multi-player games other than purchasing "ESO Plus" a couple times, I since stopped playing ESO and uninstalled because I don't like that Pay To Cheat model, even if it is "less bad" than aimbos, wallhacks, or super powerful weapons - it's still an unfair advantage compared to a player who does not have/cannot afford ESO Plus.
---
Do you know where this was?  I specifically fought a diseased honeybeast in the Mire to get Heat Flashes.  What region were you in?
---
I agree. You can 'buy' the crappy one, but go out and earn the good one. Personally, I can count on one hand the number of times I wished I would have had a weapon repair kit, and I've got around 500 hours in this game. So, when it does come out, I won't be buying. I'll get the in-game good one, and carry a single kit on me only for nuke zones--and that's depending upon how much they weigh. More than likely, I won't ever use them, just like all the chems I hoard and never use. Hopefully they'll be worth selling.
---
This is not pay to win. This is paying for convenience.
---
Well said 
---
Ya okay well for us people who don't have all the money in the world making it p2w would ruin it for us
---
I don’t think it will though. This game obviously doesn’t have a large player count. This reddit isn’t nearly the majority but we can’t act like a million people play every day. Bethesda would be lucky as hell to sell ten thousand repair kits but would absolutely lose thousands of players due to an addition like this. I personally don’t overly care but the fans are just trying to stop a problem before it starts. 
---
mmHmm, I tried so hard to play it too, but it just doesnt want to be played lmao
---
Two words.
---
Hellfire. Power Armor.
---
Ok, three words. But i would gladly deal some dosh for a purely cosmetic set that just counts as "paint" for X-01 power armor.
---
Is only game 
---
sorry but no. sometimes survival mode is the only way i can earn a little fast travel money for adventure mode. make a mule store all your valuables. you obviously haven't played survival mode long enough to adapt to the new rule set. adapt and survive, choose your battles wisely. if they're not carrying then hop to another survival server. it is that simple. adapt and survive.
---
good luck wastelander
---
I honestly don’t see the big deal , it’s not game changing to repair my weapon mid Sbq fight and contribute still as opposed to swinging my fists and being dead weight , ... not P2W in my opinion,.. more quality of life ,.. for weekend warriors like myself who don’t live in game it’s a convenience
---
Good choice lolol just wait for the FO3 remaster tbh
---
Oh yeah, I think it's grea people can enjoy it.
---
Thanks to all of you 
---
Honeybeasts can spawn at whitesprings in place of the deathclaw/wendigo
---
Idk why you’re getting downvoted. Must be the microtransactions fiends who spend money on everything. The gaming culture is so fucked right now that I guarantee they’ll monetize it
---
I need to chime in here. I spent 3 weeks chasing east penitentiary events for a chance to unlock these plans. 
---
At level 52 I traveled to watoga station and the plans were listed at the vendor for 1944 caps.
---
There is not a level cap.
---
Not if anyone iver at beth has a brain they won't.
---
Well yeah, I figured that was implied lolol but for 76 I feel like theres little to no point putting them on the atom shop except to drive up sales
---
C'mon dude. They wouldn't lose thousands over the repair kits. People would be mad but not that many would just give up the game completely. And yes this game does literally have millions of players and its player count is plenty healthy. Idk why people think that way, the servers are packed on xbox.
---
Slippery slope.
---
They have these in ESO but you get some free ones every month just for logging in. 
---
Update! I got the clock and the Nuka Cola Machine! 
---
Lolol truuuu
---
Lol.
---
I should have mentioned this is for a bloodied build. My average HP is between 20-30%. 
---
when redditors turn against their own white knights
---
Like the spawn in the middle of the grounds?  I usually only see deathclaws, yao guai, or radscorpions there.
---
Ok so they'll snap to second floor pieces but the second floor pieces wouldn't snap to them for me. Would that be because I was just trying to attach it to the top of the post with no stairs and therefore no way to access it? I've had that come up when trying to delete second floor pieces that would isolate another floor piece.
---
Don’t forget all the people who think this subreddit completely over reacts to every single little thing like it’s the end of the world. Many of them will wait and see how it’s actually implemented before they start making up their decisions.
---
In order to keep pushing out high quality content the players are going to have to start spending real money again.  I think it's very cool that Bethesda is allowing us to farm atoms just by playing.
---
I'm not wild about the idea of utility items being sold for atoms, but I'm ok with the eventuality that future large content packs will require players to either purchase or save up a huge amount of atoms to unlock.  Without revenue there's no way to continue paying employees to continue creating new content.
---
The repair kits aren't necessary to continue playing without spending any atoms.  Gunsmith, Makeshift Warrior and Luck of the Draw exist.  My PA/Slugger character has two different sledges and a fireaxe.  If I manage to break all of those before finding a weapon bench, that's on me.
---
I hope that they don't start to ignore weapon durability issues (auto laser rifles are still made of hopes and dreams) for the sake of selling more kits.  Is it really the worst thing to have a few "oh crap" items in the shop?  If you forgot to repair your only gun or ran out of food, that's kinda on you as a careless player.  If a six pack of repair kits costs 10 atoms, that's hardly a reason to start burning effigies.  Sometimes I make 10-20 atoms just by accident before I check the daily challenges.
---
Realistically, I got 100's of hours of entertainment out of my $60 pre-order.  I could blow way more than $60 taking my wife out to dinner and a movie, easy.  That's like 4 hours of entertainment, tops.  If I can trade Bethesda $20 for a well made expansion pack in the future, tell me where to send the check now.
---
Lol. Agree completely.  It's Pay to Convenience, not Pay to Win. And that's a stretch.  I'll take my 200% repairs from the Work station over the crappy 100% kit any time!
---
Yes that’s the spot. I’ve seen all 5. Maybe more. Cant remember. 
---
If I spend money to buy repair kits I can be out in the wild getting xp and loot while you waste your time gathering repair materials and finding a place to repair. Pay to win.
---
Tong Yoa here
---
Fair point but I wanted a fun game with my $80 not an investment
---
Hope they're watching.
---
REALLY hope they're watching. 
---
They said player vending was pushed. Not that patch 8 as a whole was pushed. That’s your own fault for not reading. 
---
Waaaaattttt..... Count me as one confused person lol
---
Good perspective 
---
Yeah but imagine Bethesda adding mutations and stimpacks or radaway to the shop that would be so bad
---
It probably had to do with the stairs. Who knows with them sometimes. 
---
We dint care. All a weed needs to grow is a root
---
The arrogance of this generation never surprises me. I have the video evidence I can send to you, if you need it. I have reported them and I've shared the videos too. If I can send them in a message to you on here I will
---
Holy shit exactly how many threads about this issue are we going to have today? 
---
Oh sorry didn't see the sleep thing but I see your point
---
I'm not disagreeing. 
---
See no option for it’s a good idea in case my weapon breaks mid sbq fight and the nearest bench is in a nuke zone so getting out of Power Armor is not plausible ,... just saying....
---
I agree that Bethesda is being inundated with requests and it's good that some suggestions are being implemented. 
---
_________________________________
---
Two points I'd like to discuss though:
---
- I upvoted portable repair suggestions. However I am sure the majority of players don't want pay to win. Bethesda will probably make some minor tweaks as to not cross the line but I truly believe a game like this should be cosmetic only in the shop. Guild wars 2 is one of the few games that comes to mind where their shop items like repair canisters really have very little impact. The repair canisters rarely need to be used and never mid combat.
---
I am aware that if we want Bethesda to be constantly fixing bugs, Making balance changes and adding new content then there is a cost associated. I actually was hoping that fo76 would have no store and instead a monthly subscription. An initial cost of $60 plus $7-10 per month is not unreasonable. Shit, I probably averaged that in donations to skyrim modes per month (see below).
---
- There are departments that fix bugs and there are departments that create new content. I don't have an IT background but you would think that more resources would be allocated to fix the myriad of bugs that exist, especially given the bad PR that fo76 took last fall. 
---
Previous Bethesda games were great but it was the modding community that elevated them to amazing by fixing bugs and making minor tweaks to improve the game(s). Aside from mmo's, Skyrim is my most played PC game. I had about 500 hours into the game when I was almost done with it. But because of mods, I have almost 2000 hours played.
---
They part was mostly a joke but either way Todd would still get the flak
---
&gt;but it's also not as evil as you're portraying it.
---
It's also standard practice for companies to introduce more and more non-cosmetic MTX as seen in MMOs decades earlier and other Live Service games as recent as a few years ago. 
---
It's likely the direction they intended all along. Which to me says they intended this from the outset.
---
Edging. As in future updates would grow into a hellish landscape of P2W transactions if we let this and similar future products slide.
---
Don't underestimate companies. They are not your friends. Their marketing teams will always be pushing on the developers and artists to make more and more money in increasingly awful ways *if you just accept it*. They are a necessary evil but rely entirely on consumers to thrive. Do you think it's a coincidence that recent popular games have loot boxes that rely on gambling addictions to garner income? That it isn't because of market research that *doesn't* have the consumer interest in mind?
---
It is not the repair kits that are pay to win, it is the road they would lead to.
---
Flooding this subreddit with posts saying the exact same thing isn’t going to make a difference.  One thread, highly upvoted, with a lot of comments agreeing will get Bethesda’s attention just as well as a flood of posts repeating the same complaint.
---
Flooding the subreddit with such posts also drowns out posts about other concerns and make it less likely that Bethesda will see them.
---
And finally, flooding the subreddit with the same complaint over and over is likely going to result in Bethesda employees taking a break from the reason the sub until the backlash dies down. They know from one highly upvoted and commented on post that people have an issue, they don’t need to read 50 of them.
---
And keeping it in one post makes it easier for those employees to sift through people’s opinions and suggestions, instead of having to read 50 different posts.
---
I’m sorry, but the fact of the matter is flooding the subreddit doesn’t make a difference in the end. Except by making people who don’t want to see 50 posts about the same thing unsub.
---
Wasn't cosmetic only a promise made by Bethesda ?
---
[Fallout 76 Microtransactions Won’t be Pay-to-Win, Says Pete Hines](https://www.vgr.com/fallout-76-microtransactions-hines/)
---
“If you don’t want to spend money in the Atomic shop for cosmetic stuff you don’t have to,” says Hines
---
Looks like the needle may be moving away from that.
---
Sorry. Those beers spoiled due to a recent patch change.
---
Would you like to buy the &lt;working refrigerator&gt; camp upgrade plan for 2500 atoms?
---
#flood
---
Oh, I missed this. I actually really like this move
---
I have 3* top one, it was price checked around 20k. You should take the deal, I really like it. I forget the third perk top of my head but I think it has something to do with AP. 
---
Got ya 
---
Cause the developpers of New Vegas actually know how to make game.
---
I made a post earlier about a way to fix this so everyone wins. But everyone seemed to be mad. But I’ve seen made a revision. 
---
Make the basic repair kit free. Same the poster from brewing. 
---
Then. Slap the kit on the atomic shop and hit it with 500 atom cost. BOOM it’s 5$ or whatever your currency is. 
---
The people that can buy it can go for it. And those that don’t need to or want can still enjoy the item. It’ll still drop in game as said. And the queen will still drop it as well and any other bosses that get added.
---
How is that hard of a concept to grasp. We all win. And BGS gets some money in the works. Just make sure the crafting requirements are fair but challenging. 
---
Sure, even if I don’t have friends.
---
Atoms are free
---
Game is not MP unless you want it to be
---
Not an issue.
---
Ya I'm just frustrated right nlw because of the electrical in the game and those posts have been confusing/frustrating me for a while now so I had to figure those out
---
This actually isnt P2W, its pay to earn faster. Since you can earn atoms pretty easily in the base game I see no problem as long as the price is fair
---
...k
---
Yeah and mentioned, I've seen some videos of blatantly obvious cheaters. I'm sorry you and others experienced first hand accounts.
---
It's not griefing when you get killed on an open PvP server.
---
I really really really REALLY wanted to like FO76. But.. It's just not good. The removal of NPCs was a huge blunder. And the story is really uninteresting. I'm very disappointed by this game. I don't play anymore because I just don't care. I played FO4 for like 2 years.. Everyday. Seriously. Every day. They've really crippled the franchise. At least I have Outer Worlds  to look forward to.
---
Then make a correct arguement, dont claim one thing then flip to another. Argue the slippery slope model because that's what everyone seems to actually be upset with.
---
I checked a few of the links and they all said the same, even the Wikipedia page. 
---
Where are your sources? 
---
Free market implies that people complains about bad products. And that's was is done here.
---
Tons of weapon skins, clean walls, clean stairs, clean roofs, please.
---
Very optimistic of you. My ticket said, "4 to 6 months" so my pessimist brain says, october 2019. (I know how to count).
---
Todd's reputation being spotless and all right now 
---
I'll send you the videos I've captured in a message on here 
---
Where did they say cosmetics only?
---
The guy above linked a spreadsheet of what you can learn off of scrapping. It says that you can learn the dual bar and bow bar from scrapping but not the long bow bar. Are you positive you didn't learn it off of a plan?
---
Or it is your fault for reading between the lines on my post dumbass... I didn't say patch 8, I said player vending.  I'm so bored of people I come across on here that half ass read information that pertain to a title. Do you do the same thing in your non reddit daily life too? 
---
I can't count how many times I'd seen replies to "fridge plz" posts with "I'd pay real money for that" or "take my money now".
---
Now that is could be a reality, everyone is losing their minds.
---
Name something that bethesda's done for this game that's "more than bare minimum" since launch. Sadly, everything that's moved past that line has been in the wrong direction, that I can think of off the top of my head. They've been making great strides to pull this game towards "acceptable" for people who aren't hardcore fallout fans. 
---
I've seen a few channels cover the roadmap, and that more content is coming. But at the moment, the content we've gotten isn't really _exciting_, or in other language, "news worthy". brewing alcohol is small potatoes, it's a few aid items, which are nice.  But it's not much of anything.
---
Survival mode is a beta, that's...honestly? to little to late for it's target audience. If it had LAUNCHED with a PVP/PVE dynamic, this game would have done a _lot_ better. But I have seen a little positive coverage go that direction. 
---
Now, instead of the (much anticipated) player vending? We're getting another godamn controversy, with bethesda pushing forward with a product the VP of the company stated would never exist. 
---
It's not a good look.  And yeah, channels that devote a couple minutes a month (at most) to games that hit rock bottom as hard as this one did at lunch don't have a hell of a lot of incentive to give it a second look, at the moment. 
---
I’m not “changing my side” I agree with everything I have said in the post and comments. Heck off
---
Good point man! Go rebuild a town or something. Tell me once you're done.
---
And did he really *have* tl go spawn at a train station? He couldn't just look for a new server?
---
This is pretty much why my characters diet consists of 90% canned dog food, 10% dandyboy apples (or something like that)
---
Check out filthy casuals. We're a bit less crazy and quick to get riled up.
---
I think it only works if you use the metal stairs to create your second floor so technically that is supporting the 2nd floor. Then you can use half walls and the short beam to make it appear supported by the beam. 
---
Post it online to imgur so everyone can see it, it’s easy I don’t even think you need to make an account. Again I’m more than happy to walk you through it in game, show you how this can be done with perk cards/gear/aid items. Maybe do a better job of describing what happened if you don’t want to share video proof in order not to get called out for lack of knowledge I’m js.
---
Incorrect. The free market is not dictated by complaints but by sales of Service or product. If a product or service is bad then it will fail in the free market nut if it is good then it will succeed. If the majority hate it then they will lose money on it and if not then they will make money. 
---
Patch 8 has been scheduled for next week for how long now? You no no new content was coming until the end of the month. But yet IM the dumbass? Okay buddy. 🤣
---
That is a fact. 
---
That's kinda what they're doing right. They're taking out the old expensive stuff (since it wouldn't be fair to the people who bought them at full price) and slowly replacing them with new, less expensive, more cooler looking stuff. 
---
That's a horrid mindset. That's paying for an advantage. 
---
You shouldn't have an advantage in a full priced game because you have more money in real life; we play games to escape that bullshit, not be a part of it
---
Do you not understand how the slippery slope is completely valid and not a fallacy at all?
---
In seriousness, though, the slippery slope, while a fallacy in most contexts, does seem to apply pretty well when it comes to games. That said, I'm not going to get excised by any of this stuff until it's actually, and genuinely, pay to win. I just can't be bothered. 
---
Yup no, not me a spawned for the 800th time soloing it, shot then froze and got sad af
---
The no health left thing sounds like a lag between server and client side. Literally nothing you’ve described sounds like cheating so go ahead and post the video online or else you just sound like someone who doesn’t understand the mechanics of PvP tbh.
---
Yes I did. I could have looked for another station to respawning after death but I said no thanks
---
Just to be Devil's Advocate here, the community is pretty split over it. The ones who don't like it are obviously loud, but there are plenty of people like me that couldn't care less about worthless junk we don't feel forced to buy since they only slightly useful 
---
So you tell me if a product don't do good sales , it's the consumers fault ? Are you mad ?
---
Isn't there a saying "Don't put off until tomorrow what can be done today" ?
---
Although .biggest issue imo is all the various camp shit. 
---
Well I've just sent you a message on here, if you have one drive you should be able to view them, and maybe you can tell me if it's possible to survive consistent shots with no health 
---
You’re downvoted for not panicking... nice... lol
---
Umm it takes like 5 minutes in whitespring for me to repair any gun.  People that buy these would be total idiots.
---
How is it an advantage? Instead of just repeating dogmatism, stop for a moment and think for yourself, HOW is this something that is going to give you an unfair advantage? 
---
Yeah but you can still earn atoms pretty easily so it's not p2w, more pay to advance quicker
---
time to cash in on that good will they've earned :\^)
---
Oxhorn just expressed disappointment over this. *Oxhorn* he's usually the most positive of Youtubers.
---
Mutations you can farm in a few minutes at a pool of radiation? Stimpacks and radaway thrown at you constantly? I wouldn’t care...
---
Well if I deleted it I'd look like a coward
---
I _am_ a coward, but a coward with honour
---
Yeah that's not a bad plan, or.... They could just put them in game and put better cosmetics on the atom store. It's day 3206 of me waiting for my enclave power armor skin
---
No because it happened more than once and just with him. Fortunately for my case there were two others with him, one who was higher level and I killed him, but could never kill this one 
---
The bigger issue is that Bethesda made the promise that this type of content would never be available.  I agree that in the grand scheme, this is minor and the in-game versions are better, but to have them walk back on a promise they made to their player base is unacceptable.  I've been a vocal supporter since day one, and this is where the line is crossed for me. 
---
If people can't complains, how will another customer knows if a product is good or bad ?
---
They're supposedly already expanding the amount of photos you can take with the all-new Camera that's coming in a week or so.
---
I’m in the same boat at this point. I’m all for new content/items. But unless the new Burrow requires you to use it to complete. No thanks. I’ll grind my mats and repair to full. 
---
Gratz! I hope you enjoyed it! I personally think the Silos are really well made and can't wait for the Vaults to open up for more content like this
---
This logic doesn't apply as the product isn't even released and people are complaining.
---
And at the time there was way less "eh we can fix/add it post release."
---
You're assuming the status quo remains the same. Remember when White Knife was nerfed? Remember when food decay rates were changed? If they aren't selling enough repair kits do you think they'll make more "balance tweaks"?
---
no worries, easy to miss something like that. 
---
My biggest problem is going to an area with nobody else nearby but the ads are still like 50+ levels lower than me. I get that happening in lower level areas but the level of enemies should be based off the first person in that area
---
I was not aware, or I was but only partially. I knew you can't trade items with skins on them
---
I feel ya. 
---
Or instead of taking the hint realize its the same crybabies making multiple posts for upping their karma. Micro transactions aren't bad, something you might not know but adults like me work and don't have unlimited free time and Bethesda can't make DLCs with 50 cents.
---
Ok I'll try that
---
The thing is they are not An must have game changing item... you can just repair the old way and not buy them ,.. what they are is a great utility for repairing an item and still being able to stay in the encounter you broke it in ,.. maybe the new Raids are ridden with rads like a nuke zone and getting out of Power Armor at a bench is not an option ,.. if people want to spend to be prepared ,. So what?? All it means is you will be surrounded by others that are not leaving mid raid or SBQ and effectively wasting other peoples time 
---
Podcast is not the same. The live aspect and the fact that is something limited to a especific server makes it a whole different experience. Nothing against a good podcast, though.   
---
I think one of the best things we can have in FO76 is the fact that people is not a legendary caracther in the line of the other protagonists of the saga. Here if you want to have a freaking bar in the middle of Appalachia, you can, if you want to be a raider, you can... so why not a radio host?
---
What level are you?
---
I still don’t understand the vault raids, what’s gonna be in there if it’s an unopened vault? People? Not people? ???
---
Love Skyrim!!!! 
---
Well Bethesda is a net value of 2.5 billion, which unfortunately means there’s investors that need to get paid and ceos and so forth making a whole pile of people needing to get paid, now granted I don’t put in the time to really know the specific answers but In general most scenarios play out this way when a deadline is made and minimal staff is used to keep costs down on paid man hours so that the overhead costs can be covered, which would be easily covered by a subscription the state of financial gain these days is about how to make the most with the least spent
---
I have literally left my recent job of handling the companies govt and military contracts worth 2 mil a year because I made 56 k which seems to be a general consensus of how businesses run these days
---
It just works!
---
Arrrrrghhhhhhhhh!!!
---
Yeah, it's strange the way that it shows up on screen. That's what you need if you build the things from plans (if plans are available) not mods. I do a lot of installations, both from plans and mods. Can't remember if you need a perk card with mods, but I don't think so. 
---
Yeah it was a honey beast during a nuke. was a glowing one but idk if it matters.
---
it sounds like the regular kit will be an atom shop item im assuming you might get a bundle of say 5 - 10 for certain atoms price.
---
Then the advanced kit they said will be in the world pool and possibly it will be a plan,
---
I know a couple of people posted on reddit ages back that they wanted repair kits returned from new vegas but that wasnt a huge community of us asking for it and especially not pay to win.
---
if they implement them make them all droppable loot in world pools or make a small quest like BIV quests to get a few and the plans to make more.
---
If BGS goes down P2W route we will all be walking our asses out of Appalachia.
---
Yeah that looks like server lag to me, happens a lot. You can see how the player is standing perfectly still so their Assasins sentinel gear negates most incoming damage, but a lot of the times the server lag doesn’t show this. So on your end it’s showing you doin all this damage but then when the server catches up and calculates it you’ve actually done little to no damage. I know it’s stupid but that’s how it goes sometimes. What kind of gun are you using?
---
Take your non canvas bag and ponder longer.
---
Yeah that is really annoying, now that I think of it I never go to over half the map because the enemies are way to weak
---
Your life length carries with you from one server to another, as does any bounty you might be carrying. 
---
If you want to stay alive at low levels in survival just stash all your aid and junk at camp every half out or so and take yourself out. 
---
Shoo. Go find your missing chromosome.
---
I am not sure I understand the issue. Can someone explain to me what the issue is with the through wall conduit thats already in the game?
---
Right because there's nothing in between badgering and doing nothing. Hyperbole isn't condusive to an actual discussion.
---
You spawn in to the game wherever you left off in your last session. So not having a camp means nothing
---
The only time I've ever wanted something like that was fighting the SBQ and all my good weapons or weapons with ammo broke, beyond that I've never had a need for it. 
---
Pay for convenience is the best way to put it
---
you don't care that you've been lied to by Bethesda? wow
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmm okay.... I may just be soaring through the skies yet!
---
I live too much of a busy life to do research for a game that does a poor job of consistently maintaining patch notes and updated changes as a pinned post on their reddit. The last pinned post was Wild Appalachia Patch Notes - March 26th. Nothing was pinned posted since then. The entire "hot" section of the Fallout reddit is bitching and moaning about some so called repair kit shit. 
---
## 
---
probably him, he posts tons of videos like that. In survival you shouldn't need a nuke to make an area challenging, like sure it would suck for lower level players but the enemies in an area should be consistent with the person who entered the area first.
---
I got Heat Flashes 2/2 times from glowing honey beasts, once in the Mire and another in the Savage Divide.  I guess they can give both then?

#SPRINGS

That’s irrelevant. You’re either reasonably skilled to where even fresh out the vault you’ll be ok or you could pay 10 atoms you got for free for a couple stimpacks or such to help you along. All that matters is pricing and if the prices are bad peoppe just won’t buy them anyway so again it’s not a real issue.
---
maybe they should make cosmetics that aren't shit if they want my money.
---
People don't realize that Bethesda's been testing the waters for years. The lunchbox lootboxes in Fallout Shelter? Those were Bethesda's first foray into micro-transactions. They've been testing the waters to see what  Fallout fans will do for years. The repair kits in the ESO crown store? They know how well they sell (despite being ultra common items you can find in game on your own). They have years of data as far as what sells and doesn't based on ESO alone. Heck, Bethesda even sold Fallout fans the real ending to Fallout 3 via the Broken Steel DLC, then later introduced Creation Club.
---
This is nothing new, sadly. Bethesda has been doing this for years. Hopefully, at least, Bethesda follows ZOS' path and keeps the majority items pure cosmetic with keep the utility items to a minimum.
---
I'm not defending 76 or Trump but this has literally nothing to do with politics, fucktard. What does me questioning why you bring politics into a discussion about greedy game developers automatically mean I support the game?
---
Y’all some nicotine fiends
---
I just don't get this at all. Several people ask for Weapon Repair Kits ala New Vegas, a portable repair kit you can build from scrap and carry with you so you don't need to head back to base to repair. They could have made the equivalent of stimpacks for weapons AND armor, but instead they make a magical instant repair kit that you either have to grind boss characters for, or buy. This is disappointing and very indicative as to how much BGS pays attention to requests.
---
Meh, not really. As long as the stuff doesn't actually make players stronger so it's a true Pay to Win I am ok. 
---
&gt;This is blown way out of control. You guys are loosing your minds over nothing. 
---
Has that not been "Fallout 76 in a nutshell" from day 1?
---
This is just overly dramatic people on reddit
---
Read the road map. 🙄 takes two seconds. 
---
Shocker.
---
Hoard loose springs &amp; gears (meaning items that yield them from scrapping - like clipboards, toasters, alarm clocks etc.). They are to Fallout 76 what adhesive was to Fallout 4. I’m also constantly running low on steel from constant weapon and Power Armor repairs. 
---
Have fun :)
---
I am assuming lots of robots and Ghouls and stuff like everywhere else
---
Filthy casuals?
---
You can be a squeaky wheel without being rude and annoying.  Remember your behavior the next time you're at work and someone unloads on you for something you can't control. They can see all these posts, they're aware of the prpblem, there's no reason to be as awful as possible.
---
When even one of Bethesda's biggest shills is unhappy with one of their decisions, you *know* they done fucked up.
---
When I wrote this thread, there was one other one covering the same topic on the main page. Lots of people responded to the article around the same time... surprising, right?
---
People having a problem with Bethesda breaking a clear promise (cosmetics only) is not karma farming. Stop being a conspiracy theorist.
---
And yea, I work contracts as a teacher because it's hard to get work here and it's a recent career change. So money is tight with my student loans, even though that's not the reason I'm giving feedback on this issue.
---
But keep minimizing other people's struggles, it definitely makes you seem like an 'adult'. 
---
 
---
Pretty much. I've been playing since the beta and have loved it the whole time and I'm sure I will continue to love it. People just need to chill and see what happens next. 
---
I watched t and gave an explanation in my other comment. Sorry that happened to you but it really does seem like a server lag issue to me. Good on you for reporting it tho and if they were cheating I’m sure it’ll be pretty easier for Bethesda to see.
---
How could you 
---
They also made reapairs cheaper at the same time. White Knight was only changed so that its effect would match that of similar cards. 
---
Also, why would would anyone use a repair kit that restores things to 100% when the looted improved kits can repair to 150% and workbenches to 200%, both giving a buff bonus to weapons/armor when doing so. Nobody uses a worse option when there is better options. The kits are for absolute emergencies only.
---
I'm fairly sure your plague walker is aggroing them. It affects my brahim at home, which is also a friendly, even without a disease. 
---
This is just a better way to make money, tbh.
---
I bet the Assassin/Sentinel guys are really looking forward to all the free caps, assuming that they didn't already max out by spawn camping.
---
Ok so robots I get but why would they be full of ghouls?
---
Vault tec- HEY LETS MAKE EVERY OTHER VAULT NEAR 76 GHOUL INFESTED
---
jk
---
You watched both of them and seriously conclude that it's server lag? Really? Sorry I'm not buying it, I'll send you more showing that I had no problem killing the others with him
---
I was using a semi auto handmade with max expert and master rifleman, 2 star rifleman, tank killer. I was easily damaging him, no perks in this game prevent death like that, and if that is somehow true, then this game is beyond broken. But I know it's not, because I killed another one, who was higher level, and his health didn't do the same at all
---
It's not even about "pay to win" for me, it's that it's already a big problem in the game that weapons break too fast. This makes me think that will never be fixed and now it's just a way to milk Atoms from people hoping they'll drop some money for the convenience of having working weapons in the field.
---
How about my weapons last a reasonable amount of time and I can fix them in my CAMP?
---
Umm UMMMMM not all of us are capless raiders. Some of us are capless enclave. Thanks.
---
I haven’t seen anyone be rude and annoying to the community managers, if someone is you should tell them to shut up. But we need to voice it, the higher ups need to see the outcry and see just how badly nobody wants this.
---
Are you... what? 
---
You are asking how *paying money for an item that will instantly repair any piece of equipment, at any time*, gives the paying player(s) an advantage, right? 
---
I still aint playing survival, noooo spank you lol
---
You are though, your initial premise was that Todd broke a promise of the atomic shop being cosmetic only. When evidence provided showed that was incorrect you stated that you didnt care, and in the same breath attempted to switch you arguement to the slippery slope discussion. I dont care one way or another but you most definitely shifted your argument. I absolutely know I'm being a nit picky prick. I'll gladly heck off now. Thank you.
---
But Pizza hut crust flavors are free...
---
Thanks. Seeing all of the atom shop posts flooding the main page is crazy, apparently everyone knew about the cosmetics promise but me lol. I thought this thread would be informative! :-p
---
I do kinda understand your perspective,  but my line would be true Pay to Win items, like Stronger Guns, Free Legendary rerolls or Guaranteed legendary sets or something like that. I don't get too offended by stuff that doesn't directly affect me. I will ignore the kits like lots of other items in the Atomic Shop and save my Atoms for getting new PA skins and (Hopefully!) a Handmade skin one day
---
Showing you as offline
---
It sounds like it will be like ESO's model on repair kits. You will get them in game but you can also buy them in bulk if you so wish instead of farming or waiting for a drop. They tend to clutter up the inventory in the end. More stuff to juggle in the inventory! 
---
The only issue I would have is if they alter the current cost of repair in the game itself to make the Atom repair kit more attractive. Other than that if it's like ESO's model I'm fine with it (which is an unpopular opnion). 
---
Well it's speculation not an explanation, you haven't explained to me what perks and armor could possibly regenerate health like that, when as you could clearly see he had no health left 
---
Bethesda promises to put only cosmetic in the store. Then they prove they are lying. People complains. This is an important information for customers to know. I would not buy to a company which lie to me.
---
Lmao this was a fun read 
---
That’s completely relevant because if you were a high level you would know going and jumping in a rad pool is terrible way to get mutations since you’ll get a bunch of unwanted ones before you get one good one
---
Why are you on a dedicated sub then?
---
Agreed
---
I really don't get why this isn't in the game.  It's an option in Skyrim SE and I think Fallout 4.  It's called "Rain Oclusion", and it's a bit taxing on the CPU.
---
I wonder if they'd have to have that tied to the server and that's why it's disabled. (This really doesn't make sense to me though, physics are client side generally so why wouldn't they be able to implement this client side too?  Not a developer, so I'm just spewing nonsense.) 
---
They're probably too busy getting their eyes checked from all the rolling they've suffered from just reading these incredibly whiny posts.
---
Not about me choosing my battles...its about being killed by some broke mofo who can bleed me dry with nothing to lose...yet I get nothing in return from killing them but smoke and Mirrors of a potential leaderboard spot. I have 400+ hours in this game, and been in survival mode long enough to tell you how it works at the current moment....which is group up, spawn trap and camp killing all who spawn in...rinse and repeat, welcome to 90% of pvp server modes functions. I dont play that way, but most do, and thats the reality of this mode right now for most and whats going on.
---
Please tell me why Destiny 2 was trash when it had micro transactions? Or give me a good example of a live service game without a proper revenue stream not counting Fortnite. You can't because games need a steady income for steady updates. You too can afford the micro transactions if you get a proper job.
---
Hmm...maybe the Vault Tec experiment would be allowing Rads to enter the Vault so the residents become Ghouls...but I think that has already been done
---
its survival. It's all about pvp. Don't like it dont go into survival mode. 
---
Plan your build at:

Follow the main quest at first to level up some and learn some early valuable crafting plans.
---
Fuck no Player vending next week, fuck i think im gonna play borderlands remaster for a bit give me a break from FO76 my fav game but man BGS is going backwards.
---
Yeah, that one vault who’s door didn’t shut all the way, causing rads to leak in and turn everyone to ghouls
---
Whitespring was my last stop
---
If you wouldn't buy from a company which lies to you then you must not buy products of any kind from anywhere at all, period. Get real, all companies tell lies and we dont know how they are going to implement it yet. Also, they said that these will be obtainable in game without buying them at all. Its just buying convenience.
---
They nerfed white knight, so armor \_already\_ breaks faster. They added aid items that increase the speed in which weapons get damaged.  Don't "prepare" yourself, they've already started. 
---
I don’t think it displays the damage bonus in the menu
---
&gt;Would that be because I was just trying to attach it to the top of the post with no stairs and therefore no way to access it?
---
Yes, they're cosmetic and don't provide any actual structural support. [Here's a shot of my monorail base.](https://i.imgur.com/ZVCTiml.png) I built the platforms first and then added the posts so it didn't look completely absurd. Even after they were in place I couldn't remove the stairs, but the nice thing is you can stack them if one isn't long enough to reach the ground.
---
Nah it’s nbd. Been goin on for a while now. Content is still not out yet as I’m sure you are aware but this specific thing has been poppin up for people.
---
At work and must do overtime, Wish I was playing now, at least I can check the forums on my phone 📱 
---
Lmao, that old road map that is inconsistent with it's information and timing of said updates. I will just stop you right there.
---
I believe it was during an event in the north part of the savage divide. I’m sorry,  I don’t remember the exact one at the moment. 
---
Maybe something similar to that, but more controlled where they can test different lvls of Radiation
---
Simply holster your weapon and the phsycodelic effects will cease
---
...yeah, expecting Bethesda to keep their word makes us all look like stupid fucking children, I get that. 
---
Perhaps you missed your own point
---
To be honest, the fact that people are screaming over a single item being in a cosmetic shop is actually kinda ridiculous to me. They're acting like this would ruin the franchise forever. There are MUCH worse things that Bethesda would've done, like giving preferential treatment to higher level players or threaten an indie developer team to stop making games or suffer a lawsuit, or something on the line of being a real dickhead. Plus, it's literally Bethesda Game Studio's first MMO, can't expect them to get everything perfectly on the first try.
---
I can only upvote you once to help make up for the karma-deficit your simple &amp; honest opinion has unfortunately garnered you.
---
Exactly, you have no counter to any of my arguments against a wastleland utopia so you resort to calling me a griefer.
---
We want repair kits, just not in the atomic shop. 
---
"split". 99% of comments and posts I've read today are against this, a few people don't think it's a big deal. 
---
That's not "split". A fucking microscopic minority don't care. 
---
This was wild and bizarre. I like how you think outside the crust.
---
My fav is standing there, sponging up enemy attacks until you tag the mob, then one-hitting them all so you can loot too :)
---
Totally agree. 
---
My body gaurd services are always available for a negotiable price. The finest Enclave training and equipment at my disposal

Did I miss something?
---
Sorry didn't see your message till now. If you're still around I can hop on real quick, or I'll be on tommorow night
---
Ok good,  thought I was going nuts. Had the whole team fast travelling to fight sheepsquatchs with me but then I had to be like "no... wait it's Liberators, sorry "
---
.,..the new shit isn't less expensive than the old shit. 
---
I'm kinda with you...I actually have a stockpile of atoms because new shit comes along so rarely that it builds up between things i'm even \_remotely\_ interested in. 
---
There is also no need to have it on the atom shop.

It’s not fair someone is a higher level and killed me in a part of the game created for pvp .... go play connect four?

Thanks now I can’t get the song outta my head! #earworm
---
Maybe has been my favorite since fo3
---
Wow. You really are dense. 
---
This song describes my fo76 experience lolol
---
it's disappointing because those areas are still interesting, just not many reasons to go there
---
I get what you mean about being whatever you want. I can be found on the street playing guitar by a sign that says please tip.
---
But if the resources in this game are objectively infinite (which they are), why does being "spec'd that way" have some separate meaning to you... as if the the difference between 2 and 4 ballistic fiber isn't simply a matter of convenience?
---
You are all cunts
---
I’m so done with you, you make no sense and have no actual argument. Pm me when you have common sense
---
Nope it was heat flashes! Thank you for reminding me and correcting me. Jelly fingers is the one I am also missing.
---
Oooh or FEV experiments like west tek was doing, and they have wendigos super mutants etc.
---
But you care enough to lurk around the sub , tell people who don’t care that you don’t play anymore, and complain about shit that has nothing to do with the topic ....
---
Is this still a waste of $80? Haven't played it since December since building was shit couldn't build anything since there was too many rocks and bushes etc, kept running into higher lvl creatures during quest so I couldn't complete them, spent more time looking for scraps to repair camp and weapons
---
When the game came out ( i am a hardcore fallout fan) i no lifed the hell out of it. I got lvl 120 in a week. And luanched bunches of nukes

At least give them 24 hours

had a few initiate paint when i received the knight paint
---
rng just not on your side (for now) :)

I like how my post got down voted when I point out exactly what happened. Didn't even say anything in support or against the guy, but because I didn't flat out insult the op it's all the same!
---
Yeah it got me excited when I saw my first one. I believe it popped up at Hemlock Holes when I fast traveled to it only to find there were no Sheepsquatch waves or anything of the sort. I am really looking forward to the Cryptid patch content that’s coming soon.
---
I've also gotten doubles of that paint plan. Just ended up selling it.
---
Before the recent respawn protection fix people had camps with max level turrets by white spring train station and I overheard area chat the guys doing it made 8.5k because they was "nice guys"
---
If this does launch and purchases start occuring at what they would consider successful, I give it a year before Fallout is the new GTAV
---
This is the dipped toe into items that kinda sorta affect gameplay loops but not as much as something you can get in the game by doing high level endgame content after dozens and dozens of hours of play. Refrigerators, backpacks, storage, perk packs, weapons, armor, events, XP boosts are all potential time saving convenience items which while not quite pay-2-win certainly gives the advantage to those who can afford to pay more.
---
Ballistic fibre isn't all that common ingame anyway, and if this goes down well for Bethesda, whose to say they don't sneak in some nerfs to Crafting, making it take more resources?
---
In the many hours i have already spent in survival solo and in groups i have experienced and committed spawn killing but that gets really boring really quick. the intended survival game that Bethesda set out to create, exists. there are a few things to work out but its still. a. BETA. why would you even go into survival without storing your caps on a mule? getting wrecked by broke people only means the caps you lost to them can be gained back if you can kill them back quick enough. i would say that 90% of the people i have encountered are just trying to make use of the 20% xp boost as well as finding more legendary enemies. the 10% of the ass-hats spawn camping or stacking their foundations in the cave to the north are the real problem. but not a major part of the game. avoid high activity areas, i.e train stations. be cautious Fast-traveling to events as not everyone in event areas are on the same "team" like everyone else. i don't understand why you cant play the game the same way. lower your own risk and take what you are willing to loose. i always start out survival with 0 caps 10 water and a few pieces of food. within a few kills you have meds, their cooked food, stimpacks, and hopefully some caps at the end of the night. 
---
Can confirm, it works. Bravo code is legit.
---
I think they should just A) Remove all items from suspected accounts and B) Implement an actual discipline system from that point like every other major online game.
---
Can Do perk and anywhere with lots of trash cans. Like the Whitespring. 
---
Flux is also nerfed to 2 caps from like 11 or so. Totally sucks.
---
I'm not telling people to give them death threats FFS. But constantly tagging them with a "Hey, this is some bullshit, what you do?" isn't wrong. To use your own analogy, it's like if someone was telling me at work "I'm displeased with this service and really wish you to mention this to your manager" but instead of listening and responding I just ignored them. 
---
I don’t think they’ll put fridges/converters behind a paywall. More than likely, you’ll be able to grind out the plans in game, and the atomic shop will just allow you to shortcut that grind. And I whole-heartedly agree that repair kits won’t break the game. 
---
Be sure I'll tip if I find you XD
---
Snap foundations on them. They’re primarily used for uneven terrain.
---
I sent you a friend request! Thanks man.
---
Of course aside from the plunder found in the clutches of those high level players who bum around there
---
Yes, in the past, when that $60 you dropped on a new game had a buying power of more like $80 in 2019. Literally everything else has had a price increase over the years to account for inflation, but videogames haven't budged for nearly a decade and a half.
---
What do you expect other than cutting up the product to fit into a "$60 starter-kit" and feeding you the other bits over time to make that price more palatable, or other means to make more money off of the game like microtransactions when faced with the prospect of loosing 20-25% of their income, let alone what that'd be in their net profit after they have to pay their employees, publishers, parent companies, bills, and everything else that goes into making these games.
---
You get what you pay for. 
---
If you can’t follow along that isn’t my problem
---
We already paid money for fallout.  War frame is free. I feel so burned by Bethesda. They have been going down a money grabbing shit hole since Skyrim.
---
True, but will the 150% drop from global loot pool or be restricted to say the scorchbeast queen. And with the upcoming raid/dungeons will they be required items?
---
Would be more excited if these were craftable items, even with rare recipes that would promote player economy. 
---
Agreed ‘Sixteen Tons’ is catchy as hell, and ‘I Don’t Want to set the World on Fire’ is a Fallout staple at this point 
---
Blood-Stained Combat Armor Paint: 300 Atoms &lt;---- This is new 
---
Camo Combat Armor Paint: 800 atoms &lt;---- This is old
---
Hot Rod Flames/Playtime Paint/Mothman/Blackbird PA Paint: 1400 Atoms &lt;---- This is new
---
Vault-Tec/Patriot PA Paints: 1800 Atoms &lt;---- This is old
---
And if you want to take the PA Paints further:
---
Woodland Warrior PA Paint Set: 1000 Atoms &lt;---- New Item that was limited time
---
Garrahan Excavator Paint: 800 Atoms &lt;---- This is also new
---
Proclaiming that the new stuff being introduced isn't cheaper than the older stuff is ignorant at best
---
Yeah, which makes the presence of a cash store even worse.
---
It’s more about broken promises and that this could lead to greater things in terms of pay for ease.
---
 Not to mention, they’ve adopted the Apple mentality of breaking something a while back (Increasing repair costs and nerfing white knight) and selling a solution.
---
Perhaps enough people were reporting you that they changed their stance on your name.
---
Silly name, but who am I to judge. Play silly games, win silly prizes.
---
Seeing as you persistently misconstrue things, it's very likely that you would likely fit the definition of dense to a T... 
---
I checked Phoenix, no go. I think MODUS only sells gatling laser, gatling plasma and plasma gun.
---
Two things.
---
1) you're not paying money unless you want, you're paying in atoms an imaginary currency which you are given in plentiful easy supply without any monetary exchange required. 
---
2) it's not any sort of boosts, the boosted version is available only as a drop not as purchasable. The version you can buy is essentially just heavier materials in a box. At any point no matter where I am, I can free fast travel to my CAMP, use my materials in my stash, repair anything at any time or drop my CAMP at almost any other location I'm in for a handful of caps and drop my workshop there without needing to fast travel. This saves me about a minute, maybe a minute and a half if servers are being laggy that day... And that's only needed if I happen to be in one of the rather rare areas that a workbench isn't already sitting next to me within a 15-30 second walk.  
---
The "benefit" you are buying is fractionally above negligible. 
---
I’m gonna say it: 
---
Survival was more scary when you could spawn camp.
---
Well, he obviously spent time leveling up to reach that point at which he could diversify his perks. And that's time spent which he probably also earned hundreds of atoms for free-- and I say "for free" because you seem to think that time spent in-game isn't already a diversion from his/her real-world earning potential. This may seem a different perspective, but we mostly play games as diversions, and in that diversion we accept the likelihood we are not being productive in a general sense, except the fact that are playing (ideally) for our pleasure.
---
So, yeah. We actually are already paying extra for perks. 
---
It took me about 3 months to get 3000 atoms, and that was from early easy points. This is only going to lead into Bethesda selling Triple Shot Explosive Quad Fatman.
---
Tip get a good level powerfist with furious on it then you hammer them with a good unarmed build MAKE THEM CRY AND CALL YOU A BULLY AND THEN SHOW THEM WHAT A BULLY IS BY TRACKING DOWN THEM TO THEIR CAMP AND FAT MAN IT INTO THE GROUND
---
Well as far as the mule things its just a ridiculous chore, so I need to buy a 2nd xbox, tv and game or bug a friend everyday to hide gear/caps to join the sea of broke fish and gain nothing with everyone else but pennies in pvp servers? Think about how much BS is involved there to join the typical crowd/playstyle, gotta admit, its a lot of BS that nobody should have to do.
---
What platform are you on, cause no BS just about every server I am on is nothing but people camping in pairs/groups spawn killing everyone. I hardly see anyone roaming around getting xp at any of the popular spots, that would otherwise be packed with people. Golf course/whitesprings for example. Xbox here btw.
---
There’s never been a worst ink spot song in a fallout game. 
---
It’s 4000 caps better.
---
Source: Have Both.
---
Ok, your definition of "new" and my definition of "new" are drastically different. Blackbird was in...January.
---
If your deadline of "old" is within "the first month of release" and "new" as "anything after the first month of release" then sure. 
---
lol, ok then
---
There is a newly discovered vault in that location and the good ol' space station we can't access. I would guess they have a few plans up there sleeve for Toxic Valley.
---
This is my first online game ever and I've been playing video games since the 80s. And I've avoided online games entirely prior to this because I don't want to fight other actual human beings, but I really like Fallout so thought I'd give it a try. 
---
I think there are a lot of people like me.
---
When did Pizza Hut promises that they won't monetize crust flavors ?
---
But are you pretty sure it was a honey beast and that it gave you jelly fingers, not heat flashes?
---
I think no matter how much people complain this and those loot boxes will make their rounds into the Atom Shop. This at best will... delay it. Once the game rolls out on steam and most of the dlc is out they are going to be more careless about how they implement things like this into the game because they already acknowledged they have been lazy in regards to content, fighting exploits, disciplinary actions (still no real system for this), etc..  
---
Even with the new shift to PVP it makes it all the more profitable
---
Personally I have never had problems repairing my weapons unless I wanted to do everyone in en masse. If this was a few years ago, I would have never believed anybody would actively bought stuff like that with real money. Unfortunately when I played MGS5, I found people paying $50 or more dollars just to speed up development of specific weapons in the online mode.. Not unlock.. speed up. As in a weapon that would take 3 days to obtain cut down to a few hours. That is how frivolous people like to spend money in these games and will continue to do so.
---
Cosmetic****

Looks like the dungeon will be the week after next from what im reading. Granted i could be wrong up until today i thought vending was coming next week. Im hoping when it does release there are no bugs since they are delaying it.

Exactly. This started with the Unstoppables costumes. I let it slide as many did. Then THIS happens. If more people like me flipped out when the Unstoppables costumes were sold then maybe this escalation in pay to win territory might not have been considered by BSG. Now I fear this will keep going and you'll have 'no big deal' guys keep encouraging BSG to put more obvious pay to win garbage in game.

It sucks because you put a fusion mag on it. Silly human.

How many people are viably using brews for their buffs ?

Copy and paste much?

Tagging the managers on every post is a real good way to get this post ignored.

Honestly, the new name is better
---
You know why? Because people support him. People support fake and controversial...not talented and genuine 
---
Nice. I moved at one point because I wanted on top of Senenca Rocks, but have moved again to be on the cliffface behind the monorail elevator. 
---
Awesome! Congrats!
---
Yes but people might have the option to add free things I a way which makes the pizza more enjoyable for them as opposed to how I ordered my own pizza. What if they have a better overall pizza eating experience?
---
$60 today is the equivalent of $45 when the $60 pricetag was originally set. So you're paying 75% of full price back when MTX weren't a thing.
---
Same here. I also drop stuff (purified waters, plans, recipes, aid chems and sometimes modded and buffed lower level armor and weapons) in the Overseer's stash in the Flatwoods church.
---
Both versions should be craftable lootable and tradeable. IMO 
---
If you have to keep buying things to “play” then it’s pay to play. There is no winning in this “game” just leveling up and looting and hoarding. Just my opinion.
---
I dunno man that new name is pretty good...
---
No - the complaints were about weapons breaking in two hits/shots. Repair kits aren't going to help with that.
---
This is known as the Slippery Slope logical fallacy: if we allow this one thing, it will surely lead to others. You have no way of knowing what this will lead to. 
---
I was wondering about that. That say you can't sell or drop them
---
There are two types of players out there. The ones who avoid the spotlight, and the ones who strive for it
---
Going back to camp is a big part of fallout. When did anyone ever ask for this? I’ve never seen a single post requesting this feature. 
---
At this point I feel like that would be an obvious choice. Duper or not just wipe their inventory and toss them back in. 
---
However, since they haven't done that I can only guess what may be their reason for holding back. I'm going to guess two things. 
---
1. They will take further action punishing dupers after they actually fix duping itself.
---
Or
---
2. They're hesitant to wipe accounts due to non-dupers being caught up. 
---
I think this may hold water since they let everyone keep one rare item back in February instead of doing a complete wipe. 
---
I realized that I didn't really include some positives. Going to edit and add to main post. Thanks Moth2233
---
No, if you *can* get them through *paying* it's pay to win. There is a hard line in the sand. Doesn't matter how easy it is to earn by playing when someone can get them more easily by opening their wallet.

 [https://www.theneurotypical.com/how-to-spot-aspergers.html](https://www.theneurotypical.com/how-to-spot-aspergers.html)  You might want to get that diagnosis. You to a T ;) ;) 
---
...but under what situation did you get permission to use it in the first place? I wanna know the story. 
---
Only got like 9 alien rounds but I got it. 
---
Jesus this is unbalanced but gg
---
Thank you, apparently i wasnt using the right words trying to explain this being an issue
---
It is server lag. I have the same problem when crafting as well. Happens occasionally.
---
They literally give you the tools to repair your equipment to 200% just laying around the world 
---
You wrote Bethesda
---
In *2018*
---
To check if the name ANUS HAMMER was cool with them
---
And you didn't at any point stop, look in a mirror and go,
---
"But why?"
---
The Todd bit is a joke but this would not help him one bit despite who said what
---
It could be a big advantage in PVP. I don't think people are upset about the actual item but more the idea of "what next". How long until you can buy legendary guns in the atom store or sentinel armor. I personally don't like that direction at all.
---
It’s the same thing as every other “loot box” system where you can get it by grinding versus paying.
---
The point is they said they you may be able to grind them, but you will definitely be able to get them in atom shop. Also even if can grind them, there’s a lot that we don’t know. Like how many we can grind etc etc 
---
Stash is full of three stars, since it’s like a token system? Ergo scrap a legendary for tokens used to re roll. I got too many useless 3 stars that I can’t wait for him to come out due to me wanting my stash space back 😅
---
How do the repair kits offer a competitive advantage. This is the one question absolutely no one can answer me which also debunks the pay to win bullcrap I keep hearing. 
---
did you read the post? I'm talking about folks being mad a Bethesda for light weight doing something that players have been doing all along. I don't personally think that you win anything by using a repair kit. I  
---
 mean I guess in pvp you can repair broken gear faster than and then win a battle, but idk. I don't pvp.  
---
Yup me and my friends were planning to play again this weekend as we heard the game improved
---
Not
---
Anymore
---
I guess. I don't really care. It isn't a point I can or care to prove … but you make a lot of assumptions in order to make yourself right. You might consider that in your relationships going forward. I almost lost a daughter because of a thick headed certitude like yours.
---
If you gain something from this, great. Well wishes.
---
Pizza Hut and their bullshit Book It program promised me that I could have any flavor I wanted, but I have to read books to get what I deserve. Pizza Hut is obviously FORCING ME TO READ!!
---
Can you tell me how that's pay2win?
---
The other guy was a melee character who was clearly running a low health build, not very viable for PvP with out Ass/cavalier armor. I wish you’d post the files publicly so everyone can see what happened. You can choose not to believe it but that was definitely a server lag issue, on your side it shows you doing all this damage but in reality you were doing none. You were able to kill the other guy because you were actually doing damage to him due to his build and lack of OP armor, levels don’t mean much after 50 btw.
---
Scroll to the part  
---
Evidence:  
---
*Support ticket #181108-004997* 
---
It doesn't matter if and how you can grind them. The line is called "cosmetics only".
---
Butt why?
---
I'd love some mutation body skins and scars ❤
---
That’s true. I’m disappointed regardless 
---
I'm glad this game put me off when it first came out and is not just a waterfall of disappointment over and over. I will not preorder elder scrolls 6 and I will not be buying it if there's an atom shop in it. I'm not down for micro transactions and this type of shit can get fucked. They fucked up the mobile game too with it being pay to win. Give me the fucking good classic single player or don't give me anything at all. 
---
Because you can't carry a workbench with you everywhere you go.
---
i don't really understand the problem? This is only really solving a problem for new casual players who aren't invested in the series and don't yet understand that fewer than 1% of items are ever worth repairing after breaking, or where components can easily be scavenged to fix should they break.
---
&gt;1) you're not paying money unless you want, you're paying in atoms an imaginary currency which you are given in plentiful easy supply without any monetary exchange required. 
---
Atoms cost money. Three "imaginary currency" costs money. This is a pointless thing, what you said here. While you can get them in game, you get MORE FASTER by spending real money on them. Players who spend money will, factually, have more Atoms than those who do not. 
---
&gt;2) it's not any sort of boosts, the boosted version is available only as a drop not as purchasable. 
---
So far we only know it drops from an end game boss. One drops. One. You can pay $20 of real money and get several instant repair kits, or you can grind up the ammo, healing items, and allies required to launch a nuke and fight the hardest enemy in the game for the chance to get one. 
---
&gt;The version you can buy is essentially just heavier materials in a box. At any point no matter where I am, I can free fast travel to my CAMP, use my materials in my stash, repair anything at any time or drop my CAMP at almost any other location I'm in for a handful of caps and drop my workshop there without needing to fast travel.
---
Okay, money bags. I'm glad *you* have a comical excess of caps and materials, but you aren't the majority. I, personally, couldn't repair my only shotgun for a LONG time (read: two days) because I couldn't find any screws. Was also using some BS leg armor because I had no ballistics fiber, preventing me from fixing my real armor. I'm also always broke, so moving my CAMP just to burn my few precious materials on a quick repair isn't remotely feasible. Foregoing all that, I could also pay $2 and fix my shit without wasting materials. 
---
This is literally paying for an advantage. How you aren't seeing that is mind blowing; either your head is real deep up someone's ass, or you just really like pay-for-an-edge systems. 
---
&gt; please stop saying stupid things, and please stop upvoting stupid things
---
You must be new here. Welcome to the internet.
---
Actually i am going to. I don’t have insurance. Honestly you’re probably the only one that has agreed. 
---
Agree
---
Thanks for the reply.  I’ll have to follow one of the screen shot posts for Xbox and copy them off.  Guess it’s time to take some more photos on the new system. 
---
100% is better than 0%.
---
Yeah I was legit about to buy this after waiting for all the problems to be fixed and then they add this. Wtf Bethesda 
---
Lmaoooo what a shit game, I’m out
---
Hi there. Is not just that I have uninstalled the game after knowing about this, but that I have also decided not to purchase any game released by Bethesda. To be honest, I don't care if this sort of thing ends up being strongly criticised or celebrated in joy.
---
I've been quite happy with Fallout 76 since it came out. I was having lots of fun playing it while mobs of Internet freaks where setting it on fire. I've developed a healthy tolerance towards its bugginess and I wish the best to its developers, whom I fancy to imagine as honest and passionate hard-workers.
---
However, I consider this attitude towards the consumers and towards its own product to be totally unacceptable. Is part of a very harmful trend in the gaming industry that I profoundly dislike.
---
Fortunately, right now there are many game studios that really love creating video games and care greatly about their players. I prefer staying with those than wasting my time checking if Bethesda is misbehaving again.
---
To me, Bethesda has become Vault-Tec :P
---
I play this game a heck of a lot and love it! I have never and will never spend a single cent in the atomic shop. Only what they give me for playing the game.
---
I saw it but it doesn't say WHY you are using that name and why they allowed it. 
---
I will drop some money if they release some more good cosmetics, there really hasn't been much. Why not more power armor skins?
---
Congrats! When you first launch a nuke, you feel so powerful. Hell, every time you launch a nuke you feel powerful. But I think I'm just getting carried away. Cheers to you either way!
---
Sounds like you need a nu start.
---
Jesus christ, I already left the r/Fallout subreddit because it became nothing but pedantic whinging about completely petty little shit that filled up my front page. 
---
One big ol' dumpster boi.
---
Exact same for me.  I picked up Initiate routinely.  But not a single BOS paint since the update.  Just an endless series of 40mm grenades. 
---
I see the gane hasnt changed since i left 1 month after launch lmfao 
---
Lol at the irony in this comment.
---
Imagine nuking your own camp lmao
---
No kidding. A lot of people were coming back and really enjoying the game. Hopefully they see the error in putting these in the atom shop.  This would be a huge mistake.
---
Most interactions in game were random people commenting on the name, it was typically quite positive.
---
The good thing is that you can keep going back and getting more alien rounds.
---
I mean it's slow going but it's a thing.
---
Literally uneatable. 
---
For the sake of those with partial color blindness how about no...
---
I just checked out  a YT vid on a F76 event called Uranium Fever.  Is that the event you were talking about?  
---
It really reminded me of *Borderlands*. I used to love playing Borderlands! Have you played that game?
---
You could always just sell the useless 3* to clear up space... 
---
I am. +15% ballistic weapon damage+ a viable hydration source? Why on earth not. 
---
You will get tokens for turning in legendarys.
---
Each star rewards certain amount of tokens.
---
You can then use tokens to roll for legendarys I think this is how it will work.
---
Tongue in cheek....that sounds dirty
---
Wait, who said refrigerators are going to the atom shop? Did I miss something?
---
Nailed it bro
---
Yeah little known fact. That period where people were unsuspended was an unannounced test to see if those accounts could safely be put back in the game. It probably would have been more productive to tell those people and be like "Okay dumb fucks, here is a test to see if you can drop everything for the next few days". Also they blamed reinstating those accounts caused server stability and not the Fausnaut event which kept fucking up even after they booted my friends back off.
---
I woke up and saw my friend posted a pic of a license plate that said A55 HMR.  I thought, I should send him my pic of my robot from FO4, which I named A.S.S.HAMMER 9000. Then I got on Reddit and clicked on this thread, lol.
---
after years of spending money on cosmetics playing Runescape, i whole heartedly disagree with you. a game can be successful with a cosmetic only micro transaction system. with bethesda however, it only took them 6 months to go down a dark path. it took Jagex a little longer but the years of "spins" and "treasure hunter keys" and solomon's general store, and a loyalty program kept me hooked long enough. bethesda employees seemed to have never played an online rpg in their life because the things they are rolling out, are not new and much better mechanics exist in other games.
---
Thanks bro
---
That is a possibility, but can’t confirm without evidence. Could explain why I haven’t bumped into hairyfrontbum or scathammer in a while, although I did see xxpoosyslayerxx the other day.
---
non-cosmetic microtransactions have no place in a $60 game
---
GAMERS RISE UP
---
I’m sure it will come back. I have no idea when however. Items in the shop will be available for a few weeks then go on sale for a week then go into the vault. I only assume vaulted items will return for an un vaulting event where there will be sales before returning to the vault. It keeps the shop clean. 
---
Corgidanceparty is a pretty good name but it still sucks how they changed your name without telling you.
---
I know but that hoarding game tho 😂  I’m not over-cumbered or anythingbut my stash has like 20 free space 
---
all they need to do is give us more skins to grind/pay for. Matt/chrome color schemes, simple patterns for PA and regular armors....like...I am surprised we are getting new cosmetics at the pace we are getting them.
---
So based on your post you buy games that promise the moon but the price is next to nothing? Not all games are big enough like fortnite to be free to play and thrive. Plus people like me work and we can't spend endless hours like you farming for materials. I love this and its not a bad micro transaction. You will understand when you get older and move out of your parents house and work 40+ hrs.
---
i love how much you got downvoted for telling facts. shows how much the community cares about the actual truth of the matter.
---
That's more or less what Todd said at PAX, yeah. I'm glad they're going with a token system, should work well I hope.
---
This reddit is as bad as fallout now, just noise. Where the mods at
---
The problem isn't that you can get atoms for free, the problem is that people can get them easier by spending money.  When you have to grind every challenge for a week only to be outclassed by some dude with disposable income who can buy items that do things like repair his shit on the fly, it becomes pay to win.
---
LOL. give me a break.  you can pay for it with cash.  riiiight?   its pay 2 win.  you can buy in game materials,  the cost of upgrading,  with real world currency.   I dont see why people sre defending this
---
I was looking at the wild appalachia update with curiosity, but that just eliminated any chance of me returning to the game, and I'm sure I'm not alone
---
your still goin?
---
I appreciate your apologies. And your efforts. 
---
Now. From one human to another, why is it SO bad? What I say wouldn't be so shocking if we as a society could learn to see the humor in things. Then maybe, just maybe, people wouldn't rape to begin with. Now I'm no rape sympathizer, but I feel like you're cutting right to the end where we pity just the victim and say the topic is off limits. Now, assuming in this hypothetical situation, where we're talking about an ACTUAL rape, did you ever think to wonder what caused this –assuming– man to rape? Similarly, maybe the wolf attacked the hunter previously? Maybe the hunter was a legit, sensitive human being, and the wolf was cold-hearted and humorless. Sure, rape isn't the answer to that, obviously. The guy could've probably just laughed it off, except don't understand his motives, and that's the problem with it to begin with. We know we're not supposed to kill other people, but we do it frequently. You seem to want to be recognized for your morality, and I encourage you to take it a step further. I'm asking you to forgive rapists. For you know not why they do. If you wish to achieve complete moral superiority over myself and the rest of humanity, you must truly go 100% in. Otherwise, you'll always have an asterisk in your points. And I will insist on following you around and making sure of it, because that's the kind of person I am. However, I won't rape you. Partly because I'm not a rapist, and partly because I'm really not like, a rapist I guess. Seems like a weird, enjoyment-less thing to do. When you factor in the point that it's probably a force thing as opposed to a rape thing, it's probably stemmed from a life of a lack of control put on by more outspoken, grand-standing individuals who made this hypothetical rapist feel small and powerless to make his own decisions. And for that, doesn't some of the blame go on those individuals? But yes, I know, I'm blaming the victim. And to someone with complete moral superiority over everyone, that's a sin. 
---
I got pretty off track there, my apologies. My main point is to learn to laugh. Anything can be funny if you make it funny. Think of the funniest thing you've ever heard or seen. It was probably inappropriate in some way. The first thing that pops into my head is Will Ferrell shooting himself with a tranquilizer in Old School. Seems harmless enough, except it was at a children's birthday party. Pretty inappropriate. Laughter can cure even the darkest of mental states. However, no problem has EVER been solved by shaming others for something they find entertaining. In fact, it's probably only caused more crime. So go back over your checklist or whatever your clique tells you to feel, think for yourself, and relax. 
---
They keep nerfing things, I wouldn't be surprised if things need more screws and ballistic fiber and stuff if they don't sell well enough.
---
  Surely a Wastelander springs to mind if ever heard.
---
The think I like the most is the complete silence of  Bethesda and community managers
---
Cheers.
---
How can you not find screws, I have over 1000 in my stash... do you need screws, it’s quite easy to find most scrap items in the game, shit you can even tag a item so it’s easier to find in the world. Don’t believe everything you hear on YouTube.   
---
For all the people saying “now you can fix on the fly, it’s pay to win” it’s FREE in caps to fast travel to your Camp to fix your shit, and there are weapons benches everywhere in the world.  Seriously I think some people will bitch about everything in life.  Is anyone forcing you to buy this shit I mean for fuck sake. 
---
Nice.
---
Dunno man, I've got maybe 300 fiber just sitting in my stash (god knows why I even keep more than 25). I literally drop 50 fiber as charity in the suitcase at Watoga every few days because everyone keeps telling me how uncommon it is. There are no materials in this game that are rare. I get it if you're level 25 and below, because there's so much to discover, you won't know where everything is for at least 30 hours of game time. But the "whose to say Bethesda won't nerf this or that" isn't an argument, it's just baseless prognostication. It's also just a game whose rules and systems may arbitrarily change, much like life. We trudge on if we choose to.
---
But they didn’t do this with stims...
---
Kits are good kits in the atom shop are not 
---
But you still got the atoms for free.
---
Numerous interviews before release, in print and on video. 
---
xbox here too and only one ;) it seems to me like you dont play nice with other people. the community is warm and welcoming and it is not hard to make  couple friends you can trust to hold your caps, gear, junk, armor, and weapons to transfer while you laboriously switch characters and trade it back. it may be a load of bs but dont risk everything during a BETA. What is bs is going into an unfamiliar/new game mode, and complaining when it all goes south. Even with "Bankruptcy Policy" debuff from adventure mode (-50% damage to players), it is still easy to wreck people. i have done it myself to confirm. i probably killed more people in those 4 hours than any other 4 hour stretch in survival, because of having that feeling of recklessness with nothing to loose.
---
That makes it awkward
---
This is pay to play, otherwise you're too busy grinding screws and ballistic fiber to experience any fun
---
yikes, kind of embarrassing that I was defending this game a week ago. 
---
Is that so? I heard rumors that was the case, but I never thought of it more than gossip since I never saw anything from bethesda about it. 
---
If that is actually the case then I feel like Bethesda should've say something. "Here's a test to see if you can play nice with others" or "Drop anything you believe to be duped". Frankly, if it was an actual test then I feel like some transparency is needed.
---
Also, yeah the servers were still crazy after everyone got re-suspended. I know some people were blaming server stability but that clearly wasn't the case.
---
&gt;~~non-cosmetic~~ **ALL** microtransactions have no place in a $60 game
---
FTFY
---
I was suscribed to this subreddit to check out how things are going to decide if invest time (and maybe some atoms) to come back and playing it... After this, I think I'll take my loss and uninstall. Beyond hope, sadly.
---
No… I’m saying you’re committing a logical fallacy. That isn’t a good thing. Look it up, the logical fallacy you’re using is called a Slippery Slope, it means your argument is baseless
---
Totally agreed. Refrigerators and ammo converters should've been the part of the game in first place. We are asking for nothing ridiculously unique and it makes me hard to understand Bethesda asking atoms for such basic things. Also, your idea of unlocking quests for those items sounds really fun.
---
I don’t understand the fuss about the repair kits I wasn’t there when they came out and it has not impacted the way I play so I don’t understand why it’s sooo important.
---
They could....idk....boost the Atom value of challenges? Balance if out, to at least _appear_ like the play option takes precedence over the pay option?
---
I always thought it was weird that your dailies could barely afford the cosmetics that should _be free_. (Haircut, Tatoo’s, looking at you; you’re appearance options yo.)
---
Remember when the game went on sale for black friday it was definitely 100% going free to play, when one website reported it hadn't sold a lot of physical discs in the UK the servers were going to be shutdown by the new year. So far everyone predicting catastrophe is batting exactly 0
---
Its not baseless if you look at patterns of previous games...
---
There was so much leaving players on reddit, my friends stop playing, try server hopping on survival, there can be only 1 server in wrong time.
---
What promises were made? Last I check Todd Howard wasn't giving the full details since he didn't make this game. If its so terrible don't buy atoms for it. I'm personally buying some and if you don't like too bad either ask your mom or dad for money or get a part time job.
---
They need to hurry with endgame... theres literally nothing to do.
---
u/yellowspaces is not agreeing with you.  They are pointing out that your argument is not logical because it is using a logical fallacy.  I complete agree— there is no way of knowing what BGS is planning based on this one move and there is no sound argument to support otherwise.   Everything can be a slippery slope if you just argue for it— that’s why it’s a stupid argument and a non-starter to people who understand this.  
---
I did tho you’re just not listening, it’s all good tho keep reprinting people if that makes you feel better 
---
Just make a mule character, stash limit is no longer an issue. 
---
Or in the black rubbish bins outside the Traders stores in Whitesprings - better than leaving it in a doggie bag as it will stay in-game for longer
---
Someone at work dreaming of living in a post apocalyptic wasteland where everyone is dead?
---
Wow, can't see how that would be possible. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
---
I am speaking for myself lol. Thats my reason why i didn't buy any.
---
&gt; Without revenue there's no way to continue paying employees to continue creating new content.
---
Without pushing out new free content out of thier own pocket there is no way to continue rebuilding the good will lost when they launched this game.
---
This game was a mistake, and it wouldn't be acceptable if beth didn't pay dearly for thier betrayal.
---
Because it IS a slippery slope.
---
I would prefer not to be spammed
---
Ok then and when i said it's a possibility and it does happen guess ill still be wrong after seeibg the same pattern of video games for the last 20 yrs
---
No, no it doesn’t. Repairing your shit on the fly has nothing to do with pay to win. You can fast travel to your camp for free, there are thousands of armor benches throughout the world. 
---
Somebody put forward the idea that the reroll might be based on the actual weapon/armor type and there was an initial statement that the amount of stars making something “more likely”
---
So I’m both hoarding any lightweight legendaries but also 3* versions of weapons and armor I’d actually want. Just in case I can get a reroll on the primary legendary perk or something. 
---
&gt; let Bethesda know we are going to HOLD THEM to their promise of COSMETIC ONLY.
---
Hold them? No you should push back hard let them know that testing the waters and probing for weakness will make them lose ground. Abolish the atomic shop entirely. 
---
Found this on facebook. Willing to believe it's true as the guy said he had talked to several people before getting a response
---

---
Try playing TSE: blades, that new mobile game. I heard you need money to open loot boxes, and if you don't pay, your gear will be broken over time and you will not have cash to repair it. That is not p2w, but pay or gtfo.
---
Those weren't based in Bethesda literally saying what they want to do, which is sell boosts for real dollars. That's the line. 
---
Also happy cake day!
---
LOLOL!
---
tx for that :)
---
agreed, r/fo76filthycasuals is that way
---
Are you kink-shaming this sub, bro? If they get off on complaining about something they'll definitely take part in anyway, you shouldn't shame them for that bro. It's not right bro. 
---
Try server hoping at survival :)
---
I wouldn't have bought it, and I already uninstalled the game because of it. I have other games I can play. 
---
Wow.  When did Bethesda kill your family?  What happens to your poor waiter when they get you Diet Coke instead of Regular?
---
My very real laugh just now 
---
Unnecessary 'me too' posts?  Don't even try it Ilynlor.
---
Grafton. That mayor is irritating.
---
Just because its Survival doesnt mean it has to be "shoot noobs on sight mode". No matter how you see it, its still pretty lame to KOS ppl who are so low lvl that they cant defend themselves. Nothing wrong with PVPing with other high lvl players. 
---
It is a product of a business model. THIS is largely inoffensive. Will it stop there? Unlikely. If we support it now, eventually you'll be priced out of playing the endgame without spending some money to "keep up." It's happened before and it's just better if we don't go down that road. 
---
Want to make repairs easier for casual players?
---
THEN MAKE REPAIRS EASIER. 
---
Is there a repair kit for Bethesda's reputation in that store? 
---
I'm a new player sort of. I got the game day one and played the beta but I only spent maybe 10 hours on it at the time and then didn't touch it until the Fasnacht Parade, I started a brand new character and did all the Flatwoods stuff and then the Parade and ever since then I have been getting a tad addicted to this game, been playing it a few weeks now and really enjoying myself.  
---
Things have seemed pretty positive but this announcement today was a stupid decision and they tried to be sneaky about it too. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth and I really don't know who thought this was a good idea. It's BGS, they don't need the money and even Todd said the game did well. So I don't get this. It's not a huge problem right now as weapon repair kits don't seem overly useful but this is the first step on a bad path.
---
Hopefully they won't go any further.
---
Yeah, i got around 12k atoms from playing. I have unlocked too much things,and now i don't need those ugly ones.
---
Sorry for you being downvoted, this subreddit is super slow in realizing things haha.
---
Whining! Usesless posts! ZOMG LIES!
---
What are you looking for? 
---
Legendary items? 
---
Experience? 
---
Flux?
---
Plans?
---
I thought I screwed up a setting somewhere without realizing it. So yeah I guess I've noticed this.
---
Here's what bad posts looks like.
---
Why the hell should they be a rare drop?  They should be a craftable item.  They were in Fallout New Vegas with various pieces of junk.
---
Oh don’t I know it, my CAMP is in the Toxic Valley so I hear his voice all the time
---
Stop this A_stupid_chair.
---
This was the utility I assumed they were for the moment I read about it. Instead of carrying multiple guns into a raid, you can bring some repair kits. They’re not necessary, but if you want to carry less guns so you can actually loot they will be helpful. Same goes for transferring loot back to stash without a stash box. When you’re in a raid, you can transfer items and keep looting. Again, not necessary but could be useful in dungeon situations.
---
I can only imagine, without them going into raids could be difficult without them. You are forced to carry more guns which reduces what you can loot. These items allow players to do raids more conveniently. Unnecessary if you wear excavator which I assume everyone will be wearing in raids instead of using these items. 
---
So whata the biggest plus the game has right now?
---
Whitesprings or Charleston for lots of ghouls and legendaries. Fissure Prime for the queen.
---
I have 2 mules loaded to the brim with legendaries of every kind
---
I am level 61 and perfectly able to repair my stuff, but what you are doing is way better than protesting! Keep it up!
---
DANGER SIGN: Another useless (end of the world) complaint post that spams the subreddit.
---
I bought the game to have fun.   The monetization model didn’t even factor into the decision.  
---
If only we had decent mods on this sub.
---
This pointless shit is never going to end. All of this bullshit ultimatum crap sure worked well for you people at launch didn’t it?
---
Literally no one. Not even a word even mentioned about the game having fridge in the first place. This is another hallucinated, self induced raged, prophetic nonsense bullshit for biweekly dose of drama. Like the lunchbox, the unstoppable outfit buff, etc.
---
All pointless and inconsequential
---
What he said bro.
---
Pump the breaks on #UselessSpamPosts pseunomix, if you want to actually do something useful.
---
I pray this is the case, that they are going to make the plans to create bags a free ATOM Shop item once they are released as a way of introducing them to players.
---
The utility isn’t the issue.  This is a step towards P2W and a violation of the “cosmetic items only” promise made when the shop was announced.
---
Mostly legendary items and plans. I’m about to be lv. 70 so experience is not what I’m focusing on at the moment.
---
Bethesda promised a cosmetic only store. It's even on their website. They are breaking that promise. It's that easy.
---
Honestly I love just exploring the world and playing with friends is the best despite what people say this game is still super fallout.
---
Bro
---
No Useless Spam Posts On The Subreddit!
---
I’m not saying you’ll be wrong or right.  That’s not what u/yellowspaces is saying either.  You could very well be right , but your argument doesn’t support that since you are using the “slippery slope” fallacy.  That’s all anyone is saying here.  I’m not agreeing or disagreeing with you.  
---
Yeah if they are in combat my mutations set them off or my power armors Tesla coils.
---
Thanks for the tip
---
That’s all op is doing. The karma farmers on this sub are never told to stop by the mods despite this shit never changing. This entire thread is fake outrage about something not even in game yet. Oh, but I’m sure op’s psychic powers are working this time.
---
Whats wrong with giving players option to buy repair kits, what you think DLC pays for itself. If its so horrible don't buy them, I work 40+ hrs so I have income to spend and I want to spend it on this games repair kits to save my time is my right not yours.
---
Dear bethesda: BRO
---
Legendary items would probably be Whitesprings.
---
Plans from SBQ (ultracite/serums)
---
would atom shop super stimpacks not be pay to win because anyone can farm them? Atom shop corn soup is cool because it's easy to plant corn and boil water at camp? Where do you draw the line?  
---
Maybe it's ok to have atom shop AAE's, TSE's, BE's because after all anyone can hypothetically find those as well, right?
---
I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks!
---
My husband and I were both caught in both suspensions, I am assuming from Flux he picked up out of a paper bag and traded to me.  Point being it is not even on his account anymore and I check my ticket today and guess what GONE!!! No agent, No Email (yes I checked my spam folder), no confirmation of my suspension other than the 4:8:2000 error.  I share the same frustration as everyone else and just want communication, a date, SOMETHING!!!!
---
That's your problem not the game mode. So self centered to think you deserve some kind of exempt from the rule when the game mode literally makes ALL kills legitimate.
---
Level up 3 times while intoxicated 
---
at some point when the player base has dwindled to a few hundred (end of the year?) they will all 'disappear' overnight night to be cryogenically frozen and dispatched to a distant star in an arkship.
---
The whole game is a selection process.
---
I was online, so not sure why it showed otherwise. In fact I had a number of people message me due to my online status.
---
Wtf is going on in this comment.
---
Friend request accepted. Joining your server now. See you soon!
---
Let's have them fix the guns we have first like energy weapons and how anti armour doesn't work for them
---
good post, hate the title.
---
Where is the best place to nuke for glowing mass, hardened mass, and high radiation fluids?
---
Yeah, but there's still a bug where, if you sell items too fast, the highlighted item moves \*up\* one instead of remaining over where your mouse is hovering. So if you click too fast the game will sell whatever's above your selection (try it sometime).
---
And, on top of that, you can't buy the item back at the price you sold it. Now it's magically 10X the cost. ESO at least had a "buyback" option so you could re-purchase items at cost.
---
Is this the same 99% who said the game would be dead but it isn't?
---
Thank you. The last few hours have been ridiculous. 
---
Brutal
---
Thats all i was doing was making a point. I spoke my peace. And if this happens and it gets worse all i did was warn people. If I want to play a pay 2 win game ill go back to clash of clans or something.
---
At that level probably just some crafted leather armor would be the best. If you want some level 10 legendaries you can try to farm the leader of the pack event. 
---
They took our jobs!
---
But i want an anti materiel rifle, not because of new vegas, but because the HECATE II is beautiful and powerful :c
---
Anything. 
---
I have used that name for years, on Steam, Youtube and countless others. Presumably they allowed because the name was not taken, and didn't have an issue with it.
---
Sounds exactly like Bethesda is adding pay to win...
---
“Pay-to-win
---
In some games, players who are willing to pay for special items or downloadable content may be able to gain an advantage over those playing for free who might otherwise need to spend time progressing in order to unlock said items. “
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play#Pay-to-win
---
Jesus, mother Mary of Christ that is SOME kind of entitlement you've got going on there...
---
Whitespring. Because the glowing ones drop that stuff and there’s a ton of them that spawn there when the whitespring has recently been nuked.
---
Obviously we can't believe on the internet, but if this is true then that's some interesting information. I appreciate you sharing this. 
---
I wish there was a set free option but there is not. 
---
I was a day one purchaser, Power Armor Edition. I played for a few hours, but saw that it was a bit of a mess, so I put it aside to play something else. I consider picking it up every now and then, but every time I think I'm about to jump back in, they do something else to foster bad will in the community and I go find something else to play. It's honestly getting to the point that I may just uninstall it all together and move on. At least I got a cool helmet (and allegedly a canvas bag at some point) out of the deal.
---
Yeah Bethesda should really listen to the same people who wanted the game cancelled at launch. 
---
Just because you whine the loudest does not make you correct. Learn from your complete failure at launch and stop infecting this sub with your pointless toxic speculation.
---
I saw my first Harper’s ferry nuke earlier...that was kinda a dull one. 
---
That's also why comics are released in issues.
---
Sorry pal but it’s kinda shit outside where I live therefore why would I go out period
---
Altho to further the "base" point i was making look at what happened with cod and their dlc, adding weapons in with extra maps for money. I like this game amd i dont want to see it go down that road and turn into that.
---
Doesn’t make purchasable repair kits defeat the purpose of us being the players in the game?  What about repair shops as vendors?
---
&gt;How can you not find screws, I have over 1000 in my stash... do you need screws, it’s quite easy to find most scrap items in the game ... Don’t believe everything you hear on YouTube. 
---
Because I didn't find any? I don't spend time scavenging random buildings; if I don't find the item while traveling from A to B then I'm not getting it. What about YouTube? 
---
&gt;For all the people saying “now you can fix on the fly, it’s pay to win” it’s FREE in caps to fast travel to your Camp to fix your shit, and there are weapons benches everywhere in the world. 
---
It's free to go to camp, yes. It costs both caps and time to travel back out from your camp. It also costs materials to fix your items. Not everyone wants to trek back to base once every twenty or thirty minutes to play inventory whack a mole; being able to pay money to bypass this is an immediate advantage. Full stop.
---
&gt; Seriously I think some people will bitch about everything in life. Is anyone forcing you to buy this shit I mean for fuck sake. 
---
Well that's just a rude generalization. Real dick move, bud 
---
Thats not how it works. People may downvote you. This subreddit is strange.
---
I get a lot of all three by doing Whitesprings. The glowing ghouls have quite a bit. 
---
Pretty sure doing Fissure prime can net you quite a bit as well if you focus on thr minions
---
Except that weapons break too fast in this game, especially ranged weapons. And this leads to them never fixing that issue.
---
Right? can we please get displayable skulls and pikes and gross stuff for our raider camps
---
Especially when the people we're tagging don't have any more power than to say "the community strongly disapproves of this decision"
---
0/10 troll account do more with ur time
---
Having bought this dumpster fire due to my gf's plodding, I regret it due to being an old Bethesda fan boy, but no longer. That said a lot of the fans sorta deserve this by defending this behavior.
---
Exactly you want more money bring more cosmetics. The atom store has alot of boring almost child like items. I know younger players will go for those items. But I need better options and I might spend some money. I would play for black bird power armor right now if it was released. I dont want childs play power armor..... develop better cosmetics for money. Dont make it a p2w game. You already have so much hate for the game. Why make it worse??? 
---
So assuming an OP weapon is 3000 atoms I gotta wait 3 months?
---
Make more items with multiple styles, colors and appeal.  Now it’s like you can have one chair, in one color or one PA color but only for this type, but not this type ect..,
---
I’ve been scrolling looking for trades and every two threads there is like five "don’t go ea mode Bethesda” it’s really ticking me off
---
I killed mine by leading a hungry pack of super mutants to him. He disappeared for weeks and then reincarnated into a radstag for some reason 
---
Yeah the only reason to nuke that area is to get Flux. And you can get a metric fuck ton of it around there.  Not much for enemies. 
---
I did it once to get flux to make Calibrated Shocks for my T-51. 
---
I stick to Whitesprings now. 
---
Well considering the Atomic Shop is fueling all the upcoming free content I'm fine with cosmetic only. Lets be real most of the AS stuff is meh. Only the CAMP stuff is worth it. 
---
Where there just no enemies/drops there?
---
This sub is yet again a toxic shithole because of the exact same morons like OP repeating the exact same bullshit they did at launch.
---
Thankfully no matter how much they spam the sub Bethesda already ignored them after their idiotic launch demands. No reason they’ll start now. 
---
Do your part, tell your friends who aren’t part of this bs to support Bethesda. Toxic spam and karma farming shouldn’t decide a games direction.
---
Apparently my generation didn't teach English properly since your generation calls pay to win everything. This game isn't pay to win and repair kits are not! If you don't want to repair your kits in the middle of no where then don't buy it or just farm it, and unless you plan on donating some secret fortune to pay for this DLC then stop complaining.
---
Lololololol
---
Haha, true
---
The item he's talking about buying is a repair booster, it's just used to fix the durability lost in the upgrade process
---
Haha, they just can’t stop fucking up this game.  
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
I was one of them.... but hey.
---
meh they are a AAA developer and publisher they can dip into the reserves they have a lot of goodwill to rebuild
---
Interesting. Well, that's good, at least. It won't be total RNG bullshit, just partial RNG bullshit.
---
Well if my friends list continues to shrink, I think it will move on and start playing a different game.
---
Sweet so as long as I have the stairs still attached somewhere I can build a treehouse and not a 3 story house beside a tree
---
Damn
---
yeh so just horde alot of different weapons and effects.
---
ive got a shit ton of bloodied and instigating and furious weapons ready for the mole man vendor :)
---
Damn, I guess I made a pretty good first call then.
---
Ballistic fiber is already too rare. I’m stuck with broken armor all the time. It makes it very slow to advance if you always have to farm for fiber. So this can easily be used like quarters at the arcade. In order to keep playing efficiently you need to drop real money. What’s stopping them from making lead more scarce and selling ammo cans next?
---
yes but i want to be invisible. the night vision effect has always been annoying and FO76 only magnified the problem
---
He’s making an anus joke. 
---
yeh any weapon you cant use in power armour is classified as unarmed :).
---
That is awesome. Well done!
---
Same thing happening to me
---
Preach. Hands down the best perks in the game. My crappy Honda Civic level T-60 has better armor at max repair than Ultracite. Amazing stuff. 
---
I always tell people not to listen to youtube and to make their own decisions.
---
But in this case.. Yes, listen to youtube.
---
I had/have the same problem. Finally broke it after 9 attempts. 
---
??? Just a random picture???
---
That's why I use non gendered terms like "bro" and "dude"
---
I thought it was just me it's insanely frusterating.
---
Yes, I’ve never had heat flashes, and jelly fingers only the one time. 
---
Excellent point. Take your upboat to counteract salt. 
---
Thank you, gave me a good chuckle =)
---
I appreciate your clarification.  Unfortunately its lots of misinformation that makes this particular challenge so hard to complete.
---
It's a monetization scheme where they push items by saying they may never return.(there heading to the vault) Keeps people buying them. Honestly its sickening... I love fallout and to see it monetized like this with 2 day sales and limited time events is just sad. I'm sure it will eventually come back... when they need more money.  
---
This is unacceptable for a full priced game 
---
Juicehead's a notoriously crappy YouTuber. He'll report on anything and everything, doesn't bother to do research, and reports on anything he can find as facts. I used to watch him until I realized he'll do just about anything he can for views and pushes out as many videos as possible.
---
Hello. Yup I figured I needed it as melee bloodied build especially for SBQ.  You can’t do DPS if your are dead/ dying and running away to stim to avoid dying. But if u aren’t going with bloodied build, u probably don’t need it. Taken from personal experience and frustrations. Blocker perk is awesome.
---
"Progress"
---
I want to use energy weapons
---
May as well pull metro and borderlands off that list, people are still shiting their pants about being epic exclusives on PC
---
was a tiny percentge of people asked for repair kits to return from new vegas.
---
no one ever stated please make these pay to get items.
---
anything that affects gameplay and stuff isnt to put into the atom shop as this is effctivly pay to win in a sense more so with the refrigerator and stuff as that can keep food that can add as buffs so that is def pay to win.
---
Negative. There has been untold amounts of virtual ink spilled about having to repair your weapons and armor as part of the grind in general. A simple search on the sub will bring up plenty of posts hot about repairs that never mention the lack of condition in two shot/heavy weapons. 
---
So maybe don't be so careless? Like I've got sympathy, but this kind of thing just sounds dumb, I'm not going to lie
---
Sounds like an upgrade. Thanks Bethesda!
---
&gt; I might actually spend a few bucks in the shop just so they feel less pressure to pursue antics like this.
---
I'm not sure that's how it works...
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Yep. He'll report on anything Fallout 76 related, true, false, or otherwise. He doesn't care about integrity, but volume.
---
No enemies really. 
---
They ain’t broke so you can’t fix ‘em 
---
It's not about becoming pay to win, it's about adding non cosmetics to a cosmetic shop.
---
Plus let's say that you're in survival and you team up with some dudes and take out a scorchbeast. Your armor breaks, or weapon, and when the fight is over they turn on you. You would think they would be in a similar situation, but they popped a repair kit so all their gear is good.
---
It's not about providing a large advantage, it provides an advantage. Plain and simple.
---
I think the argument is basically.
---
1. An item can be bought for real-world money in the Atomic Shop.
---
2. That item affects the actual game. 
---
3. Some players can't afford to buy that item.
---
4. That gives players with money an advantage.
---
5. That is pay to win. 
---
Bethesda has learned a lot of hard lessons over the past few months. May as well keep learning. :)
---
I truly believe they will take this feedback and learn from it.
---
It's just the start, keep the uproar up. Don't get rolled over by it lads and ladies. Stand your ground, no to this nonsense. 
---
Also a good option I do have a mule account but it’s been getting tedious transferring items and caps over, I ain’t complaining just want that legendary vendor to hurry up and get here 😂
---
Lmfao this is the hasty generalization fallacy! 
---
Damn, that really does sound dull
---
This new repair kit in particular isn’t pay to win. Most people are upset because it is a step towards trying to get pay to win items in the game. yes this item isn’t pay to win but if we let the get away with this then the next item might only be a small bonus not pay to win enough and before you know it full blown experience boosters and loot drop boosters are in the game and once they are in there is no going back. 
---
Not pay to win, just making weapons break too fast, now you pay/grind to not be inconvenienced with ridiculously low weapon durability.
---
I am more than willing to spend real money on cool cosmetics if they release them, but a consumable item that is really just a band aid to bad design is plain stupid.
---
And I've been voted down for suggestions to have CAMP generators require consumable energy resources, so I'm not the type looking for an easy game. Guns definitely break too fast, and if repair kits are a thing they should be purchased with caps. There are not enough worth-while consumable items that require purchase with caps, caps need to be more useful in the game because they end up just accumulating and devaluing in the high level stage of the game. Make it so all players still have a use for caps or what's the point of trading?
---
Stop right there criminal scum!
---
Until they nerf it to make the repair kit better.
---
It’s not pay to win. People just like to complain. Better repair kits will drop in game and if you really want them you can earn atoms to buy the dinky ones. I think people are just worried if they start with repair kits where will it stop. 
---
It doesn't. But people seem to enjoy the "Bu, bu, Bethesda" hystrionics.
---
Everyone is reacting in profound and vocal ways, but no one is overreacting
---
Forgive me if throwing away all the enjoyment you've gotten or will get out of 76 and all of Bethesda's past and (hopefully) future games over repair kits strikes me as comically over the top.
---
You can call it what you want, it doesnt change the fact that if this goes through its going to get worse.
---
Ah sorry I must have missed. Recently purchased a piece obly to find out it doesnt work. Seema like a common issue from Google but no word from Beth yet. Given the amazing response these posts get (great work!) Hoping they see it here. Cheers.
---
I want my fridge no matter the cost, go away 🤬
---
OH GOD DOOM AND GLOOM!  
---
People said the same thing about ESO too, and that it would be p2w blah blah blah.  Never happened.
---
Consumables worse than what is available in game and services are not p2w and never will be. 
---
When you can buy levels and gear in the store....then you will have a real reason to cry.  Until then you all look silly.  I swear people in this sub are more concerned over a pixel repair kit than if someone in their extended family died.   
---
Cool 👍
---
Compared to launch, they've come quite a ways. 
---
I agree with you there.  I don’t want it to head that direction either.  I have a feeling this isn’t going to be as negative as people here think, but it’s more of a hunch than anything else .  
---
I understand you seen this and was surprised. But are you a regular on this Reddit? It’s been posted 1,567,800 times. It’s a stupid glitch from the last big update. When you go back to said workshop or wherever. It’s weak ass enemies or nothing at all. 
---
You could drop maintenance perks and equip defensive + Offensive perks. This *does* give an edge. 3 to 8 free perk points are something you could die for in this game.
---
And?
---
Well lucky for you, you don’t have to trek back to base every thirty minutes or so because there are literally weapon and armor workbenches in every major installation in the world and many smaller locals as well. 
---
Now you're just reaching, i stated my opinion, and people are arguing. Im not the one acting out. I made a logical statement and stated other games have done it. Thats all. Im not fighting with a bunch of kids on reddit.
---
Not to be too intrusive now, but I'm in your lobby. Also really need to get in bed and pass out 😂
---
So I appreciate what you're trying to say here.  Your spelling and grammar and distractingly bad though, it makes it really hard to take you seriously.
---
Please enlighten me how your 100% atom shop repair kit gives you an advantage over my 200% repair?  Oh, it doesn't... /thread.
---
Darn, I'm 56 on PS4, but pretty casual so I'm like less than 50 optimization wise. 
---
Very much agree. I can understand if the game was free to download in the first place, then developers need some payback for their hard work and paid content can do that. But,if i have paid full price to buy a game, and where i live that was about $100.00,then i know that the developers have factored in the profit margin into the price. 
---
Then if they want to develop cosmetic add ons to enhance the game, i can live with that to the point that you can earn atoms to buy them through game play, so you can save up points to buy them anyway. If you want Something bad enough to pay for it after that, it's your choice. 
---
But to be forced to buy items that are made by the developer to just simply be able to play the game at all, or to give undue advantage to players who have paid over those who haven't/can't pay is completely wrong. Especially for a game which got off to a bad start publicity wise. For those who have been there since day of release,and have defended the good points of it, to see the community in the game grow and become a generally good and fun bunch of people, this is looking to be a real kick in the teeth. 
---
Ive never understood the point of posting stuff like this. What do you want me to reply with?
---
The youtubers who monetize on hating Fallout 76, make me want to just suppport Bethesda no matter what they do, they infuriate me that much. That much more than Bethesda infuriates me!
---
I always try to assess the server stability before launching a nuke and running the queen. Also sometimes when I get the infinite loading wheel I fast travel away from the area and come back and it lets me loot the queen.
---
Neither does trump. I'm only talking about his TV career.
---
I thought it looked like overreaction at first, until I thought about how weapons already break too fast in the game, and now if you don't want that inconvenience you should use your Atoms to avoid it, it will not ever be resolved. You can't spend the many caps you accumulate with not much else to purchase using them in the late game, only Atoms.
---
200% repaired + gunsmith rank 5 + luck of the draw = no repairs for a long long time. 
---
when you go to tame another it will ask you if you want to replace your current tame
---
I've tried that 2 times and it hasn't worked either.
---
Like talking to a wall....  You explain it's NOT the damn kit getting everyone mad, it's the non-cosmetic nature of the item and that BSG is appears to be willing to try an get p2w in this game at all costs. It's the bigger picture of p2w elements being slowly introduced that's causing the uproar.  Everyone's not upset about the kit, fridge, or magic bullet machine in and of themselves. I want these things too.... just not via p2w in the Atom shop. Make them plans anyone can buy from vendors, find in a loot drop, or as a quest reward. That's not p2w.
---
I'd rather have BSG spend resources FIXING THE BROKEN stuff in game before spending resources making p2w stuff for the atom shop.  It's not like the game is finished yet - this is game is just starting to transition from early release level bugginess to beta testing level bugginess. 
---
100% unlikely. No need to spread lies. 
---
Pvp. You can basically never stop fighting.  Also you won't need junk to repair. So now you eont have to scavenge or spend caps for materials. It's not a huge deal but it's imo not a good idea to go that route.  
---
This one's for you OP, from one Power Armored, Heavy Weapon wielding knight to another.
---
I got creative tonight in survival. I brought my lvl 16 alt and my main level 330 in party to survival. Built my alt a base inside of a satellite. He was primarily there to provide my main with Empath and as a way to offload excess junk / aid / caps so I didn't lose what I was earning. After an hour of farming, both my main and my alt were in the top positions on the leaderboard, and people started showing up.
---
Thankfully I was prepared for this. The only way to attack my alt is to climb up a bunch of stairs, through a bunch of locked doors, and over a bunch of traps and a few nuke mines. Suffice to say it was a slow, painful slog for anyone that wanted to make an attempt on my peaceful sleeping level 16's life. It also gave me ample warning that he was being attacked, as I could hear them unlocking doors, grunting in pain as they accidentally walked over punji traps, detonated mines, etc. By that time my main was in position on the high ground, covering their very limited means of egress with ease.
---
I've never liked my TSE .50 Cal all that much, but let me tell you, being able to hit people with the explosive damage by shooting the wall opposite of the one they are taking cover behind, flushing them out with grenades and covering their only way of escape, and laughing as they try to jump over the edge of the stairway, only to be staggered and killed by explosive heavy fire, was quite entertaining. 
---
Many tried to take my alt and I out. None succeeded. Many super stims / stimpacks / caps were donated and then given to my alt. Had one succeeded, they would have gotten a mere 32 caps from my alt, since I was giving him all of them. Is this a little bullshit? Yes. But I didn't ask for this. I was trying to farm exp and steel to make more ultracite ammo. I accomplished that goal as well - between pvp battles I was clearing West-Tek, Huntersville, and several other areas. I managed to net 105K exp in a few hours, which lead to several level ups. Not bad for a level 330+. Levels are slow at that point. Also pulled in about 3,000 steel from the muties at West-Tek. Only 10K more steel to go and I can use the other mats I've been saving up to craft 100,000 .50 Cal utlracite rounds.
---
All in all , this is the first time I can say I've really had fun in survival mode. The final tally over just shy of 3 hours of farming with some attempts on my alts life:
---
 [https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/387795497693216780/563570939967701021/unknown.png?width=1618&amp;height=911](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/387795497693216780/563570939967701021/unknown.png?width=1618&amp;height=911) 
---
Are you with a group of friends when you run it I’ve had friends leave server and come back to loot queen. But that can also make her body despawn sometimes but not very often
---
1. In my edit, already said my definition may be outdated.
---
2. The next sentence of that is "In general a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-paying peers." but the advantage isn't the same when A. The currency required can be obtained easily in game and B. The non-atom shop version is both better and drops from events in-game.
---
2b. I don't really see how having to navigate menus, inspect an item, then apply the kits will provide any particular advantage. In pvp, the person not stuck in their menu trying to apply the kits would have an advantage.
---
2c. Also totes dependant upon the atom cost for these kits.
---
3. Unless the only real way to repair items is these kits and workbenches are removed or retooled (or the perks are reworked to favor repair kits over perks) then there's no particular advantage here, either.
---
BUT... all that being said, I now see that it's not so simple, and no matter what they backed off their promise to keep things cosmetic. So no amount of my interpretation of all this really lessens people's valid, or even wildly speculative, concerns. I humbly admit my interpretation of things is not the only one, and I'm far too focused on the "win" part of the term.
---
Not lying, just being incredibly cynical/paranoid.
---
Well a refrigerator doesn’t help when you’re out scraping for food . If you don’t carry that refrigerator on you’re back :)
---
This is REALLY not a good look at all, Bethesda.... esp. after promising nothing other than cosmetics in the shop. This is breaking a promise and something advertised as a promise to those of us who would go on to buy the game. Which means false advertising... Not defensible, Bethesda. Not good.  
---
If you don't think tagging someone 15-20 times over a few hours is rude and annoying I don't guess there's much reason to continue this conversation.  If theres 20 posts on this subject 18 of them have tags some multiple times.  It's overkill.
---
And what’s the point of this post? Sorry but nobody cares. 
---
&gt; We read tons of feedback and suggestions from the Fallout 76 community, and Repair Kits were a popular request that we wanted to get into players’ hands. We also felt we could try out something new with these, both in-game and in the Atomic Shop. As we look to the future, we’re exploring ways we can bring other community-driven ideas to the game as well, such as refrigerators for C.A.M.P.s, ammo and food converters, and even the ability to send scrap to your stash without having to head home. Repair Kits are our first attempt at a utility item like this 
---
I think the outrage is less about the repair kits themselves and more that in the same ItV which they announced "pay to repair stuff instead of farming crafting mats" they implied other non-cosmetic-gives-slight-in-game-benefit items are on the way.
---
I have been on Xbox with my brother, but on PS4 I've been solo with randoms, I've also seen it have a shared loot pool and watched people grab everything in front of me which is aweful.
---
I think this is just bethesda testing the waters and it turns out it's toxic.  They shouldn't go down this path because next thing you know it,  you'll be having to buy digital bulk plastic..... can't find that anywhere right now.  Oh wait I need plastic to repair some of my guns....i see what they're doing haha
---
Replaying Fallout 4 for the hell of it and I'm seeing all the hairstyles it has and was wondering why those didn't get added to the game. Quite a few good ones in my opinion. 
---
Maybe I can offer you tips and farming mats to repair your stuff?
---
2 year old account with 2 karma
---
Seems legit
---
Wow I’m on PS4 and never had that happen before 
---
I have, and the damage this does to the game and the burden it posses on new players from entering when there are p2w elements that need to be caught up on are going to be very damaging to the longevity of the game. Not to mention how this shatters any trust anyone can have in the developer when they break promises like this.
---
Cosmetics have proven time and time again to be a perfectly viable thing to sell, whereas p2w has consistently degraded and damaged the viability of a game.
---
I found an albino earlier I could but it wouldn’t go to camp because I already had one. Didn’t see a replace option. 
---
Go to your camp. 
---
Put down 3 foundations in a row. 
---
Put a wall at the end of both of them. 
---
Put an upright connector in both walls as close as you can to the same center. 
---
Now try to connect them using the long connector poles.
---
There is a 99% chance you won't be able to connect them as they will be out of alignment, no matter how careful you were at placing them. 
---
Oh hi! I’ve seen you and your old name on the servers I play on 😊
---
Alright. Iv got an exterminator on his way.

If they do this they will pour a truck load of gasoline onto the smoldering coals of this game’s reputation - along with BSG’s already singed rep as a studio.
---
Anyone who defends this shit. You, yes you - you’re the reason the gaming industry is so fucked. 
---
Go play pigs and stop ruining it for the rest of us. 
---
? did it say tame or pacify?
---
there's two versions of the repair kits, one found in game that gives you a much greater weapon boost, and one that you'll be able to purchase for atoms. 
---
Thank you! :-D
---
Yeah we're Just letting them take us down this slippery slope.  
---
This game is 60 quid. What does that money go towards? If it wasn’t financially viable why make the game in this manner?
---
So what are we supposed to discuss?
---
Did you just say Skyrim 2?
---
Ohhh myyyy lordddd
---
Wow sent you special
---
It happened to me just before I posted this.
---
Congrats 👍
---
$12 real money for a Nuka-Girl outfit is ridiculously expensive. Cosmetics should be cheap. These generally aren't. 
---
Are we gonna tell him?
---
I would prefer Free To Play (with micro transactions) over Fee To Play (with micro transactions), yes.
---
I’d prefer they just stick to their word, even if it means taking a loss for doing a bad job, and trying a re-release at some point when the game is in a good place.
---

---
Voting with your wallet never works because people with more dollars get more votes.
---
Ya, crappy art shouldn't be congratulated. 
---
Already played through those more times than I can count?
---
Lol yeah. Stop bitching about shit like this. You earn atoms in the game therefore it's not technically p2w. Do I condone this atom repair kit thing? No. It's pretty sketchy but at least you can earn atoms.
---
Mine keeps forgetting my last weapon used. Keeps switching to fists. I only use two weapons, a knife and a sniper so it hasn't changed.
---
Yeah, but you take away the time lost from repairing durability and people can upgrade their gear much faster. It's a huge diff. (at least the way it has been explained so far).
---
This? This is the thing that finally does it for you guys? Really?
---
Classy.
---
&gt;You’re supposed to be BETHESDA.
---
I understand the sentiment here of how it is intended, but.... I don't think this amounts to much if ppl remember this company was also on the cutting edge of microtransactions and overcharging DLCs in the early days of it. Horse Armor et all.  I don't want to beat a dead horse but that is what it is.... and that is who they have been before all these other companies were viewed as as predatory and bad.  
---
You're likely right. A reasoned thread with everyone behind it would get solid attention.
---
We're going to shout at them until they backtrack, though. Because fuck EA. This is EA shit, and it has no place here.
---
I don’t think they are bad at all. Who hasn’t had a weapon break during a cray battle and said to themselves “ I wish I could fix this weapon during this battle” so I whole heartedly agree 
---
I also didn’t pay $60 just to access/play Warframe. Warframe also didn’t promise not to do this exact thing.
---
I thought it was gonna be a lunch box, but this is cool too.
---
I see what you are saying but I don't but it. To me,this is a softening of the blow. They start here, with a case like this (still a better one "IN GAME". Then something else comes along and it's as good as the unlockable version "In game". STILL NOT OK. This is the tip of the ice berg. This is the first in what is certain to be a series of terribly detrimental decisions that will represent a "Walking away from the table" .  That would be well and good and all if it weren't for the fact, they found the table, set the table and asked it to be represented at the table. Promises made at the table then later breached are certainly a gesture of bad faith. 
---
&gt; Where do you draw the line?
---
Buying legendaries. Don't really care about anything else. Not that you actually care. If people want to make the game easy and fund Bethesda, go for it. Hardly anything really matters in this game except the feeling of accomplishment. And you can't have that if you just buy stuff. And you can't take it from me just because you have an easier time in the game.
---
 Hello, I do believe I recognise your name, if your character often adorns the Hunter’s Log Coat? 
---
That’s a beautiful base man 
---
Hopefully you apply that same conviction to all aspects of your life. No plastic bags, clothing made in sweatshops, etc.. otherwise you’re just a grandstander. I’m glad you’re not gonna play this game because you sound like the type of person to come complain about every little problem on Reddit, even the ones that are your fault. Still tho that’s a stupid reason not to buy it and seems like you already had your mind mostly made up.
---
Yes this would be a valid argument... if it weren't possible to swap out perks. 
---
I feel like if they’re 50 to 100 atoms it’s gonna be ok since you can easily make that in a day if you work for them. 
---
Real players won't buy them. Brats with dad's credit cards will buy them.
---
Thanks...like I said, props go to Jug on youtube.
---
It’s still beautiful man (: 
---
Naw they see someone else complain and jump on their dick and post because they wack as fuck and unoriginal. 
---
Or finish developing the actual fucking game first. 
---
Sameish. I’ve been waiting till the game was in an actual release worthy state to finally make good on that $120, 0% APR loan I gave BSG on the promise I could actually play a game, not beta test for free.
---
They do this, well, the new Elederscrolls will need seeders I’m sure!
---
Jug is definitely the premier camp builder on YouTube. 
---
You've really got to stop exaggerating.  I say 'rude and annoying' and you hear 'death threats'?
---
Ok.  You're an upset consumer.  We'll use your analogy. The Manager is the one that sets the policy. They created the service you want to complain about.  You're calling the workers every 15 minutes for hours to tell them you're mad.  Tell em but not constantly for hours.  Have you seen the number of tags in today's posts?  Tell the Manager all you want.  Fuck that guy.
---
It is all about dmg calculation, and yes it works just as u described. First it calculates the actual dmg, than factor all the reduced effects and doggy + red perks showing u the full dmg of your hit (grey) than "returning the health" to the opp when all the other modifiers factor in. So be my guest send your "proof" and make a fool of yourself. 
---
*Maintenance* perks, not *repair* perks.
---
I can do my handmade as its my main and i have plenty of 556 to shoot 
---
Like Humming said, I do want to use Chameleon.  It's just hard for me (and admittedly I'm middle-aged so my eyes aren't as great anymore) to deal with the screen flashing.
---
&gt;The game rains atoms from the sky, it's not like they're hard to get for free.  
---
Theres an actual factual cap on how many you can get a week, which means, theres a cap to how many repair kits you can get for "free" in a week too, unless you are paying real money
---
Ther terk errr jerrbs!
---
From the way they worded it, it sounded like they will be an unlock so you can craft them. Which puts people who don't have them at a direct disadvantage. That is a problem that should not be condoned.
---
People just feel a need to vent thier frustration, just as you are doing. It's part of human nature to display thier emotions and share thoughts with others. This isnt a new phenomenon. 
---
The hardest part was putting two large water purifiers inside.
---
So, I’m right, but you’re going to ignore my opinion because...you think shouting at a wall will be productive?
---
BETHESDA PLEASE DONT DO THIS
---
It’s blatant PTW.  
---
If a person can pay to do this instead of grind like everyone else, it’s pay to win. Small or big, it’s PTW.
---
First Unstoppables happened, they gauged the outrage and said fuck it lets up the ante.
---
Now it’s no longer limited to a weeklong advantage, it’s a payable permanent and on the run advantage.
---
The power relay station east of watoga has a junk pile and a deathclaw, if you’re looking for material, black t and experience.
---
Plus it’s proximity to the vendors and SBQ is hard to beat.
---
I wish I could upvote this 1000x times lol 
---
I know I'm not a professional artist, but I am getting better and here to have fun of course. ^_^
---
Not bad! Needs more creepy smile though 
---
So you saw all the posts and thought you would get yourself free karma. How dare you attempt to take away my repair kits, if I want to buy them I will! You have no right to tell someone how live. Bet you my boots are older then you and no they aren't messed up they are nice boots I've taken care of all these years.
---
If they implement a non cosmetic in the atom shop, they are going back in their word. Full Stop.
---
You are fucking up Rouxgravy
---
They think they will pick up enough whales to support this hahahahaha
---
They're not bad, or pay to win by any stretch of the word... But they're still non-cosmetic. I really hope Bethesda reconsiders making them a part of the Atom Store.
---
Excellent use of the "hidden eye" definitely draws us in as witnesses/ participants in the grisly murder. 
---
I'll try harder at drawing him, and I'll make sure he has his devilish smile. &gt;:3
---
I think I may have seen it on Grahm.
---
Yes I saw that about mirelurks south of Watoga, but I've had no luck with that.  Mirelurks seem to give all sorts of diseases depending on the type of mirelurk, but Jelly Fingers doesn't appear to be one of them so far.
---
I’m excited to name my anti armor explosive dragon...still brainstorming some good ones. As for stuff I’m selling I’ll probably just shorten the names to make them easier for trade and differentiate them from my stash of legendaries “TSE Handmade +1 Per” for example instead of the super long name that doesn’t explain all the attributes. I’m mostly excited to name my power armor chassis’.
---
Why is everyone missing this?
---
If you use a repair kit *you don’t have to farm for the materials” it is #not a portable workbench.
---
Why does this matter though,  there are a billion weapon shops in the wastelands,  including those of the player builds.  
---
Although,  it would be nice to get a new weapon shop skin. Kits are cool, if I was bethesda, I woulda introduced in-game mobile repair kits that fix 50 %, with a timer, maybe 1.5 seconds , then introduced a craftable bundle for 1500 atoms
---
I see where your coming from but if we breed a negative light on something like this before its actually implemented and before we can see first hand how it works and if its actually bad or not will breed nothing but bad attitude in the community further perpetuating negative emotions towards this game we need to wait until we can see this and then we as the players can give our feedback and show them that we either like or don't like it
---
Or it could be like those stupid posters where instead of finding one at a train station you can get it from the atom shop. It has not shown up in the stop so no one knows the full details but oh the whining. But but caps are super important or we wouldn't have fifty threads a day about how horrible it is spending 40 caps to fast travel to an event and the event is over oh the humanity
---
My first ever scorchbeast queen attempt ended in most of my weapons broken and the ones that werent i ran out of ammo for so I had to leave cus we werent gonna kill it.  
---
So yeah I know what your saying
---
If you’re going through 3 rifle conditions on a SBQ you’re doing perks waaaaay wrong. 
---
How close do I need to be for that?  
---
I know that adding a silencer to a gun reduces it's range, and pistols already have pretty low range
---
I understand. 
---
My concern isn’t for adults, it’s for younger “kids” that get sucked into Bethesda quest for revenue. Because that’s exactly what this is. A way to get more $ from the game. Not to sound too cynical, but the community has debugged fo76 for the last 4.5 months and now that the game is reasonably playable, they are monetizing it. Good for them if they can get away with it, but Bethesda lied about pay for play. 
---
Party on...
---
Borderline pay to win items?
---
I’m sure they’ll be in game craftable too, ESO has the same thing, get repair kits to the point your offloading them all the time or buy from the store. Considering the amount of free atoms we get, I’m sure it’ll be fine
---
It's just the start that's the problem.
---
I’m sorry to hear that 
---
I will gladly support the Enclave my fellow American. 
---
Come on guys, I keep reading the “this is a great game and I love it” or “I don’t know why people were mad or gave such negative reviews”
---
I’m gonna need more popcorn
---
get a brain yourself, dude
---
If it's not cosmetic, and it gives you an advantage in the game by spending real money, what do you classify it as if not pay to win? Pay to convenience is also mobile game tactics.
---
Thanks I just want it to be lootable.
---
I’m glad I can use the naming to add flair to the selling. A 3⭐️ double sawed off barrel called the Mad Max Special just sounds better when selling. 
---
So much this. Once you learn how to play this game repairs aren't a problem.
---
Prepare your karma, for it shall be taken by the Bethesda white knights!
---
I know what they are, duh. I’m specifically saying I don’t know what you’re referring to.
---
“even what’s left of the community”, you mean.
---
Next step guns.
---
Ah yes,  the don’t buy them argument is a popular one today.  
---
and is that supposed to be sone sort of dis?  Assume im younger than you because you dont like what I have to say?   If I were to guess by your username,  youre wrong.
---
Yeah. I think that people are more likely to listen when you sit down calmly and explain why something is bad.
---
This isn't that time, though. The first pay to play advantage, no matter how small it is, is the bridge to far... but they know that. It's why they said they'd only have cosmetics in the store. This is about the community having a round of catharsis.
---
People are going to shout themselves hoarse and (hopefully) Bethesda will listen. It's not the most efficient way, but it's what's going to happen here.
---
Bethesda understood costmic items don't support a game alone and Fortnite only able to do so as it was a major hit. And whats your problem with letting me support the game? You going to be donating to Bethesda or what? If you don't like it don't buy it simple as that and if you don't have the cash for it then get a job or ask your mom/dad for bigger allowance.
---
slap isn't needed, but its the markers on the map, ridiculous ease of acquiring ammo, along with the fully automatic explosive weapons that just make you think why even bother with this unfair soon-to-be-pay-to-win mess of great potential
---
New item they are introducing in the next patch per the most recent news update. They want to put in repair kits so you can fix broken items by spending real money.
---
you can fuck right off nancy
---
Yeah, people on here are so quick to make posts about something they know so little about. :(
---
I just figure it's karma whoring. There's no reason to have 70+ individual posts about one specific item on a patch *announcement.* Not even an actual patch.
---
Uh you were definitely twisting his words and I have no idea how you could think you werent.
---
Why is it a big deal,  when I was a low level,  higher levels were just throwing me guns.  Seems to me everyone has an  over abundance of weaponry.  Guns busted,  Just throw it away haha
---
At least someone on here can see some reason &lt;3
---
I’m not a rich kid and I use 1/4 of my 200% condition of a single rifle with only 1 luck of the draw perk, and besides with all the free and easy atoms earned in game it won’t be hard get the atom shop kits for free 
---
Maybe everything is not about you, you, and what you like. If you’re a high level. You’d almost appreciate the idea of repair kits. Maybe you didn’t fight that Level 80 Scorchbeast and your Grognak Axe broke in the middle of combat. Well I did and I can see the point of an instant fix for broken weapons. Period 
---
Just curious, how do you feel about it?
---
To me its entirely optional, and doesn't pose any real tactical advantage. Spec'd out Gun nut and weapon artisan perks make their proposed weapon repair kits pretty much moot. Workbenches are everywhere... unless they get "patched" out. Especially if you travel with more than one decent weapon.
---
I get the slippery slope argument though. I'd rather see weapon/armor skins, and camp items in the A-Shop. 
---
Wep kits are presumably just an existing box model and a few lines of code made on someone's lunch break. Kinda makes sense only if you wanna make money... which I get, but come on, you can keep promises, AND make money, AND make people happy by sticking to cosmetics. 
---
It's like they had a board meeting, "well Godd, things are going good, we're starting to rebuild some good will from our shitty launch". Then Godd replied, "Nah fuck all that, i made some code in 15 minutes that will make us MILLIONS". 
---
"But sir thats FU-" 
---
"KNEEL BEFORE YOUR TODD!!!"
---
Yah with my style of play and perks I do not really ever need to repair my gear often at all. BUT that doesn't mean that the way these perks work now and item durability rates will stay the same as they are now.... with these new kits, they can always add in "extra rebalancing" with excuses for serving the PvP gameplay. I've seen stuff like this all the time in mobile games.
---
Say someone is grinding for a gun. They are having a really hard time getting it. Someone else comes by and kills them with that gun because instead of getting it by playing, they paid money to get it immediately.
---
May 7th. It appears to be part of a new questline.
---
[It's on their roadmap](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/3WheBXLAEMvTMFH70ejA9x/c38119dfaf0c67a3434df05b7d76d2c6/Fallout76_RoadMap_1920x1080_WildAppalachia-05-EN.png).
---
The game didn’t help the game at launch...
---
or you can play for a few hours, do some challenges and unlock them with the Atoms that you earn from PLAYING THE GAME.
---
I don’t think people understand they aren’t something you’re going to be using all of the time either. Most people are just going to repair to 200% and be good. The repair kit is for when you’re in that new 4 player dungeon, your gun breaks, and you remember that kit you got off the SBQ last night. 
---
Upvoted! I like my conduit for when I want to have an unfinished house vibe, or wires for when I want that look too, but a wall with a power connector on the outside that creates a fusebox on the inside I can connect to would be a dream.
---
Mr. Pebbles finally getting the recognition he deserves. You truly are doing the lord's work
---
Trust me, when we let things like this go live, they will add more and more stuffs into the atom shop that's not cosmetic; EVEN IF no one buy em (right now)... but eventually people will buy them (later).
---
This time; repair kit.
---
Next time, refrigerator kit = no more food spoiling.
---
and next time, workbench kit = you can scrap all your junk anywhere, everywhere.
---
and next next time, stash box kit = you can store all your junk anywhere, everywhere.
---
and next next next time, account share stash box = an extra stash box to share with all your characters.
---
and next next next next time, ammo converter = turn your unused ammo into another ammo type.
---
Things will get worse from that point, etc. That's why it NEEDS TO STOP here.
---
TLDR it's a slippery slope;  You said that if we allow A to happen, then Z will eventually happen too, therefore A should not happen in the first place.
---
Looks like they were just testing
---
The waters.
---
Give an inch and the suits will demand they try for a mile.
---
They mentioned refrigerators in the inside the vault. They are coming along with ammo converters. They were mentioned under a headline about the atom store.
---
Yep, watch your back out there.  I usually wait to do workshops until it's so late that it's almost morning, and only on off days like Monday or Sunday nights.  It helps that I work weekends and have Mon/Tues off guaranteed.
---
Less people to compete with.  LoL

---
may 7th but brewying was delayed by a day and player vending by a month so its not certain.
---
The game was a complete failure. And not just on reddit. The thing that many people fail to understand is that while places like reddit and game forums are filled with the loudest and most opinionated people, there are also influencers: youtubers, games journalists, and other values community members that are themselves influenced by the communities. This then leads them to use their influence to affect the more casual consumer, those people who rely on reviews, and videos to make purchasing decisions. When you have influencers condemning a game the consumers listen. 
---
The game was doomed before it even released because of influencers. The games launch was in no way caused by any community, and was entirely Bethesda's failure to deliver that doomed the game. The poor launch was then compounded by the bag controversy and ensuing PR dumpster fire, and the extprtionary prices of cosmetic items in the game (18 dollars for an in game skin is absurd). 
---
The fact is consumers can vote with our wallets, and if the dedicated fans can convince influencers to promote an idea, then the mainstream consumers will follow. We've seen it time and time again, and we will continue to do it because it works. The decline of AAA games and the rise of indie juggernauts, with a team dedicated to their fans and consumer, with the failures of the recent Call of Duty games(ghosts, infinite warfare, and ww2), Battlefield 5, and Anthem, and the massive success of Fortnite pave the way for a new future of games that are guided by the comunity not decreed from on high. While you may call it toxic, we see it as the best, most effective way to get games that we want to love to a place we can love them.
---
i want to help but your GT says you arent online
---
Perk card packs - I was fully expecting these to be sold for Atoms after playing the "beta". Surprisingly, they are not (yet). This isn't a big deal as far as I can tell because of the SPECIAL cap of 56 total points.
---
Aesthetics of character a.k.a. "the Doll Effect". Using CBBE or Fusion Girl/Superhero Body (depending on character gender) among other 'body mods' to taste, \*far\* more hair colors and styles, tattoos and eye augmentations/colors were all things I was expecting to see. As an M-rated game there is a shocking lack of skin showing, let alone other adult activities that don't (normally) involve two+ consenting adults and a bedroom. Characters can't smoke cigars and cigarettes. We don't see people swigging their beer and hooch. 
---
I was surprised to not have the option to have our FO4 characters (aesthetics, some/all XP converted to 76's XP chart = pick SPECIAL array and level-derived cards, then acquire level-derived perk card packs at the appropriate location in Vault 76; exit with otherwise a normal 'cherry' Vault 76 character - optionally include plans/recipes knowledge from 4's logs of chems/food cooked et al) awaken after arising from partying a bit too hard celebrating their completion of rigorous simulation training. Very high level converted characters start at 50th plus 'legendary abilities' as appropriate. 
---
RE: model used for justification is, bluntly, managerial hubris with its accompanying rolls-downhill effects. Best guesstimate is that they are tasked with generating ##$$ in a given time frame (monthly, quarterly are most common followed by annually). As you rightly point out, microtransactions succeed best when they're perceived as worth a buck or two, maybe five for something pretty danged awesome. However ... there's the microtransaction-laden app-games that rake in cash buy the bucketloads that feature a variety of items and packages scaling from 50 cents or a dollar up to as high as $100 for a VERY sweet bundle relative to that game. 
---
For $100 my converted FO4 character better keep her full SPECIAL, level, total # of perks and no small amount of her stuff in addition to a \*massively\* expanded stash limit. Game balance be damned, that kind of money is five to ten FULL-sized DLC's. 
---
yes absolutely ridiculous, game balance isn't a priority it seems. I feel like whoever is in charge of the survival rules has never played a multiplayer game in his/her life let alone this one.
---
People here sure didn’t help, either.
---
You don't have to spend money to get them though, so its not pay to win, since there is a non paying option to purchase them.
---
Have you played the game? Did you receive Atoms from playing the game? Yes..Yes you did.
---
You're not being FORCED to pay real money, how on earth is it pay to win.
---
Someone sold a 3* Bowie knife at one of the vendors..it was actually a pretty good legendary and it was only 43 caps..I bought it instantly..saving it for the vendor 
---
Nice with the garbage they already tossed at use they are shoving this down are throats. 
---
I think a realistic thing they could do within their own marketing scope this month is to add the explorers long coat outfit, a handmade skin, various camp and emote stuff and a clean chrome rev sword OFFICER’S CUTLASS retexture (similar to what they did with the combat knife).
---
Bethesda needs to know that them doing real work and giving people what they want instead of very occasionally giving people stuff a select few would think is cool would generate like three or four times more revenue.. 
---
Bethesda! Release those items and I swear I, and a lot of people will buy them!
---
But it’s not what should happen, and it’s no more effective than what should happen. As I’ve said repeatedly, the *only* difference it makes is that it results in people leaving this subreddit to avoid being inundated with posts about the same concern.

First off they said they got the idea from player comments they've received. I am not saying we are the end all be all of discussion boards for this game, but considering we have 3 Beth employees that hand around here all the time I'd say we rank up there as a go to source for player input. That being said I can't recall a single post in here that has ever asked for repair kits and I lurk the shit out of this sub everyday. 
---
Something is seriously fishy about this and the fact that Inside the Vault was like "YAY we are totally doing what you guys asked isn't it cool? Yea you guys totally asked for this and a bunch of other stuff to be added to the shop like refrigerators and ammo converters! You guys totally asked us to add those to the shop remember?" 
---
Yea we asked for that stuff to be put in the game. Not the shop. We asked for it to be put in game because these things are pay to win items not cosmetic if put in the shop. 
---
Unsub.
---
I found a biocommMesh robot chest piece level 50. It says it has a chem duration of 50. What does 50 mean? How long is 50?
---
Funny thing is it said pacify twice I’m pretty sure. 
---
I’ll go try again. Mine is gone now. 
---
Unfortunately, once this cat is out of the bag, you can't put it back. (Once a thing begins generating revenue, you don't take it off the market).  
---
I really think the only way to address it is now. If their promise to this player community was cosmetic only. They need to answer about this. That is the very least they could do in courtesy after the rapport they worked so hard to build. 
---
Had we started there, before it was "called out" in this manner, we could have avoided the negative light that just got cast.. Here.. This post now IS that negative light.  I understand you are calling for calm and a little patience and acceptance to diffuse this negative light. Just remember the light was finally flowing at its brightest. We didn't dim it. OP just noticed it got dark and said "Hey, what's with that shadow over there?  Just asking the relevant questions and raising relevant concerns.  I mean, it kind of feels like his concern really just became the shared concerns. Indicating loop's reaction to be a natural one based on a near missed revalqtion.
---
Too late.
---
I'll stop when the problem is solved.
---
Not playing apparently.
---
So, if its available in the atom shop, with currency that can be easily earned in game, then everyone,  including you, will have access to it. I've played less than 450 hours since launch and have about 4500 atoms currently and have spent almost double that on various items. Most challenges take very little time to complete. This whole thing would be non-existent if they weren't selling atoms for cash. But because they are, it's now become pay to win. If this is that big of a deal then perhaps you shouldn't be playing online games.
---
Show me an mmo that the dev's didnt promise something then broke that promise. Which, by the way, isnt a binding contract and thus you won't get a refund for it.
---
Then we better scrap camo skins it’s a cosmetic that gives an advantage by blending into the brush 
---
I said this earlier, but they should be in- game, repair it, but not fully, maybe incorporate a wait time on it for going mobile with repair.
---
Also,  they should coincide this with some fresh craftable workshop skins. A bundle for 1500 or 2000
---
“Complete failure”.
---
Then please, go away. Why are you STILL here? Bethesda is not holding you here.
---
Those people who have actually been enjoying the game really don’t need you!
---
Your toxic, karma farming minority have done ansolutely nothing but spew bile. All your “most effective way to get games we want to love” is entirely at the expense of people who disagree with you. 
---
YOU DO NOT REPRESENT ALL GAMERS.
---
I’d be shocked if the core toxic spammers here even represent one percent of the community.
---
I’ve yet to meet a single player in game who shared your delusions.
---
This game needs real constuctive feedback and not your ultimatum karma farming spam.
---
Great another post by someone farming for Karma, congrats you got the same people whos thumps up the last 20 as well as this one. This is nothing major, if you have a job you would have money to buy these atomic shop repair kits or you can just farm them so stop your crying and read the full article next time.
---
It’s pay to win I agree 
---
I provided you two helmets, both constructed at 200% with 25 INT. One to scrap to learn to make them, and one to wear. Enjoy!
---
$19.95 in the atom shop 
---
You know I did those all in like a five minute timespan long before your posts and that you telling me to stop won't do anything, right?
---
I've got 600 lbs on my mule that's all 1 and 2 stars, and might as well save it all right? 
---
Level 74, 81, 63, 50, and 6. (Look I like leveling characters okay?)
---
Even if it’s just plans, I do not appreciate Bethesda going back on their word and selling a repair kit for atoms.Regardless of how many atoms it may be (unless it’s **always** free, in which case just make it unlocked at a workbench),  and how easy they could be to get, it breaks the promise of cosmetics only in the shop and adds a P2W element. Especially since you can’t trade or sell them. 
---
Xbox?
---
no matter the hp its principle and 15 hp is life or death. 1hp is life or death.
---
you obviously dont minmax in any of your games and there is no degree of wrong here. This is not sort of pay to win, its just pay to win and stupid and wrong. Whoever is making these decisions hasn't played a multiplayer game before, fairness isn't a priority, they don't know much about multiplayer games. S
---
Should have asked Zenimax to help.
---
I don't think anyone's saying they don't want repair kits, they just don't want them *in the Atomic Shop*. That's a key factor here. Craftable in game or even as rare loot is a whole other matter and if they'd stuck with that I doubt you'd see anyone gripe.
---
Didn't do a search on it. Sue me.
---
But your just bitching just for the point of bitching. It’s not that big of a deal. You act like Bethesda raped your mom 😂
---
Exactly. They are full of shit for releasing that statement initially. 
---
So many posts saying “it’s nbd”. I don’t get how people can afford their ignorance and shortsighted behaviors.
---
What did they add
---
Beth gets a cut from every sale you make 
---
How is buying a repair kit P2W? 
---
That's what I feel most of us are yelling about, your line of "true" pay-to-win. I'm with you that these repair kits themselves are not something that will effect me based on my play style, but it can very easily become a slippery slope to things like you suggested. I would rather us try to stop it now before it snowballs into something that none of us want.
---
And this is why they’re trying to release pay to win items
---
To incentivize those that will spend to spend more
---
those improved repair kits are going to be EXCEEDINGLY rare so there's a reason to buy the basic repair kits.
---
Wtf I have to wait another months to pay for something that shouldn’t be been in the game from the beginning?
---
It gives you the materials too
---
It’s not just a time saver
---
I use one luck of the draw and fix my rifle couple times a week maintenance cards aren’t always needed 
---
Yeah let’s just accept it! Please make more non cosmetic items to cheapen the game!!’ /s this is ridiculous. Why are you ok with this?
---
but they still require materials. the repair kits don't from what I've heard.
---
No, it's called being smart. Someone's fucking with your shit? Problem solve and figure it out. Dont complain. Learn. Idiots.
---
It's the same, man. Bethesda are selling things that directly influence life or death situations.
---
 Repair kits can probably be quick-slotted and used mid combat to repair DR anytime. For people who's invested in white knight lucky break etc can now free up those points, furthering their competitive advantage should they wish to pay.
---
Sure its not going to be a huge effect but in any given death situation you don't want to be left thinking that the size of your wallet could have changed the outcome. That is the core of why fair multiplayer gamers **hate P2W**
---
Huh? But that would still require the repair perk to reach 200% in the first place. Nobody runs around with repair perk. The repair kit, as described, would only repair the base 100% so it's still netting zero advantage. It wouldn't change anything about equipping repair kit or having free deck slots. 
---
Two principles were initiated with the announcement of real money buying stuff that has in-game effects. 
---
1. Liar's promise - we were promised that no such items would be sold via the Atoms shop, ever. The introduction of repair kits as announced breaks that promise.
---
2. Slippery slope - presuming that the PR backlash does not thwart the decision to sell repair kits for real money, should the sales of same prove sufficient it starts the snowball rolling downhill. Next its buying special Atoms-only ammunition. Then Atoms-only apparel, armor, weaponry and power armor. Then character upgrades. Somewhere in all of this mess $5 (or whatever) gets you 25k bottle caps, no questions asked! 
---
The effects of 2 are easily extrapolated... 
---
people complain about their gear breaking in the silos and SBQ and now there is a new "raid" coming out as well.
---
how is it not p2w?
---
Heck, I wouldn't even mind if they started selling ammo for Atoms. It's really no big deal.
---
Hahaha! I laughed so hard at this! I love the phrasing you used
---
From my experience for any of the quests that have you do that if you kill the mob in one hit you don’t get credit. 
---
An economist with passing interest in game monetization schemes.
---
Agreed.
---
Juicehead is pretty well known for getting information wrong, not researching for his videos beyond Reddit and generally being ignorant of the modding community. And honestly - I totally agree, and it's not just Juice... Youtubers are more than happy to inflate problems or put gas on fires if it means they generate more income.   
---
People really have to learn to take youtube with a grain of salt - Afterall, as the old saying goes.   
---
'**Believe** Nothing **You Hear**, and **Only** One **Half** That **You** See'  
---
On the topic of the repair kits, it's definitely not pay to win - If anything it's 'pay for convenience'. But overall, I still don't like it and would rather items of that nature go into the game itself rather than wind up on the atom shop. It's definitely not as big an issue as it's made out to be, but it has some worrying implications.
---
resources. the perks require materials. from what I've heard and read, the kits negate the need for repair materials. Now you don't even need to be carrying junk.
---
N-no? Bitching to bitch would be not taking action. Some of us actually submit feedback through proper channels via forums, emails, etc. 
---
I’m here to explain the reasoning behind it. It’s like PETA. They’re all for saving animals, but they kill how many exactly? It’s a contradiction to the goals set forth and told to the community.
---
My next drop is gonna be on Lewisburg/Uncanny Caverns just because I want to see what it's like.

A few days ago someone nuked Watoga proper, pretty uneventful.  I thought maybe the high school would be loaded with glowing ones, but I ran through it and found a single glowing mutant hound and literally nothing more.  
---
The Camden Park area is another one I want to check out.
---
Change it up, 90% of nukes are on The Whitespring or Fissure Prime, gets repetitive after a while.  
---
..... Ok so Hmmm let me go try taping them. Will fists work?
---
 You want to run around the ash heap. Mole miners, mutants, and scorched. You won't get much 44 but the others you will. For 44... munitions factory or make it yourself. 
---
The problem isn't disagreement, it's the spreading of misinformation and the way youtubers generally go out of their way to over-inflate issues for profit.
---
Well, OP, you might not think all Raiders are pathetic, but I do. I absolutely do. These are the people who say, "Hurr, it's in the game" to defend trolling and then turn around and cry about getting killed in Survival mode. God, the day Survival mode opened the floodgate of tears was hilarious. Because the truth is -- Raiders suck and are nothing more than bullies who enjoy causing mental anguish in people who are weaker than themselves. Raiders deserve each other in Survival mode. They are the number one reason why I support existing characters moving to Survival servers. I wish they could be server-locked there forever.
---
The pacifist C.A.M.P. protection is a planned and promised feature, but it has not yet been implemented. It's the last critical PvE feature I'm waiting for before picking up the game again where I left off...at level 2.
---
I have a huge backlog because I bargain shop for games. Typically, I spend $5-$10 for highly rated games. They simply are a few years old. There's no reason at all why I would put up with griefing in FO76 when I could happily play 20 other games instead. After the grief-free pacifist option is fully implemented, FO76 will become one of those "happily play" games. I enjoy building, and I absolutely would not appreciate having hours of my work destroyed in minutes for no good reason. I won't tolerate it, won't even risk it. While I wait, I can keep building in peace in FO4.
---
Buy salt lining for your carry weight in the atom shop!
---
What lv are you cuz you need to be double its lv in order to tame it trust me I've been testing with the tameable animals/ beast and you need to be at least double its lv. Let me give you an example: I'm lv 99 and I find a tameable glowing diseased wild mongrel that's lv 50 can tame it cuz you need to be double its lv. I've tried it on deathclaws, megasloths everything (even snallygasters [yes they can be tamed you must equip both animal friend lv3 and wasteland whisper lv3] and yao guai) 
---
The camp on the lead deposit didn’t work for you? I have crazy amounts of lead from that and I just make sure to always pick up steel. 
---
System might help
---
In my case I had to 'server hop' to get it to work.
---
After that the first mob I slapped fulfilled the objective.
---
Its really ur own fault by expecting anything different from a company like bethesda.
---
They dont care. They use shit anti piracy programs that they know are annoying and buggy but they simply dont cared in the past.
---
What do you expect ? Why would they care now ? Just as long the sales are there they simply do not care.
---
This is a fair point, thank you.
---
Will you have a similar tone when they add weapons and ammo to the shop? Because if we follow this trend it will be here sooner than later, bruh
---
The problem is
---
No perk cards effect it...
---
It’s usable, but it will never be *worth* using persé
---
Yeah, makes sense now.
---
Sorry. Ps4. Didn't get that into the title as I had intended
---
Intrested to know this as well. What perks do they scale with if any?
---
You think Bethesda can survive on those positive vibes your sending to them because in the real world they don't supply the company the funds to constantly make DLC for you. Also good for you since folks like you are literally just spamming the reddit with these trash threads, a voice is heard but this is the equivalent of screaming and throwing a tantrum which is a childish thing to do will hopefully be ignored.
---
well that just mean you had both animal friend and wasteland whisperer on you dont need both just animal friend
---
But what’s it prove though? Only person losing is you. No one else. You can’t do a call to arms every time something happens you don’t agree with. But you have the choice to quit playing. So quit and be done with it. Peace out 
---
how? alright, I'll explain it to you. How do you repair items in combat currently? materials and being lucky enough to be near a weapon or armor workbench. The repair kits do not use materials for repair and they do not require a workbench. To put this in terms that most will understand, what do you do when that Two Shot Explosive gun you use exclusively breaks on you? take cover and toss a repair kit on it. Within seconds, you've got your weapon back to 100% or higher with absolutely no material cost.
---
I've been defending this game since launch, and this is not something I'm going to condone Bethesda doing.
---
just remember dont play aigan a single cent to this company.
---
I haven’t tried punching them lol. I just stealthed and popped with a low level gun. 
---
I personally don’t care, not gonna stop me from playing, I’ve got 40k rounds full be explosive sniper guns unyielding sentinel gear, the only thing I want is more stuff to do, and would gladly pay more for it, never have a broken gun repairs a couple times a week and levers are cheap to fix
---
Old is old, no matter how old it is. Let go and stop trying to control everything. You are not knowledgeable. Know that. 
---
:(
---
Repair to win what? Mr Prizebot paying you a visit because your armor ain't breaking?
---
If I'm on the run because I'm in the lead in PvP and i have brought a repair kit to fix my weapons and armour now I dont have to go back to a area that has the risc of people to collect the junk and use workbenches 
---
So you tell me who has the advantage the person spending money or the person collecting junk and using workbenches 
---
Open your eyes this is only the start gaming companies are known for doing this and it is a very dirty practice 
---
I haven't played the game since November, and will continue to not play it. The problem is that some people can look past what is shoveled to them by game developers, and see what the game could have been. By looking at games in the past, and present it's easy to see how many "successful" games do not live up to the quality they could. 
---
Now many people will defend with the excuse that "making games is hard" I've sure heard that excuse made by Destiny developers before, but that doesn't change the fact that the final product is what should be judged, in a vacuum, and by most standards the game is a failure. I dare you to look at the games sales vs Fallout 4, 3, or NV. Then look at the review score of those same games. The problem is that 76 does not live up to the standards set by those other games. 
---
Another example is Battlefield. When the Dice told consumers not to buy the product if we didn't agree with it, we didn't. Compare the sales of BF 5 to BF one, 4 or 3. You will see that the game sold poorly. And no dont just look at net sales. Of course any older game would sell more than a newer game, they've been out longer, but look at the sales at the same time in each games life cycle.
---
You can enjoy your substandard game, while there are people who want to see change. If you are ok with spending $60-100 on a game, then turning around and spending even more on that same game, then by all means do so, but some people are simply not ok with it, and we try to change things.
---
What are you winning? All it's doing is saving time so you don't have to go back to you base so often. It's not giving you an advantage over other players. It's not a magic "victory" purchase. You don't even have to buy it. I won't be, but I'm not going to complain about something that I can spend atoms I earn for free on.
---
Meh lame. I guess I’ll keep it in the stash for now. If they ever get perks this thing is gonna be a beast. 
---
I just need to find another one now. Iv got both perks maxed out and I’m lv 130. 
---
Go to FO76 and look at the top/hot posts. There’s literally 30+ posts flooded in here with a metric assload of support. Hundreds/thousands of upvotes total. 
---
And as a consumer, yes, yes we can. We can call to arms on EVERYTHING if we want. If we stop buying, ships sink. If we stop playing, ships sink. Individuals are nothing, you are correct. But when you have a large part of a player base that says “woah this shouldn’t be a thing”, and then ACT, the money listens. 
---
I love fo76, and I’m not gonna quit playing because of a P2W implementation, but they won’t see anything from my wallet.
---
Also another thing to point out is that it has to spawn alone in a designated random spawn location.
---
I agree it needs more 'life'. I can wander around for quite a while in the woods there and not really see much of anything. Snallygasters and Wendigo hoards should be all over the place.
---
Had it on PC a few weeks ago. It happens.
---
Given we cant get a refund for the game, our only recourse is to stop playing. So is this what we are all going to quit over? We can kill whats left of the game to make a point i suppose. 
---
ah here we go, come u/BethesdaGameStudios. keep your word. I am ok with it just been cosmetics, but now you are giving to give some ppl advantage that I for one wont have. dont make it pay to win, or that will be the moment I put the game down. 
---
I have been loyal and stuck with you, when a lot ppl turned their backs on you, but im telling you if you make this amazing game Pay to Win im done with FO76. 
---
Slippery slope is not a fallacy. It's basic human nature. People (especially businesses) think "Wow, I got away with that? I wonder how far I can push this".  Bethesda literally says in their post that there is more of this to come, and it sounded like much requested things like refrigerators would be that. First it was the Unstoppables boost, now this, what's next? It's not a fallacy, it's happening.

---
Yup. I jump by southern lookout and the miners monument. 
---
i know this wont get much attention, but i feel for all of us on this topic. 
---
Bethesda, please dont go for pay for convenience. Its the same as pay to win in a majority of user ideas. 
---
i want nothing more than for this game to iron out these issues and just be an amazing game.
---
dont.
---
do.
---
this.
---
They are adding repair kits you can buy with real money.
---
And if we want these servers running there’s gonna have to be a continuous flow of money coming in, what’ll happen when its no longer financially viable to have the game running they’ll shut it down, Bethesda is run by investors and the stock market if there’s no money being made those investors will pull out
---
Bethesda shoukd stick to what they said they would do. But there is a spectrum to what we could get.
---
Worst case - expensive and only in the store no way to obtain in game.
---
I hope they sell the plan to craft them in the atom store for say 200 atoms. And then anyone willing to roll a new toon will have acess to them on a character forever. Im very okay with the second option. But not so much the first
---
This is good.
---
I was definitely coming at this as a "This one specific thing isn't *that bad,* right?" As opposed to a more "slippery slope" type idea. Thank you for the insight.
---
I didn't see a minor utility item as that bad, but definitely if they let it go into a bad state where they start putting special armors or weapons in the Shop, that would be worrying.
---
And for sure it does hurt the casual player. To get slightly off topic, that's the reason why I defended the Two Shot nerf. When you have weapons that can do double damage, you're creating a new baseline where anyone without it is left in the dust, because you're only dealing half the damage as the others. So if you can't or don't do those grinds to get the TS weapons, you're shit outta luck. Again, a bit off topic since here we're dealing with the extra layer of having cash in the mix, but a similar idea.
---
I get you, and I appreciate you being eloquent and taking the time to rationalize your opinions.
---
You DO realize that you don't get infinite atoms when you're doing challenges right? You get a limited amount that run out really quickly and you're reduced down to the daily trickle. So they are less free than you think they are. Stop trying to defend a massive corporation that only sees you as a dollar sign.
---
Raider Power Armor repaired to 200% with Tesla Coils on the torso.
---
Why? 
---
Because I play for me and my enjoyment and dont give a rat's ass what others do in the  game. If they need to spend alot of real world money to gain an advantage in a video game then they are idiots. And that advantage is what? Being able to make something to fix something? And they are spending money to buy something that I took 45 minutes to earn that same ingame currency and do the same thing if I chose. 
---
If the only way to get atoms was buy them with real money then ok, P2W. But, it's not. So how is it pay 2 win if you can accomplish the same thing without spending a dime.
---
If you're so unhappy with the game why are you still playing? 
---
FOR REAL. The game literally throws fucking atoms at you. I just find this so hilarious because a majority of the people bitching are probably 100+ you’re telling me you have no atoms? I have a fucking pimp crib, I’m level 28 and have almost 20 Dollars in atoms. 
---
This spin-foil bullshit is hilarious. 
---
Ah ok also check big b rest stop follow the highway and the random spawn is right under the bridge. Personally that's the one I've gotten the most deathclaws to spawn 
---
Oh wow another 50th post about whining about atom shop. Either you doing this for the free karma or you don't have a job. Simple tip, get a job and be an adult then you can buy repair kits or you can just farm it the old fashion way both can be done so choose one and quit throwing tantrums on reddit with all these posts literally about the same thing.
---
And of course you haven't encountered anyone who doesn't enjoy the game, we've all left. Some people are not content with the experience in a game, and move on. The problem is you believe that voices are the only way to get evidence. Most people who you encounter in Fallout 76 enjoy the game, because everyone who doesn't has already quit playing. If you want entirely unbiased evidence, simply look at the numbers. 
---
And to address your comments about karma. Look at my account, and tell me about my karma farming. I have maybe 10 karma, and that's because I dont post, and when I do it's to say something I think is beneficial, or to ask a question. I dont care about invisible internet points.
---
It is also entirely hypocrisy to make generalizations about a section of the comunity, while also accusing them of making generalizations.
---
So you actively post your opinion, which by your own admission is completely lacking first person experience because you claim you haven’t played. 
---
You think you are not only absolutely correct and there’s no possibility you aren’t; which means everyone actively playing who doesn’t agree with you are somehow all incorrect...
---
But you ALSO think you have some kind of insight to provide, when you both don’t play the game and don’t like it. Yet, your opinion should be spammed across the board. 
---
Really?
---
IT STARTS WITH REPAIR KITS. IT WILL HET WORSE. I ENJOY THE GAME. I DONT WANT THEM TO RUIN IT. 
---
F
---
New from the vault says they are adding non cosmetic repair kits to the atom shop next patch, and looking into future items like a fridge for food or ammo converter - along with some really weird Beto O’rourke nonsense sounding speak about how it’s because of the community, or something...
---
when your guns/armor breaks in a raid or boss battle things tend to be tougher, even if you dont have to abandon the run to start with. suddenly being able to repair them during a battle for some atoms is pay to win. it may not cross the line to you, but it does to me. It is annoying because I defended the game when they did the unstoppable event that gave extra health for a week.
---
maybe it could be off set somewhat if players that spent the atoms could sell the kits to other since caps are just about worthless in the game, be even then you would have some people with an income stream unavailable to others who dont.
---
Your repair kit isn't going to help you if the whole server is trying to murder you to death. You earn atoms all the time for free. Would you complain if they made it a craft item? That would be even more broken than you suggested. At least with buying with atoms you are limited by the amount of atoms you get. If they were craft items, I could go to adventure, craft a few dozen, then go back to survival. 
---
No worries at all, just wanted to make sure you knew it was a "known issue".   
---
Bethesda's official known issues list is a little smaller than mine ;)
---
What if your asked to hold a probably duped items but your 5-10 people removed from the duper of 100-200k of a specific type of ammo (or different types of various ammo accounting for 100k) for someone to drop for their mule character? 
---
And then they give you some. I had someone give me like (idk the specific numbers but feel like it was) 50k to 100k each shotgun shells and ultrasite shells, 5mm, .50 cal. After I helped them move stuff to their other characters. Dropped in a bag. Then me dropping it back to them and then they dropped me some to keep. Again not sure how much but they had millions. Like 15 friends I met the day before. And this was before the January banning and well before 30 days of the feb ban that I got hit with. 
---
I wrote Bethesda 5 times with a ticket and even called them. The help desk guy said they had my ticket gave me a ref number which I lost but didn’t matter because my acct says I have no open tickets ever. Just a ban notice. 
---
And then before the update of the in February that got me banned I panicked and dropped all my shit that was stupid that I can remember on my main play character (I didn’t check all my 3 mules but they had stuff way long than 30 days of the January notice) I kept like 15-20k of shotgun shells &amp; 5mm, .50 cal like 8k I did keep like 20k ultrasite shotgun shells I think? But dropped like 80k maybe? Idk maybe a lot less I don’t know. I even sold my favorite guns to a vendor and bought them all back because I knew 2se shootguns are all duped. 
---
Played 2 more days after the update then I get the “error can’t connect to sever or what”  ban notice. 
---
Now I probably made 50-60k of 5mm &amp; .50 cal legitimately in the last 30 days shotgun maybe 1000 and maybe 700-1k ultracite .50 cal&amp;5mm ammo. During the last 30 days or longer on top of my questionable ammo. 
---
Now I have also dropped huge amounts of bullets to friends and randos for past 45 days or longer. Guns too. Help swap miles for ppl etc. non of them got banned and had similar numbers. I played with the same guy almost 95%of the time since I got the game, we got all the same stuff from same ppl. He even got stuff like dropped vault store powersuits to him  paint jobs to him. 
---
Still playing. I have a friend that has 5 accts with one named “wunnadupe” and 5000-100k of the same armor and guns not one of his accts got banned. (He says he never duped idk but I know he traded with duper’s) 
---
I don’t know if shorobi on ps4 got banned or not but he was a huge trader that just gave stuff away for free like 3*2se guns. I know from a friend that also knows Shirobi that he said they duped together on DL to exchange items they didn’t already have. He said he they both duped liked 10 of each thing to keep it simple and my friend gave each of the closets friends a gun. 
---
Whatever if I know or didn’t know if it was duped or not, I never duped knowingly(I had 2or 3 powersuits dupe somehow and lost them trying to get someone to mod them and I moved my camp when it was underattack and stuff I know was damage or destroyed like my mister showed back up without damage when I broke down my old camp items to make a new one) 
---
That was it. Never duped yes took question shit everyone did. But I got banned for what idk and still banned which means they haven’t fixed the duping glitch or the duper’s would be unbanned.
---
And I have a plenty of friends with questionable shit still playing that don’t understand why I got banned or why they didn’t get banned also. 
---
I know people with shit tons more than me still playing.  I even dropped stuff that worried me before the update. Which that in it self could have got me banned if I had like 100k of an ammo or ammos totaling over 100k together dropped or moved around to different ppl or mules. 
---
The help desk guy at Bethesda didn’t give me hard details but his voice made it sound like they knew they hit ppl that didn’t deserve it, but oops sorry you just told us to you took questionable shit, so you confessed to the crime. 
---
Smfh sorry for the long boring self serving rant that is probably a few months delayed. But I got on recently after the great applattaca update and deleting the game and resign it after a friend that was banned to and he did dupe said he got on played for a day then got banned the next day. I still got the error screen. Friends with 5 accts 20 mules and each with 10-100k of the rarest shit in the game still playing on all accts. 
---
I’m sorry this is bullshit. I had 700 hours or more on the game. Made great friends that I can’t play with now. Shit they don’t even play it because they don’t have ppl they like on it now. 
---
So my bad my blunder Bethesda, I didn’t cheat the way you did me. Also I think they made duping possible knowing they needed to increase items with bad drop rates and planned on nerfing 2se guns after having them so OP to get people to trade other bloodied, vampire whatever for them or drop them to be lost making them more rare to have more 2se guns in players inventory. 
---
Apparently they still haven’t fixed the glitch. So they sold a broke game knowing the problems and asked people to play the game the way is was intended to be played if it worked correctly. Stupid. I grinded the game to play with friends on a broken game longer than I should have with boring content to play with friends and the allure of what the game could be in the future if I wasn’t lied too when I bought the game based on all the info that was horse shit wasn’t there.  If I played the way it was intended to I probably would have quit because it sucked grinding with jack shit to show for it. 
---
If I had bought the canvas bag bundle I would send it back to them full of dog shit. Atleast I have the illusion of playing the game in the future again and it adding new content and maybe being actually decent. I could have bought that EA hot box of shit next after the ban and got stuck with a truly fucking hot mess with anthem, or last few 3-5 battle fields, or Cods. 
---
I think in general everyone should calm down with the hyperbole. But keep talking about it. Someone will wake up tomorrow with a full inbox of complaints and realize "well I fucked up". The community mods here have to write reports on the general mood of the community. /u/ladyevann if you are listening. And if P2 repair has negative feedback... yeah someone is going to notice.
---
Will they care? I think the release of the roadmap and relative responsiveness of the devs to bug fixing points to yes, they care, and listen. To a point, but they do listen.
---
You just didnt want the game and now want internet points. Youre missing out on a fun game that is imroving every update
---
Give it up dude and just go play new vegas or something. Bethesda’s management killed fallout.
---
Others won't be able to see the names you hive your items. At least for now.
---
Blade 
---
It goes to some weapon, possibly knuckles. It adds blades either way
---
I've been buying every 2 star berserkers whatever golf club and 3 star mutant slayer garbage board I see.  They weigh nothing and are less than 50 caps, I find at least a few every Watoga session.  Worst case is I end up with a bunch of badass  golf clubs and boards; best case I can cash the stars in to use on whatever I want.  
---
1 star Vampire's Handmade?  Had to go, 22 lbs.  2 star lvl 40 Assassins Explosive LMG, 13 lbs, Exterminators Explosive Single Action, 6 lbs.?  Keeping them for the chance that you need to turn in an effect to have a chance at it, the only explosives I have I'd get rid of.
---
We don't know how it will work, but banking stars along with covering all the effects seems to me to be the best strategy.  I should make a mule.
---
People want repair kits. They just don’t want them to be buyable for money
---
for? if it is for a tire iron it turns it into sort of an axe.
---
should show you on the left how the stats change.
---
I would prefer not to be fucked by Bethesda yet again, but here we are.
---
I have been a fallout fan for years, and I have played FO76 from day 1, and I have givng them time to fix their mess and I am still here but the day the make the game P2W im on done with FO76 and wont be buying anymore bethesda games at lunch or at all. 
---
how many different titles are you going to spam this under?
---
I know. Hence why I said it. 
---
We can all agree on that
---
Tried guns and melee no bet its been two days now and cant xomplete this
---
Maybe fun to play around with but like the guy above said. No perks affect it. I would rather use my 10mm or pipe pistol. 
---
Sure, this is also catering to the complaints about the atom shops selections as well. 
---
Itd bring the money that they'd hope for with the repair kits 
---
So add the repair kits in the base game and add costumes to the shop like how it's always supposed to have been. I can't be the only one that'd go for the older gear. 
---
Its been 2 days and many servers and it looks stuck
---
I do believe you are misinterpreting my opinion. I am simply asking you to take another perspective, and look at the facts. I have played the game. And found it lacking. I have seen the sales figures, and I have seen the PR struggles. Weather you like it or not public appearance matters, and if you look like shit, you will be treated like shit.
---
People might not stop playing, but I'm one of those patient gamers waiting for the game to be worth playing to me. Stuff like being promised mods would still be a thing before the game was released, but still being a year away, if ever. Mods would be able to fix 99% of the problems that everyone has but they keep moving towards a system of only curated paid mods. 
---
Did you crouch? Make sure your not in danger. 
---
Yet another fool helping them achieve there goals
---
If you do some simple inventory and condition management you won't have a broken item issue anyway. I have 600 plus hours in the game and I don't remember the last time a gun or armor actually broke. 
---
I apologize. I have issues with coming up with titles. This is the one that will get left up!
---
Yes I crouched got the bonus damage for sneak attack
---
Also Grafton Steel, just north of Morgantown, spawns a bunch of mid level Super Muties(lots of 308 and gunpowder) plus its connected to a Workshop that has a lead node and 2 steel making machines.
---
And shouting does not get your point across. And based on your line of thinking let's just put God weapons and armor in the game now. Or better yet let's let people mod 76 like they do 4.
---
Omg they're going to ruin the game but I'm gonna keep playing and feeding back into the very system I'm complaining about.
---
Survival is pvp mode. Adventure is pve mode. Period.
---
and we should, screw that Bethesda dont turn into EA
---
I've never really had a problem with ammo. I use 10mm shotgun and 45s. All super easy to pick up from enemies. Grab yourself ammosmith and super duper and you can craft tons of ammo. As for 5.56, hit all the places with Super Mutants. They drop a ton. WesTek and that Steakhouse place is guaranteed muties. I collect 5.56 until I reach 1000 then dump it at the train station. 
---
It is in a nuke zone.
---
For players surviving in power armor, you must exit said power armor to repair anything.
---
This can be detrimental to you in a radiated nuke zone.
---
With paid repair kits, there’s no need to exit the armor or find a bench. You can continue to grind without the risk. This is directly a competitive advantage. Other players lacking the kits,  possibly have to leave “the horde” in order to find a bench or safely exit their armor. 
---
What does it _sound_ like it does?
---
eso already has loot crates...
---
Damn! I'm sorry to hear that...
---
I don't really have any further insight on this except that maybe is time to open a support ticket?
---
That's all I did. Didn't even leave the area to go back. 
---
Lol user name relating to wastelanders is kinda out the window, my typical day:

---
That’s it you will hear from my attorney 😂. Naw man it’s cool. I just always see that every time about them phantom Sheepsquatch attacks even when I hardly visit the subreddit. Now ya know 
---
"Oh you want the R91 from fallout 3? Psch, its just a re-skin of the current assault rifle and costs 20 bucks" 
---
Yeah fuck that. How about a paid gold/rainbow paint for my new R91 instead? A lot of these fallout weapons take 10 seconds to port the model over from a previous game  and reconfigure damage stats. Literally less than an hour of work for like one person. If they charge money for something like that... I'm uninstalling and advocating others do the same.
---
But we aren't there yet. I think waters are just being tested to see if they can make more money. So boil the waters yall!
---
I get that while there are a thousand people repeating the same opinion that you want to be the one who fights for the uncommon opinion in this instance and that’s fine for sticking to your guns but here’s a few things to consider. 
---
1) p2w doesn’t have to involve actual winning. It’s a term used to cover any purchase that gives a player an advantage in a player versus situation.
---
2) Being able to repair your strongest weapon on the go isn’t something that will happen to everyone in PvP but in Survival it is something you’d hold onto by virtue of being survival
---
3) Carrying a repair kit can negate the need for backup weapons. Why carry 20 pounds of guns when you can carry your main and a few repair kits. 
---
4) it’s very possible that these repair kits won’t require materials. If that’s true, then it’s an obvious incentive to simply skip searching for materials and just buy an immediate repair. 
---
5) this isn’t the first time. It’s the second. The test of the waters was making Unstoppables outfits from the atom shop give extra health to players per unique outfit. It was temporary and everyone said that it shouldn’t be worried about because of it. Repair kits world be permanent. Which opens the door for more items
---
6) Almost every game that has applied little creeps into backtracking on cosmetic only has gone full p2w eventually. Even RDRO which promised cosmetic only was full blown P2W at the launch of its shop. I understand you’d like to think it means nothing. But the developer promised us a shop that had no impact on gameplay aside from cosmetics. Repair kits impact your gameplay even if it’s not someone else’s. That’s more than enough to be upset about. Developers will do whatever they please when they aren’t held accountable 
---
"Hate it" vs. "Don't really mind" is not being split. People who just don't care may as well not exist in the equation. I certainly haven't seen anyone who WANTS it.
---
Stop following the herd. Explain how it's pay to win.
---
Knowing is half the battle
---
I know, in the same boat, played for about a week after launch. Wasnt enjoying the pvp and bugs. Came back on recently to a great community and a whole bunch of factions and history i didnt even know took place while i was gone and the games taken off for itself, dont ruin it now.
---
They are rare drops, you obviously didn’t read the notes at all and your clearly going off what someone else wrote. Quit being a sheep.
---
Yes sir. I can’t wait to kill me a Sheepsquatch in a few days though. I’m pretty hyped 
---
Not sure how much you love your camp but you can always build something to reach it. Unless it's really really high up.
---
I’ve got so much junk I have an alt just to collect my overflowing junk
---
That could work but I’m fine with it staying put
---
i was wondering when it would turn into pay to win..game ruined
---
True story
---
K and whats this for? Pretty sure all the posts r directed at Bethseda. If u dont like it no one is making you read them.
---
The fact is the devs lied to us and told us only cosmetic items.
---
A repair kit is not cosmetic! 
---
Definition of bladed
---
: having a blade or blades —often used in combination 
---
It’s not pay to win when you can buy anything you want from the atom shop from the challenges in game👍🏼
---
This is the third post about the fridge. Got any source for that? 
---
No but it sounds good. Was there an event going on ?
---
Only 10%
---
That's what I'm saying. I go through about 1000 rounds on a gatling with my friend at queen with the perks right. Probably faster with the lmg but I'm too cheap to craft the ammo. I think the problem is more pebkac, a lot of them don't even know about aa.
---
It's like, pay to have a little tiny perk that's pretty dumb anyways since it's just one more thing to take up inventory space.
---
Really though, if this finances future big content then please sell repair kits to dumbasses. The game is already ridiculous easy already when it comes to PVE and repair kits have zero benefit to PVP.
---
But most importantly, I made a really funny topic on r/fallout76 not k owing what was up and now no one is gonna see it cause every single fucking post is Russian scammers trying to create drama.
---
Where to find one?
---
because if you spend money/atoms  ..you now have an advantage over other players..my gun broke i cant repair it right now..your gun broke you can repair it right now..you have a gun i dont..and im guessing a repair kit is just the start
---
I’d but atoms if I could get stuff for much cheaper
---
That’s me 😊 
---
Where u get it?
---
Hey, you copied my posts for this topic! I'm suing for copyright infringement.
---
Ask Shoes here, he'll tell ya.
---
They need that dick riding Fallout 76 hate karma 😂
---
The first time I explored west Tek, it was an assload of super mutants. Like more than just being the birth place of super mutants in Appalachia, I used at least ten plasma grenades in that fight with my teammate using a twoshot handmade, it was a rough fight but nice pile of loot after the dust cleared 
---
Folks want their voices heard. If someone feels like they need to post about something who r u to tell them not to.
---
I have a perk that repairs my guns and armor to 200% health and I prepare myself before I head out. You spend money on 2 repair kits while I keep going. I call that pay2lose.
---
The past few weeks she's been golden for me finally. No idea why. Maybe level, weapons or luck. Either way, I've been killing it lately with drops. Finally hit 150 and the change from 100 is huge. Don't know what to make of it honestly. I was so depressed not getting anything good but I'm on the up and up now and it feels awesome. 
---
Really glad I didn't pick up this game, been hearing nothing but bad news
---
As an hommage to Evil Dead my shotgun will be called "BOOMSTICK"
---
Use a jet pack to get to it and initiate the transfer menu to get into before you float back down
---
You're lucky to have gotten even one. I have been playing since BETA and have participated in at least 100 SBQ fights and I have only seen one serum recipe drop for me. 
---
BTW. We killed her three times tonight. 
---
It's been less than a day dude chill
---
I would if I had one
---
I would imagine repair kits would fall under the misc tab so it wouldn’t drop on death. Even if it was under aid. You cannot drop atomic shop items. 
---
You have to power attack in the crouch. I was stuck for a few days on the same thing, but it was rum.
---
Oh yes they will be duped, but not for $$. 
---
or customize the clothes we do find at least enough so we all don't keep looking like a bunch of clones. 
---
It’s a great game, we’re just picky on them keeping their word is all. 
---
Also with all us raiders being thrown into a single server setting, I think a lot of us got out that pent up aggression 😂 I’m stuck on building now.
---
What??
---
I havent tried that hold on
---
We're gonna slaughter them back into extinction :)
---
Don't bring logic to reddit but have an upvote anyhoo
---
Same, I have had him show up 6 or 7 times now and he never insults me.  Just follows me yelling "Halt". 
---
Uhhhh. No
---
I don't think you know how contracts work
---
If you feel Bethesda has ruined something, fine. Don't play anymore. I've learned not to bother defending something to people who don't care to even try it, or ignored what the game was advertised and talked about as. This one misstep by a popular company does not make them EA or Activision. 
---
Thats how a legendary works. You put it down to 50 percent or so, it mutates, fully regens health and gets some increased armor. Its not always necessarily the game.
---
By having those perks you're an exception to the rule. 
---
Doesn't change the fact that they said it would be for cosmetic use only 
---
Doesn't change the fact that your perks can be nerfed to make the kits more appealing 
---
Doesn't change the fact that it offers a possible advantage over a player that doesn't have the perks. 
---
Its pay to win
---
Before being a dick read the actual inside the vault. Basic repair kits will only be accessible through the atom shop. Improved repair kits are rare drops. I'm talking about basic repair kits in the post. Quit being a dick.
---

---
You’d better have a chainsaw 
---
The one promise I hope they don't break is that of custom servers and modding, if we get those, it makes the whole system a moot point, which is why I'm worried they won't let us have that freedom, I'm worried they will use the creation club... 
---
Let’s guess here. Where do you think the final part of the map you will confront one. I kinda think the Mire. Because the forest is low level. But I found a cave in the forest that looked like a dwelling and had skeletons and bones everywhere. It looked like one of the star points on the road map video. 
---
There are several mods that are named with very vague terms. My buddy still can't figure out what the .44 reciever mod plans he read are for. 
---
It works, I tried everything too went through like 5 bottles.
---
Yep! Me too, until I kill him. Lol
---
I think lots of people knew about it, but you managed to actually get the facts which I found really helpful :)
---
Shake it Baaby
---
Wanna dance?
---
Opinions vary.
---
Never saw him for like 400+ hours until yesterday, same thing, was really confused 
---
I just power attacked with a bone club and I power attacked with a pistol the quest still says land a sneak attack
---
Also, try facebook and discord for friendly groups.
---
Blackberry juice is easy and can make bunch.
---
If this actually happens I'm going to have no other choice but to make a lengthy post of why I'm quitting for the 3rd time. C'mon Bethesda! I paid full price, I'm entitled to get my money's worth despite 700 hours logged!!!!!!
---
You god damned heretics. Our Lord and Savior and only true god The Moth Man demands more lamps.
---
True, but repair kit isn't gonna do much in of itself in that regard. Seems like a QoL kinda thing. Fixing it in the field. I could see doing them BUT anything that gives actual power etc is a hard no-go. No xp boosts, special boosts, weapons, armor (excluding pure vanity) etc. These ammo whatever they called it doesnt seem a good idea. Although i dont see the harm in the kits, I'd actually rather them, the apparent fridge that was mentioned and anything like them should be locked behind a quest instead via atoms. We all can grind atoms but seems a better idea to have them earned through gameplay. Repair kit PLAN may be only thing like this acceptable in shop albeit not the best way to implement them
---
Repair kit intensifies
---
Yeah I spent a boatload of money in DotA 2, everything was just so cheap. I really can't justify spending 15 bucks on a power armor skin. $3 sure but any more no thanks
---
New guns? Almost certainly. No idea when we'll get them, though.
---
bro i was thinking about this exact same thing earlier 
---
In stealth? That's the only thing that worked for me. I tried everything, used a combat knife if it helps any.
---
On my main plus my mule I am quickly approaching 200 3*items for trade with the purveyor.
---
You say as you clog up the feed with a repair kit comment lmao 
---
I agree with this guy even though sometimes I somewhat disagree with the argument of repair packs. But everyone has a right to post whatever
---
We should just show our disconsent with this move and maybe if were lucky they gonna see that this is not what the community wishes for
---
Just tried that and yeah cause im getting the stealth bonus
---
I’ve already read it and made 0 assumptions or speculations. The kits aren’t pay to win if you can farm better versions of them quit cryin.
---
For real though. I for sure thought it was the atom shop 
---
The issue isn't repaired kits, the issue is Bethesda sold a bug filled game and had the community debug it for them. Bethesda either knew his game was of poor quality and released it anyhow, or they didn't, which is worse. PVP is more of the same.  The community saved Bethesda maybe $ millions in design and debugging costs. Now that they are going back on their no ”pay for play” pledge to increase revenue. If you reward a behavior you will get more of that behavior. 
---
Pffft, such a stupid reason to throw a bitch fit. "I have to install a lightweight game launcher that's totally free so I can play a game I want?! Oh the humanity!" Personally I'm more than fine with splitting my library among different launchers. With how shitty Valve's customer service can be I'd rather not have all my eggs in their basket. Plus, Valve has had a monopoly on digital downloads for far too long. Epic's got the clout to actually give them a run for their money. 
---
Hey Preston, it’s me again. Funny stumbling into you again. 
---
We love Fallout, we just want what we, as a collective, think is best for the game.
---
**And for Bethesda to keep their word.**
---
That and eat lots of honey sugar bombs nuke cherry even gumdrops
---
It's always been Atomic Shop. Mandela effect?
---
So? Why does this game have to have them too... They promised us they wouldnt do this...
---
Man you should of and video taped t as a flock of people came to the massacre, it would of been hilarious.
---
Stuff they’ve added last four weeks has been great.  
---
They arent out yet but this is just the beginning of the greed
---
As far as I know that only boosts AP regen. My regen is already pretty good as is, I'm just trying to boost the size of my AP bar
---
I’m just on roll tonight. I haven’t participated in a week or so 😂
---
Maybe, but I sincerely think it used to be the Atom Shop. Like I even remember the text on the main menu being different, could be wrong though. 
---
I don't think this is clear enough, maybe give me another example, but in French /s
---
Well said! Great points!
---
You and everyone that thumbs uped this are 100% part of the problem
---
Heavy leather because it is cheap and easy to make
---
awww
---
I was stuck on that too for a couple days. I did buy that bottle of rum from the vendor at whiteprings my last try though. Who knows, all I know is the power attack worked.
---
I dont grind for junk and usually have to much.
---
QUIT THE GAME YOU MONKEYS YOURE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF 
---
Don't just complain here, go to Twitter where more people will see it. That will raise more alarms for Bethesda than Reddit.
---
I got 2 serum recipes from the queen, one each the very first 2 times I fought her... then nothing ever since despite 20+ attempts :( 
---
Repair kits in the Atom shop seem less like P2W and more of P2bW (Pay 2 b weaker).
---
Omg I wish I would have had time. I had thought about leaving the post up to see if people would still join a survival server for friggin lemonade. And I was right next to tanagra town too so having the deathclaw/mega sloth/fog crawler in the area spawn over and over while people blew each other away faster than they can get lemonade or fight off the beasts. Next time, I promise I will haha
---
Simular here, since beta almost everyday, hundreds of queen fights and NO serum recipe drops
---
Tuu shay
---
If only Juicehead had actually made that cookbook he promised lol..
---
I forget which specific foods give you AP boosts but I’m pretty sure soft shell mirelurk meat when cooked is one of them. Anything that boosts agility will give you more AP as well, so catmeat steaks and agility bobble heads will work. Other than that make sure to play instruments to get your 25% AP regent buff.
---
we can all have weapons at 200%
---
just saying it doesn't surprise me.  i don't rely on their promises, even though i did expect vending to come out next month....lol
---
I've seen a suggestion for it, but it had 0 mention of the Atom shop. That wasn't on anyone's radar because that *isn't what we were told it was for*.
---
Ya the community is the problem....Not the devs who completely mislead us. I have been a fallout fan for years. I have played rpg games for years. MMO mobile. You name it, I prolly done it. This is a tactic that is a slippery scope.
---
Anyone else play eso when they added the xp scrolls? Its like they repeating history again. 🙈
---
Disregarding my account age I’m still trying to get the hang of reddit(only used it for maybe the last 60 days). I made it and forgot about it. Now that fallouts been a thing I’ve been trying to once more, talk to people. 
---
Platform?
---
Meh, they approved it a few months ago, but they have since changed their minds. Nothing is forever, not even pleasure hammers, I guess. TBH...CorgiDanceParty111 is kind of hilarious (as long as you are able to change it to something edgy of your choice again soon).
---
PS4. My bad
---
Ok, so it's not an advantage against you in your eyes (despite it still being an advantage against you because you still need a workbench to repair anything). But what about newbies? Are you really going to ignore how unfair it is towards people that don't have the money to make another Bethesda account to store their scrap. Nevermind the fact that you buying another account indicates you're the exact type of player they're trying to market to.
---
Seems like lots of players referred to it as the atom shop last year: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9tug3n/full_atom_shop_item_list_and_pricing/
---
I'm not seeing the problem here. They took your name and made it better for you
---
Just buy an Atom shop skin for every weapon. Can't drop or scrap or sell. Bethesda has a solution for everything in the Atom shop!
---
they can do what they want. i'm still not buying this game.
---
Daytripper!!! Give me that luck bonus! 
---
at leats the other post have porpuse, and now I ask you what is the porpuse of your post. you say we sound like cray babies, but did you look how your post looks. you do look like a cry baby as well lol. 
---
and if you dont like that we are coming together for the same issue, then skip the post and dont read them, but dont bash us for something we clearly dont want. 
---
It's a teaser
---
Just gonna cast my vote for the argument of this being the start of a slippery slope in the contents of the Atom Shop, as well as a blatant disregard of previous promises and be on my way. Up/down vote at your discretion.
---
Oh I see. I'm not sure what increases ap size. I know eagle eyes is negative on ap. Then the perks like action boy do regen too. There maybe a food that does it, wouldn't be surprised.
---
I know it’s called the Atomic shop but what do you spend there? Atoms. Hence the atom shop. Plus it’s two less letters. Seeing as we keep shortening words as is. 
---
Don't have Facebook... Whats discord?
---
I mean I'm guilty of calling it the Atom Shop as well but the official name is Atomic Shop. At this point we're boiled down to semantics lol
---
Every single super mutant on the outside was a no star legendary  for me yesterday, this was also in survival mode. No legendaries inside tho sadly.
---
You can stay on this subreddit for hours reading, agreeing/disagreeing, and talking shit. Well HaloGuy you’re cool in my book. If we disagree or not. You handle yourself like you have a brain and seeking information and answers rather than having all the answers. I can respect that. 
---
Can you blame us? 
---
I play survival on a new character and most high level players avoid killing me and I avoid killing them. Sometimes I get mowed down by a lv200 looking to get my 24 caps, but that's just how it goes. Most of the time it's fine
---
For the low price of 100 atoms all the post can go away.
---
So funny always seeing the same buyers at all the main stores
---
Even if they add a thousand of pay2win items, i'd just play as long as i'm enjoying the game.
---
If sometime the pay2win annoys me i just stop playing and that's it.
---
If you really can't deal with it, quit the game and play one of the thousand other games. For me, i'd try metro.
---
You wouldn't beat a dead horse if you had bought that Horse Armor. See?
---
it was merely a hint at what they might be willing to do. Not really news-worthy at the time, but a little more relevant now that they're going further into the idea.
---
Something like that would make the most sense,  basically especially with the Mire not being traveled as much in Survival
---
Yessss Nuka World assets please Bethesda. So easy you wouldn’t even need to redesign them!
---
Its 23 out of 25 now. They have to realize this was a terrible idea.
---
Voicing concerns about anti consumer practices isn't whining, some posts I'll admit aren't, well, they lack manners at times but there are actual genuine complaints in there. Also I feel you missed the point of them if you have felt you've had to slug through them all, they aren't complaining about not being able to afford them, they're complaining about how using money you can get items like that, and if everyone didn't midn this, we'd end up with a Bethesda ea scenario, the new anthem as it were. If your in this reddit, I can tell you care about fallout on some level, wouldn't hurt to show a little support into ensuring better business practices from our favourite franchises 
---
I am not going to get into a bigger dick competition with you about who has played fallout longer nor am I going to tell you that DEVELOPERS have nothing to do with the setup, management, or processing of micro transactions nor what will be going onto said micro trans shop.  I will say that yes, the community IS the problem because we allow these big companies to get away with that slippery slope shit just enough that they keep shoveling it to us...if it were really in as dire shape as it is made out to be than the community would rally.
---
And this is coming from a fromer hardcore Battlefield fanboy and Orignial SWBF nerd turned sour protestor after EA had their way with it
---
I get it, but in order to get it, you gotta get it from every angle, not just you own
---
Is it different cosmetically? I have it but I always thought it was just a normal hunting rifle 
---
you miss that they were saying it was the principle of selling things that weren't strictly cosmetic after saying they wouldn't that Wilford had an issue with, not necessarily that it specifically gave a little HP bonus.
---
Reddit pulled a real big sneaky on me. 
---
Just got booted in a nuke. That I already become Acclimated to. 
---
What platform
---
Blade + bladed
---
=bladed blade 
---
Legit. If each item was about 500 or less atoms I would drop a dollar here and there.
---
Honestly I think there will be five spots like that star on the map. That spans across all areas. And if the mission is repeatable. It could always be one of those spots. Think about that for a second. 
---
You made 1 point that wasn’t a hypothetical or what-if scenario. Why can your opinion be valid, but not other people’s that want them?
---
“People asked for them”, but I didn’t so that must be everybody, right?
---
I guess it's good that's never happened to me.
---
Just thought I'd post something that had nothing to do with all the anger
---
AAE Pipe rifle master race with Gunsmith 5 and Plumber 3. Also benefits from rifle and pistol perks. (Don't tell Bethesda)

Well get out there big boy and fight the good fight. And its not my “own”, its the community opinion.

A sootly Assaultron behind the Watoga super duper mart. 
---
Although I kind of agree with the naysayers on this one particular issue I also agree they're blowing it out of proportion. It won't effect anyone past a certain level, which is why I offered to repair gear for lower levels if they get stuck. Help them save atoms for the cool stuff and lighten my stash, win/win.
---
3 locations you want, 
---
1.lucky hole mine you'll find around 14 lead nodes giving 3 ore each. You'll walk out with over 100 lead
---
2. Charleston fire department, in a wieghtroom is 64 lead
---
3. Monorail station (north west of lucky hole mine) go up the elevator and walk all the way through the train to its front end, you'll find 80 lead via weights.
---
These respawn every 24hrs, your issue will no longer be lack of lead, it will be lack of steal. Get the scrapper perk run through Huntersville and loot the assault rifles off the muties and deconstruct them for 15 steel each.
---
Cheers. 
---
Don't hoard materials in the begining. choose perk card that lower the weight of items instead of adding carry capacity. In the long run it will be more advantageous. 
---
again writing to write, 
---
and for the looks off it dude you need to smoke, it was not my intention to get you all worked up.
---
but no im not on a high horse and I do not get mad when someone talks agaisnt weed everyone has thier own opinions, and like you said no one cares that I smoke weed, just like I dont care what you have to say thats all and have a good day. 
---
I’m a past it at this point. Devs will do what their told. Either you keep playing and spend monies or don’t. Or just don’t play at all. I’m getting my investment out the game. 
---
I hard crash about once week only when something really going on. I crashed last week because some pinhead was mass creating and selling civil war hats in Watoga. 
---
People need to step away from their consoles and take some deep breaths.  They aren't coming for your power armor.  They are merely trying to sustain a franchise.
---
it really is
---
it is an appeal to emotion through fear
---
there is plenty wrong with what bethesda is doing, why bother creating some future possible parade of imaginary horribles that may never happen when you can criticize the things they are actually doing?
---
breaking promises
---
Yes it's been pushed back to May 7th.

4 weeks after the Shear Terror patch.

---
Fortnite made ungodly amounts of money on just cosmetics. They are going to make millions when the four horsemen PA paints drop. I just don't see why this is necessary. Cosmetics sell as well as QOL items without being P2W. 
---
I think the idea is if they make a big enough stink about this that Bethesda will decide it's worth it to just roll back the idea.
---
Your opinion is valid. It’s called persuasive argument. The best way to convince someone else is to make a clear argument even if it’s designed to be suggestive. It’s not my way of staying opinion as fact, but as trying to convince others to see things differently. You are free to express your opinion in any manner you see fit. That is what makes a constructive debate
---
When I saw it in her inventory I just about lost my mind, I was starting to believe them dropping on her was a myth. 
---
Farm the Wood Mill waaaaay up north in the upper left hand corner of the map. Low level mutants tons of bullets and mats. These guys are plentiful and easy to kill. Definitely invest in the bullet scrounger perk (can't remember it's name)  as it makes ammo cans produce way more ammo when looting.
---
Ugh, really? 
---
I'm glad they don't want to release broken features, but SERIOUSLY?
---
I mean anything can be in the atomic shop and buying it is a choice. I don’t go to the grocery store and bitch because they have black olives. Some people like them but I hate them motherfuckers because they tase like shit. 
---
I figured, lmao. And thanks. Seriously the best way to learn is to say someone’s wrong about something. Or jump into a debate about stuff you don’t know shit about and hastily research petty points. 
---
But honestly, shit talkers are the ones who make us think and go the extra mile to read/research on stuff. Without y’all, and myself at times, we’d all be airheaded bigots with too much ego and not enough care.  &lt;3
---
4 uny + 1 cham
---
Full expecting (and have no hard feelings) about down votes.  People are seriously...serious...about their passions.  And micromanaging every single inch of their hobby -- as if they own stock in Bethesda.  
---
But those types of fans make a product/personality eternal.  So good for Bethesda. 
---
I find ultra light better, also means if you don't have it quipped say you were in power armour, it still is ultra light, it is also better for storing in your stash too, takes up way less space, hope it helps! 
---
If you are doing a stealth build then you should be using weapons with suppressors.

it's (hopefully) unlikely, but look at how they've nerfed XP over time. They COULD do it. We will have to see.
---
I run pretty much every mutation with class freak, full unyielding sentinel gear and a be lever and be gauss still tweaking my perks adding bloody mess but use all rifle cards demo expert and all damage resist cards I hit over 500 per shot and it can go higher on perks and chems

Looks like it isn't just me...lol

Renaming my canned dogfood to how it really tastes. 
---
How are they at a disadvantage? Does it not increase your stats as usual? The Improved kits are said to increase beyond 100%
---
Is it fear when it's happened more often than not in the industry? I think not.
---
Is it fear when Bethesda themselves have already pushed us halfway down the journey from their horse armor to their paid mods to the unstoppables bonus and now to this? I think not.
---
I just know better. I know what they're up to, and it's not ok.
---
Source? 
---
The **issue** here is two-fold - either (i) drop rates and quantities on certain ammo types is too low on some and too high on others and/or (ii) there is no ability to scrap or sell ammo in the game, both of which should have been right at launch.
---
The **problem** here is Bethesda charging what's left of its loyal player base for the very ideas they suggested to improve the QoL of their 'service based' game less than 6 months after it (badly) launched - expecially since a proportion of those players will already have paid $60 to access and test the game early and provided such feedback.
---
Either way it's a poor decision stemming from poor game design from a developer bereft of ideas and direction who now desperately looks like they are trying to turn players into payers. The only way they will get the message if is the Atom Shop generates no revenue. Use only Atoms earned in game or don't play it at all.
---
hopefully enough to have them decide NOT to do this.
---
... yeah, I'm gonna take you seriously. 
---
1 piece of chameleon is enough.  I go unyielding for the reasons you mentioned.  Also Luck helps build crits faster.  A side benefit is strength.   You'll be pretty sneaky and can clear lesser mobs with a bloodied melee pretty quickly, saving on ammo.  Carry weight bonus is nice too. 
---
I ditched healing factor.  You're nearly dead most of the time, so taking a few hits will typically end you, and if they dont a diluted stimpack should do the trick.  The chem reduction wasn't worth it imo. 
---
We don't need to grind anymore for black titanium or ballastic armor or screws etc. We can buy a repair kit. We don't need to grind for perks Gunsmith, Weapon Aritsan etc. anymore. We can just buy repair kits! 
---
So Beth basically said you can pay not to grind 😊 but isn't that the part of Fallout lore? The grind, exploring the map. They cheat themselves actually for folks that don't grind and explore and spend time in the game, less immersion, less money.
---
$ - How about a food kit where I don't need to eat and drink every 5 minutes! 250 atoms each!
---
$ - Stimpack kits! Bulk of 10 for 1250 atoms!
---
I could go on 😂 
---
You people deserve everything you get for buying such an obviously shitty and scammy game.
---
Or a Mister Handy.  Whatever floats your boat.  
---
And, for all of you people in the midst of panic attacks, I do sincerely hope they back down.  If for nothing else for your health and mental stability.
---
Thanks.  That’s what I thought. 
---
Is it 1*? How many caps are you looking for? 
---
I have a hard time buying stuff because I always convert the price to dollars. I've spent $40 on Atoms and haven't even used all the free ones I've gotten probably because I can't pay more for a PA skin than I did for Stardew Valley (Steam ~800 Hours). Still, I'm going to buy those 4 horsemen no matter how much they are.
---
Mostly only because they fixed durability of certain weapons. 
---
Before that, Scorchbeast Queen was end game and taking her down commonly consisted of teams of heavy gunners, melee users and mob clearers. 
---
Heavy gunners had their guns break in the SBQ fights occasionally. Having a repair kit to repair your best weapon in the middle of a SBQ fight without having to get to a workbench would be P2W.
---
Will you still think so when, while in the middle of the woods with no workbench in sight, your opponent's TSE weapon breaks only for them to repair it for no material cost and continue blasting you?
---
Read this.
---
I read that the railway rifle is more or less silent, I may be wrong. And the pipe bolt action has a supressor attached.

The inside the vault article, I definitely recommend reading them

Bethesda,"well, since people already hates us, LET IT RIDE!!!"
---
With a heartfelt and honest statement. You’re my new fuckin hero. You just stay awesome the way you are brother. I appreciate the compliment. Come by my channel sometime on YouTube. Same name. A lot of crazy shit and shit talking. You seem like you’d be cool to talk to in chat. 
---
&gt;	(Once a thing begins generating revenue, you don't take it off the market).
---
An online game doesn’t live on community goodwill alone: it needs to actually *generate* revenue. 
---
I guess you're being sarcastic. However the fridge is just one of the multiple examples given.
---
But let's expand on it for a second.
---
With the brewery, Beth implemented new recipes for item bringing some (minor) advantages. Now it has been shown here before that some recipes are currently almost impossible to do because the items are so scare they often spoil before you assemble everything.
---
Now let's say at the same time as the atom fridge, Beth implements a recipe of that kind that brings 200% bonus to loot chances.
---
Do you still think it's not a big help?
---
Not sure yet, but to my surprise, Scorched Killer Receivers do appear to work against SBs, which might save someone some flux.
---
You have that viewpoint about _youtubers_ who, as a whole, look at data they have available to them, make reports. 
---
Yet you're _supporting_ bethesda, even though they have lied _all along the line_ about this product, _to make a fucking profit_.  "we're going to have a BETA". They don't have an actual beta, they have a few hours of game play tease for some few people, without actually doing sufficient time in this "beta" period to find bugs, or fix any bugs that were found. Then there's the _literal fucking criminal act_ which was "bag gate". 
---
The hypocrisy of your stance is fucking mind boggling dude. 
---
A large hairy mega-sloth my friend, a large hairy mega-sloth
---
A real medical malpractice. A vampires gamma gun. 
---
All good 
---
But them being in the Atomic shop is a game mechanic behind a paywall. A $60 game with mechanics that you have to pay extra for. (I know the advanced ones are drops but neither are really worth it.) Still, the precedent is dangerous for the long term health of the game.
---
Yeah, I thought about luck too, it's also nice. The thing with melee is that, I don't know exactly why, the game seems to register about a half of my attacks, the rest make the good old hitting noise, splatter some blood, but don't damage the enemy. I'm gonna take your advice about healing factor. Do yo recommend on getting some other mutations?
---
Here come the downvotes for people simply stating their perfectly legitimate opinions. 
---
Omg that’s absolutely beautiful. 
---
OH, MATE, MEDIC GAMMA GUN, CALL IT CHEMOTHERAPY. 
---
I haven't noticed any change too. Yesterday my cranberry relishes lasted for like 4-5 hours. Had about 30-40% cnd left when i went to bed. My gourds lasted all the way from crashed plane where my camp is to bootlegger's shack where i've coocked my food. I've cleard out Harper's Ferry, Big B's Rest Stop, Camp Venture, Firebase LT and spent some time at Mac's farm collecting cranberries until i've reached bootleger's shack so plenty of time have passed. No good with salt perk. I do not fast travel at all however so who knows. Maybe thats the problem.
---
I think it's 1, but I don't know. In terms of caps, I just want enough to keep me going for a while. I don't know the usual price in the player market, so I really can't say.
---
I tried being a good fanboy, I couldn't keep at it. Abandon this dumpster fire in progress.
---
Ah well yes definitely with V. fast melee weapons! Did not think of that sorry (I’ve never really touched em except for a chainsaw, I like to go heavy or Rifle tbh, so don’t touch melee much except for bloodied ones)
---
And I think if companies took the loud minority (aka general public) into account with every decision there wouldn't be many companies left.  When the average person has an air of entitlement (like they have stock in the company or product), I don't see how anyone actually tied to the said company could possibly take them seriously.  It is just background noise.  
---
so your argument is that complaints will never amount to anything? In the gaming industry, look at No Man's Sky. Outside of that, since you want to take non-gaming examples into this? Look at women's rights. Look at slavery and child labor laws. Look at every single time that complaints and outrage HAVE made a difference. Most of the time it TAKES time, but not protesting only ensures nothing EVER changes.
---
I have never spent an atom because i knew they would start selling better loot and shit on the atom shop at some point. None of you believed me then but watch the loot boxes come by summer
---
You guys are like the soldiers on the Japanese islands who didnt hear the war was over.  
---
Did i send this typw of message twice? Whoops I was tired at the time I thought I accidentally deleted the first one I typed XD
---
Nerd rage helps with low hp builds too 
---
I think you need to look up the word fear in a dictionary. I never defended Bethesda, just the road to took to reach your conclusions.
---
I already have the first rank and plan on getting the rest!
---
It's not only about the repairing. It's about non cosmetics, game play affecting items in the Atom shop.
---
How about 1-star legendaries for sale in Atom shop. You can get them in game too and even better ones.
---
That is the same defense given to the repair kits.
---
Non cosmetics open a big can of worms. 
---
Bring the pay to win i have saved up over 3k atoms. Glad i didnt waste it on shit cosmetics now haha
---
Even moving it doesn't guarantee your spawn point.  I have the same issue and loading into game I rarely don't fall down from my cliff side camp. 
---
It will occasionally scrap items or render them unrepairable.
---
I have not read the most recent one I guess. 
---
The kits save materials. Besides - it's not about the kits - it's about the direction this takes the whole game
---
Is the shop still open?
---
I totally expect and understand a high ratio of dislikes.  This is a superfan community.  I just find it strange when something still so abstract is being discussed and people post complaining with "what ifs".  I seriously hope they fold to the demands of the rabid few.  For your own mental and emotional health more than anything.
---
Ultra-light armor pieces give you an AP boost. Cooked mirelurk meat gives you +10. Anything that boosts agility gives you AP as well
---
A wendigo will do, if you prefer skinny and screechy.
---
Well , if we can get 1 more player , we can play cards.👍. I have a table with 4 chairs on the patio....
---
Can you also mention your timezone so I can check when we all can come online .
---
Mine is cest
---
Me too (on PS4). I've looked around the map and I'm not near any other players. I've stood in front, walked behind me and every time it follows, but never insults me.
---
Ok that would be the only thing I can agree on is the unbalance of the game long term. I just see it as more help than hurt. Anything even the smallest of unbalance can cause a ripple effect of devastating consequences. But anything can be abused as well. Usually only people who bitch about atom shop stuff is kids and broke people. I’m a grown ass adult with money. I bought the power armor edition, another pc digital copy, 10000* (that’s ten thousand) total atom points so far.  I may be a fuckin idiot for paying that much on a “broken game”. That’s why I get pissed when someone bitches over minuscule shit. I’ve paid the fuckin cost to be the boss. I have the battle scars to prove it. Level 110 mind you. 
---
Ooh hey, didn't even thing of ol' Digo.
---
We’re tired of silly reskins and vault tec skins, RELEASE FACTION BASED ITEMS IT WILL BE LIKE PRINTING MONEY FOR BETHESDA PLS
---
Yeah and even those who did probably didn’t make it past the first section about repair kits lol, it’s a real bummer they’re delaying it but it’s better than getting a feature that doesn’t function correctly so as long as it works on release I’m alright with it. 
---
We’re still getting the new vault raid on time tho and that’s the key for me, really needing some fresh content and I think this is gonna be fun. 
---
Never got it, keep me posted.
---
A little morbid. But funny. 
---
Still supporting this dumpster fire, huh?
---
Level 15 and Xbox One
---
There's a nice one in the far north of the Mire where you can set your camp at the top and really get some elevation. You can't snap to the existing structure, but with some clever placement you can tie into it. A staircase only needs a small footprint and setting your construction bubble high would let you put an observation deck over the canopy. Most of the work is already done so it won't eat into your budget. You can simply redecorate it and make it your own.
---
What platform are you using? 
---
I see plenty of p2w players on other MMOs. Why is 76 different? They made it so those p2w players can't really mess with me anymore so it doesnt really impact me. Repair kits are different than strength boosters or whatever it could be. Guild wars 2 has repair kits. And they have perk boosters. I hear no complaints. 
---
Well obviously this subreddit is **all about the game**. I don’t think anyone is going around in their daily lives crying about it. But this is **the** place to talk about the game and your opinions on it. I’m not surprised people are sharing their disappointment here tbh.
---
Yeah, it's kinda insane that this is the vast majority of the top threads on the subreddit and we don't have a _single_ word from the community response team. 
---
I mean, legit the first player name I saw on day 1 of the PC beta for 76 was "Adolf Critler"
---
I’ve been doing this ever since I found out how. Sadly though you still only have the 50 options for visible loading screens. Despite Saving a bunch of my pictures on the Xbox it’s really not as good because I rarely ever see them again after deleting them for the photo gallery. 
---
I don't understand why they needed to do this. They have sooo much room to make cosmetics we'd actually buy. They've barely touched hair and tatt options.
---
I always assume that they found a duplication exploit in the new content and are fixing it before we end up with a million bloodied explosive handmades like we did with the Tse weapons. 
---
Per account 
---
I get a damn fallout song stuck in my head once a day at least....
---
Currently “watching the bubbles in my beer” is stuck in my head
---
I do. I dont understand how people can pay a monthly subscription for a game they already paid for like wow or ffxiv. I paid full price for 76 and haven't spent a penny since. Same with overwatch and guild wars 2 for me. People buying repair kits wont impact my experience since pvp damage is off in adventure mode. 
---
There are two types of repair kits, shitty ones you can buy and good ones you loot in game. "will be purchasable with Atoms only" shows you either didn't read the article or want to spread false information. Either way, you're conflating the issue.
---
If you’re going to post on twitter you might as well post here too. No reason to let up on one platform by pushing on another 
---
Another one? Ok. I’m in. 
---
They could make enough money through the atomic shop if they had some good skins/outfits/paints. That’s all they would need, they need to spend more time developing these items. 
---
I mean. I do sympathize. I also feel it's bullshit. I had to convey both lol. 
---
I already did today but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s bs lol.
---
Annnd this is why the game industry is going to shit, this viewpoint, right here. 
---
It's the first step, if they get away with offering a non cosmetic item in the store, and it sells, they'll add more. How long before they add weapon plans, ammo packs, or just straight up nuke codes? 
---
Not gonna lie I did the Mr. Messenger event out by harpers ferry and had about 8 of the bastards go at me. Two groups of four, one right after the other.
---
And of course Mr.messenger is just sitting there watching it happen like it's none of his business.
---
I see that false hit a lot with Vats melee. I think it might be lag related or some sort of obstacle in the way issue. 
---
Ever since Beth fixed "first gunshot right after entering misses" they seem to have nerfed VATS melee. 
---
Heck, I used to be able to rubber band through railings and windows and shit. I felt like Kool Aid man or a Bad ass ninja version of Kool Aid Man. Now I get these instances where its infinite whifs in vats so I have to back out and aim manually. 
---
Literally most mobile games. Those games also HIGHLY profitable. 
---
The way the new repair kits they'll have in the shop are described make them sound like shit. Only 100%? Shit, if stupid people who can't do math want to give their money to Bethesda to be at a disadvantage, all the power to them.
---
Slippery slope.  They're seeing what they can get away with. Soon it'll be something else, and it'll be slightly more useful. This continues until they're selling stuff like extra stash space you can only get through atoms, or guns that are better than what you can find in game.
---
Love to see those actually inserted into the .ini files so that they worked. ;)
---
I am certain they are generating revenue off of atomic points.  There are other ways to generate revenue. Generating revenue is the reason we can't get closed ended games anymore. Addons and expansion packs are revenue.  8 hour long flash sales of really badass power armor aesthetics will sell atom points
---
Is it weird I don’t care, it’s just durability, pretty much the easiest thing to manage in the entire game.
---
Why? They should have been prepared for this. There's no way they're stupid enough to think this would go over _well_. 
---
Can this game fail even more? 
---
Bethesda surprises us every day.
---
I don't really feel a front page full of the same topic with mostly restated commentary and varying degrees of emotion is not cathartic for the community, only for those posters who felt the need to make new subjects past the first half dozen.  To most of the community it is more frustrating and pointless to try and get info of any kind (even pertaining to this issue) when this catharsis is being expressed for the small vocal number doint it.  Further, it also makes it less likely that the ideas and actual community power can be shown since its divided amongst so many smaller threads.  Shouting yourself hoarse seldom does anything beneficial when you want to be listened to, and often by the time that emotional catharsis has passed so has the opportunity to choose a better path too.  I'm not sure why you feel its better to wait for that emotional power to run its course (much like just watching a child tantrum until they are done), when it should be entirely possible for us to harness it by pushing for people to focus it into a single stronger thread we can all support and express our concerns and comments within.
---
Not that I can see.
---
Not trying to have a go at you but *please* for the love of god proof read your title or go back and edit it. Otherwise no one is going to bother reading it. I’m assuming you were trying to say you were *looking for high voltage hefe* 
---
We could probably get exact values out of the game files.
---
Exactly. I thought my gamepad was getting stucky but then I saw that this was the case. I guess you could change that with ini edits, though, but then that'll probably turn all textures purple after the next update. 
---
It’s kind of naive to say none of this matters. It would be one thing if it was the first time. But it’s not. The first was the Unstoppables outfits. Also I’ll state the obvious fact that this exact moment isn’t the end all. But it’s also extremely common sense that this isn’t the most and worst they plan on doing. They’ve had loot box code since before launch. They’ve slowly made progress in backpedaling their promises for atom shop items. So yes, this EXACT item isn’t worth the outrage. But the backpedaling and very clear push against what they already promised 100% is.
---
But what if they dont? I mean a repair kit just feels like a quality of life thing to me. I know i get tired of having to hunt down a table in the middle of a mission 
---
But none of that gives you an advantage over another player in a pvp sense. It's QoL not P2W.
---
YoU'rE FuCkInG uP bEtHeSdA u GuYz R wItH mE rIgHt? Is what i expect of the angry dribblers who wanted Fallout 5.
---
Gamers rise up
---
It’s an app that streamers and youtubers, among other people, use to communicate with their friends and or fanbase 
---
The advanced repair kits are already going to be a drop but most people seem to forget to mention this 
---
It could probably go for around 1k in my opinion. Maybe a little more. Is it max level?
---
Just to be clear I'm not interested in buying, I'm on PC.
---
That is not the point the point is why should I have to pay to make things more easy especially when I brought one of the special editions at full price on launch 
---
You still have not answered my question: Is it appropriate to grind for three months for meta defining weapon?
---
You don’t hear complaints about GW2 because you’re on the FO76 sub.
---
The problem isn’t repair kits. The problem is they are using repair kits to test the waters to see how the community reacts. If it goes well that means they can start charging money for more drastic things the community wants like ammo converter. 
---
We already spent $60 on this game and I can already feel this game being locked behind a paywall.
---
I'll say the same thing to you that I've said to other people with the same argument:
---
&gt;Life is a constantly evolving situation. It's a little absurd to expect everyone to stay true to every thing they ever said. Repair kits are QOL and not P2W, as you said, and in such case there is nothing wrong with the company attempting to collect a little extra money to help finance the ongoing development and support for the game. As long as they don't add buffs or extra content there really is no harm no foul. Also, you don't have to buy atoms, you get a pretty crazy amount of them for free.
---
Adds the 'Bladed' mod to the Commie Whacker that you can get in Camden Park.
---
It's not a cash shop. You can easily get atoms in game without money 
---
XB1
---
Per character, you could make alts and farm them endlessly. But, why would you? It's just repair kits... lol
---
You don't have to actually pay for atoms since you earn them from doing in game things
---
Same. I just take the ‘You have been insulted’ notes.  
---
Got a bunch of unscrapped toilet paper.  
---
Eventually just going to sneak up to people in their camps and drop some TP and a note.
---
I brought a special edition copy of the game at full price and now I'm expected to pay or grind hard for perks to make my game more easy 
---
I paid my extra at launch just give me these perks for free dont make me pay extra for a second time
---
What times do y'all get online?
---
Or they are attempting to force sales of items that may not be buyable in the future adding an incentive to buy the points for money to avoid the risk of the item disappearing.
---
Which would make sense if it was a physical store with space issues and stock suppliers but its all digital why it it being moved off the store unless its to provoke a rarity collector mentality to it where you have to get it NOW or its going to not be there next time you come along or have the atoms 
---
Thanks! 
---
I think Bethesda is trying to find out how player vending is going to work too. Haha
---
They blamed it on vendor bot protests, but it seems there may be some technical issue to work out.
---
&gt; Cosmetic items alone won't keep servers running. 
---
Not sure why people keep using this nonsense excuse. Up until a couple years ago games had no microtransactions at all. They ran the servers just fine. Now suddenly they need both cosmetic microtransactions AND pay to win microtransactions? What have game costs doubled in the last 3 years? No. I don't buy that for a second. 
---
It is max level.
---
thanks for the tip, youre right, its fixed for me, too! 
---
Not taking me seriously doesn't make you any less wrong...
---
&gt; but then that'll probably turn all textures purple after the next update.
---
Editing the inis would only do that if you also added a custom archive list. The Custom ini shouldn't have any lines in it that you aren't intentionally locking at a given value.
---
So what you're saying is you want Bethesda to ignore everything else going on with the game that's a real problem because they announced something that we have very little information on how it will actually work? Every single bug post has now been pushed out of the top and will not be able to get back up and noticed due to everyone constantly reposting. Reposting doesn't show them that something is a problem. It only shows that people know how to post and up vote other posts like it. Everyone is overreacting about an item that will have a better version obtainable in game through normal means. 
---
Nice!
---
gt: v0rdul
---
Send me a request
---
Shit, hundreds of successful sbq fights, still missing 3-4 ultracite pa mods and haven't gotten 1 serum recipe. 
---
I hope they add the vender bots to the whitespring in this patch though. I hate having to run around to all the vendor bots.
---
I mean that's shitty and all, and they shouldn't change your name.. but why didn't I think of Corgi dance party
---
Downvote, please delete. We don't need more attention to this.
---
Give an inch, they'll take a yard. I'd like to believe they won't, and maybe you're right. But they are a business first and foremost and I know I'd put in whatever I can to get some extra cash... 
---
Yeah, fuck Twitter, Reddit is my home. But if it helps and you have a twitter account then follow OP's advice.
---
Poached angler is a max AP boost
---
Or you just don't buy it..? Or if you do, buy it with atoms you've earned. I've always refused any in game purchases out of principle and it won't change with this game. And if everyone else refused to buy, they wouldn't keep trying this crap.
---
So do you want working player vending that doesn't possibly introduce a ton of bugs and maybe even a duping bug or do you want a buggy mess right now. They pushed it back because it's not ready and that's a good thing. The repair kits aren't even that good and you get better ones from in game encounters anyway. People are becoming so idiotic with the nonsense of repair kits being pay to win. 
---
Youtubers drive more views with bolder claims, if it follows the popular opinion - Even better.   
---
It doesn't matter if it's strictly true, opinion rarely are - It's all about selling confirmation of thought.   
---
I have no idea what you're talking about with the rest of that post, so I'm going to ignore it.
---
?
---
Which is why enforcer is a broken op perk
---
No you see that is the point. These are unnecessary items that most of us will most likely never use because we pay attention to our gear and maintain it. If you need these repair kits you just aren't managing your inventory and equipment properly. I will be shocked if I ever use one. 
---
I got those plans in Ash Heap in an Enclave random event about reparing antennas.
---
you sir are hunting for Bethesda's most nerfed ammo types, so good luck.
---
What mods do u want on it?
---
Different month, technically different season. Only I posted a link to the original post and added my own opinion about the cost or perk bit. 
---
At least its not one of those craptastic  "thanks for trying so hard Bethesda"  shitposts. 
---
 Did not say "none of this matters".  Never argued this was the first or the last change to a game that, by the way, everyone is always chanting should be changed....but only as THEY want it.  Not as the owners see fit.
---
Also, a large portion of your comment is unrelated to what I posted.  I guess just another comment section to vent your frustration?  I understand you are upset.  Everyone understands who can a. Read and b. Are subscribed to this group.  
---
R. I. P. 
---
The game has been dead for like...... 3 months? The infamous patch that had those uncalled for nerfs to perks cards and made range in viable because of the TSE nerf. The patch that turned the game into a silly melee slasher in one day.
---
OP is just magically making up his own bullshit definitions to fit his delusion. I'll admit I never played 76, but "pay-to-win" simply means that I can gain a massive advantage over everyone else playing by buying shit on a 1 second old account. If I can compete or kill seasoned users who have tens to hundreds of hours on their account simply by paying more money, the game is 'pay-to-win.' 
---
Yeah it's fine bud. Because you can grind for it. 
---
Exactly what I though. But Warframe was always free to play. Making this in FO76 is so much worse.
---
It's the principle, not the specific monetary cost. If they start charging real currency (via atoms) for one thing, the slope has become slippery and it will only get worse. 
---
where did you see this at? i didn’t see it in the patch notes. :/
---
lol you carry back-ups? Tru Gunsmith/Makeshift Warrior + Weapon Artisan when repairing. smh
---
It seems like more of a QOL thing to me, kind of like how the atomic shop water purifiers make less noise than ones found in game. Or how you can find outfits in game but also buy them in the atomic shop. I still don’t see this as crossing the line towards P2P. I do understand why people feel betrayed in a certain way because Bethesda said the atomic shop would only be cosmetic, but a lot of people asked for repair kits and Bethesda actually listened. 
---
I think they should be applauded for that, especially when they asked for feedback on the way they are planning to implement them. Just seems like a more coherent argument,such as the one you crafted, would have more of an impact than the melodramatic “I’m deleting the game and never buying any new games from BSG if they sell these in the atomic shop” rant I keep reading. 
---
Not discounting people’s right to have an opinion but I think the outrage could’ve been channeled in a much more productive manner. 
---
It would be pointless for some playstyles but its a simple concept that would add a lot of RP elements and QoL improvements. Also it would allow players to have a home base without the need to fast travel back amd forth to it while exploring. You could have a static base that doesnt have to be rebuilt when you just need to boil some water or unload your junk.
---
We already have the blueprint system, they would just need to make one that can be placed in addition to your primary camp.
---
I am waiting for the 25/25. 
---
Can you explain how repair kits are pay to win? Last I checked other than having a weapon that isn't broken it won't give any other benefit since you can't overrepair with them. 
---
Deep pocket for when you're wearing the armor
---
Ultralight if you're not wearing or sneak/vats build
---
It depends on how much weight you're saving. If you're only reducing an armor piece by two pounds you'd still gain eight pounds of inventory space before you become over-encumbered. If stealth is your game you really want to avoid the extra noise that makes. If you're typically burdened on a run even with the pockets and you're trying to reduce the sneak penalty, or carrying minimal supplies and trying to maximize your ability, then go with the ultra-light. I personally prefer the pockets because they let me grab more loot before I go over the encumbrance threshold. In my experience that has a much more significant impact than a little more armor, and I hate giving away my position just as I'm getting to the boss fights. If you're rocking weightless armor you can get the best of both worlds.
---
I love to build.  Here is my current camp:

If we were able to get her to 50%, that means we were at one point inflicting damage. Then after the 50% and bounce back, there seemed to be no damage done to her, at all. Another 6-7 minutes shooting her with everything, she was still at full health. 
---
I get more armor, but I mean come on. 
---
How else are they going to make money off of it lol the game was a major flop 
---
If I have to write out that a joke is a joke, then it kinda defeats the purpose of the joke.

As soon as this concludes feel free to use the name, I won't be able to just sit idly by and accept being forced to use a name someone else chose for me, let alone be known as CorgiDanceParty111 regardless.

Three months?
---
Don't get me wrong. Repair kits are great. Rewarding them from challenges (If they are just daily ones, or something basic like leveling up.) is fine. But purchasing them off the shop. No, god no. 
---
We live in a society

Bottom text
---
Is OPs post even objectively true? 
---
I know it's something we all want to circle jerk about again but does Op even know what he's talking about?
---
I didn’t read that they were planning on delaying that change so I think it should roll out with the new content. Fr tho even with top hats it gets old waiting through 5+ wait screens per character just to stay relevant in the marketplace.

Spend more time running around in the deep woods he tends to appear to me more often out there.

I'm guessing you arent a PC Player if thats your reaction to the Epic Games Store.
---
absolutely agree. Just wanted to point it out. It would be even worse if they jumped on the epic band wagon imo
---
So glad I weened myself off this dumpster fire of a game.
---
just follow the main highway around the map especially in the mire and you will find it more times than you  need
---
The absolute most efficient way to get ammo is to craft them with super duper and ammosmith. Trust me it's a lot easier to find the materials to craft ammo than it is to find ammo.
---
Do u actually play the game?
---
It’s a triple-A £60 release from a major gaming studio. Quality of Life additions such as repair kits, new benches, and other features should be added without additional cost be that in-game or otherwise. F2P mechanics have no place in full price games, I get they need to make money hence pricing the game as highly as it was. The burden of poor sales is being passed back to those who did buy and kept playing. 
---
It will start with small items, and it will grow from there. If it was a free download then fill your boots and monetise the balls off it. You’re a customer; you’re shouldn’t be defending their business practices when they harm you. 
---
I still cant select quit to desktop without getting a not responding error, but I digress...
---
First time I drank Vintage I woke up at a little picnic/camp area with a very familiar looking motorcycle leaning against a fence thing. I realize I have seen this before so I look through all my treasure maps and there it is. I had two copies also, so double loot!
---
I wonder, is this just coincidence or am I o to something?
---
Several hour per day yes. 
---
Fridge is different to Repair Kit, Fridge provides a small advantage of food not spoiling, Repair kits can be used anywhere at any time and the Atom shop version will be better than the one that drops in game from the END GAME boss.
---
This is what is important. Thus why its all over the place.
---
Thanks man
---
I won’t buy it,I only want to buy cosmetics from the shop, NOT any pay to win items,
---
#ONLINE_GAMES_SHOULD_NOT_BE_PAY_TO_WIN

It's one thing to point outb problems but another to make it out to be the end of the world.
---
K well obviously u dont do queen runs all day. Nor do u have any idea what dungeons r like in rpgs.
---
I haven’t even found a gauss yet where are they
---
Do you remember what i paid 1750 caps for i cant remember or see it lol.
---
I think it goes by when you pull the trigger not when you release it. So if you're holding the trigger when you go into VATS you auto-miss. If you wait until you see the percentage to hit and then pull the trigger you should have better luck.
---
What's so "win" about the repair kits?
---
Again, sharing disappointment or issues with the game is one thing but making it out to be the end of the world just doesn't make since to me. Some people are even saying that Bethesda will lose "thousands of customers" over this but that's way overdramatic.
---
You know, of all the posts I've read about this, you're the first to bring up the whole "it doesn't say you can't craft them, just that you can also buy them"
---
It carries your survived time over from your last playthru, so if you survived for 30 min last time and logged out then you’ll start with that amount next time. 
---
Sneak non vats. 
---
Repair kits today, lunchboxes tomorrow. The very definition of a gambling based pay to win money grab.
---
More countries will ban this then they are screwed.
---
Have you played dungeons in Fallout 76? Didn't think so
---
Oh boy. Sounds traumatic man. He is a lazy sack oof shit that Mr. Mess. 
---
So none of the bugs or the shittiness of pvp are important then? 
---
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not.
---
the only thing that i have seen from multiple reddit comments is that hunters does extra damage to SB's. the SB's create the scorched according to the lore. the SB's are just mutated bats
---
Don't try tp argue with them, the topic got too popular before most people knew what p2w really means. Just like the whole "no NPC" stuff. The game is full of NPCs, just no human looking ones, lol.  
---
You see it this way right?: You pay to skip time required to farm repair kits.  
---
If it was pay2win, you would need to gain an immediate superior advantage over other players, that can't be obtained otherwise.  
---
But well, it's just terminology. If we're unlucky, the real p2w will come later 
---
omg you are so lucky! I am a big collector of outfits. Now i am only missing the rare ones from events. I guess i have to do more Uranium fever runs :)
---
I’ll be farming the ones that are actually worth using, the “improved repair kits” that are only available in game, from the queen and other enemies that drop them. We still don’t know if you’ll be able to buy the plans or if it’s a one time thing tho, if it’s a plan then I’ll definitely be buying the atomic shop repair kit with atoms I earned for free in game.
---
Preach it, my man.
---
even then.
---
Not really...specially when the devs are completely going back on their own words.
---
Who cares about pvp glitches when folks will just be out their paying to grief u more. And so sorry to the folks who cant pay, u have to leave the fight to go home to repair.
---
Wake up and smell the coffee. There is a reason behind everyones rage.
---
I love that would make an assumption about my game knowledge without any basis. I do kill queens on a regular basis. I have been gaming RPGs since FFI (that's the first Final Fantasy for those of you too young to remember that). I am fully aware of what dungeons are like and that's why I don't go in UNPREPARED. If you can't maintain your equipment maybe you don't know how play RPGs properly. 
---
He is probably the most active and highest quality(superficially at least) fo76 youtuber. There is a huge lack of quality fo76 content on youtube.
---
I'm genuinely not. Most people are just completely unwilling to... Like... Wait until the release actually drops and they confirm it's MTX only. People paint Bethesda as this shitty company, when personally the biggest flaw they have to me is shoddy communication skills.
---
Huh and so weird that u nvr break a weapon. Sounds like a bunker hider to me.
---
I agree that I admire Bethesda for listening to the community ( even tho i never seen anyone ask for them) but this idea should have been free and just introduced into the game and not behind a pay wall.
---
It should cost materials to make not just a quick fix with atoms.
---
I'm not too happy about the ammo converter, I'm hoping it's not an atom shop exclusive too and tbh it really shouldn't have been needed either. The whole ammo business could have been simply fixed if they allowed them to be sold at vendors, then we could of sold them and bought ammo we needed 
---
Broken Record. 
---
The ability to repair an item while in the field is huge. Guns break, and a lot of times at the worst moment. Being able to fix it instead of swapping weapons will be highly sought after. Personally I'm only half into the idea, i think having a repair-anything kit is kinda bogus. What's the point of finding scrap then?
---
Yongyea be like: fAlLoUt 76 hAs gOnE pAy To WiN
---
Seriously it takes like 15 steel a few adhesive, aluminum and springs to fix a heavy gun. That’s so laughably easy to find. One fix usually lasts me through 2 queen fights by which time I’ve collected most of the resources needed to fix it again. Maybe do a little more resource gathering before doing queen runs all day? 
---
because it sounds like the child was also unsupervised while it happened...!
---
Inside the vault says the regular repair kit is uncraftable. You'll have to pay for each one. 
---
Jump off a ledge and killing yourself will reset your timer.
---
Again if u have nvr broken a weapon in a queen fight. Then u definitely not out there giving it your all.😂😂
---
Meeh, while I agree that this is QoL and not p2w YET, I disagree on the "expect everyone to stay true to what they say". First of, this is not a person we're talking about, but a company. More importantly, it has barely been 6 months since release. 
---
Try reading my original post. No one is going to care about using 100% repair packs in pvp. Overrepairing provides more damage while the repair packs don't. And once again you do not have to pay you can get atoms in game and you are exchanging them for a plan to create repair packs not individual ones. 
---
you can also buy ammo from players for quite cheap.
---
No ones going to care?? Hellos thats why there is so many posts. 😂😂
---
I'd recommend finding players to team up with and share ammunition with. You'd probably have to choose to be content with fewer types, but I've found that works ok.
---
People are having a knee jerk reaction without actually thinking about it. The better repair packs are obtainable normally in game so what is the actual problem again? 
---
&gt; "It's too hard to form my own opinions so I'll just let someone else tell me theirs."
---
Ftfy
---
Really? Cuz all the posts I see are just people yelling at Bethesda to DO something. Whereas I'm making a suggestion to do something on OUR end to make the fix happen. So shut up idiot
---
Metal Building Set
---
What I'm afraid of is looting repair kits or similar items, seeing their usefulness but the drop chances are built around creating a need for a purchase. That is not acceptable in a full-price game. It's literally creating an artificial need in order to enable playing.
---
Don’t do a melee built based on bloodied effects that make you do more than 1000 damage, reactive plates can really hurt
---
Gotta figure how many atoms a vending machine costs to run. 
---
My guns haven't broken, in game, a single time in all the hours I've played. Wanna know why?
---
It is, but tbh I don’t think it’s going to change because the community seems to erroneously think higher level=strong character in all cases. I just re-level characters if they get over 100.
---
Must've been some high level griefers with TSE weapons. Just do a commando-VATS-crit spam build and you can kill them easily no matter what the level. I once killed a level 160 at level 110 with stealth commando with combat rifle. 
---
BEING 👏 LOUDER 👏 DOESN'T 👏 MAKE 👏 YOUR 👏 OPINION 👏 MORE 👏 IMPORTANT.

It only makes your opinion more annoying.
---
Happened months ago, pain in the ass when trading with players 
---
And being a scumfuck who wants to hate over the internet doesn't make you interesting loser
---
That's what gets me, most often mentioned is that player x cant afford it so why should player y have it! But they don't seem to get that more money means more free content for everyone.
---
I think it's all just Russian Trolls hired by EA...
---
Gotta agree with this, the serious pvps won’t be interested in these because it’s better to over repair. People just clutching at straws to think of any vague reason they’re bad 
---
Probably because you're responsible and farm materials to repair them outside of battle? Not everyone is always that prepared I guess
---
Nope you simply need to repair to 200% whenever it goes below 75% and tadaa. If you use gunsmith/makeshift warrior that takes forever to happen. And if you don't play foolishly you won't get your armor destroyed but if it does take damage there is a perk to allow it to be repaired to 200% as well, you can even use white knight and you armor can take a huge beating before repairs are needed. Besides that, repairing to 200% gives the armor extra DR. My weapons don't break because I pay attention to my gear and its durability bars. 
---
Ahh gotcha sooo where exactly is the massive people asking for repair kits to be added to the shop?
---
No where because they dont exist. And for the problem...again I am going back to I dont really think you actually play this game. Because that is becoming extremely clear.
---
I can give you one, what you got to offer.
---
Nope just another complaint post. 
---
It's just one more useless item to hoard in my inventory. 
---
Overacting a bit I think but it seems you may be comfuseing pay to win with convenience. Warframe has allot of this does paying for more weapon or warframe slots make the game pay to win? Not necessarily and many mmo type of games do this as well with like back pack space and stuff just quality of life stuff you can buy not pay to win tho  
---
It's also why I think the hysteria surrounding repair kits is rediculous.
---
Yeah I’ve seen quite a few posts asking for them them but not for a couple weeks. The problem is we don’t have all the information yet and that’s definitely where Bethesda screwed up. I’m pretty sure this will be a plan you can use to craft repair kits, so you use atoms you earned for free in game to purchase the plan then you go farm the materials to make the repair kit. It won’t be a limited time item so anyone will be able to buy the plans if they so choose, also you’ll be able to earn better repair kits in game.
---
If I’m wrong and you have to purchase each repair kit with atoms then I won’t be buying them but still don’t see it as pay to win. I guess I don’t see how you can legitimately claim it’s behind a paywall when 
---
A) you earn this currency in game very easily, it would probably take me less than a week to earn the atoms for this and..
---
B) there’s a better version of the item that can only be earned in game 
---
Whatever dude. Your opinion falls on deaf ears here. Don't really care
---
Bye, Felicia. 
---
If I buy a repair kit, with some of the thousands of atoms I have just by playing the game, and I win, what is my prize?
---
lol well why dont you wait to see if they still do it first.
---
This would be an awesome improvement i'vr been thinking about since launch but now we have worse troubles on the way
---
Are all mmo games pay to win cause you can buy extra back pack space? You guys throw pay to win around way to much 
---
This is laughable. 😂😂
---
You really dont have a clue do u.
---
I play this game quite often actually and I'm also a dataminer so yea you're now just grasping at thin air because you have no solid arguement anymore. How does whether or not people asked for them have anything to do with anything that has been discussed in this thread so far? 
---
The new word for betrayal = bethesda 
---
Example:
---
I will bethesda my teammates and take all the good loot 
---
It’s become silly 
---
A bit but I only add to the hysteria be abuse I'm thinking of the future. Sure its repair kits today, but then its specialized armor and mods and guns and on and on until you can't be the best without investing 200 bucks into the game. 
---
I just wish they created new hairstyles options!
---
And u r drinking some special kool aid if u a dataminer and dont see where this is going. 😂
---
You're wrong mate. People are going nuts over it because Bethesda over and over and over said "NOTHING BUT COSMETICS IN THE ATOM SHOP!!" and now there's a non-cosmetic item in the Atom Shop. It's not the item itself or what it does that is the issue, the issue that has everyone in an uproar is that this is yet again another thing Bethesda has gone back on their word on.
---
I couldn't care less about the item itself, but I am in total agreement with these outraged people and for one specific reason; They said they won't go back on their word for how the game will work, but then goes back on their word just on the area that can make them more money.
---
They said no matter what there would be no non-cosmetic items in the Atom Shop and no NPCs in the game. Well they stuck to the no NPCs even though pretty much everyone who's played the game has begged for them to be added. Yet they freely went back on their word about no non-cosmetic items in the Shop, because that makes them more money. It's an ethics issue, not an issue with the item in question.
---
Exactly, with correct perks guns breaks really rarely - I'm lvl103 on my new account (last account was lvl192) and never need to repair guns in the field. It can be useful, but not game changing like the OP suggests.

There are 3 bags on it halfway across the huge bridge south of Flatwoods and you can find 3 bags in the room where Uranium Fever happens.

Try reading past the first sentence next time buddy.

Screws ? I end up selling them once I get over 1000, they just take up unwanted inventory space
---
Yes, please! I got so used to having my device in front of the keyboard ready to use stimpacks or other practical use. It might also let us eat or drink a beer while sitting...
---
I, for one, am not underestimating how much worse the whinging and gnashing of teeth over a single, pointless addition to the Atom shop can get. 
---
It csn get much worse.
---
These bethesda break up posts are cringey as fu**.
---
Idk, did you check out their new mobile game? Best loot seems to be only purchasable in the store. Crazy timers on loot boxes. It's a mess of a game.
---
Of course mate
---
Hasn't happened to me, but doesn't sound very nice. If somebody griefed my base, I would get out whatever weapon I've got and shoot the griefer until he goes down or until I do. But at the moment nobody if griefing me - currently level 120 stealth commando-VATS-crit spam build - I can kill any high level player in about 5-10 shots with my handmade rifle and crit spamming. Just do a stealth commando build and you can kill any player before they even have time to react as any commando-VATS build has the highest DPS in the game (but you need heaps of ammo as it runs out very quickly. 
---
Weapon artisan and Luck of the draw my friend, pumping out those ultracite rounds on the daily. Definitely depends on the gun you’re using but my BE .50 cal and Minigun last multiple fights, and once they do break I simply walk over to the conveniently located weapon workbench right next to the fissure site. 
---
I think attacking someone’s effort based on your personal experience is a little weak but ok personal attacks it is. 
---
Atomic shop still down after 12 hours this is becoming a daily thing
---
I am so in! 
---
Your overeacting 
---
Win what ?
---
Sorry my well explained comment was to complex for you. Let me simplify. Keep your shit fixed and you won't need to fix it in the field. Don't go into a fight until you have prepared and you won't be caught off guard. 
---
No one will miss you just like no one cares. If a tree falls in the forest and no one sees it. Did it fall? That’s right no one gives a fuck and we are down another douche. So it’s win win
---
Or making a post complaining about people legitimate issues...
---
Bethesda never made any actual promises and things do change as business models change. If the revenue slows down they aren't just going to keep the game running at a loss and need to figure something out in order to make money. Unless you want paid dlc and/or subscriptions then convenience items that can be bought with in game premium currency that you can actually earn in game as well as being able to pay for it if you're lazu is going to be the way to keep this game going. 
---
There's also a round filing cabinet next door to where Phoenix is.. it's on the left when you go north of where the group of 4-5 bots are.
---
Didn’t they recently buff laser weapon durability?
---
How often do your weapons break? I repair mine frequently usually before that happens.

It’s just nothing to care about your overreacting it’s really not a big deal outrage culture at its finest

"Once you’ve got a Repair Kit, open your Pip-boy to find an item you want to repair, hit “Inspect”, select the new “Repair Kit” option, and then leap right back into the action."
---
I don't think this will be very convenient *during* combat, especially not PvP.
---
For those who haven't been buying atom shop items and who have thousands of points, I can see where you might not think it's so bad. But how long do you think you'll be capable of buying one 200 hours of gameplay from now, when they add more utility items you can only get in the atom store? Sure, 200 atom points doesn't sound bad now, but then they put more in to buy until there's no possible way to earn free atom points fast enough through challenges to be able to keep yourself in stock of these items. Eventually you pretty much get forced into hardly ever getting to use an item, or paying for it one microtransactions at a time.

The workshop to the right of vault 76 has a concrete deposit just hold that for a little while and soon you'll swimming in it or if you're on ps4 I'll trade you some

I've been doing this on a regular basis, first thing I usually do...working on getting all the boS paint plans...Got Knight the other day...and I've got an Initiate one in my stash that I've had since i can remember...Ended up getting Initiate twice somehow.
---
But that only includes things you "have" to buy. Unless they remove the other repair options, you don't have to buy anything.
---
Fine then quit playing the game 
---
Or, it isn't, and it won't be.

Thus, the hystrionics.

You're as safe as the skeleton you share the shelter with

To be fair, they never promised cosmetics only. The only info I can find is on their FAQ: " This currency can be used to acquire in-game cosmetic customization items for your character." The wording isn't a promise, more of a statement. I'm not happy about repair kits, but freaking out over a non-existent promise is a waste of time. Also I do agree with OP that there's way too many posts about it.
---
You guys mind if I ask in this thread if you’ve got any max level Berzerker’s pistols between the lot of you? I’d rather just check here first
---
This has been a problem for a while and the mods clearly don’t care. I made a post about it a while ago and got downvoted to hell for it. 
---
They need to be more proactive and put together a proper list of known topics/issues/bugs without relying on us to do it for them. I’m not going to put together a request with 3 linked examples of the same topic and submit that to the mods for each repost if no one is going to read the rules and the mods aren’t going to delete posts.

I can’t remember the places name, but where the Public Event: Uranium Fever takes places, there’s several bags of cement in the area.

---
Thanks for the tip , i started playing the survival mode and now im in desperate need to make a fortress to protect myself from the new sudo raiders that roam West Virginia 
---
Wow, I could have been honest and told you that boycotts never work. Or you making a suggestion on a tread with a minority of the games community on it in the middle of the night is kind of like screaming at into your pillow and hopping it changes the world, But instead I pointed out that you, just like all these other posts are complaining about something irrelevant that you don't like. Are you triggered that a company might try to make some money, do you need a safe space? I hope the big bad NOT REAL ITEMS don't get you. 
---
Not my post.. and the OP wasn’t complaining about people’s legitimate issues, might wanna re-read it. They were simply stating why they won’t buy the repair kit and explaining why they won’t need to. 
---
Then you ride in on your high horse acting like your experience in game is gospel and talking down to everyone, seriously most people on this subreddit enjoy having thoughtful discussions so change your attitude a little and I think you’ll find more rewarding conversation as a result. 
---
I expect them to run for several days more, before they finally exhaust themselves. 
---
Just came onto the sub for the first time in a while, what are repair kits?
---
I'm sure Bethesda has figured out that they need to pull the plug on this or at least will soon enough. But if they don't, boycotting is my vote. No real other way to go about it imo. I refuse to buy my way into the winners circle. 
---
And u can dance and sing to the fairies in your fantasy world.
---
There is a reason ppl carry multiple weapons in their inventory. And if u dont know why thats on you.
---
And in case u havent noticed in your “years” of playing. Fallout isnt about one build or one perk. Everyone plays their own different ways. 
---
Bethesda quietly rolls out repair kit plan to Atom shop.
---
Cost 0 Atoms
---
Never says anything about it, but acts like it was their plan all along
---
Everyone who pooped their pants over the whole thing feels stupid
---
Bethesda announces whales only TSE Nuclear Shop
---
Everyone is too tired to complain
---
Bethesda: Profit!
---
I have a smokey purple glow and it was after attacked at by a bunch of smokey purple ghouls
---
K and u can go cuddle with the OP and talk about it
---
Beth was selling atoms for cash right from the start. You could have seen the writing on the wall.
---
Was hoping for a linked pipboy app. 
---
I'll have to check that out
---
Buy your jet packs from Old Power player vendor in just a month from now and it wont happen to you!
---
Goodbye, have a good time!
---
Yeah I’m thinking Bethesda isn’t gonna worry about it since legendary characters are coming soon.
---
I had to throw out his skis and poles. Still alive. At least I’ll die in company when they find me, staring up at them with a skeleton embraced in my arms. 
---
Danke
---
The game could be integrated into the pip boy
---
Favorited items should have a toggle tab in the shop to show them, I don't see why people would sell a favourite item unless it's the rare scenario it's getting replaced, so that'd fix the weapons side of things. Having a favourite item for armour which doesn't make it a hotkey would also fix the problem for armour.
---
Can Bethesda just reel in like some kind of Tunnel Snakes cosmetic bundle. I'd love to see someone get mugged for a sweetroll or better yet hear the chant "Tunnel Snakes rule" as we roam around
---
Melee all they way. (I'm a frugal bastard)
---
Hope they don't nerf melee durability.
---
Well I guess warframe is pay to win then 
---
Yeah the wording confused me a little when I read it but it does appear as tho that will be the case. That to me should be the target of everyone’s outrage. Give us the plan dammit! Not some single use item.
---
I think it’s partly Bethesda’s fault for not releasing better atomic shop items so people are inclined to spend on this game. The current state of the shop lends itself to people hoarding atoms for better items down the line. At the end of the day there’s a point where running the servers and creating new content isn’t free, and if we want new content 4 years down the line then some people need to buy atoms. I’m not saying implement pay to win items but I am saying Bethesda needs to find ways for people to spend their atoms and still need more for cool stuff. 
---
Repair Kits in the atomic shop were a bad idea imo but still doesn’t equate to pay to win for me, but I can sympathize (sorta) to those who feel slighted by Bethesda’s changing stance. 
---
I’m with you when it comes to purging dupers but getting banned for picking up their duped loot is called for a ban due to suspicion, but dropping it a few seconds later because you refuse to have duped loot is another thing,
---
I hope they can lift your ban later but as for what other people have said, wait till the fire of the repair kit issue to settle down (due to attention seekers keeping it a hot topic for a long period of time). I hope for your sake that it gets lifted before the raid system.😔
---
Today feels like when some low level attacks you to get your attention to buy something from you and you turn around and kill them and they have a complete meltdown 
---
Its pay to win in a sense if it's a item that can be bought but doesnt use materials.
---
Damage reduction(armor) and weapon damage(weapon) are tied to durability/repair, the kits already state they increase these over 100%. These kits will only help the lowers, pvp'ers and those fighting the SBQ.
---
Lowers to fix things over 100% because they don't have the required perks to do so
---
Pvp'ers so they can camp stations and spawn points without needing to go to a work bench to fix their weapons 
---
The kits will allow players to gain exp quicker without taking the time to grind for materials to fix things and time away to find benches
---
There are two concrete harvesting locations right around the Overseers camp as well. 
---
Exactly. See "New Coke" for example.   
---
Just because companies want to make big bucks (who doesn't?) doesn't follow they are.  
---
Valves shitty customer service that's actually pretty good has nothing on the spyware ridden abortion that is epic Games, maybe you should read up on it a little
---
It's not because few people keep making the same posts all over /r/fo76 that you're talking for the whole community.
---
??
---
It’s funny you don’t respond to people’s points only do personal attacks, such a great strategy for encouraging discussion. I was respectful to you and you have refused to respond in kind, aint nothing wrong with cuddling btw seems like you could use a little more in your life.
---
Lol those answers are all essentially the same but one. 
---
You have a point?
---
Just logged into a server and my mirelurk hunter was dead when he was just alive before I server hopped....sigh.  I've lost so many tamed creatures to Bethesda's BS.
---
¿
---
There are plenty people who collect junk and if they don't sell it they drop it. I don't do it with junk but aid I regularly drop 50 water and 40 radaway and 50 stimpaks out in a field somewhere to make space. 
---
Then i think you need to change how you play and start using some of these perks and repairing your shit considering you can swap perk cards on the fly 
---
it's not really a few now is it.
---
About 8.
---
Look dude, I'm up and posting whenever  I feel like it because I don't care about anyone else's time (obviously you're up so I'm not the only one) Sit there and dribble on your keyboard like an angry child all you want. Honestly, I only answer your posts in the hopes of pissing you off a little more cuz you're acting like a damn child and it's kinda funny (and I mean "haha look at this idiot" funny). And ya know, I'm fuckin allowed to say what I like and don't like, it's the internet genius... And if a company wants to make money, they should probably go about it in a way that doesn't go against what they, and I quote "are all about". That's on them. 
---
Yeah my point is that if you plan ahead you won’t ever need a repair kit, and funnily enough you’ll be getting them from killing the queen anyways, but still if you 200% repair your weapon and use luck of the draw then you can go 2 queen fights without repairing your weapon. 
---
It's not the repair kits I'm worried about it's how it will damage the game.
---
Easnt even my quest. I just noticed someone nuking fissure prime so i hopped on in.
---
98%, huh? I'd go more like the 2%.
---
It's not a person, it's a company. Why are you even believing what they say in the first place?
---
That’s funny good luck !!!!!
---
Gotcha so we can all run around exactly the same. 😂😂
---
 Should we all wear the same armor and clothing too?
---
This repair kits is only the beginning. Just because one person feels like it wont affect them. That sound like some single minded bs to me. Maybe think what it does to the community first.
---
You put $25 into a game that you already bought at, I'm assuming, full price? 
---
That is how you **encourage** more MTX and worse MTX.
---
Your missing the bigger picture, as insignificant as repair kits may be where does it stop. What if we end up seeing special ammo types that can only be bought in the atom store like armour piercing or incendiary rounds. What about  more powerful versions of chems that you have to buy with atoms. 
---
Most people seem to be overlooking this, if we accept repair kits we are basically telling Bethesda we are ok with pay to win items. Let's not forget about how Bethesda said we would only ever see cosmetics 
---
After every patch I put the game down for a few days out of disappointment... the last patch was nice that they added content but there were still so many bugs and disconnections that it overshadowed the positive aspects of the patch. 
---
Hell, just last night I got disconnected while capturing workshops, still have the enemy health regen bug, constantly come across weird glitchy/clipped walls and textures, still have floating objects in my camp I can’t delete and probably a dozen more problems. 
---
The content they add just isn’t enough to overcome the negative aspects of bugs.
---
As a human who is owned by a corgi, I’m offended by your assertion that they are awful. It’s taken four hours to convince her that you didn’t mean it. 
---
Joking aside, that sucks. I half think that nickname enforcement is largely arbitrary. 
---
Also, do you know what these things are? They are not buffs or combat items, lol, it's literally just spending a few bucks so you don't have to fast travel back to camp every hour or so.
---
Yup and there is such a thing as an ineffectual build. If your build keeps failing and your shit keeps breaking maybe its not the games fault, maybe you need to reconsider your decisions. I carry multiple weapons but only for variety like my sniper has better range than my close quarters weapons. I know why you should have multiple weapons, I don't think you do. 
---
You're literally over reacting, Calm the fuck down stop crying and throwing a fit just pick a few perks and equip them from time to time when need be WOW WHAT AN IDEA 
---
who would have guessed. fucking boycot this whole game already guys. Return to fallout 4 SP until they get it. 
---
That doesn't make them any $$$ to fix that shit! Gotta focus on dashing every ounce of goodwill the community has held out for them, gotta look at black ops 4, look at how much $ they're making in micro transactions! Repair kits, 20$ guys! Come one, come all 30$ super sledge coming next, does 100,000 dps!  Fuck this boring ass, broken ass, lame ass game.
---
Pretty sure by ALL the posts. Its not me. 😉
---
Bookmarked. Can't check you guys out now, but def will when I get the chance
---
Just saw your messsge that you tried to message me back on Xbox but got chat blocked. Been there, done that, LoL. Glad you got it fixed ☺
---
I actually would prefer this to stop. This is just disgusting mass histeria at this point. People looked at the blog that says "A", somehow saw there "B,C,D and most impotantly F" instead and now are loosing their shit over it while completely ignoring Beth's history with their other games' cash shops, the facts that in F76 we have free DLCs, free atoms and we also gonna get free and better repair kits via in-game means.
---
Dont forget to keep your waste acid either. And use the superduper and ammosmith perks.
---
Yep and guess what they will start paying to win. Just get their credit card out...So get off your high horse and think about what this means.
---
The ones found in game will repair past 100% but not the ones in the atomic shop. And honestly the materials needed to repair items is so minimal I don’t really see the advantage. 
---
The damage you take in PvP is so minimal I can fight 20+ people and still be at over 100% with my armor and guns durability, by that time I hop over to adventure mode or back to my camp to store all the items I looted anyways.
---
If you’re grinding XP then you’re killing mobs and the loot you collect off them is enough to fix anything in the game not to mention the ubiquitousness of workbenches in this game, it’s pretty easy to find one no matter where you are.
---
 I get your points but I don’t necessarily agree with them.
---
I get they will need money and everything, nothing is cheap or free. But I would much rather pay a yearly subscription fee (much like I already do to play online period) just to keep Bethesda working on fallout while still keeping everyone on the same playing field. And I'm not saying that's a perfect plan either, but I just see the atom shop getting out of hand and fast. 
---
The devil is in the details, always. Remember Battlefront 2? You could grind out everything, but it would take thousands of hours to unlock the heroes. And let's be real, only the tiniest minority of a playerbase has the time and inclination to pour that much of their gaming time into a title. 
---
All this MTX stuff, games as a service, it's a cancer that is ruining gaming.
---
It doesn't matter its p2w from a media perspective and it will hurt the game
---
I heard gunshots in the distance — a wanted man fighting seven others. My desire to live fled me, I had embraced my fate and set out to leave the Pulowski behind and try to die in the fight. Then suddenly someone in power armor, pointed their gun at me and gestures for me to get back inside the Pulowski. They shut the door. All I can hear now is the rain beating on the steel roof... oddly I feel safer now than I did before. 
---
Lol “I blame Bethesda “ yet you knew the nature of the open pvp before even purchasing. We, as consumers, love to take no blame even though we’re told and are well aware of how games are. 
---
I love the game but i just thougt the last couple weeks my guns brake alot faster,now i know why..
---
Literally if you play any game where your shit can break and don't pay attention to its durability i don't think you should play the game it's probably not meant for you
---
That is the stupidest argument I have ever seen. Get a job so you can spend money on fucking repair kits. As for farming them, we don't even know there drop rate, what If they are super rare and end up being that no one will ever actually use them because of that. 
---
Even if you were rolling in money and could afford to constantly buy kits rather than use your work bench, no one should be ok with Bethesda adding non cosmetics that are borderline pay to win
---
Seems fair enough and the only way to compete with the duping market 
---
Yeah. Its grindy but possible. Doesn't mean it's the best thing they've done but you dont have to buy shit.
---
Top notch op
---
Sure there are loads of problems that need to be addressed, and many QoL changes that are sorely needed, but once games start getting the ball rolling on pay to win features they'll continue and introduce more and more features that are pay to win (even if you say it isn't pay to win, paying money to gain something others need to work for is pay to win). They made a promise which was one of their selling points, if people were informed of this pay to win stuff before the game had been released they may not have brought it. It's not so much the individual act of introducing these repair kits, it's that Bethesda lied to their customers and betrayed the trust that had been slowly earned back from the controversial launch. If they roll these pay to win features out then not only will it progressively become more and more common to the point of most bonuses and features becoming pay to win, but also the trust between consumer and producer would be severed entirely.
---
I rambled a little with that so TL;DR:   Getting everyone used to a small change indicates they're going to ramp it up slowly as people become acclimatised to the idea of it, leading to a slippery slope of pay to win game death which has happened to games in the past, and the trust between Bethesda and their fans is severed if they break open promises used to draw people into the game.
---
I've played WoW since TBC all the way up to the end of Legion, they released WoW Tokens as a way to bridge the gap between people who can afford WoW and people who have lots of spare time, the feature does have many problems, but they're generally out shined by the good in letting poorly people play, if Blizzard had actively said "We will not release anything like WoW Tokens" and plastered it on their site and used it to sell the game, then proceeded to introduce them people would be outright disgusted and up in arms. Cosmetic =/= Advantage.

Yes, please do go somwhere else to complain! Excellent plan!

I've had a few issues in the last few days. A couple are old bugs that have resurfaced, like having names pop up of enemies that are no where near me, and having vendors cap limits not show up until I sell something to them. Getting the 'cannot place item, no support' bug in my camp again too. Also when it shows up as a green outline, but wont let me place it (not because of a lack of mats). Boxes are once again doing the thing where they show infinite loading circle, and you look away and look back again and they're empty.
---
New ones (to me) that I've found:
---
\- Randomly when you kill a ghoul, its body will reset and run off a bit and then freeze wherever it is (sometimes suspended in mid air) its still dead, doesn't register as an enemy, you can't shoot it, and you can't loot it. I've only had this happen so far with ghouls, nothing else, but I've had it happen with a lot of them.  
---
\- Sometimes when I use R to open the loot window to pick things up, it wont let me click on anything in the container to put it in my inventory, sometimes closing the loot window and opening it up again makes it work, sometimes not.   
---
\- not sure if this was intended, but its super annoying if it is. Items in the camp show up as a green outline, even if you don't have the mats to actually build it. Instead of it being red like it used to show up.  
---
\- Sometimes the loot boxes are not respawning contents, at all. I've had a few boxes that I looted one day, came back the next (real day) and all the boxes remained empty. one or two I can understand, sometimes boxes are empty. But I went around and checked every box I remember looting the evening before, and all of them were empty. Two (real) days later, I could loot them again.
---
\- I had my Character asleep in her bed in her camp, an eyebot came up the stairs, past a turret that didn't shoot it, opened two doors, and hovered next to the bed until I got the character out of bed, then started shooting me.  Haven't had this happen again, so I don't know if its repeatable.   
---
I think there was a couple of others, but I completely forgot to write them down. 
---
Let's say there are 1000 unique posts from unique users. Vs. 175000 subs, that's like 5.7%
---
Those 175000 subs won't even dent the actual playerbase
---
OP's mentality is the epitome of reddit's echo-chamber. 
---
It’s a tricky situation because they don’t wanna split up the playerbase by either charging for new DLC or putting another paywall in place to participate. The atomic shop does seem to be the best way and I agree should never be pay to win, and imo still isn’t even with repair kits. 
---
I will never buy a skin for 18 dollars. Make them cheaper if you're greedy.
---
  They don't give a shit, they got burned up for releasing this broken ass game in the EMBARASSING state it was, so they played it safe for awhile, "oh we're listening guys, gonna be a great game"
---
  The MOMENT they felt they had gained an ounce of goodwill back, BAM, they're back to this GREEDY ass shit.  Fuck Bethesda, fuck this boring ass, broken ass game, it sucks fr guys, I'm officially done.
---
I don’t get how guns break, I use one lever all day and one luck of the draw perk, a queen fight uses 25% of 200% condition  and maybe have to repair a couple times a week
---
They "Are all about" making profits and you with your one man boycott won't change that. They have a player base with money, they want that money. Do you really think they didn't do a cost/profit analysis on this? Of course they did and it said they would make a profit so they are going to do it regardless of a fractional percentage of whiney crybabies on Reddit have to say. 
---
???
---
i get what you are saying but you are also missing the point, if you know something is coming and you dont like are you going to wait until it happens to say something about it?
---
i like you come in here to find info, and yes at the moment its hard to do that but I also understand why its happening. 
---
Loyal fans vs profit basically. How far we have come.
---
It actually does not matter if it truly pay to win or not because I can guaranty that the media and big youtubers will see this as PTW which will hurt the game and don't tell me we should be complaining at the media and big youtubers because that will get us nowhere but what we can do is prevent a scummy cash grab.
---
Yep. Poseidon, Monongah and Thunder Mountain power plants.

Also the way Epic came to what it is now by way of paragon and how they used the money from that for a while then closed it down and refunded after they managed to get fortnite up and running. Only after naturally running paragon into the ground.  People that joined in on founders pack spent a bit of money, sure they gave refunds but not for a lonnnng time.  Personally I don't thing anyone signed up to be a short term finance for them.  They don't give artists credits for even dances they use while selling them and making stupid money. On top of other stuff.  I don't know, its rather hard to trust them. 
---
That’s getting a screen shot and saved to my phone bravo best post 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
As long as they fix it without breaking something else I'm good with the wait. Just gives me more time to collect stuff for sale. 
---
Maybe link it with the fallout shelter, in there add a mission to send your dwellers to that gives you like 10 points or so? :)
---
Open Fallout 76 and fast travel to Berkeley Springs or Fort Defiance. Have a look around and you should be able to find your very own tin foil hat
---
Still not pay to win. What does this make you win? 
---
Your RuneScape example is wrong btw 
---
Just google pay to win. Its not actually about winning.
---
No way you got xxxtentacion in there I thought he died.
---
I mean I get it, but the initial 100 day road map was itself and entirely advertised as "free". So I was lead to believe that we will in fact have to pay for new dlcs beyond that point, not that they're already needing a money grab. A lot of things have been "not as advertised" to put it nicely though, so it makes sense that they might be harder up for funding than they were hoping for. 
---
It's a balance really: profits equals the means to develop new content, new games, ... Bethesda (as any game company is) is a commercial company, yet that doesn't always have to be a bad thing. How far are you willing to push the monetization however, that's the real question here.
---
Slippery slopes are a logical fallacy but that has no bearing on this situation.
---
Slippery slopes are real even if they are based on flawed human reasoning (I.e. Bethesda May buy into this fallacy).
---
Have you? 
---
Yongyea inbound!
---
Maybe to bring it together with indestructible pacifist camps. Maybe because of screw ups.
---
And not care they breaking promises they made I guess.
---
Stims and radaways are just burdens. You can sell the stims pretty easily if you can take the caps, but radaways are nothing. To the Overseers camp with them. Screws and springs are only problems if you're mass producing weapons to learn mods. I totally get people being pissed that non-cosmetic items are being added to the Atom Store, but the outrage is pretty disingenuous when people claim this is pay to win. 
---
Maybe building a transmitter with a range and allowing people to tune in, with    upgrades to increase the range?
---
It's not a scummy cash grab. You can't expect an online game to be free for everything as it costs money to run the whole infrastructure and we are getting free dlc. As I had stated in my post this is a way for them to keep the game going while also keeping many things free. I've bought atoms because I love this game and want to support it but I've also earned a crapton of atoms lately. 
---
I can see why people are ok with them pushing the release back but I’m more concerned with their inability to properly manage a project. 
---
They’ve been struggling with deadlines from the start, the game at release was the exact same during beta with no update, they couldn’t put together/didn’t have a simple roadmap for bug fixes and content for months, and now can’t stick to the deadlines from the roadmap... 
---
They’ve really got to get their house in order with this. I can’t imagine the community will continue to be excited about features that constantly get pushed back. 
---
Then maybe you should call it what it is. A minor quality of life product that you can get for free. 
---
Yeah, the slippery slope fallacy keeps coming into play, and while I can admit that it SEEMS bad at first glance for Bethesda to be suggesting that necessities such as refrigerators and the like will be in a similar vein, I'm just assuming that they're attempting to lock some recipes behind progression through the story, so say, the events that have been giving atoms can have more purpose than cosmetics that a lot of the playerbase on here have been complaining suck balls. Fallout 76 had been a lot more interesting for me in the early days, when I was unaware I had to read plans and don't know I had the ability to make a chem station and tinker's workbench. Making some progression actually required for cool stuff (much like Power Armor Stations and the rad shower) would be awesome.
---
Do they have more than one munitions factory?
---
To be honest I have never used that perk and hardly repair. With fix it good or whatever it lasts plenty long so I feel like they legitimately felt like that perk just made it take a month before you needed to repair
---
Yeah I’m absolutely crushed right now, honestly. Player Vending has been the one thing I’ve been most excited about in general, so to have it pushed back sucks.
---
Also I wish they would actually give us the real reason for it. I imagine it’s some technical hiccup, which is understandable. But at least level with us on the issue instead of giving a cutesy little fictional explanation.
---
Also as bad as your censor 
---
Fair point.  Condition is a cosmetic issue!
---
I mean honestly, this whole game is "displayed" on a screen, so the whole game is cosmetic!
---
Feel the exact opposite and they even just recently buffed a ton of weapons durabilities
---
I can’t cite a source atm but I was under the impression that all future dlc will be free, I agree that at this point Bethesda should not be hard up for funds to support this game and if they are then it’s their own damn vault for not releasing atomic shop items that people want. 
---
While introducing items in the atomic shop like the repair kits seems like an obvious cash grab geared towards more causal players, I don’t see it as pay to win. I understand that it can be a slippery slope but until I see them suggest something that is actually pay to win, imo, then I won’t be shouting them down. 
---
But like... switch to a different gun... or come prepared with freshly repaired weapons...
---
The problem is that we do not know that this will end up being a pay to win situation in the future. All the things they mentioned are amazing and make sense as an atom shop purchase as it would take longer for them to integrate it into the lore whereas the atom shop stuff doesn't have to be lore bound. 
---
P2W stuff in the atom shop
---
Sappy stuff aside, I’m surprised that there was no reward or achievement for getting in the Top 3 or even the #1 Spot. It’s a little disappointing. 
---
Yeah I still have at least one disconnection/freeze per gameplay. 
---
Last night my game froze after capturing a bunch of workshops and had to restart my computer. The loading screens are crazy long too, upwards of minutes to load. It’s the only game I have these problems with. 
---
did you forget how many times this game sold they have definitely enough to keep the game going besides they will give up on the game when it flops after massive backlash.
---
I actually agree with you on this. I only see my char when I die, so who cares. 
---
Its a term. I didnt invent it. Let me put it this way for u...
---
U have the “perfect” build spent time doing this and that and fixing everything with a pink bow on top
---
Then comes this other guy. He doesn’t play as much as u but he has lot of money.
---
So u guys get in big heated fight.
---
You r like damn I got this guy cause I got my shit all together.
---
The fight goes on and the dude goes invisible and u r like crap where did he go he was almost dead.
---
Dude pops out with freshly repaired armor. Repaired thanks to his credit card.
---
Do I need to continue or do u get the point?
---
A company did research before doing a thing?! *fuckin gasp* No way! They're gonna make a few scraps of money? Monsters! You sit there and act like I'm totally stupid, but I get they need and want money. And I get that they will get some no matter what. But your "one man boycotts do nothing" crap is ridiculous. Reddit is off the charts mad about it so do you really think that the non-redditors are junk junky dory about it? You sound like a "my vote doesn't make a difference" kind of person. 
---
You seem to forget the amount of development time that was paid for upfront that is expected to be made back by sales
---
And I'm not even going to use them. 
---
On ps4 here and I had a lot more trouble around launch been ok for a while, today it just seems particularly bad
---
Yes they usually refund it but ask them quickly. 
---
I don't think anyone here can speak for your brother . If however your brother plays this game and understands how this works he'd realize it isn't pay to win, no matter how badly YouTube wants him to believe it is. 
---
Absolute madlad
---
Yeah and I had kinda been getting the feeling that that's what they're hoping for, but I'm highly doubting it. How could you sustain free dlcs one after the other? That would be hard to do without income. I'm at least glad I can farm in game repair kits, even if they're going to only be tied 3* legendaries and SBQs
---
they sold a lot of copies besides that still dosen't change the fact that they wont be making money from this btw stuff because people will give up on the game I've seen this happen so many times.
---
Dude, I'm on your side with the weapon breakage and stuff but this post is too much... Don't feed the trolls. 
---
Give it a day I’m sure he’ll still be playing, if not you can come quest with me on XB1. This might’ve been just the motivation needed to give the game a break if he’s been playing for 3 months, I find I can get burned out on this game because I play it too much and just need a few days to realize how much I do enjoy certain aspects of it.
---
Let me get this straight...
---
  You weenies are on a subreddit for a game, criticizing people for giving feedback about an implentation coming to said game, THEN bitching about how people are bitching about a game?
---
Take your asses to the "sand in my asscrack" subreddit, or create one, and tf outta here.
---
Don't be another EA games, Bethesda
---
I mean, no subreddit is going to have anywhere even remotely close to 100% of it's subscribers voting on threads. When i say 98% i don't mean literally 160ish thousand people, i meant it in the sense that there's about 98 negative posts/comments about this topic for every 2 positive posts. 
---
ja, i see your point. 
---
and i hate microtrasaction, simly becuase the devs had found a new easier way to make crazy amounts off cash without having to luanch finished or bug free game and they are still charging us full price. but that a topic for and other post.
---
anyways sorry got a bit side tracked.
---
yes we dont know what the en result will at least be not yet, but if it looks like shit and it smells like shit, why would it be anything else than shit, and from the patch notes you can clearly see that the way its going we are heading to P2W, and when or if it happens that will the day im done with fo76.  
---
I know you meant pay to win not btw but this isn't pay to win its pay for convenience. 100% repair packs provide no advantage since they don't give you the overrepair damage boost that the 150% ones do and the only mode you can even pay to win in is survival and that has a slew of other issues that need resolved. In regards to survival no one is going to care about them as once again no damage boost from overrepair
---
Wait has a pay to wn item been added I haven't seen it?
---
The one adult on Reddit... my god we’ve found him...
---
Maybe you would do better in an easier game. Have you tried tiddly winks or maybe Candyland is more your speed. Maybe you shouldn't start random fights with people. And your an idiot if you think that isn't already happening go look at the G2G site and you can buy full sets of armor that you would have had to grind for months to get. Spend $10 and get a AAE handmade. People have been doing this since the games release. I would say that is where your problem is. So let's get rid of player trading since that's how those deals are completed. See where I'm going with this? 
---
The processed food from Sunshine Meadows workshop gives me machine gun diarrhea... does that count?
---
I haven't seen anything in the patch notes saying pay to win at all. The only mode you can pay to win in is survival and that has a whole lot of other issues with it not to mention that basic repair packs provide no benefit to pvpers due to not being able to overrepair and end up losing damage because of it. 
---
I don't know how a repair item (a basic one I might add) is pay to win, when you can get an improved repair kit as a drop in game without spending ATOMs on it. How often do you even repair your stuff realistically? Sometimes I go a whole day or two just fine without it, and repair costs aren't super high as it is. This seems more of a convenience than anything else. 
---
No you just pay money to not have to play the game, and progress faster then those that don't, literally P2W, I know billion dollar company dick feels good, but you are not getting paid to be a free PR person for them, so stop.
---
I called you a hypocrite, after listing lies from bethesda that you don't seem to have any problem with, while you're actively calling out youtubers for "lies" without any actual stated examples. 
---
Amen.  Probably comes from $.  No one who works for what they have is cool with these anti-consumer practices.  I mean if all they gotta do is ask daddy for his credit card, why would they care about p2w?
---
What does that even mean xD
---
Gotcha so lets all just be okay with Bethseda going back on their word.
---
Hey guys since folks use ebay and paypal to cheat. We thought we might as well make some money ourselves.
---
Woot woot loyal fans be damned we will get more!! Specially ones with shiny credit cards. 😍
---
Reddit is a small minority of the player base. If this were a voting issue your statement would make sense, but it's not. Half the posts on here are against your point of view so why would they listen to you when others are openly declaring the are looking forward to giving them money. 
---
Thanks ! Will do it asap. 
---
I disagree, would happily spend my atom on repair kits. 50% of my time in this game is spent on resource gathering for food, drinks, repairs and cores. These repair kits would allow me to actually play the game more and it would make it feel less then a chore to do. 
---
No joke I just move money into my PayPal for this. 
---
It'd be convenient if food buffs, bobbleheads, well rested bonuses, well tuned bonuses, magazines and mentants all lasted twice as long, it's wouldn't give an *advantage* since all those items can be obtained in game, but if they started selling a "2X Duration to buffs" one time purchase on the store people would call it pay to win, even if you're not stronger it saves time, effort, luck, and consequently skill to have such a buff, the advantage isn't that of a numerical, it's an advantage in effort.
---
Have you heard of Classic WoW being released? In Classic consumables were very important, if Blizzard sold potions used for raids on a WoWToken styled store people just wouldn't play the game, because it's pay to win, even if you can get all those potion in game by just farming a bit (or sometimes a lot), that's not because you're stronger, but rather because you have *more time* to become stronger, where other people are gathering you're levelling, since you don't have as much downtime, that is pay to win.
---
The scary thing is as long as these sorts of changes are introduced very slowly, they will continue to make money, they'll try to just about not cross the line by saying "it's in game, not an advantage, doesn't change gameplay or just for convenience" as they slowly ramp up the sorts of things they'll allow on the shop. It's like the idea where you say "is one drop of water deadly?", the other person says no, then you say "what about one more drop of water?", they again say no, you keep doing this bit by bit, one extra drop of water is never deadly... right? Well eventually there's an ocean of these drops that the person added drop by drop, certainly deadly but the incremental increase left no one the wiser, no one saw it coming because they didn't acknowledge each drop.
---
No joke I just moved money into my PayPal for this. 
---
And this latest debacle really puts a shine on the whole "You can't believe a thing said by anyone at bethesda" side of this. 
---
"The atom shop is cosmetic only" is turning into "the atom shop is more than cosmetics". 
---
"We won't do any epic exclusives" might well turn into "We won't do any epic exclusives, you can also get it on our launcher, but steam's out for the moment". 
---
Well put.
---
if you think about it, p2w is giving players the edge by buying microtrasanctions, having to buy from the atom shop and been able to use it anywhere and anytime. is an advantage I for example will not have because im buying any.
---
the idea I find great but it should be a plan you learn on a quest or something not on the shop
---
Yeah, I think im done with the game. Can see which way they want the game to go now.
---
Man, what has happened to Bethesda?
---
Remember back when Fallout 4 and Shelter were announced? Shelter, a free mobile game that can be played offline and none intrusive microtransactions. Fair as the game was free.
---
And Fallout 4, FREE mods for consoles. Amazing. 
---
Look at them since. First there was Creation Club. Basically paid mods. Yes, some were of high quality, but they are paid mods.
---
Also, the beginning of them turning anti-consumer with the bullshit way you have to pay for them. Cant just buy what you want outright, no no no. Have to buy their bull currency so you'd have to overspend to buy what you want. Plus they are all wildly expensive in comparison to DLC prices.
---
Then Fallout 76, "live service" game as they want a piece of that pie instead off a spinoff fallout game.
---
Now the shitshow that is Blades. A complete classic pay to win mobile game. Will not be touching that game in its current state.
---
Now the start of adding none cosmetic items into Fallout 76. 
---
No thank you Bethesda, im done.
---
The rain is occluded in most cases. It’s definitely possibly. Maybe just bugged currently.
---
"Given history for these types of items, the repair kits are going to be extremely hard to get in game."
---
On the contrary actually. In their other game, ESO, repair kits available for a bit of gold at vendors, you get free repair kits from crafting dailies and you get free crown repair kits from login rewards. They are anything but rare. In fact they are piling up faster than you can use them even if you don't buy any from a vendor.
---
So would you prefer that a company that makes a game you enjoy playing doesn't make money? How does that make any sense if you want to keep playing the game since there is no offline to this. 
---
this is only one example besides more will probably come besides the ones with the real voice in this matter aka youtubers and the media because that's how this stuffs works will see this as ptw. It's just not worth it to add stuff that isn't cosmetic to the atomic shop I don't think i'm going to change your mind though so this will be my final message here.
---
Games are supposed to be whatever they are made to be
---
So true, you don't realize how rare waste acid is until you are mass forging 556
---
Except you can get the advanced ones in game so how does that provide an advantage
---
This would be the last straw for me. I will likely not continue playing the game if they implement this. At the very least, I will never give the game another dime.
---
Agreed and not forgetting Fusion Cores, nerfed almost every patch to make you play a certain way.
---
They made guns and armor break faster for balance?
---
They should not drop a bomb like this without explaining their future policy on these sort of items. Is this the first, more to come? 
---
&gt;As we look to the future, we’re exploring ways we can bring other community-driven ideas to the game as well, such as refrigerators for C.A.M.P.s, ammo and food converters, and even the ability to send scrap to your stash without having to head home. Repair Kits are our first attempt at a utility item like this, and we plan to make adjustments based on your feedback, so we hope you’ll share your thoughts with us when they go live later this month. 
---
You gotta send them a msg right away. 
---
Yes cheese
---
I feel like he appears more often at dusk.
---
As a good number of assets from fo4 are in fo76, i wouldn't see why those specific assets would cause issue, however new assets may be a hassel and need some manual coding for fo4.
---
For anything prior, your guess is as good as mine. 
---
I'm not trying to change your mind on the not adding cosmetic stuff I'm trying to get people to back off the posting about it and let the issues that effect the game currently shine through since they now get lost in a sea of hate for something that doesn't even exist yet in anything other than text in a post online. 
---
You completely miss the point.
---
And if you want to be that blind then good for you. You honestly don't think that's them testing the waters for what they can potentially start adding into the store? 
---
You do of course realise that the IMPROVED version of the repair kits are available, to everyone, as an in game drop? This is a basic repair kit option which you can buy from extra atoms that we all make anyway without even trying during our play time. 
---
Yeah, turn our phone to pipboy.. when you take into account that opening pipboy can not stop game it would be very accurate move..
---
*yawn
---
Yup just like making the Creators Club a paid service made everyone leave FALLOUT 4, wait a minute. 
---
Why? Not disagreeing, just curious for the reasoning. If you can earn them in game, i don't see a problem as they don't effect anyone else but the person using it. Actually, even if you can't earn them, you can still repair weapons the old fashion way. 
---
Maybe im missing something....
---
Amen brother, I don't understand at this point in time, with pretty much every developer out there up to shady, anti-consumer practices, how anyone thinks Bethesda wouldn't be doing the exact same shit as BlackOps4 if they could.
---
  Look at how the game launched, look at the timing of the announcement of implementation!  No one with a straight face can tell me they werent in a board room somewhere like, "okay we're getting some good press finally, some players are coming back, I think its time to push "order 66" or whatever this is, they've had up their sleeve...
---
Good man.
---
Fuck cosmetics on video games. So pointless to give up hard earned cash for a costume you usually can't see.
---
Sad to see what is happening to video games, feels bad man.
---
It's so hard to die on this game, we'll never see our "camo suits". The gun skins are ok, but there's like.. 2.
---
Honestly, I think you will need to check for mods to get that experience. I don't think they will make any change that would "reduce" the QoL of 80%+ of the players that don't read this sub and are probably not level 50+.
---
I definitely feel you though. Survival mode + harsh weather would be really immersive :) I spent so much time modding Skyrim to add realistic lightning. Dwelling in those dark underground dungeon with a torch and magelight was so awesome (and dangerous).
---
Unyielding low health build. It's a bit extreme but I run 4 pieces of unyielding and usually have about 300 ap depending on health level.
---
I have not heard a single person defend it thankfully
---
My main is actually melee. Though I do have an easier time in survival on my doom plumber.
---
I think he is referring to the repair kits. Some how they are pay to win now....
---
I think you are asking about cross platform between PC and Xbox? If so then no this isn't possible.
---
These repair kits explain why weapons break so much faster in 76 than 4.  It also explains why buildings are so squishy and difficult to repair partially damaged.
---
If they didnt want to make money on repairs, items wouldn't break so often.  
---
So here we are. Weapons break super fast, and incentivise you to buy repair kits.   I was just playing 4 today and weapons break much much much slower.  Wonder why that is...
---
Yeah, I like vanguard for a sniper. Stick and move, leave the endurance fighting to the tanks. I liked the speed boost from wood armor (float like a butterfly, sting like a radscorpion) but shrouded wasn't giving me as much benefit as muffled legs. I took pockets on the arms so I could throw on Stand Fast without having to ditch one of my guns, but if I really need to dig in for a protracted battle I'll be busting out the X-01. In a perfect world I'm not being shot at all. I've been looking for some nice weightless pieces, but finding +1 STR and -20% ammo weight on mutant-slayer leather fit my loadout too well to pass up. [Legendary, they said.](https://i.imgur.com/CfkeCXX.png) He might have died like Christ, but his heart just wasn't in the right place.
---
He should try and get it changed to CorgiAnusParty69
---
Pick up his eggs. I find when I do I see him more often than not.
---
Weapons don't break super fast. There are perks that minimize weapon breakage and this is not something they even thought about when the game launched. I'm a dataminer and have found nothing in the data about any sort of repair pack whatsoever
---
What half of the posts? I've gone through tons of these and the best one to support your statement merely says "aren't worth while in my opinion". Not even close to what you're saying. Also, if you watched the video Todd was in like last week, they specifically talk about how much they use reddit to see what the players are thinking and asking for. So go ahead and scoff and whatever you want. In fact, fuck it, let Bethesda rape all your wallets so I can keep playing for free. I hope you like what they sell you cuz I'm not putting anymore money into this game (I paid the full 60 bucks for it 2 days before it dropped to 20 anyways, so if they want to make repair kits a shop item because they're crying about money already, tell them they owe me 40 bucks worth)
---
It's starting to sound like you're more mad that people can get a credit card than you are about the actual offing Bethesda is making. You don't need to be angry at Bethesda for your poor credit score. 
---
Well, unless you have some leaked revenue info, your guess is as good as mine. Personally, I don’t think they would risk this backlash if the Atomic Shop was actually bringing in sustainable revenue.
---
And additional content so far has been free, so that’s not doing much for revenue. 
---
becuase I would have to grind for it and you can simply buy them from the atom shop. is that not an advantage?.
---
Or ya know... swap them out when I’m not repairing...
---
Wiffle bat.
---
Be sure to buy that AAE handmade when it goes up on the atomic shop too...
---
At that point its not even a MICROtransaction. 
---
literally impossible as of now
---
That would not surprise me. 
---
You left your camp without repairing so suffer your mistake
---
Yeah, you should only have an advantage if you can play for 16 hours a day.
---
They've said themselves that they use reddit more than any other social media source to look in on what the players want. 
---
The ones that you can get by grinding for repair to 150%. The atom shop ones repair to 100% which provides no advantage other than the weapon not breaking. Overrepairing boosts the damage on weapons and resistances on armor. Unable to overrepair with basic repair packs. 
---
The hero we need but don't deserve 
---
I don't get it. Why are people crying? It literally adds nothing bad to the game. They arent increasing weapon breakage (in fact, it's the opposite), you can still repair the regular way, you can still fast travel for free to your camp to repair, you can still earn around every day and week,  AND you earn super repair kits by killing SBQs....so wtf is the actually problem here?
---
They released a set of costumes and if at least one other person in your party was wearing an item from the set, you all got a health bonus (or maybe just the ones wearing the costume). It's small, but this is where its going
---
You know its not per character right, its per account, tryst me, i tried making a new character to try it and farm atoms
---
They really didn’t man they’re grasping at straws. White knight legitimately made you go a month before you needed to repair your armor lmao
---
I love wood for he raw stealth. But the lack of 2-3⭐️ is crippling. I tried a set of it with its only mod and while I could do really well with both gun and blade but hindered with more effects. 
---
I just need more to help deal better damage and a way punch through armour. 
---
It's "pay to win" waaaahhh...bullshit.Wheres the advantage???
---
If he thinks the sbq is an elite challenge he lacks the brain power to play this game in the first place haha
---
Lol ok try a heavy build and tell me they dont break fast.  They're literally unviable as a build because of it.  Why so you think everyones running around with melee and rifles.
---
The interesting weapons are now paywalled.  
---
How much for single action revolver and aa sledge
---
Save your money for something Bethesda puts out that you like. That will directly show them what you as a consumer will and wont spend your money on. 
---
Maybe you should just uninstall Fallout and wait for something you actually might enjoy playing. You should try ANTHEM, The Division 2, maybe Battlefield. Not like any of the other AAA titles have microtransactions for game altering items or require insane playtime to earn something. 
---
Where?
---
I don't mind the prices. Because they are clearly targeting the egotistical rich folk that want everything now. Whereas because you can earn atoms while playing im happy to grind a little to get something I want as I see it as an extra since its cosmetic.
---
However, with the introduction of none cosmetic, that's a no. Now these same rich kids can get seriously tanked up on repair kits. It doesn't matter how small, there is still an advantage there that they will have over me. 
---
Why would you need to?
---
I see plenty of heavys and they literally just buffed that so it doesn't break as fast. When was the last time you played the game? 
---
Wish I knew. 
---
Thank you! I've been going back and forth with a guy for hours trying to explain all this and he just wants to babble on and on about how wrong I am. It's nice to see some sanity on our side of the field. 
---
Or maybe u should get out from hiding in the bunker and join the fight.
---
How is it pay-to-win? What’s this game’s “win” condition? This is just trivial QoL stuff. 
---
I feel you.
---
Not gonna lie, I've spent a little money on shitty p2w phone games and I've always felt a little dirty about it even though it's usually less than $20.
---
In contrast, I've probably dropped over $200 on Rocket League's loot crates and really don't feel too bad about it. The difference is that they are strictly cosmetic and the money helps go towards funding their esports tournaments. Also, even after paying all that money I still suck at the fucking game, haha, but I still play nearly every day.
---
Games just lose their fun when you can pay to win them.
---
Fuck bethesda and fallout 76 trash ass game
---
I'm just here eating bread at 5 am and reading comments
---
lucky me no one will notice xd
---
Yeah why would they force us to buy repair kits!
---
I know he was level 300 but that seems like a lot of chems almost like they were duped because even if you had accumulated that much through game play you would of been using them as you go?
---
And then you have to take into account it was probably only about half what he has on him
---
I don't know why that made me laugh so much
---
That is my prerogative. I haven't been playing as much and there were some items that were either on sale and were being taken off the shop that I wanted. 
---
I have no problem for microtransactions in games aa long as it is for things like skins or other stupidity that I may want to use on my characters. I do not purchase PTW items, and frankly, I do not play those games. 
---
Also if we spend a little, that helps keep the companies from dropping further dlc or updates etc. 
---
If you don't like that, honestly, I couldn't give a rat's ass in hell what you like or don't like. Don't worry about what I do. 
---
Exactly. Remember the outrage when CC was announced? We were all going to boycot it, leave the game, ... and we didn't. I wouldn't be surprised if CC might well have been a test in itself for expansion in future games, like we have the Atom Shop now. 
---
Agreed completely , but I don’t think it’s only that which is making people upset , it’s more the idea that Bethesda have stated in the past how the atom shop will be purely cosmetic , yet they go and add something which isn’t, and if they can do this then they can add more.
---
Good point, but if I had to be held to all the shit like that I've said, I'd owe the world quite a few left nuts.
---
I dumped loads of money into atoms literally the day before they announced this, purely because I wanted to support the game further since the keys have gotten so cheap it hardly seems sustainable for further development. I'll be really bummed out if they're going to be charging money to fix annoyances in the game that should have been patched for free.
---
I don't get it, why not just add better cosmetics to the shop so we don't feel like we're throwing money at them just for the sake of it? A lot of the stuff they're selling is just silly, I'm sure I'm not the only one who'd rather have more lore-friendly stuff that help with immersion rather than take away from it.
---
Again with this assumption of my gaming. I have killed so many SBQs that it provides me no joy any longer. I got tired of carrying 9 other players through a 5 min Queen fight (my approximate average time). Just because you haven't figured out how to play this game does not mean we are all as bad as you at it. 
---
Repair kits r only the beginning. Next will be special nuka-xp, or ammo pack. Special week only guns..
---
This is a test. Plain and simple.
---
I'm willing to bet that have been forbidden from replying about this.
---
Give this man 10 million karma. Thank you so much idk why I didn’t see it but at least now I can become a better BoS 
---
Today.  
---
"You see heavys"  ok try playing one.  It's a bitch and a half, you only bring out the heavy guns in group events, which is why you see them, and rely on shotguns/melee most the time bc problems.
---
I did i bought the survival camo bundle and id buy another bundle but im saying i dont mind paying to keep the game alive just give me something for my money. Like eso plus it never broke the games economy and people pay for it everyone wins.
---
Ok well I understand where u coming from, but I feel like that they can at least add stuff too the atom shop that doesn’t effect anything when players are interacting with other players. (Aka no weapon mods or weapons / Armor or Armor mods. And no traps/base defences) if the items bought effect inventory and stuff then it won’t bug me because it doesn’t leave a mark on me as a player. I’ll bring ur point up a bit if u want but I’m gunna show my view of it aswell.
---
again becuase I will have to grind for it and you can just buy it. 
---
Games that let you buy better gear or allow you to make better items then everyone else at a faster rate and then makes the game largely unbalanced even for people who have skill in the game without paying.
---
This isnt my post. Its about u bud. Mister I played 600hrs and never broke a gun. 
---
Can some one, ANYONE, explain to why in the ever-loving fuck, are people calling basic repair kits pay-to-win?
---
WILL LOOT
---
FOR SCREWS!!!
---
farm wendigo? Someone posted a location near the red rocket mega stop that spawns two wendigo. You could server hop.
---
Also, tag just screws for search when you go out looting. You may be surprised what has a screw in it. Mr Handy Fuel, Industrial Oil Co tainer, Tongs, Pepper Grinder.
---
Anyone else have any surprising screw loots?
---
But you are getting an inferior version from he atom shop. You literally get no advantage other than not being entirely broken
---
Unless you just started to play, instead of repair kits just check a map with weapons/armor benches. I know by heart all those around Watoga up to the Ferry. And ofc Whitespring. Why would I ever need repair kits? I don't even need them during the Queen fight using a heavy gun.
---
Word , I’m not really against repair kits but i think the community need to be outraged as it shows that the community isn’t accepting of pay to win , before the above starts happening.
---
Ohhhh yeah. Forgot about that.
---
Robobrains have an imbiding hole...

“All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76–all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff–is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand–look there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.”
---
This guy letterkennys
---
If you put it that way, it looks like fallout 76 aimed to be garbage and it achieved that in every possible way. Great approach for the entire industry.
---
While you're gone research what pay-to-win is, research some examples (looking at you Activision and EA), and we will see you in a month. Dont let the door hit ya.
---
I’m complaining about the overall lack of moderators in this subreddit. If enough people have a complaint and an immediate response to something recently released, like this one, I think they should post about it and improve visibility. 
---
The problem for me are the hundreds of reposts of requests for QoL/content improvements that have been acknowledged by Bethesda but people post anyway. I think it takes away from the more pressing problems of bugs and new ideas that might be overshadowed by the 500th ‘we want more stash’ post. 
---
Like the problem with the Italian localization that was overshadowed by 30 ‘scorchbeasts are boring’ posts. 
---
Perks can be nerfed. How soon we forget White Knight perk?

[Inside the Vault](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7DVp0EfSlQgspUWrcMzI1O/untitled-entry-2019-01-31-at-03-26-29)
---
Things change, what happens if they are not selling any? Do they balance the game to make it harder to repair in game, still possible but not as many items lying around. Look how they nerfed Fusion Cores almost every patch to make you play a certain way.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers. 
---
thIs gAMe BaD. Great input.
---
Lol as they make energy weapons, literally, 5 times more durable. 
---
Oh you mean the 3 day sale before the price went back to normal? Oh boohoo I missed a sale. By that logic Nvidia owes me a stack of games for the graphics card I bought before they made the sale deal. You're selfish and self centered thinking that your are right above all else and the people that enjoy this game and are exited about the new additions are wrong. If you are that hard up for money maybe you shouldn't be spending it on games in the first place. 
---
To be fair I’ve seen multiple posts on this subreddit in regards to this, if you ask me to cite them I obviously won’t be able to drudge them up but they do exist I promise you. It definitely wasn’t something the whole community was clamoring for but did receive a fair share of upvotes to where I believe it could’ve gotten noticed by a community manager and passed along.
---
"scrolling looking for trades" despite the multitude of FO76 trade subreddits?
---
The dome only gave me 9 shots, there's really no other way to use the thing.
---
there is the fact that for one they said atomic shop would ONLY be cosmetics and apparels then they had a month long event or so that made it so you oculd geta minor buff by wearing cosmetics  
---
Yeah, it's pretty tense in survival as a Melee Stealth. I usually try sneaking up on people at claimed workshops.
---
Zoinks
---
Didn't say never broke a gun just that I learn early how to maintain my gear. 
---
Oh you k ow what it means. I think the soilent  has gone rancid.
---
Things I would wait 3 months for: my tax returns, receiving credit hours, training programs for my career.
---
If that’s how you enjoy your games I guess I don’t have a counterpoint. I prefer to have fun with my games instead of working a second job.
---
Just remember you have already spent money on this game and you as a customer should be respected for your business.
---
I said a similar thing when the Unstoppables outfits were in the store, but nobody seemed to mind or care.  Only 10 HP and only for limited time, but it was, and is, a slippery slope.  It was a little dabble in non-cosmetic items - "Can we get away with this?"  Here's another dabble, slightly bigger.  "Can we get away with this?" they're probably asking again.  That's up to you guys.
---
And don’t be foolish to think it’s gonna get worse
---
That's what I'm doing again. I did that after launch and came back when the Wild Appalachia content started coming out and now I guess I'm boycotting this thing once more.
---
Derk a durrrr
---
That is very thoughtful of you, thank you.
---
Except those “free” atoms from dailies dry up &amp; stop for majority of the challenges.
---
I know because I’ve done majority of the challenges.
---
Which means after the challenges are done, one can earn a mere 50+ atoms for dailies, &amp; 100+ for weeklies.
---
Eventually, the game is designed ALREADY to get people to buy atoms by drying up the challenge atoms &amp; releasing limited time items that players can’t always have enough atoms saved up.
---
They also are now releasing bundles with a set price range. Get ‘x’ amount of items for 1500 atoms but you might only want one that previously would’ve cost much fewer atoms.
---
I don’t mind either way, I play hard, have earned well over 60-70$ worth of atoms and have bought nearly that amount as well.
---
If Bethesda rigs item durability to promote repair kit sales, that’s pretty shitty.
---
The repair kits should be an optional purchase that isn’t forced by shady durability,
---
If they are simply a faster way to repair with no changes to durability, they in no way ruin the game, nor are they pay to win, they are pay to repair &amp; save time.
---
Pay to win would be a high damage weapon that not everyone had access to due to lack of atoms/funds.
---
Not a shortcut on repairing. A shortcut on repairing will still require menus, making it kind of wonky to use in PvP &amp; PvE.
---
hey you too! :)
---
How do repair kits break the economy? There are people all over reddit crying about how they refuse to buy them, which is fine, because that is the community that will keep the economy alive with the introduction of repair kits. So it's kind of funny actually. If EVERYONE bought them, it would destroy a significantly small part of the economy and Bethesda might have to intervene.
---
Btw, non of this was directed at you personally in an offensive manner. I was referring to the community at large in a rationale debate :)
---
My point exactly. These are inconsequential additions and all the complaining is childish. 
---
This is so hurtful.
---
Because they are bandwagoning morons.
---
My melee weapon broke once, in a nuke zone, after killing a hundred glowings.
---
Be responsible, and fix your shit before leaving home.
---
As if any of these whiners even pvp. Most the folks that pvp are harder people. Less emotional, crybaby types. PvP'rs won't whine about this shit, they will like it, it would help them, if their weapon EVER broke. Lol.
---
If it's pay to win in pvp, that would suck. It isn't  AT ALL though. It ain't buying big ass crazy guns and hardcore armor, it's fixing a weapon, that would have killed you 30 times already.
---
Just reddit things, I guess.
---
Yea it's a little disheartening, it does seem they lack some proper leadership that would take a few risk, instead of falling back on easy to implement P2W, hopefully the community will let them know this is the direction they should pull the game if they want it to grow(which I would very much like). 
---
Im not crying you're crying.
---
I had only one drop: Adrenal Reaction.
---
It's almost as if the people hating this don't grasp that if people like a game then they'll enjoy spending money on it. I did it for Pokémon Go and that was 100% pay to win, in the exact same vein as this. Do I care? Fuck no. I enjoyed the game so I spent money on it. Bethesda is offering fuckloads of DLC for FREE. Even IF it's just buying items with atoms and not, as I've said before, trying to add some progression to the game and lock at least one of the big things behind a progression wall by requiring the challenge atoms, I'm not gonna give a fuck. I won't buy it simply because I don't need it, not because it's a bad thing to pay devs who are still working on a game and have plans to do so for the rest of the year.
---
Here’s one thread from November 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9uzvou/craftable_repair_kits/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Despite the dv, i still gave you an up! On the real, have a good night man. It's bed time lol
---
How did you know my name? Do we know each other? Are you from spin class?
---
Yeah, defending the atom shop just became impossible lol
---
I got a Legendary Insult Bot. No insult, but I did get a shitty Exterminator’s leg or something. 
---
 Only by going into the shop and scrolling through the items. It will say owned if you already have it and it will even show no longer available owned items. 
---
Well paying money to literally circumvent game mechanics, thus saving time that can be used for other thing is literally the definition of P2W.
---
I get that corporate dick feels nice, but please stop fucking yourself over with naivety. 
---
Omg u still dont get it. Its not about “repair kits”. Its the fact Bethseda broke their word.
---
Its not going to stop here. Once non-cosmetics items are there the door is open for more. Just wait till that uber one time only gun appears. Or 300% xp boost...
---
If u open the door, you cant stop more from coming. The community is trying to keep that door closed. 
---
Just stop playing Fallout 76, sorted 
---
'You're welcome' 
---
Because Reddit is the only place they get their information from. 
---
Bethesda said they would only add COSMETICS to the shop, but now they're adding helpful items.
---
try read the 50 fucking posts on the front.
---
I didnt say anything about repair kits so get that cancer the fuck on. Im trying to give them my money but i want to decide how i give it to them
---
Like if these come out and they reduce durability a week later, then i get it. Still not ptw, but it's some fuckery and i wouldn't be too happy either. But right now, give them a bikini and tuck them in tight, because we dont want to hear their crying while we are grinding nuke zones all night. 
---
Thanks mate ! I just submitted a ticket. Hope everything goes well. :P
---
Ad hominem is just going to make you feel like a moron with no real arguments.
---
yes that is true, 
---
but it doesnt change the fact the you still have to buy it. 
---
like i said i think its a good idea to fix your stuff on the go, but been in the atom shop is for me the problem. 
---
yes it is inferior but you can get it whenever you want (given you have the atmos), were for example i would have to go kill the SBQ. 
---
I get what your saying and maybe they will never realase it on the atom shop.  with that they did it with the unstopable and now the repair kit, i just want them to keep what they said about the atom shop been purely cosmetics. repair kits are not. and if we dont say something, more than likely it will continue to happen. I for one dont want the FO76 to turn P2W
---
If only. 
---
Yussss. Lol.
---
I have spent a reasonable amount on the Atom store, mainly for CAMP items, but this baffles me.  
---
Why can't repair-kits be a craftable? Why can't you drop them?  
---
Depending on what their weight will be, I don't see us carrying too many of these, I will be repairing back at my CAMP as per usual.
---
Lol so you are admitting to going batshit over literally semantics????
---
Because i have 100 pounds of magazine and bobbleheads that i won't to use and display. And a bit of junk too. They are too heavy i don't have space in the stash.
---
It's in your brain, man. Fire it up ;p
---
I don't think people that bring up PR on this sub know what PR is, or what PR representatives actually do.
---
I was in the 'meh' camp with this to be honest, but you mentioning the durability nerf, White Knight being my most hated, this possible Atom item suddenly makes complete sense. 
---
It is in fact the other way around. Those supermen playing PvP are those that, when you kill them (how can you kill me since I am the best anyway?), on PS4 start herassing you on PSN.
---
Got it. Like i said, it wasn't directed at you. But as the hot topic of debate is currently on repair kits, i assumed. I apologize.
---
Yeah I'd like to see some more cool shit too. They did say that they have the fridge and nuka-door coming though! That'll have my money for sure. 
---
I can’t speak for all the ppl on this sub but I work in PR ;-) 
---
Judge: On what grounds are you filing for divorce?
---
Person: Bethesda
---
Why not both? 
---
I'm on PS4 I'd take 500
---
The OP farmed 5K+ upvotes, so there's that.
---
If you’re offline it’ll only show you the items you already have, I guess shut down your internet to see.
---
was it worthwhile coming back for wild appalachia?
---
reappear after 1 hours  ...
---
Bye then :)
---
The reason matters little so long as its final implementation is good.
---
Don’t listen to the backlash Bethesda. Buying a repair kit barely impacts the game for anyone else besides the player who purchases it. If anything this is a welcomed addition that will greatly help with the flow of gameplay by allowing the player to skip the search for materials to repair.
---
Laws :) LOL
---
Done! 
---
It's because of crybabies like you that I am going to buy as many repair kits as possible. I'm not even going to use them. I just like the idea of you being angry about an item that ISN'T REAL. 
---
I play pc my dude, I have both consoles, but lots of fps's and 4k and all that jazz, is where it's at. The consoles are for my 5 year old ;p
---
No way to harass me after I murder yer video game character; p
---
DEEPERINO!
---
That 30 seconds it takes to find a work bench and repair an item is really going to push those level 600s above and beyond this guy...i forget, how does this effect anyone in a game that it wont matter in pve and pvp fights end in 1-2 hits, again? 
---
I have heard of people getting items refunded from atom shop so you should be good. 
---
Please don’t listen Bethesda. This is not a bad addition.
---
If social media has taught me anything it's that conflated bullshit is great for farming stuff like that.
---
No need to be sorry everyone has an opinions.
---
Id love any nuka too. "Shut up and take my caps" lol
---
Exactly, do you really think a for-profit company cares about people who aren't going to pay them for Stuff. 
---
Try reading Bethesda’s statement where improved repair kits are earned free in game, and you can use the atoms your earn by play to pay for the standard ones again being free, and any player who has built a character up won’t even need them 
---
And maybe consider that a flow of income is required to keep the game running with new free dlc and the team that fixes the bugs and the team that handles all the tickets that are sent in for help or even the electricity bill to run the servers 
---
Try using your fucking brain and look to the big picture, you don’t want to buy atoms don’t do it play the game earn them free better yet do a junk run, make sure your gear is fixed up before a big quest 
---
Guess who is blowing this out of proportion?  All of you.  That's who. 
---
Maybe you know, because i can't figure it out and OP is doing his own thing there.
---
Hahahahahahaha.
---
As if this game would somehow redeem itself if this doesn't happen
---
Time to take things in a new direction. 
---
basiclly repair kits from FNV but for armor and weapons basic version is atomic shop item you buy advanced one that gives extra durability on weapons is obtained frm high level things like SBQ kills and such
---
Can we exchange Reddit upvotes in the Atom Store? :D
---
"No longer available owned items"?!?
---
I buy something and Bethesda takes it away after that?
---
If that is the case this Shop is even worse than I thought.
---
I have the attention span of a goldfish thank you very much. I am vastly superior to the gnat peasants. 
---
I carry multiple guns. Think i have time to repair a gun in the face of a SBQ?! Get outta here with that, brotha. Im slayin shit.
---
That's a Todd Howard question. If he says yes I recommend saving your upvoted to buy repair kits.
---
I hope they stay greedy. More money hires better writers, actors, animators, choreographers ect.
---
Better games come from greed.
---
Mo money=less problems ;p
---
I have as well. Plenty of times. Someone feed him shut up juices.
---
Actually it's the smaller community complaining, hardly all players use Reddit. And not even all of those care.
---
I'm on the fence, I did not mind the P2W in ESO, the current plan is minor, and it will mostly depend on how hard it will be to grind for these things. If it will become tedious or unmanageable + a big benefit I'll pick a side.
---
The current state does not bother me (yet).
---
No longer available to buy. As in items that were limited time or have since been retired. You can still use them if you bought them. 
---
True.
---
Been on here for about 2 and 1/2 months and seen at least 15 post asking for them, now shut up.
---
consider this though did warframe have a game in prior series that had this exact feature but decided to make it premuim store only for the basic version?
---
Next patch, buy unsellable weapons in the Atom store.
---
But really, you're right. A small suggestion, once we're able to rename weapons and armor in the up coming patch, put a ! or z in front of things you don't sell to put them at the top or bottom of your items list. It's not the best fix but it's a good solution in the interim.
---
Forcing you to spent money to skip annoying parts of game. Dude. 
---
I’m on it, though I’ve got my eye on that new fashionable hat to wear in this apocalyptic hellscape, because reasons.
---
Having over 400+ hours played, I still don't see what this "win" condition is. Repair kits just seem to be a convenience. Resources and crafting stations seem to be everywhere
---
latest blogpost
---
A goldfish a vertebrate. You are inherently superior.
---
#priorities
---
Reddit is not "larger community".
---
Maybe try dropping something and see if it respawns the bag next time. Might work
---
There is no such thing as pay to win in this game.  We have all already lost. 
---
Mobs of children dressed up as adults have tantrums is what MMOs are all about.
---
If you aren't going to wear power armor IMO you are better off going with a unarmed build and using a bloodied power fist or deathclaw gauntlet. I can suggest a build for that or a 1H build if you like?
---
I think you need to sleep on dirty bed in the mire area for swamp itch
---
Can something that repairs your weapons to a weaker state than you can manually really be called a QOL item?
---
Ah, the sweet smell of validation. 
---
Bring it all on. I make bank irl and don't have time to farm. Gimme da loot! Release the paid cracken!
---
"But most people don't have money to spend on microtransactions "
---
Well, they have time, from sitting at home all day, with no job. So grind it out, lazy boys ;p
---
I know there is different cases and that we aren't all in those categories (college students and whatnot).
---
But I am. So take my money!
---
BFG 9000 please. $50. Heh.
---
Exactly. This seems like they were dipping their toe in the water to test it with The Untouchables stuff, and as people didn't mind it they are diving in to extract more cash from the dying player base.
---
theres still the fact that this feature existed in prior installments without making you pay for each kit
---
Don't forget dlc are free and these bitches moaning at what, how are they supposed to keep the servers up with out some sort of funding
---
As someone who doesn't have 16 hours to play a day, yes, you should. I wouldn't go play basketball with someone who plays it every day then get upset that they're better at it than me. And I certainly wouldn't then want to be able to pay for a shorter, bigger hoop that only I can use so I could be on their level.
---
Thinking you're entitled to winning in a video game because you have money and don't have the time to "git gud" is obscene. It's the epitome of entitled.
---
Yeah I’ve been trying to find the whoopsies for a minute, I’ve been drinking out the stream and sleeping in the dirtiest places I can find and I know some day I’ll be lucky enough to complete that challenge. Lmk if you find out a specific place to catch it tho plzz
---
Ah will try!
---
Will update if I catch it :)
---
It really makes no sense. A repair kit would be cool as a craftable item but as atom shop items?? I really don't understand the decision but I'm sure the public outcry will sway their decision.
---
Honestly I just watch the laymen and skillup as semi serious game news reporting YouTube channels
---
The rest are comedy
---
The feature didn't exist in any prior Fallout game that was online. I'm not for or against the repair kits. I'll never use them to repair my weapons to less than I can manually but if people want to pay to be weaker, all the power to them. Might make cosmetics cheaper in the long run.
---
How can people actually support this sort of post. Saying that people should have jobs so they can afford these microtransactions. It's idiotic and pages the way for game Devs to charge money for items that should have been in the 60 euro game to begin with 
---
but like I said if they implement them like the fermenter (which already has a interface that sounds like it's intended for display cases) they won't help you as they'll be tied to your stash too
---
so when your stash is full you won't be able to put something in
---
Thx, heat flashes makes me think Ash Heap for sure, but idk where I got it. Maybe the burning mine 
---
Nobody is forcing anyone to do anything.
---
It's the capitalist way.

Id up vote again if i could

It means his name is Theodore and should have stayed at Longneck Lukowski's.

If we hadn’t paid for the game, then fine, but we did. 
---
Yesterday I found two players sitting at the lemonade vendor in survival mode. Killed them both and then bought the lemonade recipes myself. #thuglife
---
Yeah that’s what I was thinking too
---
they did that for lunchboxes though silently quite likely 
---
im down to help, shot me a pm my xbox id is the same as here.
---
I dont see why they mention its pay to win because it isnt. Just like you said repairing is easy and quick. However this guy is right also, imagine grinding for them plans, that legendary gear and then just have them selling it in the atom shop.
---
They may be testing community feedback but they damn sure know people will buy these repair kits and its just a poor choice. And with fallout having a TON of poor choices in development and whatnot i doubt this is the way to go
---
7 &amp; 7 
---
Yikes some people really need to chill 
---
They saw what happened with EA's *sense of pride and accomplishment* and don't want a soundbyte assigned to them and memed. That's my guess. They will wait for it to quiet down and then address the complaints as a whole instead of 100 separate posts.
---
You should’ve just got a notification 
---
Except Reddit is where they get most of their community feedback. They even glossed over that fact at Pax East. 
---
You go to twitter. The evidence has shown me that this community is being heard.

Repairing when playing pvp has got that bad I'm buying bulk from train station vendors.  It's all geared up for us to have a stack of repay kits and not have to worry about it for a while. Won't be buying any that's for sure. 
---
I don't understand because I'm innocent.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Exactly! XD 
---
And if you wanna say how you felt about it : EA
---
Thats a really good idea. Have my upboat.
---
Just a thought...if the launch fiasco upset the finances of the game,expected gross income from sales,then maybe the viability of FO76 as online game is in danger. Just a thought...I mean those servers don't turn themselves on and off/maintain themselves. To be honest I'm more upset with the generally very high prices of the atom shop!!
---
Then patch the repair kits into the game as plans you can find and then craft once known. No issue with having repair kits in game, but huge issue with Bethesda going back on their promise of only cosmetic items being in the Atom Shop
---
Yeah I am probably overly dramatic, but it is just because I love the game, and don't want to fucked by one decision Bethesda makes.
---
The longer they wait to release actual good items that people want then the less money they’ll make. I bet when they released the new skin for the excavator armor alongside the lever action skin they had a massive up spike in purchases. Now just imagine if they released the ranger armor and skins for the handmade and shotguns at the same time? I bet a lot of players would’ve bought atoms after they ran out.
---
I love my grognak too (a 3\*\*\*) and i agree its so annoying that after a few hits needs repair (even though i also repair my guns with 200% condition perks). I hope they fix it soon. 
---
Carry no valuables and dump your caps into a mule, then have fun, die with impunity.
---
I think it’s good that so much people complain ... if anyone of Bethesda goes to f76 on Reddit they see this and can’t unsee it haha 
---
I never lost my trust in them but now I do if that’s really gonna happen ...
---
No profit from game = servers shut down.
---
It worked with the seasoned event, they added a pay to win element and they learned from our reaction
---
This is an old post but thought i throw in my tip if someone stumbles on this post.. There is no reason you can't have both now that we have had our stash size increased couple of times. Just get another chest and put other mod on it and throw it to stash. Change when you feel like it / need it.
---
No not to my knowledge, it does seem like the repair kits will be able to tho.. not trying to spark a fire with that comment lol but it’s true.
---
That's a great news ! Thanks again for the info.
---
The god damn face paints that was datamined in the first patch ive been waiting months
---
Wait, you're saying that people either have lots of free time or lots of money from working? What world do you live in
---
Except that this has nothing to do with getting good. It’s a grind for gear, junk and levels, with no skill involved, and it scales linearly with the time you put into it. Time is, *literally*, a currency. 
---
So far ive found none you have to wait until it brakes completely before fixing very annoying
---
yeah I got it. 
---
so the junk and chems you lose are only from your inventory, not your stash box?
---
Well, if that's true then clearly Bethesda has a lot of issues to sort out because that's ridiculous. There was no server lag though, I don't buy that for a second, never happened with any other player I've encountered except for him.
---
Perhaps you want to explain this supposed OP build you keep talking about? What armor and perks make it impossible to be killed? Because we should all be using it
---
I'm going to be doing the same thing. The map is so large with a small amount of players so it should be possible.
---
If you stash all your junk and aid items you can't lose them when you die. Stay away from the train stations and expect all players to shoot you on site. The only remaining problem is the caps lost on death, which can get quite expensive if you keep dying over and over again. It depends on your level, you will lose twice as many caps as your level. You could bank the caps on a friends character. I'm going to spend all my caps before I start as I am quite low on caps already and I can make some civil war hats to keep on me in case I need some quickly.
---
I just posted this same thing even after reading your post. Take my upvote!
---
do you care about the fact that they said "the atomic shop will only sell cosmetic items and they will not affect gameplay" this breaks that promise if it does go through what would stop them from selling lootboxes or other things which effect the gameplay more significantly?
---
They could charge 10,000 atoms for the app. 
---
I think I’d be happier with a FO76 premium subscription. Similar to ESO for ten dollars a month I’d get like 1500 atoms and a unlimited weight, junk only stash. ESO gives you a bunch of crowns and a craft bag a ton of people have it. I’d prefer that then the pay to win. Soon it will be experience boosters and loot drop chance boosters.
---
200% also give you bonus (damages, armor)
---
those 100% repair kits are \*pay to loose\*, literally.
---
people needs to calm down a sec
---
To me this isn't even about the pay to win aspect. Its taking a lot of the complaints we've made here, like food spoiling, and monetizing on it. Truly messed up. Just when it was statting to get some positive press
---
you mean spend actual money..... or do I detect a hint of sarcasm here.
---
personally..... I've got along quite happily repairing my weapons at a bench.Get the perks to repair them at 200%.......simples.
---
They messed up when they introduced the atom shop in the first place, cosmetic only or not, it's unacceptable for a AAA paid title. Making exceptions to this is how it's seeped so deep into gaming industry now.
---
BETHESDA PLEASE NOTICE THIS 😂
---
Make sure you drop all your caps and aid to alt/friend/stash. 
---
There are three types of players in survival according to my observations:
---
The pros, the marauders, and the survivalists.
---
As a pro, I am only interested in fighting other pros. I actively jump between servers looking for the ones that spam you with lots of kill notifications. I ignore level 20 leaders hoping they do the world a favor and die to mobs, my favorite dish is roasted spawncamper. I'm not shooting any lowlevels who did not entered an area which should be considered pros warzone. Warzone is warzone. Level 15 dude might be scout. Rotating dead body might be tactical advantage of enemy team.
---
The marauders would like to PvP but came alone and dont know how. They are the guys that bought themselves items based not on research but what everybody else buys, keep complaining there is zero balance whatsoever, keep complaining that game where you die as soon as you expose yourself lacks any tactical aspect (fucking idiots, I can't believe how stupid this worldview is, especially talking about a game where map control means EVERYTHING). They jump to adventure when they meet the pros. They enjoy spawnkilling.
---
The third group are survivalists. They are here for PvE fallout with triple thrill. As long as you stay away from train stations and keep dying every 30 minutes to make sure you are not on leaderboars, you can easily exp for hours without meeting other players. Just make sure to die near your camp and far away from stations to keep your loot safe.
---
I figure the larger community isn't going to care. What will make the difference will be the atom cost they put on it. If they put a large price on it people will get upset. Personally, I don't care, I'll get the improved kits from the sbq runs that I'm already doing anyway. 
---
\^ That.
---
If I have understood correctly the 'penalty' for not being able to cover 'the cost of one's death' is reduced damage to other players, which is to say no penalty at all if you are there just for the XP bonus.
---
Just make sure that your CAMP is devoid of anything breakable for extra peace of mind.
---
I might take the opportunity to level a few mules myself this weekend.
---
Bethesda gets bigger participation numbers for the Survival mode, I get significantly faster XP and PvP players get  a sitting duck to shoot at. Everyone wins?
---
If you havin problems I feel bad for ya son, I got 99 problems but my gun ain’t one
---
They buffed energy weapons cuz they broke so incredibly quick
---
Quick! Put your platform before you get a sarcastic reply :-)
---
So why doesn't that calculation work for anyone else? I don't see anyone else getting that treatment.
---
I'll send you a link to them, I have them on one drive and for some reason I can't find a way to upload them. I don't care whether I'm a fool or not, if anyone had to deal with this ridiculous bullshit in any other PVP game they would say the same thing 
---
A big Yes to the end part. 
---
I wish people would upvote the first anti repair kit post and keep the discussion there. I feel like people are creating new ones just to get karma or something. I want to ignore this sub.for several days and hope it stops because it seems like there is no interesting discussion about other topics.
---
Battlefront 2 is amazing now btw, u should check it out. Quite often goes on sale as low as £5
---
For real money. Not to use. I don't need them. They are pointless. But if it pisses off the children of r/fo76 it will make me smile. 
---
K
---
I might recommend calling Xbox support for that one. 
---
Not had any updates as of the email last year that was for the submitted ticket of a bad replacement 
---
Great to see. I'm going to try the same thing this weekend. Might even set off a nuke at whitesprings for some classic glowing ones XP.
---
No worries, adding you now :)
---
If they release any noncosmetic thingy I'm never purchasing Atoms again, ever. Matter of principle. I buy cosmetic stuff as game evolves because this is how I express my appreciation towards the progress of a game, and I never use in-game purchases that change the math anyhow. I'm not sure if I'd drop out of the game for those idiotic repair kits but chances are I would.
---
Thats exactly what bothers me about this game. I tried alot of stuff with the current building mechanics, but every camp i made looks like a box from the outside or isnt usable from the inside. 
---
My main problem is that i like to build small. I would like to See a round staircase that fits on one Foundation or a Smaller Fusion generator with half the energy supply. Additionally half Walls, half foundations and a Water and Food supplies that dont have to be outdoors (planters, indoor Waterpurifier). I would consider all of this basic stuff but Bethesda seems to be to lazy to add things like these.
---
So the longer you live, the higher you'll rank on the leaderboard? So I'll just kill myself every half an hour to avoid that... Thank you! :D
---
I very firmly do not want any sort of payment incentive for game play progress. I'm cool with cosmetics but anything that even starts going down the road of p2w is not my thing. Bethesda are just becoming another EA the way this is going. 
---
They look cooler so that’s reason enough to use them. Looking cool is more important than performance. Just look at everyone’s computer. They don’t add rgb for the stats. 
---
I'd love to be able to use my phone as a companion app. Use as my pip boy, talk, trade or even access the atomic shop etc.
---
there is a pool above the tunnel entrance just south of watoga,almost at the top,mothman likes to sit at the west end.may also find the flatwoods monster there as well. (and the flatwoods can kick your butt in seconds by the way).
---
You mean like people that bought/traded duped weapons and that are crowding this subreddit?
---
Repair kits fuck no, there is no reason for them in the game.
---
Yeah the enclave officier set is nice and clean 👌🏻
---
I’m not doing a good job of describing it because it’s not necessarily lag it’s just a small delay between your console and the server. The damage you’re seeing (grey line) is the damage you would do minus any damage resistance but once the server processes all the variables you see it reflected via the red line.
---
A lot of people have stated on this post as have I that the player was using Assasins Sentinel armor. This reduces damage by 8% from players and 15% while standing still, that’s per piece. 
---
Having a full set plus perks like dodgy, serendipity, evasive, ironclad, barbarian and others will negate even more incoming damage. Using a syringer to buff your teamate along with mutations like empath, aid items such as psychotats and certain magazines and you can have a build where your health bar doesn’t go down until you take massive amounts of damage that your non legendary rifle simply wasn’t able to inflict. 
---
Yes everyone should be using these armor pieces but they are very rare even with duping. Hope that helps clear it up a little for ya!
---
Got that one added to the collection😎
---
What is wrong with people today, it doesn't make me feel better or worse you moron, no one is providing an explanation on what supposed armor you can get that makes you invincible, so I don't buy that. I've played all manner of games since I was young and I've never encountered a PVP system as shit as this one, it's because Fallouts style of combat is not suited for PVP engagements. Regardless, Bethesda can't be that stupid that they would make their PVP unplayable surely? Or maybe they would.
---
No one is helpful these days, just disregarding and speculation 
---
It's not that, they're possibly selling repair kits in the Atom Shop as a convenience/utility item. But you can repair anything pretty easily in game except for I believe some high level gear needs to be rebalanced.
---
There was also a pre war suit with top hat in helvetia but I'm not sure it was exclusive to the Fasnacht event.
---
Wood armor doesn't really do anything that something else can't do as well, or better. The little bit of mobility boost isn't worth all the other sacrifices you have to make. I've found it easier to stay concealed with heavier muffled armor, which also provides better coverage and doesn't lose it's effect in the light. A full set of wood may only weigh a few pounds, but even the legendary stuff is as useful as carrying a brick.
---
&gt; I just need more to help deal better damage and a way punch through armour. 
---
Try an anti-armor knife with incisor and ninja. Slip up quietly and give 'em the old prison shanking. Piercing effects and the huge stealth bonus are exactly why my strategy relies less on beefing up protection and more on not getting struck. That doesn't seem like an ideal outcome in any world.
---
I’ve been explaining things to you man no need to call me a moron, check out the comment I just made to explain their build and how it reflects on your past encounter. Yeah PvP in this game is scuffed, doesn’t mean people are cheating tho is all I’m saying. 
---
Since I don't have an alt/second PS4 or a friend who could stash my caps, I have to take the risk. Sitting at 15k right now. Depending on how often I get killed and how much it'll cost, I'll quit it. 
---
What's trust?
---
I'll look around, thanks.
---
Here's one on r/Market76 for 1000 caps.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/b9n1eg/pc\_h\_13\_weapons\_armor\_assassins\_antiarmor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/b9n1eg/pc_h_13_weapons_armor_assassins_antiarmor/) 
---
That should still be happening. 
---
PSA:  Not worth reading r/FO76 until next week, all posts are the same and as boring as fuck.
---
Exactly, and this - while disliked by majority - is the best possible design. If it was kill based, people who wanted to be leaders would be incentivised to kill each level 2 guy they meet. Now they can still serve as a lure to bait enemy gangs into traps without killing everybody on sight. Simultaneously, those who don't want to ever be seen can take precautions not to let themselves become beacon on the map. The game would be shittiest if they made it kill based, and Bethesdas game designers &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lots of reddits whiny bastards who can't think 10 miliseconds into the future when analysing consequences of their uneducated wishes.
---
Okay, it's possible that this individual had all those perks and armor pieces and drugs and magazines on him, but it's not very probable is it.
---
So what weapon would you need to bring down this ultra behemoth? 
---
That's the worst thing about subreddits, it's just echo chambers where people think they are representing everyone where they are not by a large margin. When someone disagree with the main stream of a sub, they got downvoted to oblivion. RIP own mind and critical thought. Honestly after the "useless repair item unlockable with atoms" response from this sub, I will just stop visiting it. That's sad.
---
Why? If you try to use the repair kit during a fight, you will end up dead. You cannot quick access it. You have to go to your pipboy view the item and choose repair. In the time it takes to repair 1 item with the repair kit, you can repair all your armor or all your weapons at a workbench.
---
Hairstyles, outfits, recolours, paintjobs, stuff from FO4 Creation Club, plain old ITEMS from FO4, like bits of Raider crap or Nuka World posters or.... I don't know... literally any of the assets they already have in the game, but made available in workshop form. ANYTHING would be preferable to things like repair kits.
---
Also, on a related note: Please stop removing cosmetics! There are things I would be interested in that have been removed and completely missed, and so can't buy. What's the deal with that?
---
Todd don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more! 
---
Being loudest does not make them the majority or right. 
---
Should be able to if you open the transfer window
---
Sorry to jump in here but how do you deal with spawncampers? If they are in a team isn't it impossible to take them on with the current mechanics?
---
Yeah it’s not probable but I’m definitely one of them lol so I’m just speaking from experience. 
---
I’d recommend using an Anti Armor gun to cut through some of that damage mitigation. Also using concentrated fire and triggering a critical shot will completely ignore 4/5 of their armor. Since you’re only targeting one piece then that critical shot will cut through them like butter. I usually die to pistol builds because they can unleash criticals really fast which hits me like a knife thru butter.
---
Well don't say moronic things then, who are you to patronise me and say I report people because it makes me feel better, as if I have no justification whatsoever, or aren't allowed to come here and try and get some fucking confirmation from more than one person, or someone who made the damn game and could look at it for themselves, and decide whether they were exploiting the game, or if the game needs to be drastically rebalanced.
---
It's frustrating when nobody listens. People don't care unless it's happening to them
---
I’ll add you later on. I can always use more friends. 
---
I know if you tag it for search, it'll show the magnifying glass icon in front of the item name, but it obviously loses context if you've tagged more than one material type. I miss this from Fallout 4 too. 
---
My hero! 
---
This is a truly good idea.  The ranger armor is pretty epic
---
Aye magnifying starts losing its potential after 2 or 3 items searched. 
---
I’ve been pretty helpful walking you thru all this tho have I not? I was just sayin do what you want, it’s your right. Maybe I should’ve worded it differently but ultimately they weren’t cheating but if you thought the were then report them, it would be an act of catharsis and I’m sure would make you feel better is all I’m saying.
---
Or for a larger impact with less effort you could uninstall the game.
---
A brief mention in the latest From The Vault article. 
---
There are two approaches to that. One is team based the other one math based. Notice that spawnee people now live longer than they did. Some melee people tactics is now to use it to get in range and initiate PvP on their own terms.
---
Team based i.e. a scout enters an area and runs for their life instantly. The team fast travels to teammate, ignoring the standard spawn. Scout, if successful, also drops a camp behind the enemy lines.
---
The math based solution I'm not sharing yet. There are certain items that majority of the players ignore and which are infinitely valuable, yet people consider them crap. Until I gather like 20-30 I'm not giving up this ace. Open your mind and get rid of obsolete 'this is useless' mentality cuz lots of useless things were fixed.
---
If less people are farming materials there will be more materials available for you to farm.  Advantage goes to you.  Why are you not getting that?  This in mo way hurts or even affects your experience.  I will never pay cash for one but I do not care they are available.  When they add higher damage weapons that are only available for cash I'll agree with you. 
---
I already ignore a decent portion of their armor, I have max tank killer, so if I can't do any damage without the ego inflation 5000 anti material minigun 50 cal, then we'll leave it there, and wait until more people start claiming that the PVP is broken 
---
But where’s the humor in that?
---
So instead of buying a repair kit from the Atomic Shop, you're going to buy actual items used for repair and send that do him instead? Dont you see the irony in your post? 
---
In the end, you are still giving Todd your money🤣🤣🤣
---
Just looked at what they are and they are P2W, it’s not a HUGE advantage but I still see it as an advantage 
---
I agree that purchasing repair kits in the atom store is a big problem, but with how its worded it seems to me you wont be actually purchasing actual in game items for use. I think youll be purchasing plans to craft them, which is still kinda ridiculous. Things could be a lot worse though. Bethesda is pushing their limits with this addition to the game. The thing im worried about is this being the beginning to something worse. This is small in comparison to what they could be doing. But things like this always start small and snowball into bigger problems. I just hope they dont let it become a problem
---
rofl
---
So what do you lose after dying?
---
Is this tagged as NSFW because when people read this at work they gets so angry and kill their bosses?
---
🤭Look, I'm not saying that it's going to be game breaking. Just that, in a tournament format, repair kits probably wouldn't be allowed. But if you cannot imagine a scenario where 2 players are in competition in any way in this game, and one having the ability to repair their weapons or armor without finding a work bench or spend ballistic fiber is what makes the difference, then we just aren't going to do more than talk at each other on here. 
---
Schadenfreude
---
Box of caulk is probably cheaper than whatever they’ll charge in game. I’m sure he’ll appreciate the gesture too.
---
XD
---
lol, im good, but as i said before, personally, i think its bad that youd be forced to take an already accepted name, one would think that as reviewed they would have notes on the account or a way to contact you and warn you with time
---
i agree, i have over 200 hours played and not once had my weapons broken in a middle off a fight, but i do agree with everyones on the matter, not only becuase they said the atom shop was going to be purely cosmetic items, but it can open a can off worms if we let it slide. next thing we could see are P2W items and that im not ok with. 
---
Gesundheit
---
Just like the guy who sent him the box of bobby pins with a note saying weight this🤣🤣🤣. I get your intentions tho 
---
I appreciate that you have taken the time to reply yes, and you have now explained that there is a possibility for that sort of protection, despite how improbable it is. Not saying you haven't been helpful, but no it doesn't make me feel better to report people, I don't report people, but having played so many multiplayer games, I've never been robbed of anything this bad, and if you are 100% certain that this isn't cheating, then this game is absolutely atrocious for having such imbalanced builds and ridiculous combat systems, which aren't suited for PVP 
---
Yeah that’s your decision, there’s definitely room for improvement as to the PvP in this game.. still doesn’t mean people were cheating tho and I’m glad we can acknowledge that fact. I hope you have a good day man and know that survival mode is a BETA, so if you want to influence Bethesda’s decision making going forward I’d recommend sending them suggestions directly as to what you’d like to see changed.
---
just punch him
---
Except that you can earn Platinum via trading too. Platinum injected into the game via people buying those Prime Access packs and platinum packs is what keeps the economy going, and there's no real inflation issues keeping new players out of that loop.
---
It's a system that I don't think could ever work with FO76, but it's not a bad model.
---
Indeed.
---
Will happen
---
Yes
---
 🤭 
---
Have a good day too, and thanks for the responses. They don't listen unless enough people complain, I'll just leave it now, thanks though 
---
FINE! TAKE YOUR UPVOTE!
---
Hi mate, wonder if you could elaborate on this a little more? I'm currently lvl 45 and my armor is always broken and I never have enough ballistic fibre to repair. What changes after level 50?  
---
So devil's advocate, can you point me to where anything says they won't need materials? Everything else from the atomic shop does. They won't require materials to use, but pretty certain they will to craft. So what they're providing is convenience at the cost of level of durability.
---
To be clear, I'm not a fan of the idea of them myself, but I'm reading a lot of guesses about how they'll work. 
---
There is a severe edge case where they could offer a competitive advantage, but I doubt anyone's strategy going in to PVP is based on their opponents weapon breaking.
---
It's a convenience item plain and simple in the vast majority of cases, personally, if it stops there, then fair enough, whether it opens the door for more is a different question, but I'm not lighting my torch yet as that question hasn't been answered yet.
---
Its not really greedy if you need to make money to update and keep the servers alive and whatever other costs they have paying employees etc
---
Dang ps4 here, i would have helped you on the PA. Oh well.  
---
Really I’ve not seen a single post aboot it 
---
That's the job of the mods to group it all in a megathread.
---
Rich people can buy atoms and get as many repair kits as they want
---
Make cosmetic armor and weapon skins to put over items all ready in game, even legendaries. You will get a rush of money and have no need to implement game play items for your money shop.
---
I think you can drop the ones earned from quests right? I sure hope so at least.
---
Mainly because bethesda said that they would not include non cosmetic items in the atomic shop
---
Thanks for the offer tho 👍 
---
I think you can get clean military fatigues
---
I think it’s good to give them the feedback they asked for. And this is a good representation of how we feel.
---
People always post the same shit on here. At least this has a real potential effect on the future.
---
Same problem here. The quest stuck forever as it cannot be dropped.
---
Two words, reactive plates

Someone did try the poll route, but it kinda got buried under all the other posts.

Also, there was a post somewhere encouraging people to make their own posts to show their displeasure. And now we're here. 😅

If they are easy to craft than what is the issue here?
---
I’m gonna mail you some diapers :)

Find someone with max perk of lockpick and have them open the trailer in the Gorge Junkyard.  Level 15 power armor setup in there.

you and the players get it, the question is does Bethesda get it?  i have yet to see a "Bethesda replied" to any of them.  which i find interesting because last night we hit 19/25 "hot" slots as repair kit threads.
---
Sweet! Those things are super expensive. Never have kids, okay?
---
Thanks! I'll look into it👍
---
I don’t think everyone wins when you can take steps to negate the intended risk of survival. If you don’t want the risk then don’t play the mode.
---
You can farm the regular blaster rounds. It's a fun little toy but it's not efficient or powerful enough to replace a high-level duty weapon so not many people bother to collect them. The aliens thought their guns were the best in the galaxy, until they came to redneck America. Now they just wander around in the woods wishing they'd taken that left turn at Roswell.

Downvote then upvote!

X2 THE UPVOTE
---
Sounds like it should have a mega thread, then a call to action in the form of a petition or some such and then once of sufficient size it should be forwarded to all Bethesda channels. Because at the moment it looks like we're a bunch of capering loons repeating the same thing over and over to no one in particular.

Oh and could you send them here:

I feel the same, I can understand people being upset that it's a paid advantage, however slight an advantage it is, but honestly, what are you doing that means you don't get to see a repair bench for the several hours it takes to wear your durability out? 
---
This is the only reasonable post on this subreddit right now.
---
I actually didn’t die, which is surprising. Was able to make it back to base and dump everything I owned in my stash before allowing myself to be devoured by a Yao-Guai 
---
What mods?
---
The longer Bethesda pushes the envelope in terms of community acceptability in taking advantage of said community, by forcing them to acclimate to their microtransaction models in return for making badly-made games, the less hope I have for their future flagship games.
---
Because, honestly, I think even the real-money "cosmetic" shop is shitty. Having such things already available in-game without paying extra used to be a thing. But instead, they withhold aesthetics - things that made the game better - and decide to charge more for it. 
---
Because now people have accepted enough of what they do that they will be okay with charging for items with game functionality. 
---
They are not dedicated to making a good game anymore. They are dedicated to developing and making money with a bad game.

More are more people are coming up with this point, and it’s a fair one. But there are many cases of games as a service offering ONLY cosmetics (and early access) as financial incentive. There is no reason fo76 can’t do that too. Especially since they said they would. 
---
Or you could boycott the game if you actually care that much.
---
"oh no, we won't make an extra million on the game people just paid for... oh God no!"
---
Here lately Lucky Break doesnt proc at all for me and its maxed out.
---
All you do is store it in camp mode then place it again lol
---
They exist?
---
Oh? I have the ranger hat and space helmet clean versions but I got them in the world, didn't know he sold them and their suits. Thanks~
---
If you use non-automatic pistols, they have higher fire rate, thus the lower damage. But If you mod automatic, they bug out and turn into plasma for pistols. Also, automatic pistol mods lose the original fire rate bonus and cap at 91 like red lasers. Thus you will have same fire rate but actually lower damage. They also, for some reasons, weight more than red and consume more AP in vats on comparable mods. 
---
All in all, it is garbage right now, not even talking about balance. Don't use it.
---

Good stuff right here

According to the wording on the post, no.

" These will come in two forms: Basic Repair Kits and Improved Repair Kits. Repair Kits cannot be dropped, sold to vendors, or traded with other players. "

---
I didn’t say that though? I listen to the reading to form my own opinion.
---
Take a step back and try to look at it from Iam's point of view. Sure you don't think it does much to change how you play the game. To Iam, this adds one small tiny thing that gives the smallest advantage to someone who buys it. Sure, it probably won't really make any noticeable difference at all, but it's the fact that it DOES make a difference that is upsetting people. It was promised nothing that makes ANY difference would be added to the shop.
---
You see that is fair but lets say for example fortnite: to earn v bucks in fortnite you have to either buy them or get a $20 game to earn them at a slow pace. In fo76 you can earn them fro completely free. Combine that with a much smaller player base and the game might just not be able to stay afloat.
---
Since you can obviously see into the future can you give me some lottery numbers or horses to bet on? ;)
---
Huh I guess not then, sorry. I hope they are weightless too then.
---
For a second I though you were really brave for posting your address...
---
This makes me so happy I quit the game about 2 months ago. I knew they would snake in and lie about this game. Paying for a consumable was what Bethesda said they WOULDNT do. 
---
I do like a wait and see approach with this.
---
Well if they're looking at this hopefully they see all these comments hi to him super prone to buying small things at a time on apps in any situation! LOL I have a tendency to be that guy who pays the dollar when it says you can have double value 25 times and then I kick myself in the head because I could have had way more if I just spent $25 and then I end up actually spending $25. Kind of thought that's why people did that!
---
Oh my god!!!! Maybe you could link your device to fo76, you can send a dweller to your camp, and if they survive they appear in 3D form at your base! Such a link would be really cool
---
I didn’t know they were available in the world
---
Also, clean ski hats
---
Exactly, nobody really knows how these things will work or how much they will cost.
---
Excellent insight thanks! Which locations are the primary war zones on the map? Are there particular train stations or workshops that tend to be popular? I ask for two reasons - to avoid while XP farming and maybe go and have a look at the action :)
---
It's actually 50 per xbox. Makes for cool loading screen surprises when you share an xbox. I think you can move the game and it's reserved to another storage device and then reinstall for a fresh 50 but no way to have them all in the pool at the same time. 
---
Well right now the atomic shop is math-free and I am very happy with that. As you said, this is the first step which would make atomic-shop infinitely more math-related than it currently is. I'm against that.
---
Ski hats you say? Coolio.
---
And yeah I found the space helmet out near new gad on a shelve..idr where I got the ranger hat.
---
I’m sorry but this subreddit has been reserved for post that are complaining about repair kits. I kindly ask you to hold off on posting non repair kit complaints discussions for approximately 1 day. Thank you have a nice day. 
---
This wasn't supposed to have anything to do with repair kits augmentation would be a stone or something completely separate
---
It could also mean they are scrappable like mods or when they are dropped they are destroyed so cannot be picked by anyone else.
---
In my Siege example they give out their in game currency money too. People can play the game and unlock stuff for free But there is a second tier of currency that you can buy. Some in game cosmetic items are cheaper to buy with this currency and there are some that are unique to the real money currency. 
---
All I’m saying is, I agree with you that they need a financial plan here, but adding paid for utility is not the best answer.
---

It's not a common tone. Some people are all for it, saying it's no big deal, it only bring good things and it's a way to pay the servers.
---
Evaluate the range you typically engage in, and pick mods that make your weapon lighter. There is a surprising difference in ap per shot. 
---
All train stations are battlegrounds. All visible leaders are battleground definers. As a Pro hunting pros I look for kill notification and then for loot bags on map also. Farming locations include savage divide, the mire, and the ash heap. Further from station = better. Also be aware events give fast travel points. I used one event to hunt a bontied player in the mire yesterday.
---
i dont see the big deal about repair your gear, i lunch nukes and fight the SBQ (when im not disconnected)4 to 5 times a week, and I only have to repair my stuff once. all they have to do is pay attention, yeah materials can be a pain but hey you are playing fallout after all, I dont see the repair kits been the problem. but the steps bethesda is taking leads down a slope i dont want to see. it always start small and the it grows. 
---
I think most focused on the repair kit and not on what it could lead too. the repair kit is useless if you ask me, but what could come after the repair kits could be a problem. 
---
Oh Ok. 
---
Sorry, I panicked.
---
Try the quest with it unmarked, it worked for me just now.
---
Suckers keeping alive!
---
Seeing those posts and then this post is like watching this sub go through the stages of grief. 
---
Yea, I thought they would keep their promises so I stuck by them day 1 and it was first the price drop, now this, and idk if I should even keep supporting this game, but if this happens, I wont
---
Oh yes, that’s wonderful advice. Someone has an issue with them breaking their word, so the best way to deal with it is to just quit playing instead demanding they stay true to what they’re documented as saying. Grow up, child.
---
It’s a sarcastic joke. Because everyone else is complaining about repair kits.
---
On the other hand, this is exactly the thing I was thinking about.
---
How do we know what we already bought or how many Atoms we should have? When I log out I am not writing down how many Atoms I have.
---
And in the case a bug or such thing strikes and Atoms or Items are getting lost or marked as not bought, how do we know?
---
I think I'll stick around and watch the train wreck unfold. 
---
No, not the ranger hat (you can find one at south mountain lookout), ranger hat clean. The clean versions of the outfits look different. The clean space suit is shiny. 
---
They appear only with a full moon.
---
I'm really on the fence with the whole pay to win thing. I am cheap. I have occasionally spent a few bucks here and there on a game that I really enjoy, but for the most part, if it costs extra, I don't touch it.
---
I can definitely understand why you wouldn't want people with tons of money getting an unfair advantage over you and I, but your argument has devolved over the course of this disagreement.
---
In the post directly above this, you are pretty much saying that people shouldn't be able to buy things because you aren't very good at the game. You don't have screws because you don't scavenge buildings and you don't have any caps to fast travel. I don't mean any offense, I'm only lvl 45, and I have garbage gear, but if you're not picking up junk to repair your stuff, you're playing the game wrong.
---
I have about 2000 atoms from challenges, and aside from a few decorative items for my house, I really haven't found anything to spend them on. I would really like to be able to use them on craftible items I haven't found plans for, and although that would fit your definition of an unfair pay to win advantage, that's what this free to play payer would like to see.
---
This sub is too funny. You're playing a disaster of a game and yet not only do you keep playing it (?) but you're consistently surprised that Bethesda continues to make mistakes like this...
---
Okay! I was like when did I say anything about them. Took it personally. Cried. Called Mom. Whole shebang!
---
Theres already hackers like gtav
---
Was this on PC?
---
Sorry, yes
---
Probably because weapons don’t break in F04.
---
This direction was always going to happen. All you have to do is look at what has popped up in the ESO store in the last years and you can clearly see how their business plan for online work. These decisions are made far above Dev level, so no matter how much we complain here, the people making these decisions won't even hear about it (or care, because the same complains were made about repair kits in ESO, and the complains eventually died down and they are not a part of the game).

Anything that boosts Agility will boost max AP.

Food that gives +3 Agility bonuses for 60 minutes include: Smoked Scorchbeast Heart, Squirrel on a Stick, Mirelurk Softshell Cake, and Ground Mole Rat.

Food that gives +20 max AP bonuses for 60 minutes include: Steeped Melon Bloom Tea, Infused Soot Flower Tea

Not sure if it's a complete list, but Nukes and Dragons food section seems to be a good source for food recipes sorted by bonus type.

Seems to me you are forgetting horse armor, that was way before lunch boxes
---
I guess [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9e31i/danger_sign_repair_kits_noncosmetic_item_will_be/) is kind of acting like a Megathread
---
Awesome, thanks again!
---
I’d actually like that if he said it to me...
---
I was hoping there was an easier way. My camp is kinda close to a super mutant behemoth spawn and i lure him over and get my turrets to help take it down so my house gets damaged often and i got alot of stuff on my walls that is annoying to put it all back in the right spots.
---
That's pretty cool. 
---
*drops pants, turns around, and bends over*
---
And 'lived-in C.A.M.P.-items: decorated bookcases, filled shelves, tables with dinnerware on them, ...  
---
Anything to make a C.A.M.P. feel decorated and lived in! That would be worth my atoms big time!
---
Ohh i see well u had a too fitting name
---
It is not the only possible explanation however the behaviour you describe is consistent with 'speed hacks' created using Cheat Engine or similar tools.
---
Fooling the automated detection the game runs is also achievable.
---
Literally no one has made a thread like this yet. 
---
Thanks! I had a long week of projects so my sleep schedule got all kinds of messed up. Figured while I was awake I may as well do something I enjoy to pass the time!
---
He just keeps yelling halt
---
the first few post were about the leading to P2W items on the shop, and then it shift to the item itself. 
---
im like you, it doesnt bother me at all, in fact i can tell you im not buying any. I will keep doing what I have been doing for more than 200 hours and I will gladly take that 200%.
---
but it does gives an advantage to the paying player over the none paying player, not a significant one but it still does, and if we dont say nothing, the very next time you login you could see plans and loot boxes on the atom shop, and I think that should had been the uproar not about the repair kits itself.
---
anyways that is my 2 cents, and im getting my popcorn ready.
---
I'd pay 1000 atoms for a small box of caulk the same scale as the poster bed. Then everyone will come to my base and be like, whoa, dude, where did you get that tiny caulk? And I'd be like, Todd Howard sold it to me, but it's kinda been been a disappointment. That would totally be worth ten bucks.
---
I do agree. There are better options.
---
Why are you still reading and posting about a game you havent played in 4 months?
---
Is your cable out? Forget to pay electric bill?
---
Maybe you need a hobby, or a RL friend. Go for a walk maybe, its spring.
---
I have a problem with games like 76 that are going on even when I’m away because I feel like I’m missing something. I hope everything is ok with your hospital stay whatever the case is. Be well. 
---
Yea ikr its not the front page is just this or anything
---
Sorry, Sorry I meant to type clean, sometimes I forget a word or two when typing.
---
I have the clean space helmet, ranger hat clean, steelworker hat clean, miner hat clean, pristine miner uniform, and clean steelworker uniform,
---
Nope. That’s called bladed tire iron mod. This one changes the commie whacker into a bladed commie whacker 
---
No worries. I'm used to it around here. 🤷‍♂️ 
---
A delay means that they hit a snag and need some time to improve their functionality, to delay it is better than releasing in a worse state.
---
Agreed. But due to the Karma whore comment, I can’t give you a thumbs up. 
---
I really enjoy the game, kind of regardless of all the drama and panty knot tying, you should just bite the bullet and get a FO76 deal it’s available so cheap now and just mess with it fir a bit 👍
---
Can’t upvote this enough, ranger armour is the dopest armour to ever grace the fallout games 
---
The biggest mistake?  Have some perspective.  This game has issues that I'm confident will improve over time.  This is far from the worst.  You can still get them for free and it's not going to drastically change the way anyone plays.  Melee gets benefits from 200% repair that this kit will not give.  Someone has to explain to me this huge advantage these kits will give before I'm on the bandwagon 
---
You really think people are doing it for karma?
---
Maybe it has something to do with Bethesda asking for feedback on a mechanic they plan on adding that goes against a big promise they made. 
---
The spam is a little annoying, but it’s well deserved. 
---
I have 1 main character and 4 mules. Each mule has a specific job.
---
Mule 1 - 1* weapons that have been catalogued/imgur album updated as main role... 2/3* armours and weapons i have yet to catalogue.
---
Mule 2 - 1* armours and excess aid
---
Mule 3 - 2/3* weapons and armours that have been catalogued/imgur album updated
---
Mule 4 - god roll weapons in collection and junk/flux/serum holder. 
---
Main - actually play the game
---
Here is a link to the catalogue/inventory i mentioned. Mule 2 has over 2400lbs of stuff, hence why i haven't got round to cataloguing yet.
---
It helps with trading and selling, keeping track of it all.
---
Meh, have a thumbs up.
---
IMO there's no reason to support them. They released an incomplete game while promising a great release. Denying your fans what they want and lying about it doesn't go over very well. And I just had enough. 
---
Wasn’t this sub mad about them releasing the whole game too early? Now we are mad when they decide to delay. What do ya want. 
---
Last thing I got was an email in February I think saying that they were working on it. 
---
This, look at it in the transfer window and it will/should show in the same area as weight/“value” etc. 
---
Lmao 
---
easier availability of materials.
---
Word
---
Yeah brilliant idea, because one single post will change anything. r/fo76FilthyCasuals already exists for an essentially controversy filtered version of this sub, just post there.
---
I don’t bother with mules, so I’m not speaking from experience but man that sounds like it gets in the way of actually just playing the game and having fun. 
---
This is the hand we have been forced to play, with weight restrictions etc.
---
I bet you would be at the front of the queue of complainers if the vendor update was released buggy. 
---
Swamp itch, dirty more bed
---
Heat flashes, honey beast/bees (irrational fear works great to get it)
---
And whoopsies you get from a SBQ fight, but not the queen herself, one of the scorched that follows (I think the ants specifically)
---
Brilliant of them to announce just before the end of the week. They'll have the weekend to have have to respond to anything.
---
I had a heart attack in 2014 and spent a lot of time in the hospital. At the time, Borderlands was THE game I was playing. I got a PS Vita so I could have my video game with me all the time. It's too bad that device didn't do better. I'd love to have FO76 available to me during my lunch break at work.
---
I agree with what you are saying, but so far it's only one item, and it's not been added yet, they might listen to the players and decide to add it as a craftable item.
---
They might decide to add more non-cosmetic items over time, but I suspect a whole bunch of people will disagree with this change of direction simply on the principle that they said they would not do so.
---
However, in the end, unless they start adding items that give players an unfair advantage, the Atom store is still optional, and I don't mind buying the occasional cosmetic item for brightening up my CAMP, but non-cosmetic items? well, that depends how far down the rabbit hole they go.
---
We shall see in time.
---
Fair enough 
---
The Fallout series is the only games i still play, has been for years,  and ive played 76 since the Beta, reserved my copy the first day you could and waited with open arms for a new adventure. Even through the ups and downs ive still stuck by Fallout but this might be the final straw that broke the camels back if they blatantly break their promise and start making pay2win features ill put my copy down for the last time and never play again. 
---
I never did, until i started getting rid of decent items. It starts with 1 mule and then goes on from there. I agree though, it does get in the way of playing the game, but is fun being a trader.
---
This is the end game for me and the best way to get the best weapons and armours in the game. 1 day last weekend, i earned over 26k caps from serums and trades. 
---
Use a shotgun, don't fast travel after logging in until it's changed to report results, don't kill the monster with the shot. Those have been my workarounds. 
---
If you know there are already a tonne of posts like it, why bother?
---
What limb are you trying to apply it to?
---
It’s meant to be for legs only, but sometimes comes pre-fitted to arms. 
---
If you’ve got a buddy to help you it takes minimal time to transfer items. From my experience coming from past fallout games it’s hard not to hoard items and having a couple mules helps alleviate the stash weight problem. inventory management makes this game so tedious imo. 
---
Epic Games Launcher was caught stealing your Steam info without permission. Makes you wonder what other data they're stealing that they haven't been caught on yet.
---
If they made it so that these things, the regular ones mind you, had a drop rate in the world that was consistent but not everywhere but if you went the Atom shop you could just make them at your base I think that that would be a relatively fair trade off. That way everyone can get access to them regardless of Adam sharp points but someone who really wants to get a bunch of them could pay for them as well. Either way brings a little more of a level playing field to this repair fiasco. Repair gate 2019
---
Agree with everything apart from the mention of that money grubbing YouTube insect.  Oh the irony of a click bait YouTuber commenting on Bethesda being only interested in monetary gain.
---
As much as I think NV is the worst single player Fallout I've ever played, I'm inclined to agree with this. Going straight for the cash is messed up
---
Change it to a doorway?
---
Seriously though, add another support and then you can remove it. 
---
I had the same issue with beer on the same quest. I ended up consuming a few bottles and spamming a group of aupermutants. I think it triggers once you have hit an enemy in VATS, building up your crit and then initiate critical to kill.
---
I had to use a crappy none-lego lever to do it. One shotting did not pass the quest.
---
I can help you with that, what's your IGN?
---
That's only relevant maybe in pvp and only if you're running a kinda crappy build to be honest. Most "armor" isn't going to make a difference in a fight pvp. It won't even break before you're dead or they are. 
---
Main adventure mode is essentially going co-op with the exception of workshops and intentionally consenting fights but still armor being repaired or not isn't going to make a difference. 
---
I just feel like most the people claiming this is p2w haven't actually played the game as their is no understanding how the current armor system works. 
---
Yasss, I loved that aspect of oblivion, finding an enchanted eleven helmet at the bottom of the sea really rewards you for exploring. I feel like they need more random quests, like a holotape inside a bucket that you wouldn’t find unless you looted the bucket.
---
Looks to me like you're jumping on the train yourself, hollering 'no homo' all the way.
---
The best your post may do, is fan the flames while farming a bit of karma on the way, or are you expecting these posts to cease due to your request?
---
lazy people with too much money. "I can't be bothered finding the ballistic fiber to fix my armor. I'll pay a dollar in the atom shop."
---
Seriously, all these are is a shortcut to repair your weapons if you don’t want to spend your resources. Other fallout games have had them too, the only difference being you could not buy them with real cash. But you can still earn them in 76 without spending atoms so that seems fine to me. The instance of another player having an advantage over you because they had a kit is very, very rare. It’s not “pay to win” it’s “pay for convenience” 
---
We want to be able to convert ammo or break ammo down but we don't want to fucking buy a atomic shop item in order to do it.  
---
Bethesda I swear to fucking god if you fuck us we will never EVER buy a fucking game from you ever again and I will pass on elder scrolls 6. [Shut the vault](https://youtu.be/SjrDbSgB9IU?t=131)  
---
Personal stance on angry joe I like him but not the best critic considering he gave BF V a pretty good score and anthem lol.
---
I know the familiar feeling of not wanting to let something go. Ultimately unless it’s a really good 3* I’ve decided to let them go. Being forced to make those hard choices is a pro to the game for me, not a con. 
---
yeah I'm not returning until it's confirmed they're not doing this.
---
you HAVE seen the updates to the game right?
---
Hell yeah! I can't get the pass through wall conduits to work ever. I wish I could upvote this a million times.
---
Yeah, it didnt seem like a legit thing, which is why i kept respawning..
---
dont understand the loser mentality needed to want to cheat to win at pvp? 
---
See now you're thinking with your noggin. I guess my issue here is I hear alot of people throwing their arms up and saying "oh God Bethesda is at it again!" I'm pretty sure Bethesda countless times has said this game is a work in progress and is going to be made by the community as much as by the company themselves. Updates these days in most if not all games where the company literally has dev update videos/blogs etc. Is an open forum to say "hey this is what we want to do, yall like it?" Play it, share your feelings . I'd personally like to see people quit acting like by adding one minute thing which realistically wont break the game is a death sentanace to all the fans out there and give actual insight. Games are never going to be perfect. So with this said I ask you. How (besides hurt feelings that a company "lied" to you) is this significantly impacting your playing ability to the point of raising your pitchforks and setting all the wasteland on fire? I. Sure this has been awnsered a million and one times by now in other posts to this sub, seeing as this post was made yesterday mid day, however I really would like to know how this is such a wrong thing to do.
---
Bullshit, it impacts everyone because they have the game tuned to be an absolute slog without them. My wife and I were just commenting on how fast our armor seemed to be breaking lately.
---
So the tldr is that you're too lazy to farm materials for the 10-15 min it takes, and too cheap to spend the maybe 40 caps it takes to fast travel back or drop your camp at a new location but yet you're also angry that others who are also lazy might want to spend money to not have to go grind for materials. 
---
You really haven't thought through your opinion much here. 
---
I get your point, but I don't agree this is the way to go. It turns a core mechanic in the game into a "pay to skip the grind" thing.
---
If my weapons or armor broke and there was no workbench nearby I always thought it was ok like that, it's annoying but part of the game as a survival. But if you can pay real money to bypass it? The scorchedbeast queen for example, it goes from "you need to prepare your gear" to "either pay atoms or enjoy your broken weapons". It's just like a free to play game, annoying you until you are willing to pay premium currency.
---
And I have played some free mobile games for long periods of time without spending a buck, of course you can just do that, but even if you actually like the game it ends up being a long boring grind to bypass the microtransactions. I have really enjoyed Fallout 76 and I don't want it to become something like that.
---
I rather watch this game die in a year and a half as long as it was enjoyable. I don't like this "games as a service" bullshit that makes every game a long boring grind. Hell I was about to buy atoms after Farsnatch parade and Nukashine quests, but I didn't because I disliked the harder daylies and the rare mask fiasco. If Fallout 76 ends up looking like a free to play game with the bad reputation it already has no one is going to buy it, let alone keep playing it. A lot of fans have been driven away already.
---
Videogames have become this annoying money sink shit because we allowed it, let's NOT allow it to go forth and ruin Fallout too.
---
Yeah we want free content forever!! We don’t care how you pay for it, just don’t pay your devs! who cares if the cost to run the servers is more than the revenue from this game, what’re you gonna do, shut em down? Oh wait...
---
Ah, thanks!
---
Once he did that to me and the server crashed
---
It’s Molybzen !
---
I guess that’s where I deviate. I had a ton of fun with Fo4 hardcore mode. I loved having limits on everything and needing to operate within them. I think it’s far more interesting long term than it is to brainlessly hoard. 
---
Yeah. Frankly most the people complaining seem like they aren't playing the game right at all. 
---
Selfimposed deadlines met?
---
PS Vita would've been the best selling hand held if Sony didn't force us to buy proprietary memory cards. Seriously if we could've used a micro sd that system would be killing it. The memory cards were too damn expensive.
---
Aight, expect a invite from "Nezedia" I'll join your world!
---
that's what I truly do not understand. People were FURIOUS about the lunch box discovery that was never implemented. They got angry over the minuscule HP buff from the Unstoppables event. And now they're doing this. It's like whoever is in charge of monetizing this game doesn't fucking pay attention.
---
Yeah remove the source of free dlc! Give this guy a job! 
---
It would literally take me 2 years of game time to earn what I have purchased in Warframe.  It ain't that great in terms of being a great free to play business model, that belongs to Path of Exile.
---
This armour and elder maxsons jacket from fallout 4 ill through money at those items
---
I do see your point. I don’t want this game to be like that either but we have to see how if plays out. The overwhelming “repair kit bad” isn’t helping anyone.
---
The problem is currently, that there are 1* weapons and armours worth more than some 2/3* ones. Worse so, that builds and metas keep changing. Have to keep up with it to know what ia junk. Mainly saving all the useless 1-3*'s to trade in, once the lego vendor goes live.
---
I am currently level 194 and still yet to discover the full map. Farming whitesprings was my main gameplay. I have done about half of the quests too, still a lot more to do in the game. Get too easily distracted by shiny 3* enemies.
---
Exactly, I'd rather wait a bit longer for something that is decently implemented in the game and actually works than having to suffer a sloppy rush job.
---
Why are you assuming this person is receiving an allowance? You're being intentionally obtuse. No one said you can't support the game. You sure make a lot of assumptions and put words in people's mouth instead of saying anything constructive. 
---
That's false, all those things *do* give an advantage in PVP and on the Survival server, could easily make a big difference.
---
My best weapon breaks almost every time I play!
---
Right now there's a double XP bonus on the Survival server.  With limited fast travel, a "repair kit" would be a *huge* benefit!!!
---
I don't understand why you are trying to defend PTC?  But, I am happy to discuss it with you regardless.
---
Just don't freaking buy it... big deal. 
---
Half hating and half not caring means the average player dislikes it.
---
I'm pretty sure this change was an intentional cap sink. I can't resist buying a 3star item from vendors. I think they are sometimes seeded and not from other players. Almost always +durability and rad resistance. Meh. 
---
I try to avoid the meta so I can do my own thing but you have me curious. What 1 stars are regarded as the best now?
---
so micro transactions shops are not cash shops?
---
If you spent half the effort in the game you're supposedly fighting to save you'd never have to worry about materials or repairs. Bother to learn how perks work and how to scrap properly. 
---
And why does it seem like the same people complaining about how repair kits are p2w were the same ones defending duping, which was something that was actually destroying the game. 
---
You misunderstand. I am genuinely congratulating Bethesda and I hope they stick with the troll. I don't give a fuck. I don't need the kits because I am playing the game how it was intended to be played rather than trying to min-max by hot swapping perks whenever I craft something and anything that can extract money from tryhards who think that repair kits will give them a significant edge in a casual game is fine with me.  
---
Anyone who is mad about this has already lost the game.
---
I also not had clue about root access made it with jet pack inside lol.
---
Lmao thank you!
---
The initial price in these games covers development, marketing, etc. And with single-player games, it is enough. You own and maintain the platform. But with online games, the server farms and network infrastructure for 24/7 availability is expensive to maintain and improve. Not to mention the need for ongoing refresh of content, and extended customer service costs this sort of game requires.
---
Make interesting and cool cosmetic items but make the pricing reasonable.  That's the key to increasing sales.  I would abso-fucking-lutely throw $15-$20 at the cash shop if I were getting 5 or 6 cool items.  Not one item, maybe two if its on sale.
---
+karma
---
😂
---
It's like they've just shot an arrow in their own knee.
---
I like limits as well but I also enjoy having multiple sets of armor and weapon types. I like trading things and holding onto items until they become the new meta and then reaping the rewards for my patience, wouldn’t call that brainlessly hoarding. But I guess that’s where our playstyles differ, and who am I to say your style isn’t fun?
---
Ahh okay, so basically repairs your items without needing materials? And in the case of the super one, gives it a durability buff?
---
It was a heavily discussed topic on the Bethesda forums around December. I even made a post about it, along with the refrigerator and ammo scrapping. 
---
Watch the "bug fix" be selling fridges in the atomic shop in a few weeks.
---
I'll not be using repair kits. I don't need them. I won't  keep playing if I am forced to spend more money on this game. I spend Atoms on cosmetic items but won't  for repair kits. I have been here since beta and paid twice as much as it is for sale right now. And why are we waiting in player vending? Because they are spending time on refrigerators? SMFH!
---
Back in 2008 I broke my ankle very bad, forced in hospital for almost 2 months. I was playing gears 2 back then. 48 hrs after first surgery I had my bro bringin me a portable xbox 360 station, with 19inch LCD screen, and I was able to kill the time doing what Ive always loved to do. Too bad back then was very hard to get an online connection outside your house, so I wasnt able to play online. But today, I guess it shouldnt be that hard to use a phone as hotspot and connect your consolle to the internet, assuming that your phone has enough bandwith to allow a totally online game as F76.
---
Honestlly, I think you can be online, party chat with friends,, but I'm not sure if youll be able to stay logged and play on a F76 server. We already have disconnections when home under powerfull wifi and internet connections.
---
Omg it actually does and with 12000 subscribers
---
Actually, yes, wouldn't most everyone want free content forever?  But that's beside the point....
---
Funds could.be generated with having substantial/meaty download contents of quests, map.areas, etc.  Think like the old school modules for DnD.  
---
The real issue is apparently the definition of cosmetic lol
---
Anything 1* that is bloodied really, melee or guns. Fast fire automatics such as LMG for furious. 1 shotter, or power house shottys for instigating. Vampire fats rate or the gamma. 
---
Top tiers are still BE/AAE/FE and IE. with regards to armours...
---
Unyielding/Bolstering/Chameleon 1*'s can fetch upwards of 1k caps. 
---
The hope is that you get tokens from the lego vendor. With those tokens, you can apply attributes to your 1*'s and make for instance a Bloodied Lever 1* into a 3* BE lever with +50 damage critical on VATS.
---
As a player merchant from day one I'm just really salty about it being delayed but everyone here is right.
---
I wouldn't want bugs and if it takes a month I guess I'll just wait.
---
I'm honestly just wanting the camp items placement but I don't think we got a release date for that.
---
This isn't free content at all.
---
Far Harbor for example, a bethesda produced expansion is a fraction of the price of an equal amount of content found on the atom shop.
---
Someone is paying for the content, and its the chumps who are giving bethesda a pass. 
---
Brainlessly Hoarding was a bit flippant of a term to use. And I’m sure it doesn’t describe how you play. 
---
As much as I say all that, I still do want more future vendor to be well stocked as much as the next guy.
---
Yet here you posting in the same way about their complaining. 
---
"thinks business owes him fucking anything"
---
Actually, moron, they DO owe us something. They owe us the honesty of giving us what we were promised. We purchased their game on a promise of the Atom Shop being strictly cosmetic-only, and now they're getting ready to go back on that promise. A purchase is a contract between the buyer and seller. There's a reason laws against Bait And Switch tactics and False Advertising exist. If anything, you're the one that sounds like an early 20s kid who thinks he knows everything.
---
You all pathetic idiots who still "support" this game, deserves this shit. 
---
yeah, been stuck on the same think for a weeks, it's bugged, even walked on my hands naked shooting with my feet, no go :/
---
It's probably say at least 50% of it is for karma other wise why not just write your own comment to one of the existing threads and upvote it
---
Pay 2 win us only when you have no choice but to pay. If you can earn it in game then it's not okay to win, it's just pay to get something a tad faster. Now, if it was like 30k atoms then it would penetrate p2w since that many atoms is insanely hard to grind for a single item 
---
You clearly havnt seen enough free to play models based around this very thing.
---
I agree 100% the other day I was driving to the bottom of the mirelurk queen pond by watauga and was disappointed to find absolutely nothing at the bottom of it used to be really cool treasures at the bottom of the sea!
---
the disc itself is usless.  bought mine 2nd day release   50gig download. all in? 200gig ish.
---
as far as i'm aware   different platforms on different servers that don't mix.
---
I’m on Xbox but I’m going to guess and say yes. It will still need to download the most current update. 
---
I agree with this. I have a good job, and personally paid $30.00 in Atoms so far. But thier pricing model seems to have been dictated but a low inventory of Atom store merchandise. I would likely buy everything in it if the Atoms were at least half the price they are now.
---
To me, thier answer is there, more inventory, less cost for Atoms. They have thier customer's financial base wrong. They are modelling it like a boutique store, and it needed to be Walmart or Target.
---
You are one of the very rare people with little time to play that i see agreeing with the notion that people with more free time should always get a natural "advantage" over those who don't, on the basic fact that effort should be rewarded.
---
And for that i commend you open mindedness.
---
Most of the time i see the opposite based on the sole reason that since they have little time they should have means to shortcut their way up, which is absolute nonsense to me. Your basketball player is a perfect example on why their reasoning is flawed at the core. 
---
Or I could just buy 2, that's my 200% repair.  Or I could buy 5.  That's better than grinding for 1 advanced repair at 150%
---
it was so cool though! Who doesn’t wanna pay money to dress your horse for only $2.50?!??
---
Anne Summers was your typical southern belle farming girl, having grown up with a rifle across her one shoulder and a mirror in the other. Growing up on the farm, she was the girl that claimed loudly she would never ever stay on the farm. She had dreams, ambitions, ... When Vault-Tec came along and offered her a place in the new Vault, she grabbed the opportunity with both hands. Then the bombs fell and the Vault closed...only for her to realize she wouldn't love anything better than to return to those peaceful, simple farming days.
---
When the Vault finally opened, that hope was soon shattered...this was no longer the land she knew. Lost at first, she somehow automatically fell back on those skills learnt a long time ago: hunting, living off the land, repairing and creating items with your own two hands. Not being the sturdiest or strongest, she relies on her skill with the rifle, picking off potential enemies from afar. Without realizing, she took to it like a duck to water and now stalks Appalachia with her trusted rifles, surviving one headshot at the time.   
---
(She's a typical stealth sniper build, focused on high sneak damage output with the sniper rifle and quick bursts of close combat damage with her lever-action rifle. Secondary perks, like armorer, gunsmith, ... are chosen to reflect her crafting skill, with perks like Green Thumb and the like that can be switched in for 'hunting trips. She never consumes 'shop-ready' food, but kills/gathers/prepares all of her meals herself)
---
Well let’s say they are. They needful to think of a response that they all come to agree on
---
This. They aren’t pushing it back because they are trying to street out content, they’re pushing it back because they can’t make it work right. You think people about repair kits?  Imagine how mad everyone would be if all their shit disappeared because they got disconnected 
---
They could conceivably do the Elite Riot Armor from Lonesome Road even easier; lore wise, I’m fairly sure these suits existed Pre-War. Atom flavor text along the lines of “only the best riot police protection this side of the Mississippi, and the other side too”. That way Bethesda can avoid ever referencing the NCR like the cowards they sometimes are.
---
Those are all ones people requested be answers
---
Rainbow
---
\^\^This :)
---
Thanks a lot !!
---
Np, happy hunting
---
And those with more time *currency* as you call it should earn better things since they are *spending* more of it than you do.
---
See what i did there ?
---
YOU ARE AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
---
- Ranger Armour
---
- Blackbird paintjob
---
- Faction based camp items and costumes (BoS, Enclave, Raider etc)
---
- another decent Excavator Armour paintjob
---
= $$$$$$$$$$$
---
I don't either.
---
I was more sympathetic towards people using it to circumvent the mobility restrictions imposed by being over the 'weight limit' in the early days of the game.
---
A cheat is a cheat however I am not prone to zealotry so I am still capable of perceiving nuance.
---
If that player however was using cheats to gain an advantage in PvP I think he/she would benefit from a period of forcible reflection via suspension.
---
Sorry to keep bothering you but you are helpful and I appreciate it. I was trying to sell a 2* lvl45 bloodied pump action with +50% vats crit damage. How much would you say that’s worth? 
---
I seek the 1 shot instigating build myself. 
---
No worries, if theres any other mod you're looking to put on let me know! :)
---
That’s a whole other can of worms they’d be opening. People purchased this game with the assumption and assurance from Bethesda that all future DLC would be free and funded entirely thru the atomic shop. To change that now would cause much greater outrage from the community I guarantee you. 
---
The problem lies in Bethesda not releasing cool items in the atomic shop that players want. Sure there are some but they release them in such a slow stream that players are able to grind free atoms before the next item they truly want is released. 
---
Side note, do you play this game?
---
XP boost is what OP is interested in, removing risk of lost inventory is just that, still get XP boost.
---
imagine having having the audacity to release this shifty shitty of a game AND pull this shit?  never even looking in direction of Bethesda again 
---
I like it a lot! Refreshing from “ex-military” or “crazy man who snuck into the vault”
---
Carrying a back up weapon is not that difficult. I always have several weapons on me.  If less people are farming mats it will be easier to find yours.  Less competition = higher availability of mats.  This makes your life better at no cost to you.  If you have to stop and go into your inventory in pvp to repair your weapon you'll probably be dead before you're back out. The only thing I agree with is this could lead to actual pay to win items in the atom store and they could make atoms harder to earn in game.  But that possibility exists whether they do this with repair kits or not.  You have made several points but I dont believe they are all valid.  Melee weapons get a good bonus in damage from being repaired to 200%.  This kit will not provide that.  Do you think melee users will just give up that damage so they can use repair kits?  I dont.  I will never pay 1 cent of my money for one of these kits but their availability will not affect my gameplay 1 bit.  It might even make it easier to find the mats I need.
---
Agreed fellow brother, there aren't enough mods.
---
Didn’t they promise whilst selling the game that all DLC would be free? Surely that makes this analogy a bit pointless.  
---
All I want is my Gatling plasma to shoot rainbows.
---
Well if I had a powerful laptop I would be giving it a try. I can watch Netflix on a tablet using hospital Wi-Fi, so it would have been pretty funny for the hospital IT department to show up and ask me to stop monopolizing bandwidth as a result of Fallout gaming. 😀
---
This game's a joke that keeps on giving.
---
I love the ranger armor but I think it would work better for immersion if they did pre-war riot armor that someone tossed a coat over...I mean the NCR rangers don't really exist yet. You get the same look and a bit of immersion.
---
But seriously classic weapons and armor as skin options would be incredible. Hell, give an option to have the current armors as a full set but as a cosmetic as opposed to actual armor would be awesome. I would love to have the look of full shadowed leather gear while wearing heavy BOS armor under it.
---
Food for thought.
---
Fine, if the weapon itself is gold, then we can find middle ground.
---
Found one for 195caps too. Maybe we were lucky and someone sold it there.
---
Trust me I started off brainlessly hoarding but soon learned that even mules have a limit, at this point I’ve gotten pretty smart about what I loot and always fix my buddies armor and weapons under the guise of being nice but really so I can have some stash space 😂
---
Hey i think i seen that guy.
---
It would be nice to get an admins opinion on this. I think this thread has a lot of great input for the real problem... Atom store inventory and cost. I dont know how to flag them.
---
You can't sell plans as far as I can tell that's why people just give them away
---
That’s you’re imagination . Armor is not breaking faster , it’s the same as always . 
---
But i agree with repair kits should NOT be in the atom shop . That’s not a cosmetic  and it’s bullshit to have to pay for kits. Should be a drop Ingame 
---
1 - The BETA wasn't a 'lie' - It follows the industry trend of having a BETA that means nothing. Of course it's not what a BETA should be, and it purely existed as an incentive rather than being used for anything actually useful to the game's development. But while shitty, it ain't a lie. That's what a 'BETA' is these days.  
---
2 - Yeah... It's a bag. They literally cost less than fifty cents to produce per bag. It ain't ideal to have them swap materials out of nowhere and I would go so far as to call it a lie in terms of the material promised. But then hey, they're rectifying it. Not that it absolves them - But the bag thing was so petty to begin with, it's like whining that your burger came on a wheat bun instead of rye, it's packaging. Of course, it also has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on the game itself.  
---
3 - Yong Yea went on record in one of his older videos about the Creation Engine claiming he was very informed on the technical aspects of the engine, claiming it needed replacing with a new engine and that a retooling 'wouldn't cut it'. Days later Jason Shrier released an article saying the exact opposite and Yong backpedaled hard. Yong then tried to play it off like he still knew what he was talking about but it was painful.  
---
4 -  On the Channel 'Laymen Gaming' Skillup's said many, many times as both a joke and a serious statement that he continues to pour the hate onto 76 because it's bringing both channels so much attention and revenue. This being after the same thing happened with Battlefront 2.  
---
5 - I shouldn't have to go through a pile of examples to explain to you something that is in essence common sense - Even youtubers themselves will admit it readily in most cases. This is how they make their living... And yeah, I already stated those two prominent examples, if you want to know more - Go and research, you won't have to go far. If you're going to call me a 'hypocrite' without even bothering to look for the answers you claim I don't have, then atleast try not to make it so obnoxious so we can carry on the conversation instead of shit-flinging over a footnote's footnote in the footnotes of what's essentially a 'footnote' video game.
---
Your kindness seems limitless !
---
Oh. Well in that case, yaay. But I agree, they're too cheap for something that generates 100 power.
---
Even if there was some food you can buy on the atom shop giving back 1% hunger i wuld still be against it. Its not about how big of an advantage you get. It's the principle of buying something that isn't cosmetic. 
---
You should not buy your way through the game that's all there is to it. Even if my example of that 1% food is laughable, its still 1% you shouldn't ever get outside of playing the game itself to get it.
---
I will accept a gold-plated Gatling plasma that shoots rainbows.
---
I will also use all my atoms to pay for it.
---
I agree
---
I get the note, but no insult.
---
I always blap him for the free lead scrap.
---
I’ve bought 20+ items in the atomic shop and haven’t payed any real world money but I would if Bethesda gave me a lot of items I wanted at once. Right now it’s too easy to grind free atoms, but I’m not really complaining about that lol. 
---
I loved Far Harbor but I don’t get what it has to do with this game? The first big DLC is being released next week and I don’t think it’s fair to judge until after then.
---
Username checks out.
---
Implementing PaytoWin will totally reverse all the progress. Especially since they recently have been doing really good, all the DLCs seem awesome! F pay to win.
---
Very constructive comment right here /s
---
That'd probably be a valid point if there weren't tens of millions more gamers today than a decade and a half ago..
---
Didn’t know they had announced they’d be craftable, but even if so, it’s still equivalent in principle to selling stimpaks and other AID items. These provide advantage and are rare in the game world. 
---
Purely aesthetic store is what we all want I think. 
---
Yeah I have reported them..
---
I returned to the game yesterday, really was enjoying it now that they've released the unrestrictive survival mode. I was considering buying some atoms now they've added more stuff to the store and i was happier with the direction the game is going. Come on reddit and first post i see is this, gg bethesda my wallet stays closed 
---
Same here. I go to a workbench for my repairs. The most important is that the legendary weapons do not drop . Killed a Queen I be got a spoon....
---
Nobody is  talking about that anymore, problem solved for Bathesda....
---
There's the repair kit argument going on and everything else seems to be forgotten
---
Instead of junk store every legendary you can get your grubby little vault dweller hands on and trade them in for legendary tokens when the new vendor drops.
---
... while this is one of many other threads of its kind. how's that helping?
---
But it was going to happen anyway. It's the community reacting to a microtransaction system that is not cosmetic, which goes against what Bethesda advertised about the Atom Shop in the first place.
---
I'm not sure how it will turn out but it had to happen, otherwise people would just stand there doing nothing and that's exactly how video games have become this: Released unfinished, pay to win, must buy DLCs to enjoy the game, and so on.
---
Not sure if people crying out loud will do any good but the alternative is doing nothing and allow it, which is way worst. I wanted Fallout 76 to become a better game and despite the profit and therefore content they provide, microtransactions usually just make the game worse.
---
Jesus Fucking Christ. Know what makes sense as atom shop purchases? Mother fucking cosmetics. Because that's what we were promised would be the ONLY things in the God damn shop.
---
Where are you coming up with this excuse that all updates NEED to be lore bound? They're tossing the higher grade repair kits right into drop tables without a single extra bit of lore needed and it would be just as simple to do the same with any future plans for refrigerators or anything else. In your head it's perfectly fine if one day people can spend atoms in the shop and suddenly be able to build an ammo converter but if the plan just appeared at a vendor it would be lore breaking? Give me a fucking break. 
---
Finally someone who understands me! Exposure NEVER inspires change, how could the devs realize something is wrong if all we do is show them with the tools we have Available?
---
It's called curdling. Traditionally you add rennet (an enzyme derived from a calf's stomach) to raw milk and, over an hour or two, it separates into solids (curds) and a watery residue (whey). In the pot you then cut up the curds into small cubes with a knife, heat them up a bit to drive out moisture, strain out the curds, add salt, compress the curds in a mould to squeeze out most of the remaining moisture, then leave the cheese to age for a few months.
---
It's fun to do. I've been making cheese for about a year now. if you're interested, look up a guy called Gavin Webber on YouTube. he does some great vids on the subject.
---
I'm not Gavin Webber.
---
Blessed are the cheesemakers.
---
Not super close. If you get sneak rank 3, they'll be dead long before they spot you.
---
But this is Bethesda testing the water. The repair kit is inconsequential, but if we accept this the next addition may not be so innocent (refrigerator for food?). All the way to legendary guns in the atom shop.  
---
Bethesda employee we see you..
---
Lol sorry had to
---
Yes, making my point for me  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯ 
---
Some people have more time, others have more money. In neither case it’s a matter of skill, so I don’t see where all the outrage comes from. 
---
15 hours later and this is still the last comment made
---
Do not fast travel after logging in, use a pump shotgun, don't kill the mob in one hit. Those workarounds have worked for me. I saw someone else say deselect the quest in the data page. Good luck! 
---
Well fortunately I'm not missing Fasnacht parades or anything, so hopefully I'm not missing anything unique.
---
Everything went fine and it's just pain management right now. Thanks for the kind words.
---
The real question is: Did someone at bethesda Support make up this name or do they have a name generator that can legit output a name like CorgiDanceParty111. If so I want this name generator.
---
When I can buy stuff on Level 1 that gets me faster to maxlevel you have an advantage and thats pay2win... It doesn´t always have to be an Item thats for money only and kills everyone one shot or is stronger than any weapon you can get without money...
---
This is my last wearable plan, I’ve been trying to get one forever! Nice drop! 
---
My level 69+1 character which haven't done the quest yet could have a speak with you. What is your time zone?
---
Because you don't want to pay for a requested feature?
---
You expect free DLC, free requests? Do you know what actually goes into network an storage management? Community is moaning for the sake off it, do us a favour an stop playing.

There's a good chance you'll get it after doing the different power-up reactor events. Ever since the vendor update, however, they made it available for everyone along with the stupidly rare powered gates plan. With Hard Bargain 3, they just cost around 192 caps. That's a good price.
---
   
---
I have one that I do not use, when would you offer? I am looking for some heavy weapon with damage against scorched 
---
Since the pvp mode has come out, that will be worth a lot more than previous. Which platform you on? 
---
Pc price - 4k+
---
Console price - 1.5k+
---
If you are on pc, i would buy that for 5k?

OOF I wish, I’m an unemployed bum ;)
---
I use durability perks, if I can just lug around some repair kits I can instead take damage perks.
---
We're also close to getting harder pve content in form of 'dungeons'.
---
What's the# for i want to buy the fridge?
---
Weird, I've never seen that, but it sounds super annoying.  Anyway for mutations, I run Marsupial, Speed Demon, eagle eyes, adrenal of course, Bird Bones (lifesaver for super low health), and Carnivore (MVP of Survivial mode).
---
People really still play this game? Lol
---
Maybe create 1 actual non-silly men's hair style? I would spend all my atoms on decent hair.
---
My level 83 and level 78 soon to be mule characters beg to differ. :)
---
Personally, I don't care about the repair kits as an item in and of itself. I don't. They're conveniences, not game-breaking wonder-things. Workbenches are everywhere, all over the goddamn place, you can't throw a stone in 76 without hitting a workbench, and you can fast travel to your CAMP for free from anywhere or to a train station (which are abundant and all have one crafting bench) for little cost. No worries.
---
The worry is that this is coming after a nerf to White Knight, Licensed Plumber etc, which is extremely concerning - not to mention the part about refrigerators in the article after a nerf (accidental or not) to food spoilage. I don't care if they add stuff to the game that I won't use - Guild Wars 2 sells conveniences (and is a full price always online game with PvP elements), but at the expense of being able to play reasonably *without* buying them? That would be the bigger concern.
---
At the moment it's impossible to say one way or another what impact these will have without knowing how rare the findable ones are, whether you buy the Plan from the Atom Shop once and can craft them yourself, or what. It's just a step in a concerning direction until it's clarified by the devs.
---
Exactly take away repair kit and put fridge to atom shop.
---
Yassss I can imagine whereing the armor with a six shooter with the song big iron in the background 
---
Know what convenience also doesn't equal? COSMETIC.
---
It doesn't matter how trivial these repair kits area because that isn't the God damn point. The point is that the Atom shop was promised to be 100% cosmetic only with no effect on game play what so ever. These kits spit in the face of that promise and lay way for Bethesda to keep pushing the boundary into what content they'll no longer consider part of the DLC updates and what they'll instead sell bit by bit. 
---
How about starting 600caps?
---
Or bring down prices a bit, people are more likely to buy things if they are cheaper because they think they are spending less money and thus they won’t really consider the prices all the time
---
I'll put em on my cap/serum mule 
---
Glad i'm not the only one. Feel like people have specifically been waiting for something like this.
---
The best part? It's a REQUESTED COMMUNITY feature. So people want free DLC, free updates, free features without anything but a one-time fee.
---
Are you f*****g joking me? Network an storage costs? Management? The team that has to code updates and draw up atomic design etc, all work for free do they?
---
Come the fuck on.
---
There are weapon benches everywhere.. I think I read one post about repair kits. 
---
I have three: an armor, weapon and junk mules. I also leave the vault and run straight to WS. I usually have a full set of leather pocketed armor and shielded vault-tec underarmor waiting to trade with them.
---
Still isn't fixed, I'm having the same issue.
---
I hope it’s not Pay2Win content.. 
---
If the loot is in a container, open the transfer window to see components for each item. If the item is rendered outside of one, you're out of luck. Slowly learning what contains what is what it comes up to.
---
BTW, does anybody else feel that they change items' components from time to time? I'm pretty sure I looted Blasting Caps Boxes for nuclear waste all the time, but now there's none in them anymore.
---
1000 caps . o 800 and ammo for 5mm
---
Why not both

If you're so worried about Bethesda making money then how would you feel if after Wild Appalachia ended they announced that on top of adding non cosmetic content to the atom shop they would also be adding loot boxes and that the next and all subsequent seasons of dlc would cost $20 each? 
---
I have no issues with their availability to players. I’m just concerned over the slippery slope effect regarding potential paid items that DO effect gameplay directly; something Bethesda said they wouldn’t do. I’d be satisfied with the ability to make atoms a little more easily as a trade off.
---
We go down together 
---
How much ammo for 5mm would you want?
---
The only response Bethesda is looking for, are sales figures. 
---
Thank you for the advice I will now stop this
---
Disappointing. I really want to enjoy this game. I guess I'll go down with the ship. I bought the game and I'm gonna play it. 
---
Cheers mate. Mr. Handy fuel containers? Dammit!! I have been ignoring them for weeks, but no more. Seems I get a healthy stash of them and two armor repairs; boom, I’m screw-less. 
---
Apparently the tip. 
---
Thank you mods for being awesome!
---
How is preserving your food to keep your health up any different from weapon repair? Both are contributing factors in the game as you have to eat and kill. Cooking food yields specific perks. Glowing meat steaks are 10% melee damage. You mean to tell me that its accept able to sell a fridge that preserves perks but weapon repair isnt acceptable? Sorry if that sounded aggressive lol. I genuinely would like to know your thoughts
---
with 1000 I'm fine 
---
Yeah true, I play a lot on my own Xbox as well as my partners Xbox and he’s constantly complaining about all the pictures of my character that come up on his loading screens lol
---
You're all puppets dancing on their strings.
---
I’ll see if I can. However it would be difficult for me to go online in 10 hours because it would be 2am for me.
---
Ballistic fiber is the reason I switched to power armor.  Then they nerfed the fusion cores out in the world to 25% .  This is a much bigger problem for me than repair kits.  Taking over a fusion core processor forces me into pvp.  I dont want pvp.   This is a much bigger problem for me than repair kits.  I get disconnected from server at the worst times, friends dont show up on my friends list,  there are much bigger problems in this game than repair kits in the atom shop.  You guys are losing it over something that's basically inconsequential.  
---
lmao 32 years old married IT Director here. My folks ask ME for money.
---
You aint wrong Glayden, this is another notch in beths bedpost, of the fuckbois she has been banging. 
---
After playing the mode, I realize this is the absolute best design. It keeps people from griefing if kills mattered to climb to that spot. It lets anyone reset their own timer for virtually no penalty. It increases tension as you live longer and longer. It can act as a bonus as people will seek you out and you can be ready for them. 
---
answers is more skins (e.g. for handmade...), lots of people will throw money at better skins
---
I like the Atom Shop. I like browsing. Trouble is there's not much there I actually want. I bought a small clean generator and would happily pay for a medium or large clean generator, but they're not there, in fact there's not much there at all, and the stuff that is there is really overpriced imo. The whole thing feels like a wasted opportunity.
---
The bethesda staff that's on reddit isn't responsible for this decision, the only thing they can do is to forward our complains to their higher ups.
---
There's nothing they can say that will make people feel better. It's a lose-lose situation. 
---
Absolutely not. I want fridge because fridge is awesome and I'm fine fixing my stuff to 200% at work bench.
---
Excellent moderating here I must say. 
---
You did check the control panel at the top?
---
Ps4 unfortunately my friend. I think I got an offer for 5k tho 
---
If you can trade cash for items, it's a cash shop. You're being pedantic. 
---
So you guys are not worried about the direction Atom shop is going? Good for you.
---
I personally are not happy about the direction. Repair kits themselves are not a game breaking mechanic, as stated you can easily repair in your base or anywhere else there is a armor/weapon workstation.
---
The problem is this eases an access to other types of items in Atom shop as they will see it's Ok for players they will keep adding game affecting mechanics to be bought in the shop.
---
Now about worst case scenario involving repair kits.
---
Raids. Do they have armor/weapon benches in easy access and plentiful? If not, then repair kits will soon be mandatory to have with you when going to these new raids.
---
Dropped repair kits. How often you get them and what events/monsters? Are we talking Fasnacht rarity or 3-star rarity? How many do you think you can get in a day?  
---
I check this reddit from time to time to see if people are happy and to see if it's a good time to hop in. 
---
Still happy i didnt buy. 
---
Its about the principle this time, they said cosmetic only, they need to stick to a promise or itll just get worse and worse to the point youll be buying scorchskin armour with atoms because its the best
---
Ok im all for the fridge but im asking how the 2 are different. 
---
I don’t expect much, but I expect certain limits to be upheld. I don’t care what it is, giving us small things could lead to them trying larger items that make no difference. 
---
By the way...its easier to farm caps and buy ballistic fiber from vendors or even reddit.  There are easy ways to amass caps.  Look into that.
---
After the way things went for FO76, going down that route is an actual option. What's there to lose? Plus, people tend to forget way to fast...
---
Seems as though the price has gone up! I did notice the console economy more cap rich than normal, the past few days. 
---
I feel pretty much the same. The daily and weekly challenges could use a bit of tweak, the amount of things you should do/craft for a measly 10 atoms is off putting most of the time.
---
When I originally acquired the plans 'organically' one would get a guaranteed geneator plan upon completiong and could not get duplicates from the 'Power Up xx' events until all the possible power generator plans were learned.
---
If this is still the case this means that they can be acquired for free - in fact 'get paid for acquiring them' - fairly easily even as a solo player which would make the asking price a reasonable one?
---
People still play this shitty game?
---
You damn well fucking can expect it WHEN THAT IS EXACTLY HOW IT WAS ADVERTISED.
---
People didn't fucking imagine that the Atom shop would have never go p2w or come up with their own conclusion that Bethesda would never add anything other than cosmetics to the shop. They EXPLICITLY advertised that ALL FUTURE CONTENT would come in free updates and that ONLY COSMETICS would be be solid in the shop. 
---
Do both. 
---
Skins can only get them so far, and unless it’s a a high end skin it likely won’t be that appealing
---
Agreed. By ,asking atoms in usable quantities more accessible I’d feel less ‘forced’ to pay up or go without. I honestly can’t find a reason to prevent them from being craftable AND tradable. That is what worries me. It’s one thing to pay atoms, which can be acquired with real money. It’s entirely different to gate them as a whole. 
---
Yes- no sparks, no damage, nothing. I even had music turned off so I could hear all the sound fx perfectly. I came to the conclusion it was bugged because two events were happening in the same area.
---
I see what your saying. That’s why I spend a little more than I should on atoms. I think the bundles like the vault Tec sets and the scientist bundle are a step in the right direction. Spending more at once, but getting more at once.
---
I’m just not gonna buy them. And if we all don’t buy them, then they won’t try this shit again.
---
See? Simple. 
---
DAE REPAIRKITS BETHESDABAD
---
I'm honestly not surprised.
---
I mean is that something you have data to back up? I don't but all I know is that my armor breaks in one play session now and I went from rarely having to repair to running around with broken armor all the time now. (Same with my wife)
---
Hold on, this is how you turn it into anthem? Don’t get me wrong the game is shit but they don’t have utility items you can buy with real cash. 
---
So, no objectivity whatsoever.
---
Geeze you sound like one of those little kids throwing a temper tantum in the grocery store.  Just enjoy the fucking game.  
---
granted that the NCR Rangers dont exist yet in this game's timeline, but i mean the legendary "Black Armor" of the NCR rangers was just repurposed L.A.P.D. Riot armor with a duster over it, there's no reason someone couldn't have thrown together this outfit with pre-war LAPD Riot gear before the NCR was formed
---
And we all know how brainless Steam wallet-zombies are. They would make absolute bank off of that.
---
Most of that money difference on console goes to the licensing fees.
---
It’s £18 for Xbox one digital and that probably includes 10 to Microsoft .
---
So when people say if it goes P2W I’ll stop playing that’s fine by them less infrastructure costs to them and you are just a leech at that point.
---
I’m on board for Ranger Armor. 
---
future sales are hardly are leasable source of income. 
---
not endorsing, just saying'.
---
Same thing keeps happening to me, one min I'm over encumbered the next in not. My carry capacity keeps going up and down to, without buffs being enabled, guessing its maybe a glitch. 
---
Coming to an Atomic Shop near you: the new Vault-Tec WeightReducer3000!
---
That is lazy gaming. You can already convert .38 to any ammo type. I built a .38 auto pipe rifle which is quite effective at killing low-mid lv enemies. (Which is what i find while farming lead,gunpowder, and steel)
---
Presto! Spend .38, get other ammo. It just takes some time.
---
Stomthing need to be done about the damn campers at the train stations 
---
Absolutely spot on man, it is their own ethics that they are crapping on. It makes it more frustrating, when one of the E3 selling points, was "not a P2W game", which drew in a lot of preorders. 
---
Just because he (more likely scenario is \*the team\*) has data, education, and that's the job doesn't mean he (or they) actually knows how to practically apply that data and education. Lots of companies and individuals screw up all the time...
---
1-The game now cost 30 buck.
---
2-Get it through your head that there is no additional cost if it gives you the needed currency in abundance if I may add.
---
3-It's no burden but to people that don't understand the definition of P2W it may see that it is.
---
3-What do you think they will add.
---
4-Yes I bought the game but their choices don't harm me. It didn't physically harm me or any thing and it didn't affect the games economy or experience, so I don't see any reason other than people wanna get butt hurt that people are complaining about these things. If youv want to complain find a shitty YouTube video don't make me explain why your wrong.
---
I just want a big spiky mohawk or dreads for character...!
---
... And a 'Got a mic?' emote would be handy. 
---
I gave up on having any working lighting system in my Camps, purely for how difficult it is to get a system that both works and is clean looking.
---
Sure having sloped ceilings probably doesn't help make it easy for me, but even with flat roofs it's bloody hard to make it work and look nice.
---
After their large scale fuckups, I'm surprised they legitimately think they can afford this. The game already sold poorly, now they screw themselves out of even more money. Going back on a promise like this *will* cost them a LOT. A lot of support and a lot of money. 
---
Great to see Bethesda turning into Rockstar, though. As soon as CC became a thing we should have seen it coming. 
---
Paid mods, then they buy into the resource-gain multiplayer genre, then they go back on a big promise. Remember post High-Life, when Rockstar said they'd leave fun glitches the players enjoyed that provided no unfair gain unpatched? Lies. Clothing glitches patched, car launches patched. Bethesda is just as full of shit as Rockstar and potential money is all they give a fuck about. They see dollar signs, they jump at a stupid decision. 
---
Don't expect a change, Bethesda is going to run this game into the fucking ground, and they only have themselves to blame. Good job, you managed to completely *fuck* a triple-A series. You complete fucking idiots.
---
It's about ethics in games journalism
---
Why you ask? Money money money money money. Mr.Krabs wasn’t this greedy
---
Game is fine, I’ve been reading all the threads praising them for what a good job there doing and that everyone was overreacting at launch 
---
Keep up the good work Bethesda 
---
Every character is a mule with 1 for playing, i don't seperate loot but just give them all what needs to be moved at the time, literally have a bit of everything on them all!
---
Bethesda doesn’t matter what the community says.
---
Yes, once you use it, the secret ending will show and you unlock every legendary item.
---
It's not, some people just want to complain about something this week.
---
If we accept this now, what can come next? The problem is not the kits, this can lead to the appearance of more objects outside of cosmetics 
---
No I don’t have any data backing this up, but haven’t seen a single post about people’s gear breaking faster . I read about food spoil faster and that’s it. 
---
But this repair kit thing is making people believe the gear will break faster and I don’t believe it is or will be like that . The shit this game would get then would make this seem like nothing . No game developer can be that stupid . If that would happen I would uninstall in a second . Right now ? I like the game and the kits would not effect me , I repair with my perk cards to 200% . So no need for kits 
---
Check your Stat-Effects. See if anything is going on.
---
Otherwise, in similar manner, my level 50 rifle has lowered itself to squirt gun damage in the past for unknown reasons. It seemed to fix itself shortly after. Reboot might help, but I think it is Bethesda's outstanding programming skills and attention to detail.
---
I think it's safe to assume the communities reaction was well anticipated and their strategy of handling it planned in advance. Bethesda is not a corner shop, ey?
---
 people are still playing this trash game?
---
Let’s keep in mind that repair kits does not = pay to win. It doesn’t necessarily mean a flood of items to come that are gameplay-directed, advantageous, and the like. They aren’t even out yet and some folks are shouting like the damn sky over WS is falling. We’ve all been very vocal about our dislike of this. 
---
IF they end up implemented after all of this, they’ll be pulled shortly after and provided as a drop. 76 has some issues, but the devs do listen. It’s easy to tunnel vision in on the nerfs we didn’t particularly care for despite progress in needed areas as well. Just keep the volume up on the dislike, but don’t go full blown apeshit with assumptions for the future of the game. They’re adding something WE asked for, for months. The idea is right, the execution is what is flawed. 
---
Give this man gold
---
How will you not have the same advantage? If you complete challenges then you earn atoms and can purchase the same things.
---
You know damn well that the repair complaining did not ask for atom shop repair kits, which brakes an original promise of the game.
---
It would be my first haha. 
---
Here we go
---
So are you being purposely fucking dense, or do you REALLLLLLYYYYY not get whats going on. If its hard for you i can try and explain :)
---
Gears. I'm broke and an always out of gears, but I have 5000 atoms waiting to be spent
---
You musing  the point off my post, but ok
---
Stop downvoting this guy, you fucking dicks. Can you IMAGINE what these poor CMs have to clear for notifications right now? I wouldn't like being tagged 93 times, and neither would you.
---
They are not i just don't need repair kits
---
Nope orginally i just had 
---
I think it's pay to win- because people thought that
---
I don't care- it's supposed to be that it's ok with you but i guess it can be taken another way 
---
I don't care but it's a slippery slope- it's ok but it worries you with the precedent it sets.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
So, what fallacy is it when you have no real argument besides reciting your humanities 101 book? This is obnoxious as fuck to read. It’s not a real conversation, it’s just you trying to discredit someone because they recognize human behavior, and you recognize a bullet point. 
---
Just because something resembles a fallacy does NOT mean it’s a fallacious statement. 
---
Can I ask, what do you see when you look at the big picture?
---
Just spam it everywhere, this is outrageous
---
It has nothing to do with skill doesn mean it's acceptable.
---
All we're saying is that someone playing 2 hours a day should not have the same level of progress compared to someone who plays 12. Nor should have ways to bypass some of the mechanics which in that case is grinding for repair materials.
---
Like i said in another post its all about this being P2W. Your money should not bypass what should take time even if you have little of it available.
---
Its been about that price for some time.
---
I bought the plan from Graham for about 240 caps (pre patch 7).
---
Curious: Why do you say the FG is an end game item?  
---
The same result can be achieved by building a number of the other generators.  Granted, they are louder/uglier, but they get the job done.
---
This is the first thing I've seen about 76 since the canvas bag controversy. I see it's going about as well as I thought it would be lol
---
Arrrrrghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
---
the spoil timer is very broken. I hit "feed the people" tonight with a couple of low levels for the stack of "meat stew" to use during the double XP weekend. The bonus is 5% XP for an hour for each can, and its a stack of 5 so it should amount to 5 hours roughly of increased XP for completing the event. 10 real world minutes later the condition on the stack had fell to 50% with "good with salt 3" equiped, how is this reward even usable like this?
---
Mods sticky this please
---
Sorry this YouTuber got under your skin. Follow the good YouTubers that have integrity and actually play for fun ;). IGP, manlybadasshero, etc... I feel your frustration though for decent fo76 YouTube content. 
---
I would be really pissed if they would allow to buy respec of special or stars for the weapons 
---
A level 10 can't buy it tho - the different generators, like the building set plans, have level requirements.
---
Is it too late for a refund? If they go through with this it's no longer the product they advertised.
---
I hear what you're saying. I just hope Bethesda does too.
---
XB1? I have a 3 star vampiric one with swing speed and endurance 
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals if you need a safe space
---
In a way this is about the fridge. If we allow them to set the precedent of paying for utility with a repair kit. What’s to stop them making us pay for a fridge. 
---
As they are not using any materials to fix stuff they must be magical what meant most likely 0 weight.
---
Or it could backfire and they add more stuff that people would buy. Hopefully they see this backlash though.
---
If one person is doing something at one speed and another person is doing something at a faster speed, the faster person is................ winning. Why not murder someone and say I didn't kill them, they just died faster.
---
It's not the repair kits, it's the way in which they could be the thin end of the wedge opening the way for larger more OP p2w
---
There's a megathread now 🤷‍♂️
---
Well they already are lol. Its confirmed that they are going in the atomic shop. 
---
Big man shaka on the ting. Nice one neebs
---
If people want to waste their money that's fine by me.  As long as you can get them in game it doesn't bother me if they have an option for super lazy people with money to burn.
---
I actually wanted Vault Tec skins. Of course, I already have several of them so I get screwed that way. 
---
Can the time limit be extended based on Bethesda response as well? Wouldn’t want them to argue it was just an immediate backlash when the news just came out/it died down really quickly. Also since I still haven’t seen a response, unless I’ve missed it somewhere. 
---
Or put a symbol in front of each so they stay at the top of the list.
---
All of sudden you hear 👂 something , thus your ears deceive you ?! no! It’s really happening slowly you hear a tune and it’s the sweet melody of the gods..
---
Tell me lies , sweet little lies ... 
---
Todd Howard’s will come trough a mist of fog whilst wearing his brown shinny leather jacket , just like is has pulled of a dream carriage pulled by a majestic stallion.
---
“Don’t you guys have phones ?”
---
Grinding out atoms isn't hard, imo. I bet they're seriously regretting the amount of challenges that can yield atom reward. As for the repair kits, I think it's a silly system that should have been considered with respect to the teamwork element of the game. Why the hell couldn't we have craftable repair kits that we can drop to teammates in the midst of battle?
---
Every mmo has similar stuff. MOST dont let you earn currency like atoms. And its quite easy to earn them. Missing the point of your post? Oh boohoo, another gaming company broke their promise with an online game. Yet you're probably still playing just like 90% of those who continue to complain about an online game.
---
Are either of them confirmed to be ONLY atomic shop? Like can we make them in game without atoms?
---
Bethesda's sustainability isn't the players responsibility and as such they shouldn't suffer for their poor decisions. Bethesda is a massive company whose games sell multiple millions of copies on name value alone. 
---
Gotcha. Next time I'm fined at the race track for using tire softener, I'll say I wasn't paying to win, I was just using a time saving item.
---
Why'd this brilliance get nuked?
---
There's also the desert ranger armor, which was modeled after the riot gear and issued by the USMC. There could easily be a forest ranger version issued to marines on the east coast.
---
I dont see anything that says we can
---
PR Crisis? There's been no Press/media talk about this, only ones whinging are the one who are going to whine regardless.
---
You want free DLC, you want free feature updates. Yet you're not prepared to pay for it despite the fact you can earn the currency, free?
---
Does anyone on this Reddit understand the money pit this game is? Atom store designs... updates, network and data/storage and stability are NOT free, y'dig?
---
Weapon maintenance is a big part of the game and having the ability to bypass that breaks the flow. Weapons and armor are primary scrap consumers. When you collect scrap, it most likely goes to repair the weapon you have first. In later levels, weapon repair can become intensive and a person normally carries around a couple of other weapons to replace it when it breaks. By having purchasable repair kits, you allow players to subvert a big part of the game and carry less guns as back ups. This appeals to people who have money to dump but it's unfair to the people who won't dump money into the game set up like this because its bs. Instead of scavenging for ultracite or nuclear material, you can pay a couple of bucks. While people can earn it in game, it's not an easy way to get it compared to forking over cash.
---
Pull your tongue out if Todd’s arse Gary. Dogs do that. You’re not a dog are ya Gary?
---
I agree about that, I just think that all the crying make you guys look like cry babies and I find it funny lol
---
You mean Power Ranger armor right because if so i am down.
---
This is most idiotic thing for support to do. They shouldn't even have access to do this.
---
Obviously someone at Bethesda literally had the thought "yeah just change their name, fuck 'em" and just did it.
---
This has nothing to do with journalistic ethics dude. 
---
Same, i run a Strength build so i can switch between Melee/Heavy guns/Shotguns
---
Don't fuck up my game because you don't have time to play it
---
You would actually have to pay $5 dollars cause there is no $2 option to buy atoms. There SHOULD be. But noooo it'd be a crime against money to make a $2 option.
---
please be careful with the slippery slope argument. I'm tired of seeing people complain about it then declare it is only a matter of time till Bethesda triples the repair cost and halfs the total junk in the game to force people into buying it. It completely undermines the argument when you jump to bullshit extremes based on nothing but paranoia and drugs. 
---
Happen to me after patch , I did the following.
---
Cure all negative stats 
---
Stripped of all from armor , including clothes.
---
Leave team ( if any )
---
Unequipped all my weight reducing cards 
---
Reload and equip back everything 
---
Tbh I was loosing my mind until i decided to give this a shot and it worked , hopefully it fixes your problem too if you try this :)
---
A fusion generator is not an end game item. Power up Poseidon twice and it yours for free. I got this pretty early on, just this way. I'd say if you don't have it by level 40 (way later than I did), your doing something wrong. 
---
Where is it confirmed?? They only briefly mention them in the Inside the Vault.
---
So you're basically saying: if Coca Cola were to release a new product that doesn't meet consumer expectations, doesn't taste that great and is bound to cost the franchise money rather than make money - then, instead of not supporting the product and instead of not openly voicing concerns, we SHOULD buy the product anyways and keep our mouths shut so that Coca Cola may recover and keep releasing new and... er... exciting beverages?!
---
Given the response, I'm pretty sure the CMs get the message. Not at all surprised that they've been radio silent all day today.
---
&gt; **EDIT**: Assuming this way of handling things goes smoothly this time around, I'll talk to the others about making this our standard procedure for subreddit-flooding issues going forward. 
---
Mods as an aside, funnelling people to a single post to avoid dupes is VERY common in decent gaming subs, except those mods tend to be more proactive and their mods tend to nip that bud in minutes or hours rather than days. You know, stuff like multiple posts linking to the latest release of ItV post or patch notes. 
---
There's almost no reason to have more than one of theses sorts of posts so why not just deal with it immediately than taking a 24-48 hr wait and see approach?
---
If there's a new development, we'll consider resetting the clock
---
Question to you.  I build my CAMPs in open spaces and have trouble sometimes with intersecting objects.  I've never tried to build mine in a cave etc.  Don't you encounter same errors when you built your CAMP?  Is there a trick to this?
---
Not sure what about my comment led to yours.
---
Nobody is forcing anyone to open their wallets and pay for anything they don't want. That is the only thing I said.
---
Thats where its confirmed lol. The same confirmation that everyone has for the repair kits
---
Before ya'll jump on the hate train I'd suggest waiting untill its actually implemented.
---
And even if it is exactly like people fear it will be, there is nothing forcing you to buy it, and you wont be handicapped in the game if you do not have it.  
---
At this point it feels like people are just looking for any excuse to hate on Bethesda, all this could be doing in the worst case is people exchanging money for a small time saving. There is nothing wrong with that as people shouldnt be automatically rewarded for grinding and spending tons of time in a game vs people who lack time because they're out there doing useful things in the world.  
---
Those people can then spend some of their hard earned cash in exchange for not having to scrounge for materials all the time to repair their stuff.  
---
Sitting in the basement at your parents place playing FO76 all day doesnt entitle you to being automatically "better" than anyone spending less time on the game, instead of spending all this time and energy complaining about something that "might" not be entirerly what was originally vaguely promised somewhere by middle management is you should find a decent job or get a degree or whatever and go earn some money, you can then spend it if this superfluous item is so important to your precious gameplay.  
---
I also find it amusing that the people who are complaining the loudest about this are those that didnt give a flying fuck about duping, which was an actual problem, not this.  
---
It all comes off as incredibly petulant, atleast I know the youtubers are doing it just to generate traffic for their ads.
---
tldr: Get your priorities straight and stop whining like entitled little brats, FirstWorldProblems shouldnt get you all worked up like this.  
---
(Bring on the downvotes eh? :) )
---
I equip Green thumb and harvest razegrain at billings homestead? for an easy 216 caps per day. well 2-3 days ago  i picked the whole field fast traveled twice cuz the first vendor was already wiped out. By the time i got to the second i couldnt find the razergrain in my inventory. Took me 5 mins to find the 216 spoiled grains &gt;&lt;
---
Whether they should or shouldn’t suffer doesn’t matter, they are suffering and if they suffer we will suffer.
---
Doing a shotgun rifle build and hoping i don't fuck this one up, had a level 50 character who just did no damage so i restarted 
---
Be careful? I’m not suggesting it is the case. I’m suggesting it IS an unfortunate and often unwanted occurrence in games that offer advantageous micro transactions, and that we expect Bethesda to stand by their promise to avoid them. Merely pointing out that I’ve been in similar boats before and they capsized. Wanting them to offer some level of solidarity with their own claims is not dangerous nor paranoid.
---
That’s what you consider a danger sign? Seriously? 
---
They won’t , company must have a policy that forbid comments like that.
---
And given that they didn’t go, whoops guys just wanted to find another funding since we kinda effed up a bunch.
---
This kit will hit the atom store , if wanted to do right Bethesda should add more cheap cosmetics and avoid doing battlefront 2 remember that fiasco ?
---
Hiya, thanks for the meaty reply, thought I might get something not so nice :)
---
I did not that ALL DLC was to be funded through the shop.  Indeed, that changes things a bit.  So would.folksnclaim that a DLC package described above would not be cosmetic? As in it would create an unfair balance?  
---
As for the slow.grind for Atoms, it doesn't affect me since theres not a darned thing that I want from the shop....I'm not into skiims and whatnot.  
---
I definitely agree that Beth pulled a switcheroo and has lowered themselves.
---
Yes I play the game...had it since Christmas from my wife.  It's not my favorite of the series :(
---
Gots to get the kids to.school and get to work.  Cheers mate!
---
Why is this tagged NSFW?
---
Bethesda is going to come to your house, hold a gun to your head and force you to buy an optional item?
---
Can't wait.
---
Coolio! Thanks for the response
---
Don’t know if you read the thing but they will also be free in game and why would you use this win perks can repair it like by 200%?
---
Warframe has allot of convenience items and not pay to win this 1 thing wlll not make fallout pay to win 
---
I’ll give my 2 cents , I agree with the crowd but for a certain amount of reasons.
---
Any ways I gave my feedback 🤯
---
Fast travel to Watoga, and sneak behind a Protectron. I do that every time, hitting him with my All Rise, and each time it completes the sneak part of the quest. It's a pain on fast travel caps but it does the job! I'm not sure, you may have to complete Mayor for a Day. Or maybe not, but Watoga Protectron sneaks always deliver.
---
That is only a confirmation that they exist. You have no idea how they will function. They don’t talk about that at all. 
---
Most online games already have similar features that add "convenience" to their subscription-less games. Path of Exile comes to mind.
---
I am a paying customer. Im okay with paying for cosmetics. I loved survival and because of that I purchased atoms.
---
I want a game where you can't get advantages by paying. PR crisis is here. If you don't see it your opinion is irrelevant. 
---
No, I hear you perfectly, I just disagree. Since we’re both on the same page about this not concerning skill, I don’t see the problem with letting people who don’t have as much time bypass some of the mindless grind.
---
Or, to put it another way, I don’t get the philosophical distinction between “pay to win” and “be unemployed to win”.
---
By removing duplicate top posts you actually ARE inhibiting the community expression here.  When 10 of the top 25 are very similar that shows the magnitude of sentiment.
---
Let it be organic.
---
Idk I didn't do it.
---
So get this. Reloading to a different server can change whether or not an object will let you jam it in somewhere. I don't know how, or why it works, but between that and the rug workaround to the old cooking station glitch, I was able to clip all the second floor into the stone walls. It's just a frustrating process.
---
Go figure server hopping would work it's way into camp building too! 
---
I would find it surprising if Bethesda didn't already know know this was going to cause outrage. 
---
Whether you are a professional in the industry, or just the average gamer, at some point in the last decade you should have been exposed to the countless number of times a company get slammed in media for the same practices. It might be mainstream media, gaming media, or social media, but at some point it gets pretty hard to avoid. 
---
I have literally seen forums and subreddits explode over stuff like this. If you are a developer and unaware of these trends in gaming... I mean, come on, get your fucking head out of the sand. 
---
It doesn't sound like you want a discussion at all. You've already made up your mind.
---
I agree that the shop isn't required,  yet I entirely understand why people are concerned as shop items start to bring mechanical advantages instead of just visuals.
---
Being able to save some atoms over time is well and good,  but the model is literally created to get you to spend money.  It is the road these things lead to that bothers people. 
---
Maybe in a year or two.  All the cool updates aren’t even out yet. People will still buy later.  But as Bethesda, you have to weigh in on whether pay to win micro transactions will profit more than the possibility of people leaving the game because of this and not spend money on cosmetics only
---
Right? We get free DLCs and free Atoms and that's ok but paid shitty repair kits with a dropped better alternative is somehow a no-no. This histeria is getting ridiculous.
---
Agreed 
---
I just read that to the song styling of McDonald's filet of fish commercial.

---
wrong sir! i am already being pushed to buy repair kits because my gear is CONSTANTLY BROKEN. either my armor is shucked off in seconds via a flying bat monster using the echo attack CONSTANTLY, or the enemies are dumb bullet sponges that require unholy amounts of round/weapon condition to kill, the only way to keep them repaired is to ALWAYS interupt my play to go farming for mats. without scumming, this farm also takes longer then the actual play. Not to mention this farming/scuming requiers me TO KILL ENEMIES and i am constantly getting attacked by bat monsters causing my weapons/armor to degrade. 
---
the only thing mote they could do to force me to buy these repair packs would be to put a literal gun to my head. 
---
saying they dont force you is as true as saying they don’t force you to play the game so of corse you don’t need repair kits to survive real life! 
---
Honestly, I spend almost all of my Atoms on CAMP items. I wish there were more decorative items, like wood floor stairs instead of the stupid chain link fence floor.
---
I also really wish there were more faction items. I want the option to decorate with BoS, Enclave, or even Responders stuff in game.
---
Seeing as Bethesda doesn’t have to pay more to put it on the shop this isn’t an accurate assessment, tho I think people should voice there concerns but Bethesda has concerns of their own that they must tend to. People are just seeing that this is a broken promise but the promise was made at launch when they thought the game was going to go great, but the situation changed and they need to be receiving more money out of there game if they want to be able to continue supporting it.
---
You would think 
---
Given that they said in other words 
---
We gonna sell weapon potion at 1 dollar but hey we will give you the ability to craft the good weapon potion that is given your lucky enough to get something we are making available only one week odds for lot are 0.003%
---
Not worth it unless you PvP
---
It's an Open PvP mode, what did you expect? Oh and PvP is a joke in Fo76 anyway, sadly.
---
Risk of survival, you know what you signed up for 
---
Then it was the mods, I presume... which really needs an explanation. Are they trying to limit the visibility of this post so that underage and those with NSFW filter on wouldn't see this, as a form of shitty PR control?
---
"This is our first attempt at utilities like this" is a quote from inside the vault regarding the repair kits and the upcoming appliances. 
---
Get my uptoke
---
And you don't, 100% repair vs a 200% repair.
---
50 damage vs 75 damage.
---
Tell me more about him my opinion is "irrelevant"
---
They also promised the game would include a LOT more content then it shipped with. They lied about Fallout 76. That's why so many of us were PIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSED at them over the last few months. But let's ignore that for now.  
---
This was inevitable.   
---
Fallout 76 is not an online survival game by it's design, it's a "live service" game by design. Key point of evidence for that: only Bethesda can host the game. You can't. It's not like ARK, or Conan Exiles where you bought the game and can run it offline, or on your own server. YOU NEED Bethesda to play Fallout 76.   
---
That means Bethesda has to keep putting money into the game. They have to pay for the servers, for the staff, and for the bug fix team. Given how the market responded to their game though, they probably didn't have a ton of profit off this one compared to other releases. But that's ignoring the fact that the money from selling Fallout 76 was NEVER intended to be used to keep it running. No one does that. No, the money to keep the lights on was supposed to come from microtransactions and DLC.   
---
BUT (probably to calm down fans because they KNEW how much of a garbage fire this was going to be) Bethesda announced that all DLC and expansions would be free, and the Atom Store wouldn't sell game enhancements. So that gives a situation where there's no solution for them. Only a few idiots are going to spend $15 on a power armor paint job, so the Atom Store probably isn't a huge money maker. They need to bring in more revenue from somewhere else. They can't sell more games, because the game's rep is ruined in the eyes of the market. The only thing that could have broken is the "no game enhancements" pledge. It's the lease offensive option for them.   
---
The takeaway from this is: if this offends you (and it kinda should) get ready for it to get a lot worse. As they try to find ways to keep the game alive and bring in $$$, they will look into other options. In-game items and other enhancements WILL show up in the Atom Shop. And eventually, they'll have to start charging for DLC. That or they shut down the game's development, apologize and tell the public they can't afford to keep as many servers up and running, and start shutting them down one by one.  
---
If you need a hand, hit me up. GT same as Reddit handle.
---
We're well aware of the best practice from other subreddits, as some of us helped to develop that best practice :P
---
We're trying to strike the balance here, as there's a lot of resentment towards megathreading the issues du jour too quickly in many other gaming subs
---
And to clarify for you, there has not yet been an official response from them. 
---
The ONLY problem I can see with that is if you use those repair kits on items that are incredibly expensive to repair (end-game gear maybe?). It can happen.
---
It should be the reward of the next dungeon we are heading in. And should considering as a rare plan like fasnacht winter old man. That make the item valueable.
---
Good riddance!
---
We are allowing them. For two full days. 
---
You sound like you are unionized lol
---
Clean space suit helmet can spawn at the bottom locker room in whitesprings golf course. Rare helmet spawns at the Ranger office in cranberry bog as well(flight helmet other clean hats).

---

---
Thanks for the spots!
---
They’re gonna sell the basic but will grant the “chance” (since they have pretty effed up odds on things ) of getting better 150 , 200 condition duration kits plans by playing 
---
Are they impacted by Thru-Hiker?
---
You are reading way too much into that. Besides, they asked for feedback before they continue. Nothing is confirmed. But have fun in your world of hysteria.
---
Making Atoms more available is not an alternative. This is NOT a free to play game. It should not have free-to-play mechanics. 
---
Don’t let the door hit you on the way out 
---
I stopped playing for a while, what was the unstoppables test? I must have missed all that.
---
I’m open to discussion but I do have an opinion on it already formulated. I think you’ll find I’m willing to be convinced tho and see holes in my argument. 
---
It’s true that the system is designed to get you to spend your atoms but with all future DLC being available to everyone without a paywall then there has to be some way for Bethesda to recoup their money. 
---
At a certain point the base game sales will not fund the dev work and cost of running the servers and they’ll need to rely on other forms of funding for this. The atomic shop is the perfect solution as long as they don’t make it pay to win, and I don’t see QOL items as being P2W. Bethesda’s problem is not releasing better items in the atomic shop so people are more inclined to spend real world money imo.
---
They could say that they're passing out issues up. Might be an empty gesture but the silence every single time there's even the smallest controversy is maddening.
---
Wow you are one triggered, dramatic person lol. You took this completely the wrong way. Its ok i can downvote too🤣😘
---
I think the same. 
---
They knew how the community would react to this, I believe they are fully prepared to take this amount of backlash with silence to let all die quietly without taking any action to correct the situation.
---
did they announce they might include non cosmetics?
---
They literally explained that participation will reward better but hey, if there's a will there's a way
---
Holy shit. An animated series reference...
---
Not resounding, plenty of people have argued for them.
---
Excuse me Mr. Holier than Thou. Bold of you to assume I spend my life playing games from my parents' basement. I play it in my own housing. As for the degree, I am in college studying a Masters' in Theoretical Physics. I am about to start a PhD in a few months. I think that's more degrees than a lot of people on this sub combined. And I get paid for my research work, which I spent on this game. So I value my money. I invested in this game on the trust that it won't be p2w.
---
It makes it worse when you realize that new datamined vault themes have been found
---
Find it good in both pve and PvP, personally.
---
Not voting either way, but I think he wanted the clock not reset...  although that makes no sense, because then you get 48 hours unless they don't respond and if they so respond then the issue is new again so....  there is no scenario in which there is a limit under his proposal
---
Buy a costume, get free legendary....
---
Eeiiiii
---
Did that work? 
---
No thanks I don't want a Power Rangers Outfit - Pink, Red, Blue, Yellow, or Green suit as it would look strange in a post-apocalyptic environment. Just think every time I go into combat I must shout" GO GO Power Rangers". 
---
Also, how about cosmetics for your house, like modern, clean, new furniture, walls, floors, etc.
---
Let us go wild, lore wise you can always explain that in the end, we've all just nuked each other to death and none of our creations survived.
---
Damn right youre getting downvoted...
---
Quick look at your profile and you just go around getting downvotes telling everyone they're irrelevant before blocking them.
---
You're pathetic and actually irrelevant. Get blocked.
---
Me neither specially when the ones dropping in game are far better. 
---
Nothing about what you said suggests or supports mutual exclusivity though. I’m not saying atoms should be free. I’m saying if Bethesda was hell bent on making repair kits atom-only outside of their own discretionary in-game rare reward, it would help satisfy *my own* ire the tiniest bit if I wasn’t at a “new skin or X amount of repair kits for the week” impasse. No, it isn’t a solution, nor did I claim it to be. I’d simply be happier with it IF all of our collective expectations for how Bethesda should respond to this issue were not met. Cheers
---
People just hate change. It will pass, always does.
---
I found this thread very difficult to masturbate to.
---
Looking from "their, the people with the problem " angle, if it's one non-cosmetic what's to stop them from another non-cosmetic? When does it stop. Give'em and inch and they take a mile arguement.
---
But the idea repair kit can be able constantly purchase by atom is suck.
---
Just make the plan rare like winter old man mask. We will see valueable in them.
---
 starting a hashtag something like #bethpay2lie or anything would probably be pretty affective. When these things go viral, they often are forced to respond. 
---
Can you at least, rebut my argument? Why do you think that RK are the end of the world.
---
Yes I do say stupid people they are irrelevant and then block them. You are one of those.
---
in PVE there are better ways to spend those extra 3 points that I can think of. Even Tenderizer would be a better card.
---
You didn't answer the question about adventure vs survival. If it's adventure only, who are you racing?
---
I did. I just found it odd that I had no problems anywhere in the game except for a specific area, and that having only started recently, so was curious if anyone else experienced it. I also point out that so far as I have seen, people hate ws auto farm camps.
---
I thiiiiink Graham might sell it? I ended up lucking out an finding the plan in a random drawer the next day off me saying I was looking for the plan, but I was told to check Graham.
---
I’m pointing out that it’s not confirmed. 
---
You seem more “triggered” kid 
---
Exactly. Repair kits aren't pay to win and don't matter but lead to future p2w issues.
---
But most people are ignoring common cash store items.  These include things that aren't p2w but offer convenience. Often times xp bonus potions, bank space, and other items that don't offer advantage just easier gameplay.
---
While it's purely my speculation/perception, I get the sense that some exec really wants to push pay-to-win elements into the Atom Store. 
---
In some ways I don't blame them. Cool cosmetics that people want to pay for take skill and effort to design and you can only purchase once. Consumables like repair kits are much easier to design and are a bottomless pit in terms of consumption. Do the work once, earn money many time over. 
---
When it comes to the choice between taking the time and effort to do something right vs spending the absolute bare minimum to implement a feature, we know where Bethesda stands on that matter.
---
Maybe it's just me but it feels like we need to be ever vigilant when it comes to keeping Bethesda in check. They've already demonstrated that they're far from scrupulous when it comes to the Atom Store i.e. fake sale prices, artificial scarcity with very short limited time availability etc. Sadly I don't see that changing any time soon.
---
They just did.
---
Hopefully soon lol it was entertaining to just scroll through and look at posts but now its grueling to find one that's not just more of the same.
---
Yeah. This is probably where it's going.   
---
Unique armors and weapons. New quests and dungeons. This shouldn't be a huge surprise to anyone.   
---
Here's my advice to Bethesda: Lower your damn prices! If you want people to buy items from the Atom Shop, make them cheaper! I'm not going to dump $10 (let alone $15) on a paint job for power armor, or for a new set of power armor. What your pricing model is doing, is scaring away people who might be willing to buy shit if it was cheaper. Make a new, unique suit of power armor only $5 and I'll friggin buy it. Other people will as well. Same goes for weapons. Make some unique ones and sell them for a few bucks apiece and people will buy them. And you will make more money. 
---
Silos are technically an MMO style dungeon. It's just not a fully instanced dungeon but it's partially instanced per server.
---
Prepare to be dissapointed.
---
Name checks out, I guess.
---
It’s not though
---
Usually swap to it with strange in number when in team, loan wonderer when solo. Do agree with tenderiser though, most useful charisma card arguably.
---
This is one of the most asinine things I've read on here to date. The sky is not falling chicken little.
---
Tbh even the ammo converter is a pointless and un-necessary item.
---
Why do we even need it? It seems like a more complicated work around for a more simpler solution, it could have been quite easyly solved by allowing players to sell excess ammo to vendors AND then buying ammo we did need 
---
Have you tried getting a reward for a plan in this game ?
---
The odds are so slow the day you get them , buy a lotto ticket 
---
Hahhaha get it because the username is relevant to the comment!!!11!!!!!!1!
---
Lol this is a really good idea! I would’ve never thought of doing something like this, my hats of to you! I mostly play solo and it gets very lonely out there in the wasteland at times. 
---
That's fair IMo
---
Good move, now can you by any chance unsubscribe from this sub Reddit as well?? 🤔
---
I feel like slippery slope arguments usually have a bit less context. 
---
Like "If we let gays marry, what next? Marrying dogs?"
---
As opposed to "This is a live service game and those things thrive off micro transactions. It's a concerning step towards actions other games in this format have taken"
---
brb, buying more atoms
---
It is p2w. Currently I am rocking gunsmith 5 int, white knight 3 agi and 2 luck for rank 2 luck of the draw. I am happy with my build and 200% durability last for 4-5 hour session. And I don't have to swap cards a lot to obtain it. However a repair kit will eliminate the need for these perks. And everybody is using some or all of them. The paying user if they decide can remove them and use the item to win more easily by paying, especially in survival. Or I don't know ... The Burrows perhaps, where more dps and survivability will probably be key to complete. And without the need for a sidearm, more loot can be hauled.
---
Exactly, if people want to pay money to be weaker than using vanilla mechanics, I say let em have at it. If people want to speculate negatively I'll speculate positively. If they keep adding Pay2bWeaker items that people buy, that may allow them to drive down the cost of cosmetics.
---
Oh so you came back you argue lol that's so cute. I'm not a keyboard wussie so you can continue with your little hissy fit. Have a blessed day buddy! 
---
They plan on releasing Basic Repair Kits "on the Atom store," while Improved Repair Kits will drop from enemies (particularly the Scorchbeast Queen).
---
What's unclear is if they meant the kits *themselves* will be for individual purchase on the Atom Shop, or if the plans will be. If the former, that means people can use real money to keep their gear topped off &amp; bypass the entire repairing mechanic, which is what has folks upset.
---
No. I’m enjoying it. Feel free to leave though yeah? Don’t let the door hit you in the ass on the way out putz. 
---
Cheers! I hope my slippery slope quip hit that nail squarely. I’ve participated in other gaming communities where you didn’t feel the slow increase in “waves” as a big deal until you realized you were damn near drowning in advantage consumables and the like. I can’t see Bethesda doing that, but I also never saw Bethesda suggesting the current issue were discussing. Hell, I never imagined they’d do an open world multiplayer rpg. They’re in uncharted territory by comparison. Absolutes and expectations are going to mean less, I think.
---
This is just pathetic for a big company like this and their most hyped multiplayer game. One ugly shotgun skin, sold in a bundle, and in order to sell it they had to make existing shotgun skin fugly. The management need to pull their heads out of their collective a$$. 
---
That's not p2w either, all that means is you're making a smart decision to spend atom points to repair end game weapons insead of a pipe pistol or something.
---
He's right you know, do some research.
---
"Yea i do say stupid people they are irrelevant"
---
Says the stupid one. But you keep on living in your own little bubble if it helps you sleep at night kid 👍🏻
---
I hope it works like fo3 where you could breakdown unwanted ammo for scrap to craft other ammo. I used to breakdown mountains of .22 ammo
---
Given all the miner protests in Appalachia before the bombs fell, it'd make sense for there to be riot gear around.
---
Not a huge surprise. Regardless of the promises they made to sell this garbage fire of a game.   
---
Gotta keep the servers running somehow, and pay the debugging team. 
---
Utility items are existent in many cash shops.  This allows people to spend money for shit instead of farming.  Bank space, xp potions, basic shit that doesn't make you do more damage or take less damage.
---
This sub is full of babies. 
---
&gt;  I’m suggesting it IS an unfortunate and often unwanted occurrence in games that offer advantageous micro transactions 
---
Such examples? What game had no or limited MTX then suddenly completely over hauled the entire game system to push more MTX? 
---
I've seen games be developed with MTX in mind (AKA GTA Online/Battlefront) and I've seen games offer very useful MTX like exp boosts while still retaining the same game development systems it always has had with nothing changing (AKA Runescape).  But I have not seen a game be completely over hauled with the introduction of MTX.   
---
So please show the examples that would validate someone saying that Bethesda will increase the repair cost of heavy combat armor from needing lets say 5 ballistic fiber to repair it to needing 20 ballistic fiber to repair it while at the same time  cutting the amount of junk that spawns with ballistic fiber in half in the game. 
---
I currently have 5 charisma. 4 lone wondered, 1 tenderizer.
---
Bye thrillux! I’ve known of your existence for about 37 seconds, but good luck with the future dude!
---
In game challenges for atoms = do tricks like a dogg for that mother fucker todd howard
---
Imagine the day they say.
---
Servers are going permanently offline , where you gonna display that 20 dollar skin for your power armor :(
---
Why not both?
---
Ah, I missed their last inside the vault thing. I will continue my tradition of never opening the atom shop
---
Alright, this was supposed to be a discussion not a one sided opinion and then ignoring me when I try to discuss with you.
---
Nice, I like to have Lone Wanderer + Travel Agent + Field Surgeon
---
Went there last night and stumbled upon a level 52 3* legendary mr gutsy who then slayed me in just a few seconds as I entered one of the side rooms.  
---
Unfortunately when I returned and cleared out the area the 3* was gone and only thing left was a crowned laser gutsy in the final room.  
---
&gt; We're trying to strike the balance here, as there's a lot of resentment towards megathreading the issues du jour too quickly in many other gaming subs 
---
Given that for the longest time the mods have been very hands off in this sub, I'm just glad you guys are looking into it at all to be frank.
---
As I mentioned, there are some no-brainer ones like the examples listed that I've been surprised in the past weren't dealt with at all. Hope to see more timely and pro-active measures in future :)
---
Since when do we owe stupid ass ideas any consideration? 
---
I like your style, you are the kind of person who says yes when everyone else says no.  
---
Uhh. You asked for feedback man. I answered. Take a step back and ask yourself who is having a hissy fit. 
---
Wow, didn't think about that. Will see, thank you!
---
Again, your entire last paragraph does not remotely resemble anything you will have found me to have said on Reddit to date, nor does it reflect my opinion. My slippery slope comment meant future additions of atom based items, be it bobbles,possible atom locked recipes for food storage, etc. 
---
You’re being incredibly confrontational over what comes across as misunderstanding my point of view lol
---
The mods don't really have a good relationship with me. I have previously made several posts calling out YouTubers for intentionally spreading false news about the game, those posts also garnered a lot of attention and both times they have deleted the post secretly without citing any reason or sending me a message. This time I am actually saying something bad about the game and Bethesda, maybe that is why my post has survived the ban hammer.
---
Unfortunately no haha.
---
Can't see myself purchasing anything from Bethesda for a while. I'll play the games I've already purchased or that are FTP. But for the next 5 years +, no Bethesda for me.
---

This is my planned respec. I'm pretty close to finishing it, last thing I need it to move some P to C and get the suppressor cards, but thats 6 total levels and im not sure if I should spend it elsewhere.
---
🤔😒👍👌
---
But if the repair materials are super rare, it will make using a repair kit (free mats) a P2W system
---
So the people that enjoy the game should stop playing just because you don't enjoy it?
---
No it's not a "stupid" ass idea. Hell the whole idea was from the fans, can you at least be happy that Bethesda is trying and listening us?
---
They are already did on twitter.
---
When you crouch you aren’t visible in hud if that’s your question. You are still visible on the map tho
---
 Nice CAMP Where’s the cave at?
---
the scrounging for materials, for me, is a big part of the feel of the game..it's post apocalypse, it should be dirty, tedious, dangerous and a struggle. I know this isn't what everyone wants, and I respect that.
---
Personally, if I find a repair kit out in the wild, great, but I won't be buying any. I'd rather curse that jammed gun, feel panic at the rip in my armor and get back to the chore of finding ballistic fibre and screws..
---
This is my planned respec. Last thing i need is to move some P to C and get the suppressor cards. What say you? Worth it for explosive vanguard/sentinel shotgun build?
---
Yes.  I believe they are.  My pepper and seasonings only weight 0.03 each or so. 
---
It's recently been added to my queen fight load out. That and tenderizer. But.... I honestly don't know how helpful it's being.
---
They just drop. And there's a vendor that sells the plan for ~4k.
---
No.  They really don't.
---
You hide from the map whilst crouched. It's Stealth for gods sake
---
If you don't want to walk all that way just unlock Morgantown station first
---
Okay so let's just think, how can that be p2w? Repairing a good expensive weapon doesn't directly relate to being p2w, you're only thinking that you'll repair the weapon to attack other players. Repairing a weapon doesnt directly lead to attacking players.
---
I always think the observatory is one of the toughest places on the map.
---
I mainly want it for pvp servers.
---
The beginning of?????? 
---
I would like a pink fairy princess dress with a matching tiara, god damnit
---
Rks are not the problem. Them being in the atomic shop is the problem. The idea that putting them in the AS is all good is what im calling a stupid ass idea. 
---
What BS is that? Which "fan" wanted repair kits to be atom shop items?
---
Exactly. What *I* want is for Bethesda to show some level of solidarity with their own promises of not doing that kind of stuff. I don’t expect an avalanche of purported P2W items, but I feel a “we won’t “ should mean “we won’t”, 100%. Cheers
---
Never claimed you said any of it just to be careful with said argument because it undermines people's argument when they jump to such extreme examples. 
---
Good to know thanks
---
Even then them being in the AS isn't a stupid idea. It's not p2w at all. Repairing a weapon doesn't directly lead to attacking a player.
---
Moaning about weapons an armour breaking in a multiplayer title is actually hilarious.
---
Did you play Fallout 3? New Vegas? Weapon an armour repairs isn't a new mechanic 😂
---
You're not getting an advantage over another player so...
---
If ypu're using chameleon armor/mutation, or a stealth boy, you are 90% invisible. They can see the same faint transparent outline that you do. If you're just crouching, you are 100% visible.
---
I think it must be a pretty fun game if you're feeling this way ;-)
---
I don’t think people are missing that point of it. That’s why people are arguing so fiercely. 
---
Weightless reduction is only on he base item weight.  Mods add weight to that without the 90% reduction   
---
They should remove camo paint schemes from the Atom Shop. You don't want to give players an advantage by them hiding in the bushes 
---
I’ve been trying to figure out the timeline, but yeah. Seems like the last of the Appalachia survivor’s died maybe just a few months before reclamation day.
---
I paid them when I was satisfied with the games progress. I won't be satisfied if the join the dark side.
---
Seee yaaaa! 
---
You are invisible on the map. You can not be targeted by vats unless already hit by an attack. You are plainly visible to other players.
---
Yes and GMT+2 IGN Geneziz
---
I'll do the quest tonight (I hope I have the time), so you can add me and check on any time. Just a fair warning I have a small alt which dwells on survival, so don't join worlds blindly.
---
Ahh, okay. I feel like we’re understanding each other now. It felt like you were suggesting I held those extreme views, and I’m just over here like “T_T what?”
---
Also, to address your question about games that went from no real p2w to being enamored with it? Ragnarok Online and World of Warcraft. They relaunched RO entirely on a cash shop that let you purchase almost anything, from end game materials, boosts and the like. WoW let’s you do character boosts, and whatnot. They just aren’t what they were when they started in that respect, as I played them both from launch. Cheers, man!
---
The sad part is some people would actually buy it again after that. 
---
I think people got the point 
---
Ah thank you that's what I wanted to know
---
Where does it say that ? Where does it say you vám use it in combat etc ??
---
Only 100% repair and does not match your inteligence up to 200%. A smart character should be able to use them to their fullest potential and get the same if not more from using them. AKA The right tools for the job. They are not worth real cash if they are just mediocre. 
---
It wasn't "which fan" it was the community. Look in the article before you try and comment something that is actually BS.
---
Thats a terrible idea. Why dont you just make the game automatically charge 10$ from your credit card on death while your at it.
---
And yet totally countered by Berry mentats.
---
They've already done that at the start of Wild Appalachia. not gonna disagree with getting more, just making that point
---
The one that drops in game will give you a 150% repair.  The one they plan to sell is a 100% repair.
---
If you ask me, a fridge is a far bigger advantage than a repair kit.
---
Thank you, that's good to know
---
Ooo I like that idea!
---
I thought  the rare masks never dropped?
---
If you get legendary items that regen your AP, you won't need Action Boy/Girl. And only 1 rank in Adrenaline is hardly worth it. It doesn't work well alongside Suppressor either. I just don't think 2 second debuff is worth it.
---
Also, if your build is for Bloodied shotgun, consider also getting Nerd Rage! from INT tree.
---
This community is the absolute worst.  Overreact, post, repeat.  
---
The beginning of "perk card packs just 200 atoms each, this weekend!"
---
Well if you read the first part of my reply before answering, that was the actual argument you dyslexic retard. I don't see any reason to be civil against ignorant retards that choose corporate dick over enjoyment. literally pushing gaming the way of everything mainstream,  no substance, just shit.
---
Because it's not about just repair kits. Repair kits are not the disease, they are the symptoms. Bethesda said that Atom shop will be cosmetics only. Now they put a non cosmetic item in the shop. If they see that people are ok with it, they'll slowly acclimatise us to more drastic game-changing content in the shop. Someday, they'll add new exclusive weapons to the shop. Then these people will argue "Why do you care if I use a weapon I bought for PvE?" Then, one day, they put a key on the shop that unlocks a quest area. This may sound like conjecturing and fear mongering, but these things have happened in other games before. Which is why we need to put a check on this.
---
I too think it's a latency thing, sad because I wanted to melee. Rubber banding  sucks too, but the melee thing is worse for me because I have no way to know if it will hit, and it can get dangerous.
---
This is literally what I suggested...
---
An example of why buliding limits need to be relaxed...people are already abusing this/floating builds to absurdity.
---
Yea retards all around with no forethought, just keep believing that giving these company and inch and they wont take a mile, or wont plough your asshole for another dollar.
---
No problem, if you're still confused at mixed inout just go back an watch any of the video's where Todd talks about how Stealth and player engagement works.
---
Can be.  I have been there six times. Twice it was surrounded by and filled with high level Liberators and was a joke.
---
But four times it was mr, major, and colonel Gutsy’s and Annihilator Sentry Bots outside.  Was a bit more serious those times.
---
But those containers inside seem to have a high rate of Plan spawns.  Each time I go I get 2-3 CAMP item plans and a random armor/mod plan.  
---
Hmmm... a very carefully taken quote.
---
They never said anything about fridges in the atom shop. They include fridges as a community desire. Just like repair kits.
---
Lol well it certainly doesn’t reflect that right now 
---
Rofl I can get behind that 👍
---
Yeah people asked for repair kits, but no one wanted them in the Atom Shop
---
That's a fair point but I'm wary of train stations as this trading areas are also camped. It'd be nice if they had some form of turret safe zone on them to prevent camping repspawn locations.
---
ranger armor instead
---
I'll try both tonight
---
Bethesda is clearly testing the waters. They did this last month with their costume bonuses and the players accepted it. People were warning that it was a slippery slope but most didn't listen. Now we have this. If we accept it, next will be exclusive guns and armor only available in the Atomic Shop.
---
It is super annoying! I will consider risking getting one I don't want, because I still haven't access to serums. Thank you!
---
They (survival) told us (survival) from the (survival) beginning, how (survival) this game (survival) would be (survival) a survival game.
---
(survival)
---
The thing is that even if this were the best possible decision that would benefit everyone in the long term, the obvious backlash from this choice is only hurting the game even more now. The reviews are already bad, and now with this, potential new players will be even more turned off at buying the game. If they were bleeding money before, well they just cut off their own heads. 
---
There was no need to add to the negativity with an obviously unpopular move. At the very least they should have waited a few years when they would've had a better over rating and reputation just by repeating what they have accomplished in the last couple of months.
---
I'll be here till the servers go down, but it is sad to see all the work they've done to improve community relations go down the tube like this. 
---
But they're not solely in the AS so..
---
Bethesda can write whatever BS they want in the article. They lied through their teeth, that's what they did. I follow this subreddit every day. Never have I ever seen requests for putting repair kits ir anything else in the atom shop. So tomorrow if Bethesda puts out an article and claims that "the community" wants them to charge monthly subscription for the game on top of the $60 price, you'd believe that without question? 
---
I thought I qualified as a Bethesda fanboy with the way I defended the game with my life, but at this point people have turned into bootlickers.
---
Good idea I should of done that before I started playing 
---
Sadly ranger armor is impossible as NCR isn't founded yet.
---
Cheers man the thing is people rarely see the consequences of their actions and wishes. I do live in my own little bubble but its an anti-ignorance shield. They guy knows shit and if he denies the fucking fact that if the game goes the direction of purchasable items that can give you any tactical advantage, then inviting people into this game (already hard as it is) would become semi-impossible, then his opinion is one of fucking lunatic and is complely irrelevant.
---
I am tired of explaining obvious things to people that are intellectualy inferior. I understand that its sounds like 14yo prick thinking he's awesome, but I suffer enough because how fast I process information, I wont be suffering more by trying to be nice for people who know shit yet think know it all. They don't. And I fucking do. I worked hard to get here.
---
 Arrogant people - fine. Arrogant ignorant people? Im saying the truth their opinions are irrelevant and blocking them.
---
I really dont give a shit for opinions of peopel unable to see consequences of actions, because they ARE fucking irrelevant, just as you.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Well when you are circumventing gameplay to speed up progress with real money, that is one of the definition of P2W, and don't ascribe this shit to poor choices, monetisation of all options available is heavily considered
---
I just want a ‘take the goodies in the paper bag’ emote...
---
You're getting downvoted because your opinion is extremely short-sighted. Most people who are against repair kits in the Atom Shop, are against it because it could lead to more utility items in the Atom Shop as well, meaning more and more of an advantage is given to those who buy those items in the shop, as opposed to those who just play the game.
---
Nice 😎👌 lol
---
Removing redundant/old posts to allow fresh debate on a hot topic is exactly the right thing to do.  Keep up the good work mods.
---
No its high health. I have a aae pump anx tse combat and double barrel, and a set of vanguard armor, a couple are sentinel.
---
What would recommend for agility? Right now I have 11 AGI, 4 adrenaline, 3 action boy, 3 enforcer, 1 gun fu. 
---
Yeah but what did they release before that? If they wait too long between store updates or don’t release enough new items then it’s too easy to save up points to purchase everything you want for free. 
---
I’m really not complaining as I’m not in the financial position to be spending anymore than the $60 I payed for the game, but I understand why the atom shop is there and its to fund future dlc. 
---
By making smarter business decisions Bethesda can make the money they need to keep the game running for years to come while also not being tempted towards the darker side of in game purchases.
---
You also forgot that you can.. wait for it.. play the game normally, like you play it now. They arent removing the ability to fix gear without a repair kit.
---
Honestly I am surprised they haven't reused the security armor from Fallout 4 as SWAT gear. That would be a really neat item to have. They could even doll it up in responder, BOS, raider, and Free-States livery.
---
Reasonable policy, actually pretty cool and 'light touch.' 
---
I've *never* seen a game sub so flooded with backlash posts, not even AnthemTheGame after that recent expose or even Blizzard's Diablo, "What, you guys have phones, right?" stupidity.  But that's probably because the mods in those cases must have had much stricter policy.
---
No one here ever posted a drop confirmation screenshot so it’s not trusted if anyone actually received them or if the people with them were cheaters or got them from cheaters.  
---
You know what else would help sale numbers? It not costing half the price of a game for a single paint job. Cheaper items are more justifiable and stack up where as a big cost then puts you off doing it again unless you have problems with financial management or more money than care.
---
Last I looked, while ago as stopped playing the game but waiting to come back when more to do, there wasn't a huge amount in the store. Add more variety and lower their cost so people think oh I'll buy these 2 and mix the colours rather than "hmm which one of these £20 skins looks overall better". 
---
There's two ways to make profit. Sell it high and depend on whales and the occasional buyer; sell it cheap so lots of people can afford it and it stacks up as a few quid isn't noticeable at a time. 
---
The best way to do it for Fallout is going to be lots of choices at reasonable prices. I can't play the game without my Excavator Suit but I can't decorate it. Give me half a dozen patterns at a low price and I'd get a few to mix and match but give me only one and I'll just play the game saving up for it. 
---
Same. I always do 'come over' emote and melee the bag. Clumsy, I say
---
Are you on PC? If so, then Yes
---
In the grand scheme of things, im all for this progress. This will lead to bigger and better things. Ive been wanting a fridge since fo3 where you could make your nuka colas and bottled water cold. Also preserve large amounts of food! I also hope the make it do we can breakdown unwanted ammo to craft other ammo. So many things in their previous games could be implemented and make one awesome update! 
---
I understand your concern but end does not justify the means, why not just add atom shop clothes that actually look awesome? 
---
Check out r/Market76 there's usually a few players there selling serums for a few hundred caps each.  
---
Oh ya it's a waste of money. I never but ingame currency I only pay for major dlc content. It dosen't affect me at all either way. I'm just done seeing it lol its exhausting to find a normal post now 
---
We are not talking about how you can repair in the field. I'm stressing the fact that if the item requires an extremely rare material to repair it, you are making it a P2W if you allow it to be repaired for free.
---
&gt;My biggest complaint to do with actual game play is how quickly I need to repair my weapons and armor.
---
It's too bad there isn't some sort of repair kit that you could find, or maybe purchase if a busy job and a cranky baby don't give you much time to grind out. You know, like a watered-down version that would let you keep farming nuke zones with your friends but won't give you an advantage over the people who invested their time and perk points, so it's fair to everyone. It's so lame that Bethesda won't do that for us.
---
Sometimes we are joining on the fly thru lfg feature , or may not have durability perk equip and not realize it
---
I'm suggesting collective action, this isn't a "I'm personally leabing!!"
---
The only real good use for them is repairing Decontamination Arches.
---
But its sometimes not free, you have to spend Atom Points to get it and or take on tough enemies like the S. Queen.
---
Also a simple solution to this, allow the tinkers or chem bench to break down ammo into materials, why does it need another work bench to achieve this?
---
Because the simple solution doesn't require atoms 
---
They know their fanbase well.
---
They will milk it and will do it again next time.
---
Why do you have Serendipity then?
---
We have no idea how prevelant the advanced ones will be, they gave one example of where it would drop, and we have no idea how you will get the basic ones, they just stated that you could buy them in the shop, never that it was a plan you could craft
---
Bingo! Even tho the simple solution would probably save a few glitches lol. 
---
It’s a one time purchase that only goes to those who are willing to buy it, most likely people will just buy it with in game currency so the profit margin would be minimal.
---
But still utility items arent an advantage in pvp. You can't use a repair kit to kill someone. Meaning that its not p2w since you don't get an advantage.
---
 Commenting to increase the odds that this post will draw attention and get some real feedback on the fashnacht event 
---
Just gotta bomb the twitter accounts with that sentance.
---
So everyone is mad over speculation because Bethesda wants to add a single Pay2bWeaker item to the Atom shop? If we speculate in the opposite direction it would be great to have tons of people buying P2bW items so they could lower the prices on cosmetic items.
---
Can anyone give me a disco ball plan i will pay you 
---
What are you talking about? The repair kit comes from Atom Shop that can repair any item of your choosing FOR FREE (no material/junk cost). You're not spending ANY junk for that repair.
---
I look at them as a quick repair, jury rigging/improvised repairs if you like. I'm okay with it not being a repair over 100%, but not with it being sold for real money, even at 200%.
---
Yup. I’ve been hopping the threads looking for that “Bethesda Replied” tag. We went from having a nice friendly relationship with them to a deafening silence. 
---
Did you read the itv? They CLEARLY mention fridges.
---
Like its quite hard to miss if you actually read it
---
Welcome to Reddit.
---
I am not.
---
Thank you though.
---
Good luck being sensible, logical and wanting a discussion.   The hate train is strong today.
---
Yeah point taken we should never allow pay to win items into the atomic shop. A new gun would obviously fall under that category, as far as the keycard to a new area of the map.. Bethesda already said that there won’t be paywall for future DLC so I think that’s fear mongering tbh.
---
We should absolutely be up in arms about P2W items if they’re ever even hinted at, but these QOL items are not the evil they’re portrayed as. At a certain point we have to accept the fact that developing future content and running the servers isn’t free. Does Bethesda need to do a better job at releasing items that people want to stimulate purchases? Absolutely. Should QOL items be a part of that strategy? Sure I’m fine with it so long as I can earn the atoms in game at a reasonable rate to purchase said items.
---
What is yout gamer tag?
---
Not sure where else to put those perks, and I think its too valuable a perk to leave off any build. 
---
Its like my last line of defense. Takes a while to chip through my high DR and resistances, but it happens. Its been the difference between me winning and losing a fight enough times to want to keep it. 
---
People apparently love Borderlands enough to not give a crap.  Comments I've seen in other places are fairly mixed.
---
Yeah you're not spending junk ti repair your item but you are still using some type of currency to get the RK. Again meaning that they're not free.
---
What your gamer tag
---
The fact that they are willing to cut off there heads for this is why I jumped to worst case scenario, they no the public won’t be happy but if they’re desperate enough to go for it then it makes me scared for the game.
---
Thanks man, it's already rough.
---
Why dont people like your comments lol? Asking for a friend...
---
Didiznutz
---
You going to launch now?
---
Fuck if it gave 50% repair and still be accessible for $ then I'd be against it.
---
It's not the repair kit itself but the player base is afraid of Bethesda adding more of these in the atomshop. So often it started with little advantages by paying little amounts of money, to massiv/gamebreaking advantages by paying hundreds of dollars. Better stop them now, look at the elder scrolls blades, if we don't say anything now it might be too late in a few months... 
---
*eyeroll*
---
Anyone who got it probably got it from the dev room
---
Well, Bethesda promised cosmetic items only and broke that, so why do we have to believe the "all DLC free" statement anymore? Yes, maybe they'll not do it, but the possibility that they'll go back on the solid promise is now *very* real.
---
They never did !!!
---
They decided that it is in fact, not an end game item. 
---
The only way for the subreddit to return to normal is for bethesda to announce thst repair kits can be found in game for free instead of purchaseable with atoms.
---
Im on the poor spectrum and dont have a fat wallet. I solely rely on the challanges in game to earn atoms. Them challenges are eventually going to run out.
---
If you go to a nuke zone with 1 weapon the problem exists between keyboard and chair.
---
What bothers me most ist Betheda's claim that „People Adressed it and asked for it“. Clearly no one wanted them in the atomic shop. 
---
Except while you don't buy them, Karen will. Karen is the VP of finance at a small company in central california and her husband is a stock broker. They have kids, 17, 15, and the twins at 13. They only wanted 3, but surprise! Twins. Karen doesn't care about that anymore though, she's just trying to plan the wine trip "with the girls" but her kids are just running around doing Fortnite dances. So she buys them this fallout they've been talking about just to get some variety. So now they're all playing it, but they tell her that all their stupid friends are getting these whatevers from the shop. Well, tell your friends that you're getting them too, but no more than $50 a week for each of you, capiche? Use mommy's account, mommy needs another Chardonney. 
---
Limited time, you missed it!
---
Buh.
---
Bye.
---
Oo burn
---
limited event 
---
It is. I used it for a long time to help provide extra to large scale fight aka the queen fights. As long as you have a way continuous ways to apply the effect on targets everyone can benefit. Before I hard switched to the lever I used to run tenderizer, suppressor, and tormentor. Coupled with a shot from the endangerol syringer (which stacks on each player) make for a really helpful time fighting the queen. 
---
This is the most specific complaint I think I have ever read. 
---
Very interesting story there.  They effectively developed a weather control mechanism and could have used it to win the war with China, but it was suddenly shutdown shortly before the nukes were launched.  
---
This isnt a competitive game though. People are losing their minds over small shit. I would understand if this was a damage buff or something but this is pure utility. Its gonna save time and that's it. Less fast traveling and load times. This is a QOL item and it's lesser version is purchasable. Just farm the queen and you'll be better off than the people buying it. 
---
What bothers me most is Bethesda's claim: „People asked us so many times about it... we recieved so many wished for it“ while clearly *no one* wanted them in the atomic shop. 
---
The ONLY example they gave is it them being dropped from the one of the most annoying fights in the game.  If Beth came out and said that every event has like a 25% chance of giving one or something then your point may be better received.
---
Well yeah that's my point
---
You missed it and I’ve only got 2 masks
---
I run around with 5 ranks of gunsmith and use rank 3 Weapon Artisan to repair to 200%.  I have a handmade rifle and a lever action.  The lever gun seems to degrade faster per bullet, but I put less rounds through it.  I'll usually "top off" when I hit 70-80% condition, which is probably about every 6 hours of play if I had to estimate.  
---
I broke my handmade once during a really bad SBQ fight, and started the event with the rifle at slightly less than 100% condition.  I just hopped off the roof of V9, ran to the little shack nearby with the elevator down to Glassed Cavern, fixed it and went back to burning up 1000+ rounds.  Even if there was no bench nearby, I could have just used my lever gun or picked up an assault rifle off a corpse on the ground.
---
If you’ve already bought the game, you’ve already given them your money. What good is it going to do to stop playing?
---
Easier gameplay IS an advantage.
---
The only REAL resource in this game is time. Everything else is infinitely available if/when you spend enough time on it. 
---
And it is fair: we all have the exact same ammount of time, its just how/where we choose to spend it.
---
UNLESS: they put something in the atom store (buyable with cash), that saves you time. If it saves time, it effectively makes time. Time for you to do something else faster/more than someone who doesnt spend $. That is an advantage, and is therefore P2W
---
Yup...lol
---
No, I want you to come with me
---
How so?
---
By that argument, you shouldn't be able to buy camo skins for armor because it could give you a benefit in PVP because it's harder to see you. 
---
I get that for some people this just seems to be some ethical brick wall that logic can't penetrate but it's a dead argument. Bethesda has already made their stance on things like this pretty much clear since horse armor and if you look at Blades, you can obviously see they know they could be making a lot more money from the stores. 
---
People may not like that this is the direction gaming is going, but that doesn't make it not happen. 
---
That's what I thought,  lame.
---
Fucking Karen man...
---
Just west of the fissure site by lake Eloise. There are some steep cliffs and a large stone archway by the lead deposit.
---
Tap the upvote button a million times! 
---
Doesn’t do anything, but it keeps you occupied!
---
They haven't been released yet. The Sheepsquatch quest comes Tuesday and the Burrows dungeon a week after that. The content update is being spread out over time
---
It’s the fan base's job to criticize. Where would this game end otherwise? The breaking point about this is, that Beth claimed the atomic shop would only include *cosmetics*. 
---
Yes - why? So what? How does it effect you’re play? Is you’re game play in any way affected by repair kits? 
---
No just no...... People are pissed and they should be this shouldn't be a pay to win game. What's the point of playing if i go on survival mode and the gods of players we have...its just wouldn't be fair at all.
---
1. The other player does not need to stop farming to repair gear so they have more farm time
---
2. The other player does not have to farm ballistic weave or screws (or whatever hard to find item you need) so they can keep farming other things
---
3. The other player does not need to farm the mats to repair anything in their CAMP (such as for the Arch)
---
Is that something that happens to you? I've never had that happen
---
Evidently they didn't, as you'll see on my post. People are quoting the article about how they'll be accessible from SBQ as well as if I can't fucking read.
---
What recipes are impossible to do? I've yet to see one with rare degrading ingredients.
---
I have. Plenty. 
---
It's almost like it takes time to coordinate a response and make decisions...who would've thought.
---
Oh okay then I don't have to worry the masks looked bad so it doesn't matter for me 
---
Todd Howard said in an interview that he had received a letter with a box of bobby pins during the bobby pin weight thing that said “weigh these” lol, it obviously get the attention of them so you know what to do folks..... get those salt and pepper sachets off in the post to Todd lol 😂
---
P2w in the atom shop I think, but really the repair kits are just time savers and better ones will be received as a drop from events. This means they'll also be tradeable and obtained on the market76 sub
---
I look at this from such perspective:
---
When I admit I play Fallout76 to my friends they laugh. When I ask them why they laugh, they mention lots of stuff that is mostly fake news, mixed with pieces of actually valid criticism (i.e. I wanted dark game and their atom shop keeps adding princess beds and pink armor sets).
---
I'm on a crusade to popularise this game. I'm also a person that continously pay for cosmetics to support the titles I love. I have like every possible cosmetic purchase in Titanfall2 because oh boi I loved it. Bethesda released a survival mode I love and I reacted by paying them. The moment first noncosmetic item enters AS, my crusade is finished and I will not be able to win arguments with my friends who say the game is bad but haven't really tested it, because they will say the in-game store makes the grind less tedious and they will be right.
---
Hotplates!
---
I was wondering aboutvthat too. Although, as soon as the uproar started yesterday, I kinda figured that corporate may have forbidden the community managers to involve themselves in any discussion regarding the Atom store now.
---
You've just written down my thoughts.
---
Those clickbait Youtubers are way too much lately.... 
---
No running around getting the code right now
---
Alarmclock
---
Correct.
---
I suggested this very thing. Make the plan a free atomic shop item and have the basic kit on the shop for 500 atoms. And available in game. Those that can’t craft it can and those who can’t can choose to but it. We get the best of both worlds and the world keep spinning. The advanced kits still drop their normal way. It’s not a hard concept and it works. People are still mad that we would open the door on future where we don’t and shouldn’t have to go. 
---
Oh that's fine I wasn't interested either way just wanted to know what exactly it was 
---
I want the Hellfire Power armor
---
If they're extremely cheap (I'm not saying its right) then it shouldnt be that bad of an implementation if they move it to just normal gameplay loot tables 
---
Giddybuttercups
---
They see the lower player engagement if people take collective action.
---
People like to play with their friends, and the more people that switch games, the more friends end up switching too, because their friend is telling them about another game that's better
---
So I've heard.. a thousand times now 😒
---
If they offered ranger armor in the atom store, how would that be any different?  Armor, after all, is non-cosmetic as well.
---
Would you just chill? It's not critical at all. It's just one non-cosmetic item in the shop, it's not going to kill you.
---
I didn't ask what is, I asked what if. 
---
Search for Fallout 76 roadmap on google. It has all the dates. Some of the dates have slightly changed since then but you'll still nore or less get an idea of what comes when.
---
That would make sense, and that is also what I am worried about. If this is the case, then that removes a lot of community leverage for issues such as this. I'm not ready to bash or trash the game or anything, but that really does give me a bad feeling about things. 
---
They don’t care , funny how they answer about bugs and other stuff they are interest in but not about complains or accuse when they fuck up everything , they are  going to make p2w fallout 76 after making blades an horrible micro transaction monster , can you fuc***ng believe that I’ve like 4 hours of actual gameplay in that game and the rest only waiting for chests , upgrading , building etc ? Like wtf man this company is going down a path I can’t follow 
---
Bethesda themselves announced the game is a financial success so why add utility items to the game. Make the game more attractive for new players and you make more income, that's the marketing strategy they should aim for, not the easy solution milking costumers with micro transactions. Look at their recent mobile game it's a complete disaster, almost unplayable without paying. You want the same thing happening to a full price AAA title? You people are sheeps if you defend any of these actions, you are part of the problem we have nowadays with online games... 
---
r/fo76filthycasuals is where you wanna be if that’s what you’re looking for my dude! 
---
Not to take away from your near accomplishments, but I'm counting one degree there, a second one nearly there, and a third being "possibly in a couple of years".  
---
Calling one degree (your bachelor) and a second one almost there (masters) as "more than a lot of people on this sub combined". Is extreme hyperbole lad. Even I for one have literally 2x the degrees you listed there, even if you get your PhD.
---
Because I need to make sure that we get our point across, if we flood the subreddit with these posts, they'll notice
---
Beth would need to tally feedback, come up with options, select options, get permission to make changes if so decided, craft a response, get permission from Higher to post response, the post response.
---
They're big now, so there's more bureaucracy to go through.  
---
Oh how I long for the days of Dave Gaider asking about pointy hats..of course, that company got big then bought out...sigh
---
Then you still not seem to understand the point about this. 
---
If you buy one you'll become the best pvper of all time. Hackers will be running away from you like legendary super mutants. All the poor people will be crying in their tattered rags wishing they were as cool as you, but it also reduces the number of fucks you have to give, so you can just focus on blasting fools with 360 marsupial no-scopes. Yeet!
---
See, I can get behind that, and it’s kind of why I said making atoms more accessible. I feel that if you have moderate access to loot them in-game, and/or the ability to more reliably buy them on the shop due to a bump in atom acquisition, it would offset some of the “exclusivity” that comes with p2w, chiefly that it won’t ONLY be available for real money, and that those who opt to spend it don’t receive an all or none advantage. 
---
Let’s get on this people. Start sending real objects and get them weighed in. Like a nuclear key card that weighs one pound? The hell is it made of dark matter?
---
Yeah I understand that their stance has changed and some might find that distasteful. Personally I am encouraged by their desire to implement ideas recommended by the community, and also do it in such a way that it funds itself. 
---
The reason I see a difference between their changing stance in the atomic shop being cosmetic only and a paywall for future DLC is simple, money and reputation. The backlash for going back on their word when it comes to people’s actual gameplay, not simple QOL things, but their ability play with their friends would be enormous. Many players would quit and maybe leave the franchise for good. I know I’d definitely need a whole lot of convincing to come back. This would wreck their atomic shop purchases and create a major cash flow and PR problem imo. 
---
I understand you might not see the nuisance between these two issue but I believe it exists.
---
Even the price of the console was very close, at least we're I live, to the original Ps.
---
And the titles themselves are competing the ones for ps4, in pricing still. 
---
Nah just looking for codes right now, but I'd love to have a team for wat ever come my way
---
Why X-01? 
---
If I were to stop playing itd be because I'm pretty bored with the game already, so it isn't a big deal to say "if you're on the fence anyway, do some good by staying away or your engagement adds +1 to their stats telling them they did good"
---
What, because of repair kits? That only repair to 100%? Not gaining the bonuses from Weapon Artisan? 
---
Because you can earn Atoms for free?
---
Because it was a Community Requested feature?
---
What? Why? Because you said so?
---
like the post before mine stated, "..this too shall pass." :)

I'm thinking of an atom price range between 5 and 10 atoms; make them SUPER cheap. On the matter of their usability, I dont see much of an advantage outside of for early players and with black powder weapons (more so the dragon). Otherwise I can only think of one use which is the repairing of the decontamination shower. 
---
Fallout has only gotten worse since Fallout 3.
---
I do wish people would wait for more info before filling the board with copy topics. As far as we know the repair kits could be a 10 atom priced one time purchase recipe. Just saying it could go either way, yet this board always goes with doom and gloom. 
---
Which is odd considering its been doom and gloom here since release yet were all still playing...
---
No matter how many people want to see something like this ingame, just as many people will complain that they are not releasing anything original.
---
I understand your fear. However in the very same article announcing those repair kit,Beth announced they are thinking about fridges, ammo converters and auto-junkstoring. This really looks like a slope.
---
Is there a way to do a search to filter out the phrase "repair kits"?
---
They are preparing a response 
---
Being paranoid of thing that hadnt happened = spreading lies if you act like its a current truth. 
---
No but I’m also not the type of person who stops playing a game I enjoy because said game developers are adding a item to the “store”. 
---
Same as always.  Their responses and general communication with this community are always few and far in between.  
---
I think we are done here. I can get more sense out of a dead super mutant. if you can't tell the difference between PAY and FREE... 
---
It’s opinions not facts.  If you are engaging in the behavior described you are a griefer and a jerk....pay attention to this part...in my opinion.  Your opinion is no more fact than mine.  
---
Let’s wait for their response. It’s crazy how quickly we rush to judgement.
---
No, we understand it, we just find the whole bitching bit stupid. There are much worse things in the world to complain about and you people chose THIS?! 
---
I literally get my master's in less than a month. It's all but a formality now. Of course, I agree my PhD will take a while. And like I said, it was to call you out on assuming that I am some basement dwelling unemployed parasite. Surely you do realise that a degree in a field of modern science does not fall out of the sky? So calling me things like "get a job, get a degree, get a life" was uncalled for.
---
And a lot of the trolls on this site are actual basement dwelling parasites or high schoolers, so my degree count still holds.
---
Yep, yep I remember
---
We were talking about this last night. Someone did get it but traded it for another mask. So it's out there.
---
RC
---
&gt; So long as you have a Repair Kit in your inventory, you can use it to fix up a piece of gear anytime, anywhere, and without spending any of your own crafting materials
---
hows that?
---
Lets just skip the whole rare material stuff and imagine an actual encounter. Imagine two teams fighting each other in survival mode. What happens in a tough fight is that you can't always loot your opponents freerly. Imagine a battle was happening in given zone for last twenty minutes and now its full of loot bags. You see, at some point the fighters weapons will broke. They will have to either give up this area and the loot, or to strategically reorganise mid-fight. If the other team is full of repair kits, they might be able to hold the position longer, and loot the whole area when their opponents are fixing their stuff. Its p2w.
---
reddit enhancement suite for chrome (firefox too?) and boost for android (iphone?) should be able to do this.
---
Why use my credit card to get to 100% when I can do what I'm already doing and get to 200% complete with damage bonus with degradation mitigation?
---
I hope they are.
---
I’m sure the the devs are nice people. But when the boss hands you a memo and says “do this and do that” you really don’t get a say in the matter. It’s a shut up and do what your told. We can arm up and demand to be heard. Viva la revolution! But and the end of the day the train is going full steam ahead. If we are lucky they will change somethings about the idea but not 100% drop it. 
---
Not to mention that they have servers. Not like regular mmo servers where they house thousands of playser, 24 damn players. That's a lot of servers to run. They need that money. 
---
Bethesda adding non cosmetic items to the Atomic Shop gives In Real Life rich/wealthy players a advantage over the poor players.
---
This is a big deal and a promise broken to the playerbase of Atomic Shop items will be cosmetic only.
---
Wow, this whole thing is really getting overly-dramatic. IT'S JUST A VIDEO GAME ITEM, CHILL THE FUCK OUT.
---
No one is making you explain anything to me. Walk away by all means.
---
"Free To Play", adjective, Relating to or denoting an arrangement in which basic access to a game is granted **without charge** while more **advanced features must be paid for**.
---
* Is a repair kit from the Atom Shop an advanced feature? Yes
---
* Do you have to pay for it to access it? Yes
---
* Is access to the game without charge? No
---
Yes, you **can** earn the currency in-game via things you would otherwise already do. The rate at which you can earn Atoms depends heavily on how you play the game. It also doesn't matter if you choose to only use in-game generated currency to buy the items, because other players will be giving them an advantage over those who do not. This scenario is the core issue with F2P mechanics the world over.
---
1. It cost me £60, as it did for many others and $30 is still not free so don't leverage in-game non-cosmetics
---
2. Heavily depends on a) how much they cost, b) how you play the game
---
3. Definition is above for your viewing pleasure
---
4. Yes it does. Games used to have items you unlocked by doing game related things.  Now it is simply; enter the 16-digits on the front of your card, expiry date, and the 3-digits on the back. I don't **want** Atoms for doing in-game challenges, quests or milestones, I want that content unlocking because I have done the thing required to do so.
---
Last game I remember playing and being rewarded for playing with cosmetic items that you couldn't buy was Halo 3. Get 13 skulls and you got the sweet Hayabusa armour, wanted the matching katana then you needed all achievements and 1000 gamerpoints. You saw people with those things and knew they had invested the time and energy to get those items. It didn't make their character quicker, stronger, or better, it didn't get them an advantage of any kind, it was just cool for the sake of being cool. That was 12 years ago. Now it is £3 here, £10 there, and £15 for the season pass, or preorder to get the really cool bonus thing. This is wrong.
---
**Because of you.**
---
Allows you to control the map longer without needing to fall back to repair stuff. Tactical advantage. P2W, not a terrible one, but P2W still.
---
You only get the buff if you hitb200%, and it lasts until it hits 100% integrity. 
---
I'd still bet they cost to craft, bit not even really my point
---
I agree, this is getting stupid.
---
Thats not p2w mate. Thats just being well organized, im sure you don't only care one weapon. You're telling me in that VERY rare case, that the losing side would only have 1 weapon? Or all of them break? Yeah alright.
---
Because it might not stop there? They also make enough income with cosmetics, look at how many people ingame have these atomshop skins. Every little step towards pay2win is a success for them and a loss to the player base. I rather pay for content than for ingame advantages. Look at their recent elder scrolls blade title, they have no problems releasing a game that is basically unplayable without paying. What if they don't stop with repair kits and fridges? What if they add exclusive weapon mods in atomic shop? I rather have them break their promises with free DLC's than their promise to not add micro transactions... 
---
Except you can very well gain an advantage in PvP because you don't need to hit repair benches when your guns/armor break. It gives you the freedom to repair on the fly, which can make a huge difference in sustained firefights. 
---
Have a bunch of repair kits and you never need to fast travel to your camp, workshops or train stations. A lot harder to spawn kill someone who can be self sustaining because they dropped a crap load of money on a utility item 
---
Let them - let them fund this and future projects. You dont have to spend! Its the fucking beauty of the matter!  If they start selling real stat bugs, then we raise hell. Its that simple
---
*standard procedure for subreddit-flooding issues*
---
Well, in this case it WAS Bethesda who made this horrible P2W scheme decision, so not sure how consumers making their voices heard is considered flooding, but i understand the mods a re in a pretty tough spot now.
---
I think the rare masks were only given out if you 100% the mission, meaning the Protectrons were not allowed even 1 damage
---
You can find "improved" repair kits as loot drops from certain enemies, it was stated in the original post by bethesda, which so many people haven't even read before complaining. Which means everyone who wants a repair kit, will want and have those ones. Which negates any so called advantage of buying the normal ones for atoms. 
---
So we are. You're the one that clearly can't see that you are paying for the RK, meaning you aren't getting them for free.
---
Spamming posts as a new form of protest. I like it :D
---
I didn't save the post, but some user made a pretty exhaustive guide here about it.
---
An instance I remember included royal jelly, which is an ingredient that's almost impossible to find, not to mention there are TWO items named "royal jelly", but only one can be used in the recipe.
---
I'll do a quick search to see if I can find it, but I hope my point is clear without it.
---
The "new player" vs "grinding through this all yet again" aspect is also something to be considered.
---
I just recently started leveling a 3rd character, and I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't consider buying something to just unlock all map markers on a character or an XP boost or even WoW type "skip to level X"
---
Can I vote for you to replace the current team in charge of monetization?
---
I have no idea lol 
---
It’s impossible for them to ignore us if we continue. It is effective, although I do agree it probably is a bit annoying from a fan perspective. 
---
The problem is, those people are ignoring the part where we can get the better version of these kits in game. You can go farm kits instead of buy them. If, down the road, they make ammo converters, and I can either buy it with atoms or farm it in game, well hot diggity dawg, time to go farming, because I do not pay for cash shop items. But if some person wants to pay ten friggen dollars to save their foods from spoiling without having to farm it, why should I care? It has no effect on my gameplay. It offers no advantage in PvP, and PvE advantage is a hilarious concept in a game like this.
---
Now, if down the road Ammo Converters can be bought with atoms, I can see that being an actual point of contention, because that has an actual impact on what you bring to a fight. But as I mentioned, they have in no way indicated that to be the case. 
---
If they had made the kits purchase only, or indicated that those other possible future items are purchase only, or gave something that granted real advantage instead of QoL, I'd be upset. But this is just another round of "Reddit Gets Pissed at Hypotheticals."
---
It's shady but they just want money at the end of the day.
---
Exactly 👍
---
If it was adventure only there wouldn’t be as much backlash. If my aunt had a dick she’d be my uncle. Ifs don’t matter. 
---
Don’t give Beth any ideas man
---
I'm looking at this from viewpoint of person responsible for logistics of PvP. Repairing the stuff mid-fight is a complicated tasks that sometimes needs to happen. Its a tactical hinderance. Having an alternate way to solve this issue mid-fight, and access to this alternative via real money, is a tactical advantage.
---
imo these items and others in the atom shop would work if we weren't allowed to buy atoms with cash and could only earn them by playing.
---
Just to be clear I’m talking about Runescape3, the original and less popular version than OS Runescape.
---
Having played the game for better part of 10 years on and off I don’t think I’m wrong.
---
My biggest bone to pick with the outrage is that no one has yet shown me the "promise" that the AS would NEVER have non-cosmetic items. The closest is where someone asked if you would be able to buy legendary items. That leaves a VERY wide open door of other non-cosmetic items. I just think that people WANT things to be a certain way and when their mistaken beliefs are challenged they get up in arms.
---
Just make a new character
---
I get that, but it won't stop us from calling them out. If you're fine with it Simply because "that's the way the game is going" good for you.
---
Also with the camo argument it's a grey area i guess. If there wasn't player icons it would absolutely be P2W, but there is icons so… Nah in that case it's just cosmetic.
---
Me to
---
I never once said they were free. I said that repairing an item with a repair kit is junk-free (costs you no junk whatsoever). So even though you are paying for a repair kit (Pay of Pay2Win), you are saving on junk that could've been extremely valuable (Win of Pay2Win).
---
I'm sporting a camo suit because I wanted to play corporate general. I tried to analyse if it gives me any advantage and I don't think so. At the distance where that could help all player characters are mostly grey anyway.
---
But the game isn't forcing you to buy atom points. You can earn them naturally through the game. 
---
I get what you’re saying, but low server numbers aren’t going to kill this game. It’ll just force them to shut some servers down, so they can save a bit of money. Which may actually help them as they won’t have to maintain as many, and can improve performance even more. 
---
If you want to stick it to BGS, keep playing the game and don’t spend anymore money on the game, whether that’s on atoms or on DLC. 
---
PS: I’ve seen a couple of downvoted on your posts in this conversation already. I want to assure you that is not me, as you are stating your case calmly, which in my book makes you an alright person, even if we disagree. 
---
Here you guys go censoring again like with literally every other controversy about this game.
---
&gt; 3) We have been and will continue to remove the blatant karma-grab "DAE REPAIR KITS BETHESBAD - UPTOKES @ LE LEFT XD" posts that don't want to stimulate actual discussion, but solely clog the subreddit/ride the "karma train". 
---
Not affiliated with Bethesda BTW. We're cool and hip and use GamingCircleJerk Memes btw
---
No thanks, I’ll keep playing.
---
I see atleast 1 in my camp everyday
---
I understand what you’re saying, but not everyone is going to agree with that. Some people have all the time in the world to play, don’t mind the time required to accomplish certain tasks, etc. it’s a very broad extrapolation of a game meant to be fairly specific in user-experience. Caps, ammo, and other things can be equally, if not, more valuable to a given player than time. It’s important, sure, but it doesn’t usurp the significance of everything else. P2W is effectively anything that you can acquire with real currency in exchange for an advantage regardless of duration or permanence. Even still, opinions will differ on how big a deal something is. For example,  being able to buy an instigating explosive the dragon is going to cause riots on fo76 media. That is a massive advantage. Repair kits ares till an advantage, but arguably less so. The point wasn’t to accommodate the repair kit plan. It’s bad. We were just musing as to what, if Bethesda ignores the community, would lessen the impact. Cheers.
---
Pretty sure they mean an outfit like all the other stuff in the store not actual armor with stats. 
---
Well I disagree I think it’s people like you who are the problem, they just care about what the game can do for them and not what they can do for the game, the reason fallout 76 has had any success is due to players who support each other and aiding the game. The fact you go to calling people “sheep” tells me you’re likely one of the toxic players people usually come on here to complain about.
---
I thought you said we're done lmao.
---
With a weapon repaired at 200% I don’t see this as being a real issue unless you’re spawn camping.. survival mode just doesn’t lend itself to the kind of map control you’re talking about imo. Also with the “improved repair kit” being available in game I find your argument to be irrelevant. Not trying to be rude I just don’t see how you can say it’s P2W when you can literally pay zero atoms and get the same, and actually better, result.
---
I got to level 72 within the first few weeks and haven’t played since. I heard they made leveling much harder.
---
how about "for god sakes,go and buy a set of headphones with a mic".
---
NOT dissing you. the audio definition can be top notch and will definately improve your game experience to the power of, and the emotes  SUCK. Might be ok for a 12 year old,but for adult (old fart like me) they SUCK. To further original post, a polite "no thank you", "hi" (just a quick hi,no arm waving "
---
On the subject of mics -  bethesda-   please MAKE THEM WORK !
---
Who gives a shit about the original promise. No one wants to play the game but die hard fans anyway. Refund meme, shit bag meme, bobbypin meme. Those arent even people playing the game that made that hate train run so long. People who played the game kept their head down and just kept logging in when you got shit heads running around picketing "do not play this game! Bobby weight is too high therefore the entire game is unplayable!"
---
You can either stop fighting a pointless battle - and wait for a huge problem like paid stat items, or you can fight over stupid shit and when a real problem happens, you've already cried wolf - no one will listen.
---
I am glad that you get the very real problem bang on. Most people don't seem to be able to grasp the problem here.
---
Yeah, but right now when I decide if I want to spend my atoms or purchase them (and I did purchase em), I'm only thinking about visual results of such purchase. If they changed that I'd have to take possible combat situations into my calculations. I dont want that.
---
Personally--and I got down-voted in my post about this yesterday, I don't see how this is any different than players purchasing weapons and armor--which have a much bigger impact on gameplay than a repair kit-- through the various markets.  The mechanics are exactly the same.  In both situations, there are two methods to get what you want.
---
Method 1(the hard way) : Grind your ass off and actually earn in-game currency to purchase the item you want
---
     * Earn caps to spend on the Fo76 marketplace
---
     * Earn atoms to spend in the Atomic Shop
---
Method 2 (the shortcut): spend real world money to purchase the item you want
---
       * Purchase armor and gear on Ebay
---
       * Purchase atoms in the Atomic Shop
---
Exact same mechanic at work here. Only difference is that when people elect to take the shortcut, the real world money goes to Bethesda.
---
Agreed. Everyone wants the R-91 assault rifle from Fo3.  Get it now from the Atomic shop! Each kill with grant 3x exp up to 15x. Only 3000 atoms.   That would kill the last of the game.  
---
Agreed.  A pinned poll would be more effective.  Give Bethesda real data.  A flood of posts can easily be interpreted as a relatively small but vocal minority dominating the conversation, as frankly happens a lot on Reddit.  I happen to not think that is the case here but a poll showing X % of users on this reddit responding hate this move and will boycott the atom store until reversed would be more effective....especially with corporate IT types.
---
The characters I usually play as aren’t dwellers despite Bethesda always forcing us into that storyline.
---
Salvador Torres was only 10 years old when the bombs fell in the Great War. Living in the West Virginia area, however, he and his single father survived the bombs unscathed. The two lived close to Grafton, with his dad being an uneducated factory worker for Grafton steel. 
---
The two holed up in their small, raggedy house for the next several weeks, but eventually their supplies began to dwindle and neighbors became less and less generous. Sal’s dad packed him and their few belongings up into their car and attempted to leave West Virginia with nothing but hopes and dreams. This didn’t last long, though, as Sal and his dad were on the road out, a recently created biker gang of bullies had formed and extorted supplies off those unlucky enough to be on the roads. 
---
The gang flagged their car down and pulled them over. Sal’s dad shushed the boy and told him not to make a peep. He would take care of this. He came out of his car with his hands up and was trying to talk to the gang, but he made the mistake of reaching down towards the back seat door to open it for them, and the leader of the raider gang shot him dead. A few moments later, the raider gang opened the passenger door and found Salvador shaken and unsure of what just happened. Their leader didn’t have the guts to kill a kid, and so they brought him back to their hideout and that’s where Sal stayed since, taking part in their looting and raiding as the years went on. 
---
Over the years, Salvador became accustomed to this lifestyle. He was used to taking what he wanted from those not in the position to give. His raider gang flourished, and their small compound became busier. 15 years after the bombs, Salvador had a son with a woman in their gang; she went by the name Softie, an ironic name given to her by the group.
---
Their son, Guillermo, or Gill for short, was sickly and frail, common to those born in the first generation after being exposed to high radiation. His autoimmune disorder kept him from spending much time outside, and when he became sick it was always something deadly. When Gill was 9 years old, he became violently ill with flu-like symptoms and became lethargic and ran a high fever for days. It was a peak of this fever that caused Gill to convulse and the crudely trained medic with Salvador and Softie told them that he was experiencing a stroke-and that it would be fatal. Salv could do nothing besides weep as he held his son and poured what cold water they had on his son in order to break his fever. (Ultimately, meningitis is what caused Gill to pass, but unfortunately one of the only ways to diagnose meningitis is with a spinal tap and I can only imagine how unsafe and unlikely that is to happen in a post apocalyptic wasteland.) 
---
After Gill’s passing, things started to matter less and less to Salvador. He became frequently agitated and lashed out at those that pried too much. He turned to things that would briefly take his mind off the loss of his son: chems, booze, sleeping all day, whatever it took. He eventually left his raider gang, leaving behind Softie as well as the people who raised him since he was a child. Salvador realized that the one good thing he put into the world was gone, and couldn’t justify making the world a darker place, and so he left their compound to do something better.
---
Oops wall of text haha 😅 my friends and I have a big, long fallout story so it picks up from there, but I really liked typing all of this out!! If you read it, thank you 😅!! 
---
It’s a slippery slip my friend. The repair kits are a way for them to test the waters and see how much we will let them get away with. That’s why most people are outraged. We need to make a point that we will not stand for this.
---
What do you play on? I have 5 of each mask
---
I see no mention of repairing CAMP items with these kits (it specifically says items in your inventory). And to be honest, if people step away from the whitesprings/watoga farm zone, normal gameplay should get them all the repair materials you need.
---
relax bro
---
Me too, I play once the kids are in bed, I can't be rambling about scorched and plague rats. People with speech impediments/ hearing difficulty have no real communication available
---
I'm going to buy 5, I'll be able to win so much, thtlat Todd will make me the honorary prednizent.
---
I’m glad I can never guess what you’ll do next haha 
---
I do too :)
---
Location, location, location ;)
---
No we can follow along. You just fail at perceiving a perspective that isn't your own.
---
I like this idea. And I’m even ok with the plans costing as much as one kit (at 500 atoms). Like you say, then we can enjoy the best of both worlds. 
---
As the op stated this will encourage balancing the game badly. The unstoppables bonus was only temporary so they aren’t going to change game balance to make them more necessary. The repair kits are something they will keep selling and expendable so you keep having to pay more and I can tell you right now how they could change he game for the worse to encourage you to buy them. They could either make armor and guns break so quick you can’t keep up with having the resources to fix them without most of your game time being farming for resources or make the resources really rare. And if this works they can push things further. Gta online didn’t start so grindy but you could still game elements that were there to push you to pay for shark cards and as it worked rockstar pushed it more and more until now it’s notorious for it.  
---
I got lucky, I jumped in a radpool and got speed demon, I bought marsupial and twisted muscles other than that. 
---
The hypothetical inclusion of utility items to the Atomic Shop has three main issues:
---
1. BGS clearly said the Atomic Shop will be cosmetic only so they just straight up lied to the consumer.
---
2. It is a lazy and distrustful cash grab. Instead of making a little effort in selling high quality skins, it is easier to add utility stuff that of course people will buy, and even though you get atoms for free, it is still just a way to make money, if they didn't want the money it would he part of the game. 
---
3. As others have stated, it is a symptom, not the disease. While repair kits don't sound terribly gamebreaking, imagine something like being able to stash your junk without needing to find a stash box. Now that is extremely game breaking since it makes you neglect the whole weight micromanaging. And it could get worse.
---
Btw, of course you're gonna get downvoted and I hope you get it the hard way. Although discussion is cool, most people just like or dislike based on the title, and yours is one that suggests lying to the consumer and getting away with it and promotes lazy, unfair marketing practices.
---
Maybe posters need to take the hint, too, and stop cluttering up the feed with posts all griping about the same damn thing. I'm sure this crazy idea will just get downvoted, though.
---
I entirely agree with you. Not one person so far that has a different opinion has yet showed me the video, article, etc that shows that. Yet I still used points from the patchnotes and i posted the link for them to refer to.
---
Xbox Live?

Around deatchclaw island and where nuka cola paint is for x-o1
---
&gt; It’s impossible for them to ignore us if we continue.
---
Idk, I've been pretty successful at it. 
---
Self-fulfilling prophecy much?
---
yeah, im sure everything will be just fine, we'll trust bethesda to do the right thing without us consumers making our voices heard  /s

&gt;another decent Excavator Armour paintjob

I want flashing lights on it and a police skin oh and a siren. I want to charge through the wasteland blaring weee wooo weee wooo
---
Understood.  Would be nice to reconsider though in the future, as you are effectively allowing a few super active users to dominate the conversation.

Don't be scared, it's just a game.

In life all things must come to an end. If you feel the end is near then you must take the time to prepare for it. Otherwise the journey had no point at all. 
---
Word of mouth and positive feedback tend to be what companies call free advertising....
---
You get atleast 10 free atoms a day
---
Haven't played in months, was thinking about getting back into it.
---
Probably won't now.  guess i'll play borderlands
---
I don’t have a mule or anything so I have to mod legendary armour to ultra light build to lessen the weight so I can cram more in my stash lol, never used so much fibreglass and cork lol
---
I don't mind that someone who doesn't have a lot of time to play the game, but can contribute money to help the game development is able to get some convenience items to make their short play time more enjoyable. As long as it's reasonable and only a convenience and not a major advantage.
---
What I do have a problem with in the case of repair kits as Atoms only, is that it is a band aid solution to horrible weapon durability in the game, and incentivizes them to keep it in this awful state.
---
Couple that with caps becoming less useful in the late game, there really should be some useful consumables  they can buy. This would give high level players things to spend caps on, and a reason to trade and contribute to a player economy.
---
Midfight is the key. I play the game on the highest possible level (I mean I only hunt the hunters and I am disinterested with the prey), and this game is ALL about tactical map control. People may be unaware of that but well coordinated group of 4 people in 1* gear will dominate disorganised team of godroll wielding people, easy. I killed people from distances where they barely rendered using a 1* weapon (it was actually 2* but it gave vats crit damage as the 2nd star and I dont use vats with that weapon).
---
People are often saying that game where you can be one-shot does not allow any tactics and skill but this game is all about tactics and skill.
---
I don't think you realized that was sarcasm...
---
Would you believe if I told you the drops in game are better than the paid drops? It seems to me like it's if you don't play you pay. To at least keep up with ppl grinding them in game to get that advantage as well but not boosted as the in game drops. Bc this game is still grindy.
---
Yeah. It seems so heavily gated: rare reward or atom-purchase. I mean it’s apparent thought went into monetizing this specific item.  It’s discouraging. 
---
As an alternative I would be more than happy if they built a simple quest around unlocking access to repair kits. 
---
Something linked to the Red Rocket Stations perhaps, where you come out of the quest (even as simple as finding them all or something daft like that...) and voila you can craft the kits at your tinker station. They would cost a flat amount of materials, e.g. 1.5x or 2x what it would cost to repair an average item based on your level. It can then repair one thing without a workbench while in the world. Ideal for that dreaded moment when you're in a big scrap and your gun snaps, but otherwise still cheaper in materials to use a workbench if you can.
---
This could be the same for the other mooted items; fridge, ammo-recycler etc. Some simple quest (for fridge = find "refrigerant gas" at location X, find a fridge at location Y, add refrigerant, power, voila)
---
Simple **and** rewarding. Leave the Atom store for novelty.
---
Like the lunchbox, unstoppables and all the other bullshits that led to literally nowhere?
---
Bethesda ALREADY changed. Started with horse armor, moved to steam mods (where they let mod authors mod's get stolen and then earned money from that), then it went to creation club ( a micro-transaction store that did well on PS4 and on some extent the Xbox One due to limited modding on those platforms), to 76 (an always online game without the option of singleplayer with an ingame cash shop that'll now feature pay to win items), and then to Elder Scrolls Blades probably some of the worst micro-transaction monetization  i've seen come to gaming. I'd like to see how they'll get away with blade's microtransactions when it comes to consoles and PC.
---
I wasn’t sure if it was but I don’t think my response would’ve been much different regardless 
---
That’s right.
---
That’s what we want, for them to stay with cosmetics, things they can’t rebalance the game for the worse to encourage us to buy. Repair kits they can easily start making guns and armor break easily to the point you either have to buy repair kits or spend most your time in a boring grind farming resources to fix your stuff. You are being incredibly short sighted to not see why these things being things you can pay them money to get is a bad thing. 
---
I have 40 points to spend. I’d like to know what to change and what build is good for my wishes :)
---
Again, still no mention that there would never be non cosmetic items. Just that there WOULD be cosmetic items.
---
Alright wat ur tag
---
They're just extremely rare, period. It was rare even back in launch and it's still rare now. So whatever you do, don't invest in that Radstorm perk card.
---
Breathes.... Wot in apalaichian
---
There was an apocalypse? Just looks like regular old methed out West Virginia on a beautiful summer day to me. 
---
That's where I get jelly fingers alot. The queen south of Watoga. 
---
We don’t even need them to add those in for these repair kits to affect the game badly. Bethesda wants to sell repair kits? Hey, let’s make guns and armor degrade so fast you have to spend most your time farming materials just to have enough to fix them. 
---
Because that's like +60 health in total and that's really nothing
---
It’s my current camp
---
There is no huge advantage. That's never been the claim. You're being willfully ignorant here. The problem is, this is clearly a stepping stone. We were promised ONLY COSMETIC microtransactions. That's what we were told, and that's what we expected when we purchased the game. I know there's the whole BETHESDA GOOD GAMERS BAD thing going on, but jesus christ some of you people are more anti-consumer than the mega-corporations shafting you.
---
It’s not about how useful or not useful they are. It’s about the precedent they will set. It’s blocking game mechanics and utility behind money. It’s breaking the promise of cosmetic items only. 
---
yeah! those goddamned CONSUMERS thinking they have a right to have their voices heard!  Good thing KasvOtVag knows better, dont want to upset the Bethesda shareholders and executives from making sweet P2W money     /s
---
Tbf, they didn't intend to seperate the co-op from the PvP experience, that was the communities request to add those servers, Beth just wanted a co-op game with optional PvP when someone pissed you off.
---
intereting , like a time skip .

https://promise.silveress.ie/en/dashboard
---
Here's the one I was looking for before the edited everything to be more vague.
---
Yeah, because this is how pay to win aspects get added to a game, if you want to play a game like that, go for it, but most people dont
---
Relax at your camp when they introduce raids taht must be completed in one go and there are no workbenches in the entire raid dungeon and they secretly increase the rate at which weapons and armor break.
---
You have to understand that is a mobile game. Mobile games must be monetized. Also, you are directly competing with anyone in Fallout Shelter. Not defending the Repair Kits, but saying that about Lunchboxes seems a little extreme. 
---
Oh, I wasn't asking, just stressing that location is everything :)
---
Said that mine is in the South-East of the map, in no-man's land.
---
I think people kinda let that go as it was ZoS not technically BGS (although there's a lot more similarities there than Beth fanboys care to admit)
---
I definitely knew this game would be different. I mean,  back at launch claiming that they'd probably add advantageous items to the cash shop 6-12months  you'd get downvoted to hell.   
---
\*BETHESDA WOULD NEVER DO THAT! BETHESDAS GOOD\* etc
---
Xbox One 
---
It was pretty different. It was a cosmetic item. It was only a temporary buff and then the item did nothing. 
---
Do you want to buy some masks also have a beret
---
I don't understand why they got rid of human nps in the first place. I get it that we're the first humans but that was just a stupid decision.
---
Right I understand that and those types of fights are fun tho exceedingly rare ime, the point being tho... how is it P2W when you can find a better item in game that gives an improved outcome than one purchasable in the store with currency earned in game?
---
I’m not really here to debate the merits of repair kits so much as why they should be considered P2W. The reasons I stated seem to imply that it’s not P2W because it’s entirely possible to find these in game.
---
if they want to sell items other than cosmetics, im cool with that,
---
as long as atoms cant be bought with real cash and only earned in game.
---
What the fuck are you on about? Lay off the Nukashine
---
wait, we are talking about in a video game??... um yeah... totally in a  video game...
---
Then why would you wanna know how to access it?
---
There is an investigator terminal in a cabin that mention it and it is locked until the "time is right:
---
*"Try using your fucking brain and look to the big picture"*
---
holy fuck the irony here. 
---
I bet youre the first to defend them when they introduce legendary weapons in the atom shop next. 
---
I couldn't really get into those games. They seem so casualized compared to what i'd expect from Dice. Then again, so was BF1. I was hoping battlefront would be like Battlefield 3 with a starwars skin tbh. Atleast then it'd be competitive.
---
"It doesn’t offer anything with a competitive advantage"
---
Again, there is nothing in that statement that is future facing, that is a present tense.
---
"It won't offer anything with a competitive advantage" is a completely different statement.
---
This^
---
 I  used to chuck real world money at boosts in swtor when I used to play alts. It wasn't a massive deal.
---
 Its only play to win if you're engaging in pvp. Pve is not a comptition. Anyhoo once you're repairing gear with the right perks it doesn't too much. 
---
As correctly stated above atoms are pretty easy to come by in the wasteland. 
---
This is the one I use

Headline: "how do i access it" 
---
When people say: "i wasn't interested it was bad."
---
Why even bother making this post?
---
There are plenty of ways to make money in the game. More cosmetics, new camp items, weapon skins/armour skins, hair, tattoos, music holotapes, camp paints, PA paints, etc... There’s a huge market for this stuff and we have asked for this stuff but clearly aren’t getting it.  We haven’t really seen any of those since launch. 
---
Regardless of what they said pre launch. It doesn’t matter if you meant it or not. People will hold you to that as law. 
---
If your American look at the Arizona drinks. They said at their start the cans would always be a low cost drink. And to this day they are still .99 cents. Sure they said they could raise the cost to help make more money. But the action alone of hurt their fans from all the way back when they started. 
---
Ok
---
And they would be great as craft able items or perk cards. 
---
At low level I can't recall any weapon or armour breaking. At low level you're constantly changing weapons as you level up. Only once you're higher level do you have weapons and armour that you may want to keep and use for an extended period
---
The wording isn’t very specific. Just re read the inside the vault post now. But I think they will be available to make without spending atoms as well. That will be a choice. 
---
It's a total mess.
---
The main source of progression in this game is through upgrading your player self, and what they are capable of. You go from having to scrounge new weapons and armor to upgrading them then becoming self sufficient. "Winning" in this game is coming away with more junk than other players. Far as I'm concerned, repair kits make it easier to be self sufficient, cutting down on the main grind of the game, and therefore=pay to win
---
I got them from packs🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
---
500 atoms is like 5$ US. If even X people buy even a single usable kit it makes money. 
---
they saved a lot of money on voices and development 
---
Everyone is bitching about the Basic not the Improved, which is the one you get from various types of in-game content.  They use the SBQ as an example.  What I would be wondering is what will the drop rate be from the various in-game content, especially considering the drop rate for legendarys.   
---
You’re not seeing how his can be abused. Slowly the game gets rebalanced so that guns and armor break so quick you have to spend your time farming for stuff rather than playing the game or pay for these kits to skip the grind. Sure, the game is balanced mostly now. This gives bethesda monetary incentive (and they made this game to make money so why wouldn’t they do stuff that will make them more) to rebalance the game so that it’s at least slightly frustrating/grindy to have to keep finding resources to fix your gear. 
---
The people buying weapons on eBay etc. don't care about P2W, obviously, except in as much as they don't want competition (if they care at all).  The people that care about P2W want everyone on an equal footing, just out of fairness.
---
The problem we have here is that it's virtually impossible to prevent external P2W without locking down almost all drops.  If you can gift an item, it's pretty hard to prevent selling that same item off-world.  Bethesda *could* put it in the ToS that something like that isn't allowed (if it's not in there already), and go on a takedown spree for all eBay listings and *every other site that has open forums* like Reddit, but they're understaffed as it is, and that's a whole lotta work.
---
It would be fairly trivial to prevent selling items by making them all no-drop (only sell to vendors or delete).  But that would put player vending on a pretty limited leash, and would prevent anyone gifting items to friends, new players, etc.  I'm not sure much of the community would see that as a good thing.
---
Bethesda is between a rock and a hard place on this one.  There isn't any easy path to preventing all P2W without dramatically changing the landscape.
---
This seems like a big moment for you. That seems sad.
---
The basic ones are, and they gave one example of how the other one would drop.
---
"Pay to Win", adjective, relating to or denoting an arrangement in which basic access to a game is granted without charge while more advanced features must be paid for.
---
&gt;I don’t see the problem with letting people who don’t have as much time bypass some of the mindless grind
---
It's not the main issue with all this but it's part of it. If one has to go through it, everyone has to, regardless of the amount of time available.
---
You want to play a game then play all of it, good and bad aspects together. There can be mindless grinds but in those cases the remedy would be to nerf said grinds, not to offer ways to bypass parts of it for real money. 
---
Not only its a spit on the face for people who can afford to go through those grinds but it's also preying on people who can't.
---
Because Don't be fooled. They are not adding those repair kits for the sake of convenience and helping people with little time to play. Its some corporate executives trying to find more ways to milk the impatients and people with bad money management dry. And that is the main red flag about all this.
---
Also to finish, it has nothing to do with being unemployed, some just have flexible schedules. 
---
But like you said we wont agree. So might as well just stop there.
---
The second comment is mine and I still stand by it. It's a non issue if the p2w effect has no permanence. You can simply outlive the bad. Say, they announced an event that people who buy the Vault Girl head will be invincible in PvP for a day only. We can still avoid PvP for a day and defeat the p2w component. The problem with this repair kit however, is that it's not just p2w, but predatory as well. Imagine a new player who has no perks in repairs. Their weapons constantly break. Suppose they find a good weapon they like and it breaks. They either replace it, or find mats to repair it (which is not the easiest to do at low levels) or, now, they feel like the game is forcing them to buy the repair kit, because sure as hell a level 7 isn't gonna do a SBQ run to get the improved repair kit. That's the predatory part of the problem. 
---
Yes please, I would give up all my atoms for any of the Veteran Ranger armors from New Vegas(NCR,desert,riot) as an outfit. Or the helmeted cage armor from F4.
---
The issue with cosmetics is it takes a lot of time and money to design for a one time payment that people usually just buy with atoms they earned in game, and with all the free content they are developing and there future plans for the game they are going to need more money out of the game to allow for more improvements.
---
I'm lvl 130 and typically carried around 300 RadAway and 300 RadX and around 100 of the diluted variety of each one on me from just looting during normal Adventure play. Putting them in a stash box with no weight reduction wasn't a good option.
---
 I recently bought a second xbox and started a mule account before getting into Survival though because losing so much made it not worth going into Survival servers.
---
You gonna need more points on perception for once and are you going for sneak build or just a riffle build?
---
I’m running a vampires standard red laser rifle for the burn damaged against SB and Queenie. It really helps in those fights where dps and whatnot is needed. 
---
They *did* ask for feedback from us, so they're pretty much analyzing all this feedback and likely posting a response in next week's ITV, since in general the community's divided on the kits in general. 
---
One camp thinks it's P2W and is in outrage, another camp doesn't think it's P2W more like "Pay for convenience" and has mixed opinions, another camp doesn't really care since a better kit is available in-game and perk cards repair equipment better, *another* camp is fine with them so long as either it isn't a one-time consumable, and another camp is paranoid this'll somehow make Bethesda worse than EA and they'll end up making pretty much everything from now on pay2win/pay2use. 
---
Repairing your gear is a chore, from one side, and logistic challenge from the other. If I paid 10000$ for atoms, I could ignore this logistic challenge and the chore. I'd eliminate part of the gameplay other people have to put up with. Thats completely different from my definiton of fair encounter, where only your skill and time put into character creation and research are factors that influence your chances of victory. Being able to ignore weapon detoriation midfight does influence your chances of victory.
---
One now. Hundreds in the future.
---
Makeshift Warrior, Gunsmith, Licensed Plumber, Power Patcher, White Knight... all perks that reduce the rate at which certain weapons or armor break.
---
And on top of that Bethesda literally addressed some of these issues in Patch 7, specifically with regard to certain ranged weapons whose condition deteriorated too quickly.
---
This idea that they would develop content for the sole purpose of avoiding having to tweak a number in a database attached to a specific weapon doesn't just border into 'conspiracy theory' territory, it's built a lovely CAMP there and hands out tinfoil hats.
---
Judging by how wondering they were at calculating drop rates for the Fasnacht event, I am not very hopeful that we'll ever see more than 3 non-store versions in our lifetime.
---
I was not aware of they Royal Jelly debacle, and I never bother with SB Stew because there is no advantage in making it a single meal. But thank you for the info, it was an interesting read.
---
That said, one of those is absolutely silly in requirements even if you did have a fridge, and one is a broken loot problem. In both cases, a fridge would not be all that helpful (as both are gated by the time requirements of farming the stuff needed). I can see someone saving up a while to get one Scorchbeast Mixed Stew... or they could just cook and eat the parts separately rather than wait and wait hoping they get the right scorch beast bits to make the one recipe. 
---
If there was a "Bonus Loot Chance" recipe that was hard to craft, I'd agree with your point entirely, but beyond that circumstance, I just don't agree it's a meaningful advantage.
---
I mean if you're really trying to stretch it, you could read it that way. But to get some context, this article has a few verbatim quotes from Pete Hines at PAX Aus where he makes it clear that you can't get any competitive advantages from the Atomic Shop.
---
https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-has-microtransactions-but-bethesda-insi/1100-6462850/
---
If you'd rather watch the PAX Aus footage I can link that, though I'm not sure exactly where he says the lines from the article.
---
I just have two accounts, and use my second account purely as a set of mules. Over time they've changed a bit so this ordering might not make the most sense.
---
* Mule1 - 2/3* Legendary items only
---
* Mule2 - Magazines, Bobbleheads, Ammo, Explosives, Recipes/Plans, basically all the non-legendary stuff.
---
* Mule3 - 1* Legendary Weapons
---
* Mule4 - 1* Legendary Armor
---
* Mule5 - 1* Legendary Weapons 2: Electric Boogaloo. 
---
Basically I started with just 1 for legendaries and 2 for all other stuff. But farming them, they've added up quickly. Mule 3 was at the point he could only do the super-slow walk, so I started Mule 5 to hold the overflow and give Mule 3 the ability to actually do a light jog again.
---
I do know you can get it for free but being the top of 4 different generators makes it end game to me as it was in fallout 4
---
Didiznutz 
---
except we don't know how much they will cost... If its like 50 atoms that can be done daily in a few minutes with daily challenges...
---
It’s not much an effect now. The problem is that bethesda now will want to sell these since they make money. And there is ways they can rebalance the game in a bad way for us to make these more enticing to buy. For example they could start rebalancing the game so that guns and armor degrade so quick that you have to spend most your time farming for materials to fix them rather than playing the game. Basically making most the game a chore to play unless you buy these repair kits that will help you skip the grind. 
---
No loot at all or just poor loot? One time I only got some plans but no weapon or armor. Another time I got into the fight too late, even though my shots hit her I didn’t get anything, nada zero, empty loot box (PS4). 
---
I agree! Id love for it to be a plan on a hard mission i have to earn! I love challenges lol. But their statement is pretty open ended...
---
But here’s the question did they just do that for pc and not the other consoles. Or did they actually put it in both so it can “now” be obtainable? 
---
But someone could always pay for more. Or you could say, "pay to win"
---
This should be a combat armor skin tho. We know that they have support now for model changes. They could make skins for PA too where it gets changed to a hellfire pa. I mean it dosent need to be lorefriendly 
---
I could have leveled my alt to 25 in a day at Whitesprings. But now it took me three hours for a level at 20. 
---
Sure it does. Bethesda asked for feedback, so we can petition for no repair kits in survival. And only if she chose to be a man, she could be transgender.
---
I am so sad about this because it feels real and not just by them but most big studios also.
---
Inside the vault also said they would be rewards for defeating the SBQ and other events. So its not just something that is paid for, but will drop in game just fyi.
---
I sent the invite
---
I would go to an alt acc if i had a second ps4 so i could trade myself whenever but i think im going to do 1 for serums, caps, legendaries armor and weapons and then 1 for junk 
---
Yeah right. They sell fucking icons for 50 atoms. Have you ever even thought of checking out another player's icon? And no matter the cost, it's a predatory behaviour. New players, faced with constant weapons breaking and having no repair perks, will feel pressured into buying these kits. And therein lies the big problem. 
---
It would be kinda cool if say an enclave satellite would pass over head every 20 minutes or so and give every ones location. Even a random timer on that would spice things up.
---
I don't think the dev room was accessible from consoles so I guess the purge was on PC only, but the release of helmet 2.0 was global, I suppose.
---
theres a concrete deposit on the right hand entrance of Posiedon....
---
main road, turn in to Posiedon.  Pass the turret, unranium deposit, bar gate, red tractor trailer, concrete deposit.
---
Found other deposits literally in the middle of the roadway in various locations in the Forest.
---
I'm opposed to selling anything other than skins in the atom shop, and in that vein what I'd like to see is more faction specific clothing and camp item skins from the in-game factions.
---
This has been my hypothesis, there wasn’t anything in the itv article that specified individual items, if it is indeed the plan I wouldn’t have much of problem with it, I’d rather have it in game but the ability to buy item plans isn’t terrible.
---
Still not a big fucking deal. There are worse shit in the world that anyone can rightfully complain about (there's still no women's rights in the Middle East, Flint, Michigan still doesn't have clean water, child abuse is still a thing today, the rich are getting richer by making others suffer, Nazis are reappearing for the first time in decades, etc.) AND THIS IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE DECIDE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT?!?! It's just baffling to me how this is the thing that gets peoples' panties in a twist.  
---
Flashlights? Like the ones that are supposed to go on those nubs on the back? Those don't exist. Never did. Dont even bother looking at posters of the suit in the game, itll just be blank..
---
It bothers me that its supposed to have 2 more lights that they just didnt model for some reason. It's like the f03 flamethrower missing the hose that connects the tanks to the thrower...
---
I think the important thing to draw attention to is that this game is rated to be for adults.
---
You can literally blow enemies to pieces, but they think Anus_Hammer will offend someone's delicate nature?
---
I would say they should stick to only restricting racism/prejudice/bigotry in usernames and let the rest fly.
---
I dunno man, to me the no-pay people in gaming are like the non-gmo people, they haven't really done the research and the logic only applies where convenient but whatever, if you feel like voicing an opinion on the internet guess Reddit is as useful as any. 
---
As to camo, There's no markers on the map in pvp unless you're on the leaderboard. So you're definitely less visible especially for people further away like snipers, so without the revenge options people can pick you off pretty easy and there's a number of people doing so regularly at spawn points. 
---
I think there's far more game breaking things that people can be doing that buying a repair kit doesn't even hit my own top 10 and it's not a sword I'm willing to throw myself on. 
---
You dont. He finds you.
---
Just keep hitting those random spawn points. I've only ever encountered him in The Mire.
---
Especially considering that the better repair kits are the ones you can earn in game.
---
That said, I'm sympathetic to the people upset about Bethesda breaking their word. That is potentially a big deal. Repair kits themselves are definitely not, and anyone attempting to inflate their importance in order to bring greater attention to the other problem should probably reevaluate their approach. 
---
I know. Unless they nerf the decay rate I’ll hardly ever have to use one anyway. I’m arguing against the principle it sets. They should at least address that they can’t keep their cosmetic only promise. 
---
"Must be paid for" did you ever stop to think that atoms are earnable? Your entire post is nonsense.  
---
I’m not sure why everyone is freaking out. They stated these repair kits will drop in game during events like the SBQ. They will also offer them in the atom store, so what. I have never had an issue with my items breaking since i leveled up the armor and weapon repair perks that bring em up to 200%.  The best one will only bring up durability to 150%, i will likely never care to use them.
---
While this sucks, I don't know, I don't see how is it such a big deal. It reminds a lot of ESO's consumable items that they sell, except in 76 you can earn the credits through gameplay. And from the sound of it, it's looks like a one time unlockable plan that you then craft whenever you want.
---
Eh... For free DLCs, I think it's a fair trade. Especially since repairing your stuff is trivial anyway.
---
That being said, it does suck that they're backpedaling on the "cosmetics only" promise. That tells me the big execs are pressuring the devs into doing things they don't want to do. That's always a recipe for disaster. Just look at BioWare.
---
So by your logic perks like luck of the draw and serendipity shouldn’t exist. There’s no logical way they proc it’s all based on RNG and yet they give a tactical advantage to a player 
---
You still refuse to acknowledge my argument which I find confusing as I’ve pressed you on it multiple times now, if I can find an item in game then how is it Pay to Win to have an inferior version of that item purchasable thru currency that can also be earned in game? 
---
You say repairing is a chore, yes that’s why this is a QOL item imo because it replaces that chore. The time these players spend killing legendary enemies and finding “improved repair kits” is legitimate gameplay. This item may change PvP encounters tho only in a small way, one part about being tactical is having access to resources you need such as a weapons workbench. But the fact that it can be found in game means it’s not pay to win in the way that you’re portraying it imo.
---
Can anyone cite a source for this "promise" that everyone keeps referring to? Because I can't find it nor has anyone else been able to provide it.
---
There has never been a statement that that AS would NEVER have non-cosmetic items.
---
The closest is when someone answered a question about buying legendary weapons.
---
The next most cited is a statement that the store "Doesn't" have non-cosmetic items, not that it never would.
---
Where can i find this?
---
Using any of the things I suggested will be a net gain. People are craving customization. People will buy weapon skins, paints for their camp, hair, anything to make them feel unique. 
---
I guarantee if BGS made an R-91 assault rifle skin from Fo3 for the current assault rifle we have and charged 800-1000 atoms. 100’s if not 1000’s of players will it. Why? People love that game and that gun. They tell their friend and they get the gun skin. Thus a ripple is created and boom profit. 
---
If the money is the issue lower the in game amount of atoms we get for doing stuff and lower the cost of purchased atoms and put something on the shop and people will buy atoms. 
---
Pay for more what?
---
one may think that it's not a big deal, some say that it's not p2w item but "pay to loose" as it repair stuff for less then you can do with ranked perk cards. I agree on this as melee weapon do more dmg when repaired to 200% then to 100-150%, but it`s any way not cosmetic item. this add curiosity about what the trick behind, as they put "worst" kit to shop and better one to loot drops. second point is it`s p2w in way that you pass time to gather mats and go to workbench to repair, some mats as you may know are +/- rare, and who know if one day these mats not turn out very rare. why? because if no one will buy repair kits, as many of us said, how can we be sure that there will be no "sneaky" tunes to mats drop or item degradation.
---
and more disappointment, understanding, that instead of working on player vending, they push this uber needed in game option a month back, just to add one more photo mode and qst for that photo mode, that do nothing more then hide ui + print screen. and repair kit that not sure who asked for. as I know ppl ask for bug fixs,fix for qsts and events, bug fixs,in-game text chat, bug fixs, better loot from sbq, bug fixs, anti-cheat for survival mod, bug fixs and so one
---
very sad and it`s second time they try to push p2w to atom shop, first was outfits with hp buff 
---
I'd say that is a significant stretch for almost all of gametime. The only time I can imagine it giving an advantage is if someone gets to the top of the survival leaderboard and if someone does not bust a cap in them (so far, I've not seen a lot of really long survival streaks) and you've been standing at the rail station farming people as they spawn in and taking every challenger face first.
---
Taken to that extreme, we could argue that the camo paint sets are technically a P2W system, because they offer a chance, however infinitesimal, that you might have an advantage.
---
Also let us wear armour over our clothes, obe of the few mods I got for fallout 4 was the one that made all clothing able to be worn under armour.
---
I don't mind if there's a tickbox, or two versions if they still want the option to wear costumes over armour, but the whole reason I haven't bought any outfits on the atom store is because I'll never wear them since they hide all my armour
---
We can’t open it back. There’s no outside button to open the vault. 
---
Reddit isn't the Lorax and doesn't speak for the trees.

Adding a place holder comment to add my character's backstory when I am on my PC. Word of warning though, my name is Pvt. Beck Brightstar, military with a twist. :)

but if there is a sewer where we can re-enter 
---
You got real lucky, those mirelurk families are rarely Legendaries. My camp is nearby and I check them everyday, only a handful times any of them were Legendaries. A legendary couple? lol. The queen quite often is crowned though. I got some decent drops from her from time to time, then scrapped them immediately to unlock mods, many of my handmade and gauss mods came from the queen. 
---
They’re still creating a problem—item durability—and selling a solution. It’s unethical, plain and simple. 
---
It’s obviously designed to be an atom sink, something to chew up the free atoms people are sitting on. I get why they want to do that and understand the necessity, but it’s not a good way to go about it. 
---
Instead, they should just be transparent, explain that the balance is off with free vs paid atoms and reduce the flow of freebies in game. 
---
That's different because that isn't authorized or official. Those people doing it have actually gotten banned for doing this. The issue is it sets a precident think about their post they mentioned fridges and most importantly ammo converters.
---
Imagine with an ammo converter you'd never need another player you could convert your 5,000 .38,.308,.10mm etc into any other bullet. That would absolutely be a huge advantage. That is the issue that these things that should be QoL are atom shop. 
---
The Vault is sealed and all life support systems have been turned off. To go back in would require some space suits.
---
Sorry I haven't played in a few months now, so no idea.  
---
Its still the principal of the matter. They promised only cosmetic items in the Atomic Shop and now they are adding non-cosmetic items to the repair shop.
---
Nothing, not even a piece of meat, and I am there for the entire fight.
---
Because people love a good riot.
---
&gt; Once this post is ~24 hours old, we will default to our "standard" system: After that point, any new post about repair kits that isn't significantly different from any other repair kit post on the sub's front page (first 25 "hot" posts) will be removed to limit duplicates.
---
You are just attempting damage control here. Stop it with your bullshit "moderation" excuse and let the base speak openly about what they want to adress you little corporate crook.
---
I intend to withhold final judgement until I see where they priced the plan at.  If this is a 2000 atom plan, Im gonna be salty as hell about it.  This isn't a $20 upgrade.  If its a 1200 atom plan and gets sold as a featured discount, at least at first, for 700 caps or so...I'm gonna be annoyed but not all that salty.  I wont really be happy unless it costs 1000 or less, AND gets sold initially at 50% or more off.
---
Repair kits, assuming their consumables and not a plan. Mobile repairs would make a huge difference to things like the bloodied +40% swing speed ripper meta that rely on keeping high levels of repairs due to the insane amount of damage drop off that comes with any durability loss. Now instead of having to grind for multiples of the same weapon these people could just drop cash on repair kits and hotkey it to maintain at least usable damage.
---
Whitespring sucks, only occasional legendary ghouls and half of them are level 42. I simply don’t go there any more unless it’s nuked. 
---
It would be cool. But it breaks lore. All the vault life support system shut down 24 hours after we leave. No water, no air, lights the list goes on. And no overseer or vault dweller can change that. It’s a vault tec protocol thing for vault 76. 
---
At least you agree that it's p2w.  I agree that's it's only relevant for pvp.  If Bethesda implements this, they will be going back on their word about cosmetic only and starting down the slippery p2w slope.
---
Oh, yeah, I am on PC, so it was suuuuper easy to just get a second account and boot up another instance of the game whenever I need to transfer items around.
---
It's not, you learn a plan, hell maybe even a different coloured version, but it's not pay to win when you can both earn the items ingame, earn the atoms to buy said plan. And repair using perks to a better percentage than these RK's have.
---
Read into it more before jumping up an wailing around arms raised screaming "problem"
---
Yes. Not as 'obtensible through real money' items.
---
Yes.
---
Unfortunately the minority addicted to p2w mechanics from mobile gamblers and loot boxes will financially support repair kits implementation enough for it to be profitable. Time will tell if it’s long-term profitable. Then again, it’s likely this game has already been abandoned in comparison to content planning from last year.
---
I'm not sure how difficult it would be in terms of implementing within the existing programming, but there are two changes I would love to see to the Barbie Dress-Up aspect of Fallout 76:
---
* Being able to apply more outfits in 'pieces' (Wear the Shroud jacket with the Casual Shirt with something else, etc)
---
* Dyes that alter the color of an outfit (Crimson for the Silver Shroud, become Carmen Sandiego!)
---
The unstoppables thing was a test to see if they can do this now, and since nobody really cared for that Bethesda thought, "shit we can do even more to milk these suckers".
---
Im waiting for all the DLC to drop so i can play everything this Fall but considering the news i might just well completely write off this game.
---
I think they just want the vault interior to remain a safe place for new players to learn the controls and absorb a little bit of starting lore, without too much commotion around them.
---
but a safe player hub is always a good plan.. somewhere
---
I use to play madden but refuse anymore because there are certain packs you cannot buy unless you pay actual money. You can earn atoms in this game pretty easily, i never look at what the challenges are and i still earn 20-50 each time i play, if i did try to grind them it seems pretty easy to earn  80-100 a day. O and these repair kits will drop during events just fyi, at least thats what is said in inside the vault from yesterday the 4th.
---
Sorry I couldn't respond earlier , are you still willing to give me them?
---
No. Anything that is non-cosmetic but has an actual in-game impact (like any armor that gives resistance values and isnt just for the looks) is fucking p2w. This cancer needs to stop, no discussion.
---
I think it does make sense, for the initial window. I don’t know that I agree with it but it makes sense.  
---
The decision makers at Bethesda could see far fewer threads about it and think “well, great, the ruckus has died down, we’re good to go!”
---
But reddit is only one of many places they’re getting hit with this so I’m sure they’ll know. 
---
The fridge is but one example with current recipes. Think about the advantage it would be to be able to convert any kind of ammo 
---
That’s strange indeed, were all of those after the latest server update? 
---
They can re-introduce the Disciples and Operator armor designs in the Atomic shop and i would actually considering getting those.
---
Depending on how they do it, when they give each vendor a representative at Whitesprings, I have a feeling that it will become the de facto player hub.  It already is for many players.
---
I can use luck of the draw without paying. I'll be sacrificing some of the slots of my build for an advantage thats accessible to anyone without any money. There is zero connection between in-game repair perks and real life payments for repairs.
---
Lets rephrase the thing because I thought I answered the "better in-game alternative", but seems the answer was not satisfactory. Yes, I might farm the game to obtain non-AS repair kits. The non-AS repair kits will be better than AS? Thats irrelevant to me still. Because if a player killed SBQ milion times and has milion repair kits in their stash, this is something they achieved in game and they deserve to use it for their own advantage. But if I pay lots of dollars, I can get to a situation where I can negate one aspect of gameplay (the chore and logistics), and even if people can play to get a better repair kit, money allows me to ignore the aspect of gameplay they had to work for.
---
I’m still unclear if the basic kits are a plan or if it’s the actual kits. Anyone know?
---
You’re giving too much credit to actual gamers that they aren’t helping perpetuate this. This is pretty much a real life example (though it was a different game we were arguing about). Meet Mark. Mark likes fallout but has a job that keeps him busy. He doesn’t have time to gather all these resources. He lives these microtransactions cause they help him skip the grind so he can play the game. He can’t comprehend the game is so grindy in order to convince him to pay to fix it. No, they are just conveniences for him because he has more money than time and apparently would like to pay to skip playing the game. Dense to the irony that he’s paying for a game made not fun to grind so he can skip playing most of it. 
---
Depends on the 3*, could be anywhere from 5-12k
---
&gt;It is our job
---
I'm not doing this for less than fifteen bucks an hour. I say we strike until we get a living wage!
---
I just used a anti armor one today for the first time,its pretty good and fun against weak ghouls and such,but the lack of mods is a shame tho,would really like a dot sight or long scope,i have over 600 bolts,if you on xbox u can have some
---
More than just the WS vendor has them.
---
Theres almost always a box next to the workbench at one train station, and in the cabinet next to the workbench at a diferent station.  Couple of boxes at Grafton steel.
---
Pegboard toolholders often have a box.
---
farming fans, giddyup buttercup parts, most toys....
---
Since at least since patch 7, lots of critters also drop them.  
---
Off the top, Wendigos and mutants...I think the last graftom monster I killed had 8 or so. 
---
Since screws are required to complete the excavator quest, availability of same in the shop may be a bit over the line.
---
And while they’re at it, how about making the recipes that take all those ingredients better than just making mutt chops?
---
Having those weapons at 100% repair which is what the purchasable repair kits would do is far inferior to what the improved repair kits would do by repairing your weapon to 150%. Sure someone could purchase hundreds of these normal repair kits but they’d be at a tactical disadvantage against players who had the improved version. Also we don’t know the price yet but with the steady supply of atoms each week any player would have access to a good supply of these items. 
---
Your argument is sort of akin to someone saying that a player with more stealthboys is at an advantage against other players. This is true but it’s not because of a pay to win philosophy but instead a knowledge of the game and desire to grind in adventure mode to influence their chances at survival mode.
---
i have this same problem and repairing files didn't fix it. :(
---
So, I use rifleman, expert and master, gunsmith lvl5, tank killer. Using anti armor combat rifle..
---
Got any advice for me..?
---
God yes. I’d prefer yet another in-game set with tweaked stats but even if it’s just a skin, I’d be happy. 
---
Are nerd type and the perk

Is that how people are server hopping? Just quitting and reconnecting?

The mentality is like ‘omg i can finally be successful for once so I’m gonna use it’. Those are the kind of folks who can’t achieve anything in real life. 
---
I checked the Whitesprings Bunker yesterday and saw a Gamma Rifle plan on MODUS.  It's possible that's always there, or he has a set of plans he randomly shuffles between.
---
I encounter them from time to time as well, they were awesome in Fallout 4. And lasted for a little while, now. They barely last a minute or two, and they already start to dissipate before you can get a nice photo. 
---
Are the armor kits being sold in the shop, or the ability to make them?  I think every other item in the shop that is at all tangible are items you craft (obviously things like poses and player icons are not crafted, but they're also not really single use).
---
Let's put a scenario together for you...item repair kits are in the atom shop.  It's 100 atoms, and it teaches you the plan to craft a repair kit for 25 steel, 25 wood, and 25 cloth.  What would your opinion be about that addition?
---
Now, change the price to 1000 atoms.  How has your opinion changed?
---
Now, change the price to 0 atoms, everyone gets it for free.  How has your opinion changed.
---
I don't need to ask how you feel about buying 1 repair kit for X atoms, we all (mostly) despise that idea.  But what if that's not what they're doing?  We don't yet know how it's being implemented, so it's kinda pointless to make a decision on the whole thing without knowing those details.  
---
And right now, we don't know those details.
---
So many “what if’s” fueling these rants, .. how about “if , if’s were a fifth we’d all be drunk”
---
There is nothing that you need to repair with anything that you can’t find in 10 minutes. Juicehead is retarded you don’t need flux for repairing items.
---
Yeah, I am able to loot everything but the queen. 
---
r/fo76filthycasuals is that way my friend. 
---
Mark AND Karen are the problem! But you are correct. It introduces difficult and time consumption in game and allows relief from that with monetary transfer. 
---
Not arguing with you (I'm really not) but I have never had a weapon break and I'm level 32. I definitely fully realize that it does happen, but at low levels? I mean, pipe pistols, hunting rifles, and machetes? They're everywhere. And sure I've had to repair my weapons, in fact I do it frequently to keep damage maxed, but it's not that much of a resource suck. Since I stick to areas my level, I have never had a problem with most mats for repair (hell, I've never had a problem with having enough ballistic fiber either). I'm not going to challenge that there's a very debatable issue with repair kits, but predatory to low levels?
---
I’m taking a break from the game until all this is sorted out. If it turns out to be a mistake then I’ll be playing again. If the repair kits and other items like the fridge are as we feared then I’m selling the game. Not too keen on the idea of Bethesda nerfing unnecessarily just to temp me into buying utility items from their “strictly cosmetic” item shop
---
No fix for hot wheel or grognak axe so far either. My weightless armor still weighs 6 lbs. There are far too many incompetent programmers in their dev team. 
---
Whoosh! as it goes over the head of about 25% of the people. There are a scary number of people who simply don't get that this is beginning of the end if left unchecked.
---
It's just unnecessary in general.  To me, the best way for Bethesda to operate the Atomic Shop is to offer more cosmetics that players actually want.  And there's some really obvious stuff that's missing from that, particularly faction-oriented gear.
---
How I am feeling right now:
---
"You feel that? The way the shit clings to the air, Randy? It's already started my dear good friend... The shit-blizzard."
---
To me I could care less......
---
What if Bethesda dies this , what if they do that.... hmm a lot assuming in all the rant threads
---
This
---
"All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76--all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff--is going to be free. That's important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff."
---
This is the key one to me. Everything in the AS is, and has been so far, available to be gotten without real world money. I personally expect that to continue so that it is all always available for (a certain definition of) free.
---
Same with the second line "AS is cosmetic stuff" isn't AS is ONLY cosmetic, it is only "non-competitive" as the only Competition IN the game is PVP and it seems EXCEEDINGLY unlikely that you will be able to repair mid fight, then by the "non-competitive" qualifier they are still within the bounds of the statement.
---
But hey, what do I know, I just draft and review contracts and legal documents. It is my impression that they have been VERY careful about precisely what they have said and how that they have said it. How gamers have taken it while skimming articles in the rush to the crunchy parts welllll....*gestures at everything on fire*
---
Thank you, mighty internet crusader. I sure didn't notice the *tremendous pile of people who already know and are* ***posting their angry recriminations ad nauseam*** [*which would make removing an old text post pointless seeing how it's on youtube videos and angry pre-reviews starting all the way back* ***when they announced the bloody thing.***](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/)
---
Brave knight, thank you for doing this completely unneeded thing. Rest assured, within a ~~fortnite~~ fortnight Kotaku will relieve you of your vigil and take their rightful place above the grave where "Bethesda sent Fallout to die". Fear not, for if anyone doesn't care, it's going to be the huge corporation who everyone insists gives no fucks about the fan's opinions.
---
...
---
..
---
This is reddit, so to be absolutely clear, that's sarcasm.
---
My bad, I’m sorry. 
---
This mass hysteria is exactly the problem ,.. to many calling to arms based on “ What if...”
---
Although the Bobby pins was a small issue, many other issues such as the collectors nylon bag was completely justified and started by the people who bought the collectors edition, the people who played and bought the best version of the game. You have to realize that most of these problems affect the games worth and our enjoyment of it. Players of the game are willing to speak out and don't "keep their head down", just look at this Reddit recently. Why wait for a huge problem when we can start before it begins. Also, "boy who cried wolf " doesn't apply to real issues that are defying a key promise from the game's release. People care about promises, look at any game that lied before and see if they get positive responses.
---
What I'm saying is there is a fundamental difference between grinding for an advantage and purchasing one. Imagine if Mark 1 Stealth boys were purchasable on the atom shop and mark 3 stayed an overpriced item in the enclave bunker or worse yet, became a SBQ drop like the advanced repair kit. You could buy infinitely more time invisible using your stealthboy example then you could ever farm Mark 3s even if they are 3 times as effective because once it is a cash consumable the only limit on it is how much someone is willing to spend.  
---
A low level player does not have all the knowledge about the game you have. Neither does everyone spend a lot of time playing. If the option to buy a repair kit is their, they'll feel it's rather a necessity and end up buying it.
---
And this entire thing is just acclimatising us to non cosmetics in the shop. They broke one promise and if they see players are ok with it, what's to stop them from addition more game altering objects tobthe store?
---
But playing the game also allows you to ignore that aspect of gameplay aswell.. these will be purchasable with atoms you earn in game. So how is it pay to win exactly? Also other enemies besides the SBQ will drop them just so you know. 
---
I find it hard to believe that firefights last so long that a gun repaired at 200% is breaking every time during the middle of said fight. And if that’s the case then a backup weapon would be more useful than a repair kit that would take time to use.  You said yourself that you play with a team, it’s easy to travel back to your camp and repair your weapon in less than 3 minutes then fast travel back to your team without losing any map dominance so I still find that argument lacking when it comes to a pay to play scenario in respect to repair kits.
---
Was it the never ending circling arrows or just blank? I’ve come across many paper bags lately that would never show the content, just the arrows circling. 
---
Haha yeah I got lucky having them both legendary, was a hell of a fight though. I love using that area (watoga and surrounding) for high level enemies and loot
---
Hell I could have a custom pin cushion map in my camp I could do that I would take it.
---
They mention fridges as part of fulfilling the community's ideas and desires. NOT a section "about the atom store".
---
Literally nothing in there about fridges in the atom shop. That is total speculation. 
---
They get hate because they are going to be in the atom shop which was supposed to be cosmetic only
---
I'm a casual gamer.
---
You have 450 hours? I have 150. Most players are like me, playing about 10-15 hours a week.
---
Atoms are not as available to me as they are to you.
---
yeah if they do that you have a case to be upset about
---
being upset because something could happen is pointless
---
Seems like a mod-approved megathread would have more impact, and be less annoying to the rest of us, who are just trying to read the goddamn subreddit.
---
I think the Whitespring is going to be the meeting point and main market in game because they are going to put all factions vendors there in Patch 8
---
That would be cool. A map on the wall you build then “interact” with it to look at it and place push pins or something. 
---
Agility, rad resistance, endurance
---
You take vaccines before you die, not the other way round. Prevention and cure and all that.
---
They probably won't offer one.  Bethesda tends to go into "business as usual" mode when it is faced with some kind of controversy, and what winds up happening is either the controversial problem magically gets dropped, or they forge ahead with it anyway.  They aren't prone to go out and make public statements because everyone knows how those cascade on the Internet these days.
---
It's stated right in the lore of the game that Vault 76 was designed to make itself uninhabitable 24 hours after Reclamation Day begins by venting out all of the air and permanently disabling life support systems. This was done to ensure that none of the vault dwellers would be able to stay. Turning it into a player hub would make no sense.
---
Besides, they seem to be planning for Whitesprings to be the player hub anyway with the upcoming update adding a vendors from every faction except the Enclave into it.
---
Teaches plan - fine with me.  Probably even if there is no way to earn it in game.   Even at a high price, if I have learned the plan it’s a “permanent” improvement to my experience.  And I’m sympathetic to folks with more “money than time”.
---
0 atoms is a great price, but at that point I’d almost rather have a quest to learn the plan.  I wouldn’t for example want to unlock all the plans in the game for zero atoms! A big part of the experience of the game is going out into the world and finding these things, and with the multiplayer component, trading and sharing with others.
---
You are right we don’t know the details, though the statement they have made admits single use as a possible interpretation.  Trying to be measured in my response, but also explore the boundaries of what we think is acceptable.
---
Good lord, no they haven't.. I can't stand people who compare games to what YouTubers have said. Jeezus.. form your own opinion. Please. 
---
P.S - I can't stand Juicehead and his constant shit-canning of the game. 
---
The food an drink rates haven't been increased at all, people just post about this after every single update and they soon delete their posts after enough people tell them it's the same.
---
You're just looking for problems or reasons to complain aren't you?
---
&gt;	While it's purely my speculation/perception, I get the sense that some exec really wants to push pay-to-win elements into the Atom Store.
---
Well, it could be as simple as “make some actual revenue for next quarter, or we shut you down”. 
---
My point is that means effectively there would be no clock. Not arguing for or against, just pointing that out.
---
Cheaper items, better items.
---
Bethesda can make a lot of money and still be affordable. Just have to make the right decisions. 
---
Yea, I agree with you.
---
We were told the atomic shop would be cosmetic only, and I honestly dont think selling these are that big of a deal. But I dont want these in the Atomic Shop because I see it as a slippery slope, where Bethesda says "well they didnt mind repair kits, why not sell gun upgrades?"
---
I honestly thought about getting a game map and doing it at home.
---
🤣 I'm digging these responses from the normal people. Keep this kinda stuff rolling lol
---
If people don't like what companies are making, then people have a right to complain. Especially when it seemingly goes back on the companies word in order to make more money. 
---
They said only cosmetic items in the shops, not ones that practically allow you to buy junk. If they want us to buy more, make better content. Don't give people a donut themed pipboy when better things can be given (maybe a chrome, wooden inlay, or gold plated pipboy).
---
“Buy once, play new content for free forever” isn’t really a sustainable business model, though. 
---
I agree that repair kits aren't exactly game breaking. But I do see the argument that paying for an item to improve quality of life could lead to worse problems. Let's say I'm extremely rich so of course I will buy a basically unlimited supply of repair kits. This means I can stay away from a work bench for a little longer and therefore can farm slightly more efficiently. I know this is really minor, but I'm glad the community is taking a stand at "Pay for cosmetics only", instead of "Pay for cosmetics and some small quality of life improvements only". It just seams like an easier, more concrete stand to take.
---
Maybe it's just me, but we don't know the food spoilage rate was intentional or a bug? 
---
I see a lot of talk about White Knight being nerfed &amp; how that was obviously to cater to repair kit sales...except I haven't even noticed this entire time (White Knight + Fix It Good). Hell I haven't even had issue with armor damage on my alt through the 1-50 grind over the past weeks. 
---
I think we need to leave the conspiracy tinfoil hats on the table a touch longer, though I'm 100% for the uprising that has occurred over this. 
---
Yea the kings are nasty, and they hardly drop anything except their own meat. I always wonder how the king and queen look so different yet they produce crabby offsprings since the king looks more like a mammal. They should really add some mating animations to demystify this. 
---
I only play for 5-6 hours on weekends, and I had no knowledge about repairing when I first started. I still have never had a problem with it (I expect once I'm waltzing away in the bog and such, this may change).
---
Your second point is what I'm not arguing with. It's a legitimate concern, which I can fully appreciate.
---
Realty depends on a buyer, but at least  10k each.
---
YES!!! Let me know when the in-game protest is. We can have a sit-down at Vault 76!
---
Its fucked that the mods are considering a "standard procedure" for every time Bethesda fucks up so bad there is a public outcry. 
---
Right but that would be a legitimate pay to win scenario, you just confused my analogy but that’s alright because I probably shouldn’t have brought it up when I was trying to prove a point.  No one wants stealth boys in the atomic shop this so not a QOL item and is infact pay to win. 
---
The way PvP works in this game does not lend itself to incredibly prolonged gunfights. I’ve hardly ever been in a situation where I’ve shot so many rounds that my gun breaks in PvP and you might say differently but I’d honestly push back on that. But even if that is the case for you... you’ll be able to earn these items in game thru killing boss enemies aswell as purchasing them with currency you also earn in game. The frequency of your gun breaking in PvP won’t be on the level of how many of these repair kits you’ll find. I can’t guarantee that but I strongly suspect it to be the case. 
---
Be honest how quickly does your gun break in PvP?
---
Yeah... I haven't played 76 in a few months  because of reasons. This repair kit caught my eye so I decided to see what the fuss was about and good god am I disappointed.. 
---
It shows you every time you open the pip boy, do we really need another reminder...
---
Right I’m saying *just* for the initial window after a controversy. Once they’ve made a statement the clock halting stops. There would still be a clock just after the first statement. 
---
But like you I’m also not arguing for or against. 
---
I don't believe it's a stupid ass idea to offer a reasonable point to a debate.  I think your post is reasonable and has talking points for sure, but the debate isn't about Bethesda offering multiple ways to get URK's.  There are quite a few items in the Atomic Shop that can be found or earned in game.  A Bomber jacket bought in the Atomic Shop does not offer any competitive edge to someone who got it by turning in tech plans at Camp Venture.  URK's do offer a competitive edge, however slight, to people who have money to buy Atoms over those who don't and are relying on completing challenges and events to earn them.  Is it an outlandish edge?  Absolutely not, but that still isn't the biggest point of the argument.  The main argument was that Bethesda originally stated the Atomic Shop would only offer cosmetic items.  URK's are most definitely NOT cosmetic items.  I'm sure you agree with that. The worry is that it if people buy these things with real money, and they most certainly will, then Bethesda will just start adding the loot boxes and other items that are non cosmetic to the shop.  That's what all the backlash is about imho, so by that logic, it is as bad as we are all making it out to be. It is very bad when game developers encourage players with cash to spend their money to gain a competitive edge over others who can't or won't spend real cash to compete in a video game.  A video game shouldn't be run like a car lot. Especially since they had already stated that they wouldn't go that way.  That's my rebuttal sir.
---
It doesn't have the level of lore as fallout 4 or new Vegas but it has more stories and information to fill in the gaps. It has og elder maxson, some new and cool factions, and some interesting quests but nothing too big or interesting. I was let down by the lack of lore about scorchbeasts, the main enemy. 
---
I remember reading somewhere that the vault filled it's self with gas too. Though that might have been from Reddit.
---
OK got it, thanks mods this makes sense; allowing venting/posting of displeasure regarding the P2W controversy but at the same time do not let this escalate to the rioting level, no flipping over cars set on fire, smashing store fronts allowed....this is a good plan.
---
I just feel confident they are more apt than a bunch of outsiders that know nothing. I really agree with the lowering prices approach. I just hesitate to make the argument it's what is best for Bethesda because I feel like they would be doing that. Although with recent event who knows 
---
the mod name should be bladed (item).
---
Its a literal definition.  Mod adds blades to the specified item.
---
bladed rolling pin is rather amusing....
---
Same with "barbed"  it adds barbed wire to the the specified item.
---
Barbed baseball bat mod is how you make Lucielle :)
---
or spiked....ad nauseum.
---
Thanks
---
You don't have to use the repair kits. You get free atoms from quests. Nobody is forcing anyone. I don't know why people are so upset. 
---
I repair my armor once per week and i love it becouse i can make some space in stash.. weapons once per 2 days.. yeah guuyys so much advantage !!!
---
What? Did you expect them to give stuff away all the time??? They need money too, the people working on this game are not volunteers, they're employees. They also need money to live.
---
Is that really a bad thing? As a multi-million (billion?) dollar company, they have to look out for their investors as well as the player base. Them trying to make a little extra money does nothing to harm the player base, but could potentially help the game in the long run. Arguably, it could help the player base, especially with instanced dungeons coming down the pipe. 
---
Honestly, no. I like the game for what it is, but it isn’t rich in lore like the others. They did an okay job with SOME quests but if you are in it for LORE I’d say no. However, Beth is continually releasing new stuff into the game to make it very fun. For instance, dungeons are coming, raids, and a new quest line that they will hopefully improve the lore of. IMO  the last quest they added was fun and the lore was interesting despite it being all on terminals and holotapes. So overall, don’t buy it for the lore but there is absolutely fun to be had. 
---
Well said!
---
Thanks for the input man. Think i should buy it? Do you still enjoy the wasteland? 
---
To be fair... I would buy a fridge from the atom store if it stopped the condition bar on my food.
---
But yea I don't like the idea of repair kits that can't be made without premium currency.
---
No he's bringing up an important issue that you obviously overlooked. You are blind to what's actually going on.
---
We're one of the few online game communities that actually want loads of skins, but don't really get em
---
"You're a loony" - Monty Python
---
I knew there was a reason I've been carrying around this straight jacket in game.
---
Why don't you come over here and take a load off.  I have some nice Calmex for you.
---
I mean, they're right about comparisons.  They said it themselves - one of the things the devs are taken aback by is how *nice* most players are in the game.  When they were developing it, it was wishful thinking, since they deliberately scripted the Responders and the Overseer to plead with the players to be nice, but it actually wound up happening.  But since PvP was an advertised feature as well, they still wanted to appeal to that group, so that's how Survival mode came about.
---
They are sort of making it up as they go along, if you couldn't tell.
---
They will be dropped in game as well just fyi. Not sure if you have read inside the vault from yesterday the 4th, but they go over it there.
---
Do you mind linking where they said fridges? I can't find anything with all the repair kit hate. 
---
Yes, add ign - tuckfodd 
---
Yeah having them only available in the shop would be a mistake... that’s why it’s not the case. You’ll be able to find better ones around the wasteland not to mention purchase the normal ones with currency you earn in game for free. 
---
The game is full of lore. In fact, that's what you'll mostly be interacting with since there are no npcs spoon feeding you story. The usual kinds of stories are there, except most of it is way darker than the previous Fallout. I don't understand what you mean by "compelling" lore, but it's no different from the other Fallout games. There's also a sprawling back story involving the many factions of the game, and some never before seen things about how early raider groups appeared, the early days if the BoS and how people reacted in the early days after the bombing. 
---
Happened to me yesterday. Just make a note of a few gamertags at the fight with you so when you get back on you can just find that player and join the same server. Shouldn't have to but it lessens the frustrations.
---
Warframe is free though
---
This is why I am a rude fucker. You have hard time believing things that happen in this game because you don't do these things. I've been to encounters which lasted for much longer than 20 minutes. I've been part of a killing spree where there were dozens of loot bags lying on the ground and nobody was able to pick them up because people controlled the map. I'm not saying that those who control the map the best would die because of enemies repair kits, probably not. But I just want all the advantages to be only attainable for playtime, and never for irl money.
---
Very realistic concern. My pump shotguns used to have camo by default, they removed it in order to sell the camo package. F that I won’t buy it. Sneaky bs won’t get them far. 
---
They presented this as a way they are listening to players and they paired it with other suggested items, such as refrigertaors and ammo scrappers. Yet, having them in the atom shop violates what we were lead to believe.
---
We were told the atom shop would be cosmetic only but they never gave us a lot of good content from there. If they want to make more money, give better cosmetics. Instead of a donut and abraxo themed pipboy, give people wooden inlay and gold plated pip boy.
---
In both FO4 &amp; 76 I mostly just explore &amp; ruin mutant days, and I personally think that type of play is pretty much the same across the two. Bethesda has excelled with the environment imo. 
---
One vast difference between the two, 76 has limited stash, so the days of hoarding every round of ammo &amp; all junk are more or less dead unless you want a (generally pointless) overly full stash.
---
As far as multiplayer, it is highly variable based on what the player wants. I'm way more into solo play, and one can easily go through the whole main story solo. I read plenty of positive reactions to other players on here, a lot of compliments on how sound this community is, so teaming up with randoms seems highly viable (just not my thing). 
---
The guardian of the low levels has protected you
---
You must have missed the part about the scorchbeasts then. There is a part about how combined experiments of Arktos Pharma and bomb testing by AMS in Glassed cavern led to the first strain of the scorch virus and how it spread to bats in the cave.
---
It's still cosmetic. Now after you look at your newly repaired weapon it's cosmetically at full health.
---
Repair kits repair to 100%. What idiots run around with &lt;100% armors missing 50% bonus?
---
No one will ever use those kits outside of emergency. And if you go into intense activity with 20% gear help, you kinda deserve it. 
---
I'm blind, or you're too gullible with a tin foil hat. Which one? 
---
"Overlooked" despite clearly mentioning why it isn't. And mentioning one positive to offset the negative. See comment; "Scrapper" got fixed to give us more. But you're only talking a how it's an aggressive micro-transactions push?
---
Get outta here.
---
The have said the SBQ will drop the advanced version so the regular versions will likely be more common than an SBQ fight. 
---
The Horseman power armor skins, pls. They look DAMN FUCKING AMAZING.
---
Dropped in the game from high level enemies like SBQ. So most players will rarely see one unless they pay for it.
---
X gonna give it to ya!
---
The fair, a lot of the nylon bag, and I'm saying majority, wasnt even people who bought it. It was media, game journalist and pot stirrers who wasntbeven playing that made that an issue. Most of us didnt care, nor did we have an actual use for the bag. 
---
The reddit is also full of the same people. Heres an example. Hop on Instagram. Look at bethesda posts. 95% STILL asking for a refund. Why? Because it's a meme now, and it was a meme back then. Most of the hate this game receives is from people who arent playing it, or should otherwise have no say in the matter. 
---
Everyone keeps this promise. No one cares about that promise but people stated above. Kids promised in grade school not to do drugs in the DARE program. I'm sure you've made some bogus promises to people yourself, because circumstances change. That's the thing - life happens and in a perfect world we all keep out promises ( marriage is also a promise fyi - want me to pull up some divorce stats?) 
---
Bottom line - if something happens, we need to adapt. This game can either bleed Bethesda, or keep it afloat till they release servers to the public. Which brings up my final point -
---
If you truly think all of this is going to ruin the game - you still have private servers to look forward to, where other people wont ruin you game, and you can mod to your hearts content. 
---
I want an armor made of stripped off car parts and stuff.
---
It's fun and all but I would say wait out the controversy here. It looks like it may favor people willing to put down more money after they buy it. Maybe wait a couple of months to see bethesdas direction. If it stays the way it is, I would suggest buying it.
---
I know you are wrong 
---
I did totally miss that. Where's the information found?
---
A lot of blather and hand- wringing about nothing. 
---
Instead if fixing the drop rates of materials for repairing they want you to go the easy way and pay for something you should be able to do without paying. This is the problem. I am always short on materials and when I scavenge for them my armour and weapons  get even more degraded. Which makes it pointless. So they want me to pay to repair my stuff and this is the problem for a shop that they claimed will be cosmetic only.
---
I think with the pins it gets very busy on the map as well as being a development nightmare to initiate. 
---
However, I do agree that you need a way to return somewhere.
---
Add grid lines to the map or go the development route and add GPS coordinates to the HUD. Or simply add a GPS since we already have binoculars. 
---
So, I do agree we need something but in lieu of more pinning and cluttering the map we add grid lines to the map and/or a way to get GPS cords. Heck, if we had GPS cords might as well add altimeter info with all the floors and basements we need to cover.
---
How were they given then? My mistake
---
It’s top tier 
---
So? There are worse shit in the world, I don't think making this whole "They promised us this and this." is that critical. Trust me, I have been lied to by friends and family members about bigger shit than this, I can say with experience that this is not really a big deal at all.
---
It's not the kits themselves, they are a small convenience item offering little advantage to most players and non at all to people who repair to 200%. It's the precedent set by having them in the store.
---
You can take the convenience item concept further - nuke launch pass so you don't have to clear silos, camp repair kits so you don't have to grind resources to repair your camp, legendary tokens for the new legendary vendor, fast travel passes, dungeon passes for the new content so you bypass what ever grind they come up with for them.
---
Take anything you current grind for and there is a way to monetise it somehow.
---
People don't want that in this game.
---
SJWs unite! lol wtf...
---
That is a new take on it, and I love it!
---
I'd say it's capable of doing putting out the most damage of any build if done right, and I know my new melee character is utterly wrecking shit with a pretty mediocre kit
---
Hey this is a really good idea as well. Be able to store coordinates in your pip boy then just return to them. 
---
It's quite spread out. I'm not sure I got all the points exactly correct, too. Widgeon Tav covers Fallout 76 lore in detail and recently made a video aboutvthe Scotched plague's origins where he covers the whole story.
---
It does? I know it shows in the perk screen that isn't really good enough
---
Yes.  Beta I was playing solo it feels desolate and isolated.  Sure in adventure mode you can see map markers with other players and once in awhile will cross paths.  You will meet enemies or new friends and spam emotes unless you have a microphone.  Disliked base building in fo4 and absolutely love it in fo76.  GF and I co-op mostly now.
---
“Only obtainable for playtime” sorta like purchasing them with currency you get in game for free and finding said item on enemies? I’ve also been a part of these firefights but I know to care multiple weapons on me Incase they are prolonged. I just find it disingenuous to imply these repair kits will only help whales when they’re available for free in game. I know you want to say that this will benefit the rich but I’m honestly interested, how many times did your gun break during these prolonged fights? And how many fights such as this are you involved in daily?
---
BS they'd rebalance things to drive you towards buying no one beats the house
---
They never said that. Also, why is statues, posters, etc. Is in the shop which is non cosmetics items 
---
I’m sure other events will drop them, and even if they don’t, people have been getting along just fine without them. The game has been out for a while without them. Just continue as is and nothing will be different! The hysteria over this is a bit much.
---
Happened to me a couple weeks ago. Got her down to 25% health after her regen, then the game crashed. After going through 6k .50, and a boat load of stimpaks, I won’t be running her again until this is 100% fixed. 
---
Trying to make a “little extra money” is what lead to the dominance of DLC. People made this same argument years ago that somehow selling advantage and/or content that was pulled from the base game for the sake of making an additional buck down the road wasn’t really all that bad. It was, and still is bad for us the consumer.
---
Sometimes the arrows but mostly just an empty corpse.
---
That's great if they presented it from the start but they led us to believe that microtransactions will be solely cosmetic. I know that's what convinced me not to be skeptical and so many others. However, seemingly going back on their word makes us feel lied to and taken advantage of. It they told us all before the game came out about stuff like this, it wouldn't have so much pushback as it does now.
---
Almost like repair kits being totally countered by.. the way everyone has been playing the game since launch...
---
I spent my first 100 hours entirely solo, just exploring and digging for lore. There’s a lot to be found. Since then I’ve teamed up with people, gotten into other things as well, but I’m still finding new interesting things. 
---
I'll try to look over that. Thanks man!
---
Ostriching the problem will only make it worse.
---
Must be a glitch, will be soon patched in the next maintenance. 
---
I’ve come across a few truly honest servers in the past, where a three star legendary will really give you a three star item, and two star for two star item, on every single encounter. Before I could enjoy it long it would either disconnect me or announce an immediate server shutdown so I had to leave. 
---
Honest drops aren’t supposed to happen, that’s all. 
---
I'm ok with a fridge if it has it's own stash limit for anything that can spoil. Also, like to see the fermenter have it's own smallish stash limit or just it's own 10 item limit not relating to stash unless the stash is just a way for your save to work properly.
---
In the Bethesda post? Repair on the go like they said, 100% condition with two click. First weapon, then repair kit. 5-10 seconds of time (even if you need to open the pipboy).
---
Yeah, I get it. Once, I was playing with a mic and it was sincerely fun talking and playing, so much information we can share and emotes can never do that. The thing is my wife gets really jealous seeing me chatting with someone with a mic! lol Also, I can hear my kids and kinda watch them at the same time. Really, a serious game should get married and have kids lol
---
&gt;	That would kill the last of the game.
---
Which is not something Bethesda wants, is it? So the logical thing is to make mtx that bring revenue without killing the game. 
---
Any paid shortcut is unacceptable as beth would screw the free game balance to drive more sales of that shortcut.
---
They can be found and earned in game regardless of Atomic store ownership.
---
Bethesda have stated this yet people only seem to talk about hit it's locked behind a paywall and being P2W despite the fact you only repair to 100% durability and still have to make them yourself.
---
Hate train from Youtube taking off again.
---
What is the problem with new content? It is optional, and i’m not “ostriching”, i’m responding to posts with my opinion haha
---
" *Please reply to this email with a list of alternate UserIDS that you would like so we may change it.* "
---
PLEASE tell me you've responded and requested "Anus\_Wrench, Anus\_Screwdriver or Anus\_Drill".
---
At the bottom of the pip boy where it tells you what to press for certain functions, it says for example "Y: Perks (2)" meaning you have 2 perk points available.
---
great here comes more fear mongering and overreacting and over exaggerating and other crap 
---
The worst part is that Bethesda obviously knew this would nake people very angry, but did it anyway because they know that at the end of the day enough people will still buy the store crap to make it profitable.
---
They see us as a bunch of pushovers, all talk but no real repercussions. They see us as money faucets and our angry words are unimportant.
---
Please for the sake of the industry prove them wrong...
---
Nah.. if this were any other company that your precious Bethesda I'd guarantee you'd have a problem. Look I love Bethesda a fallout as a series, I really do. But honestly people are blinded by a company who has done great things in the past. All the bugs and stuff aside this is a very well known business tactic. You slowly change the need for a specific demand then provide that demand. On the surface it seems harmless but it's the intention that is devious. I am hopeful that the repair kits and the fridges aren't atom shop items. But until we know for sure I am going to be wary. 
---
It is a big deal when a big company goes back on their word. A good bit of interviews, articles, and videos focused on the atom shop. You being lied to by your family may affect 2 or 5 people but this change influences what they say millions of players. It seems like a lie to make money and now they are trying to make more money. 
---
Plus, saying one bad thing isn't as bad as another isn't really looking at the whole think properly. It may not be as bad but it still is bad and people have a right to get upset.
---
Saying not to worry because there’s no evidence is the same as letting the mafia boss go free because there’s never enough evidence. Everyone knows that they’re going to do it. Mainly because we’ve seen it happen dozens upon dozens of times before. If you’re genuinely this naive you might want to be a tad careful in what you put your belief into. Also the likelihood that repair kits won’t use materials was confirmed so that isn’t an assumption anymore
---
the only problem with your post is that as a farmer who makes soup instead of using stimpacks, the day the change happened it was instantly noticeable.  All my clanmates noticed it.  Flux deteriorates super fast now also compared to how it used to be.  this change occurred around the time of the patch that introduced the fermenter.
---
Its unfortunate you werent able to recognize the huge change, but many many many people have indeed noticed it, it a  real thing and your thinly veiled sarcasm and confrontational behavior in your messages reveals you to be unable or unwilling to see this from both sides.
---
its ok though, because the food spoilage is a real thing whether you want to admit it or not.
---
ok, ive said my peace, have a nice day, time to do actual work when im at work lol, ill let others deal with your inevitable snarky and condescending reply to this message.
---
Lol. I think repair kits will be offset by the materials used to craft them. Imagine having to spend ballistic fiber, screws, and flux to repair a single weapon or armor piece.
---
Humor is a great coping mechanism, but the problem doesn't vanish because of that.
---
Ok consider this many of us don’t have nearly that amount of time.  Things like ballistic fiber aren‘t super easy to farm in quantity but are needed to repair most armor.  I can either dedicate the very limited time I have to farming junk so I can do a quest or an event every once in a while OR I can use repair kits that drop in game/purchase from the atom shop.  
---
For lots of the more casual players who have a greater amount of time commitments than you likely have these things will be a blessing.  
---
Finally a thought that's outside the box!
---
Google Fallout 76 roadmap.
---
Maybe, but sounds like we could make the pip boy cluttered. I think if you need many waypoints pencil and paper is the way to go. Coords make it real easy to do.
---
Not sure we get around a manual system for waypoints. Need GPS coords 1st though.
---
I found one with extra sneak and used with perks cards not so good against mobs, found a really good second piece leg equipped it huge difference.  Even in danger they cant find me to hit me so imagine what its like with 5. I now do white spring runs  one shotting them maybe get tagged 1 or twice for the whole run. I am now looking for a few more to get a complete set.  Added bonus you dont get hit you dont have amour to repair and now I can switch out blocker perk to more offensive.
---
I will do now thanks.
---
I get it and I’m with you. I personally believe that the repair kit will be free in the atomic shop. If you think about it, this wouldn’t be the first time Bethesda put an unlockable in the atomic shop. Drunk on Nukashine is a perfect example of this. The poster for your camp also unlocks the quest once you build it and read it in camp mode.
---
Please don't encourage them.
---
It's not total speculation. In the context of the paragraph it is a fair inference. They are "looking for ways of releasing" these items, presumably in a similar manner to the basic repair kit as the previous sentence was just about a similar community driven idea that found its way to the atom shop. 
---
I'm generally the optimist in this board. Yes, while it is possible refrigerators will not appear in the atom shop (and now that seems likely given the uproar), they seemed unduly comfortable about placing community driven content not previously contained in their roadmap behind the convenience of a paywall so they wouldn't have to find a better way to release it
---
Are the repair kits classed as aid items ?
---
Is it confirmed spoil rates were nerfed? I've obviously noticed the difference but thought it was an unintended consequence of the update
---
Well that's the hope, anyway! 
---
I once laughed out so hard that woke my whole family up sleeping in next room. Yes, I too think we need a text chat for those people with such difficulties, not only emotes.
---
I don’t think some people get repair kits aren’t something you’ll use all of the time. Most people will just repair to 200%. The repair kit is for when you’re deep in the new group dungeon, your gun breaks, you and 3 other people are about to kill a boss, and you remember that kit you had drop from the SBQ last night. That said I’m always for more outfits. I wish some more of the ones from fallout 4 were in the game. 
---
It's not for fuckups. It's for anything that causes a flood. Future game announcements would be treated the same on /r/Fallout. 
---
Who do I contact to collect my apparently overdue pay cheque? I'd sure love to be earning more than minimum wage! 😁
---
Yeahhh Nahhh, it sounds great until you say it and then it doesn’t sound great 
---
If you can find a good price it would not hurt to try. I paid $30 and love it. It's easy to solo with the exception of the Scorchbeast Queen. 
---
Myrna: Synth or Human
---
Todd: Ummm Todd
---
Myrna: *makes a what the heck face*
---
I for one did not accept nor buy those costumes. I did see people running around in teams in those costumes though. Just saying some of us hated it as mich as you
---
But that’s assuming the game is unplayable without said DLC. 76 has given me hundreds of hours of entertainment for the low price of $60. I agree that DLC hurt games like The Division and Battlefront, but Bethesda has already released an entire playable game that doesn’t require anything extra. 
---
DLC itself is not a bad thing, as long as it adds to an already enjoyable experience, and isn’t necessary for the game to function. 
---
i heard padded walls are nice this time of year..
---
Melee is pretty fucking op. I was a pistol build and I'd struggle with large hordes of mid level scorched. I'd get utterly destroyed in Whitesprings. Now I just casually walk into Whitesprings and 1-2 shot the charred feral ghouls with my super sledge.
---
Lmfao, and we do know, FOR SURE. Inside the Vault. Read it. Repair kits can be found in game from events and SBQ kills.
---
You're also forfeiting a 50% gear bonus from a 200% repair, you can keep saying "pay to win" "paywall" as much as you like, it doesn't make it ANY truer. 
---
Has nothing to do with him/her being a fanboy/fangirl, he/she talks sense.
---
White knight got nerfed yet Scrapper got a buff? You quite clearly have a tin foul hat. As there is literal zero guarantee or proof of this, it's hearsay. Make-believe if you will.
---
And i've yet to see proof myself about food/drink rates. But i have seen a post every patch about it.
---
Misdirection; yes, I can contemplate that possibility.
---
Is no stretch of the imagination given that there was a small controversy over the Unstoppables 'buff' that this repair kit 'thing' was... at the very least not going to go unnoticed.
---
It's absolutely viable and you don't even need top-tier gear to destroy pretty much everything.
---
My suggestions:
---
* There are three styles of melee - two-handed, one-handed and unarmed.  Don't be too quick to decide that you're going to be a specific type.  Part of this is going to depend on the Legendaries you find.  I have way more one-handed and unarmed Legendaries than two-handed (mostly because there are a ton of junk items in the two-handed category), so that's the direction I ended up settling in outside of Scorchbeast Queen battles.
---
* In terms of damage perks, don't be quick to rank up Slugger or Gladiator.  You'll find Expert and Master versions of those cards with their own ranking abilities.  Basically, you can take Rank 1 of each and get a 30% damage bonus for 3 SPECIAL, or fill them all out and get a 60% bonus for *9 SPECIAL.*
---
* Weapon Artisan repairs any weapon to 200% condition, but with melee weapons, it *also* increases their damage.  This can be pretty substantial and is the trick to getting things like the Mr. Handy Buzz Blade and Ripper to be incredible.
---
* Scorchbeasts end up being a problem because of flight.  Unless you wait for them to come down, you'll want to cripple their wings.  So, it's worth choosing a supplemental gun type and its associated crippling perk (i.e. shotguns and Enforcer).  This will be useful against other tough enemies as well, like Yao Guai (cripple their legs) and Mirelurk Queens (cripple their spouts).
---
*Is a repair kit from the Atom Shop an advanced feature? Sure
---
*Do you have to pay for it to access it? In a way
---
*Is access to the game without charge? No
---
The next point you made is null and void because of a later statement.
---
1-Never said its free but my point was that it they introduce new and wanted items to be able to raise the price to increase profit, but that's beyond the point. If people want some thing you analyze it and decide to introduce or kill off the idea and this so happens to be one that they want to introduce.
---
2-a) The original commenter made a good point and that's if it cost a few hundred for a plan then its fine but if its a few hundred for a 1 time use repair then it is definitly pay to win and will at that point be removed or changed, be it the price, making it a plan, or how it is found (aka making them found in the world or a plan you can buy from a vendor/find).
---
3-P2W
---
Short for pay to win, in the sense that in order to 'win' a free to play game, such as Maplestory, you need to pay for various advantages to 'win' ingame. (1- You don't need to "pay" to get it. 2-And the advantage you get is a free fast travel to your camp of a free placement of it. [I understand that it says free to play but i just grabbed the top on urban dictionary. The second says the same thing])
---
4-This statement made the other null.
---
 &gt; Games used to have items you unlocked by doing game related things.
---
Once again you don't need to buy this currency. You can earn it. I believe before you leave the vault you get some for taking the id card photo. This part is all void because you contradict your self you want items unlocked for completing quest and challenges but you don't want to be able to get these item by doing the challenges and quest.
---
That still applies to this game but because someone buys a item(with a ingame currency none the less) it makes every thing they've done worth nothing when in reality all they wanted is to be able to get more things done without having to stop doing what they are doing. And how am i directly affecting anything. All Im doing is standing up for a big company from a child with a computer that gets butt hurt over a executive decision that will in turn affect a game for the better. So to conclude stop with the rebuttal and

Have you ever played a bad fremium game? You rarely HAVE to buy anything, but they make sure that past a certain point it is overly cumbersome to keep playing without putting in some money. They will always make sure you CAN
---
I wonder... could a Pulowski actually survive a Nuclear strike? Has anyone actually tested this? I assume being ground zero at a strike would be fatal.. 
---
You refuse to listen to reason about this and just cry censorship every time I in particular make a post on behalf of the team, and make snarky comments in unrelated threads too, so I'm just not going to try to explain how you're wrong anymore. Ciao! 
---
As other people pointed out. This is just another outrage attack about something we know very little about. People really don't know what p2w is. P2w is having a advantage over players in any kind of way by paying for it. I didn't know having a item to fix my armor when I'm far away from a workbenche or doing a event is p2w or having advantage over other players. Workbenches can be far between each other most of the time. Not only that, we've no idea how they will be implemented. Then there is the people who are making claims and fallacy. Lastly, it can be a plan you've to buy like other plans from the store. But building a repiar kit might take a lot of materials which people are my thinking about at all

*cough* Roving trader outfit *cough*
---
It's not encouraging them I really want a larger capacity Stash Box and I am positive others also want it.
---
To add to what Shaka said, this standard procedure was developed on /r/fallout in reaction to post flooding for positive things. It wasn't a fuckup response procedure.
---
And I have the tin foil hat... Anyway I'm out. No point in arguing no matter who's right. It's Friday let's all just enjoy the weekend. 
---
There was a single one confirmed on Xbox at least.  Dev room was pc only.
---
Save your breath for when you want to spread more bethesda lies.
---
You cant and wont change it, that this shitstorm will be damaging Bethesdas PR no matter what you do and honestly they deserve it.
---
I can't disagree. As a user, I find it pretty awful that they'd reneg so hard. 
---
So, you're condescending but telling someone else they're being condescending? You're actually stupid, i would suggest going back to education.
---
Isn’t “paying money to skip core gameplay mechanics” the definition of pay to win?
---
    *sigh*
---
    *uptokes*

I bet they have the lines of code from other items (legendaries), they just need to implement it EVEN client side, it's easy af.
---
The question should be how many times I died because my main weapon broke and I was left only with the toolset ineffective against the opponents I fought. My lowstr character has eight weapons on him. My superlowstr carries five of them. Both are PvP characters. I'm not a person to be instructed to learn to play better and I take that bad, and I will continue taking that bad until I met a person that actually researched this game more than I did. I met one such person, and after initial discussion of two rude fuckers who thought they know the game best we concluded we're equals and founded a gang.
---
If the community outrage against a piss-poor decision from a company so obviously makes you upset, there is a simply solution. Leave the Subreddit. "Upvoting" through pointless comments is rather contrary to your intention.
---
Ammo scrapping - since we can't sell ammo, not even fusion cores - is a decent measure if it's a tinker workbench action.  The implication by the dev's post is that "functional cosmetic" (i.e., a fridge) items are under consideration. If craftable and lootable, no big deal. 
---
As Atomic Shop options, especially if they are exclusively so, is the concern. Looking at their whacked out pricing structures for what we get ... My guess is that each single-use repair kit launches with a minimum cost of 100 Atoms, with it quite possibly being MUCH higher. 
---
Their own words on the Atomic Shop: "Basic repair kits are single-use consumables". Not a plan as some others have claimed they will be. Plans - my guess/hope - is that we will be able to find/buy basic kit plans fairly readily but improved repair kits appear to be loot-only/event reward only. (Hopefully they are additional rewards instead of taking up the 'slot' or 'roll' that delivers the really good stuff.)
---
lol pessimistic much?
---
Having that in the atom shop is predatory. Everyone wants a bigger stash. It becomes almost mandatory to spend extra cash on the stash at that point. Either that or you have an inferior experience where you struggle with inventory shuffling. 
---
Add old school radio from the older fallouts to the atom stock I would gladly buy a new vagus radio station
---
It has been tested.  You would survive a mini-nuke since they are somehow impervious to explosions...but the bigger nukes kill you because reasons.
---
I only play about 30 hours a week, most of it solo and that's since beta. The same atoms are available to everyone,  if you want more, you look at the challenges lists and work on them. 
---
"Tod" 
---
Your comment was filtered out, but there's no automod "action reason" so I don't think it's any of our automod code (I added action reasons to everything that was missing one late last year) so maybe it's the Reddit spam filter itself. 
---
I approved the comment for you. 
---
doesn't matter how large you make the stash, I'll keep filling it with crap and want larger..hmm..methinks this is a lot like the pursuit of happiness :)
---
Was gonna say the same thing in my own comment but I’ll just piggyback here. I appreciate this mod post! The sub can definitely feel very under-moderated at times so it’s great to see mod engagement and decision making. 
---
Of course they knew. After all, where are they? 
---
They buried that news in a generalized update post and asked for feedback. They got it in spades. Where are they? What's their response? 
---
The answer is that they aren't seeing anything outside of what they expected. 
---
aaaand blocked, thanks, now i wont ever have to interact with someone like you again.  
---
Let's just gloss over the trivial amount of atoms you can get from in game vs. the price of things in the atom shop. 
---
maybe these specific items are not a big deal, but is being lied to by Bethesda a big deal? it should be.
---
 Quit tootin your own horn
---
Good to know. I've moved from melee to heavy guns for the queen. I'm further back and not getting body slammed by her so its hard to tell if she's doing less damage.
---
I know I've kicked her ass the last three times I went down there, though. Even with some level 20s and 30s in the fight.
---
Perfect example of the problem. Look forward to more of this everyone.
---
Oh you’ve seen the license plate too?
---
What license plate?
---
You can obtain atom through the game, but it will always be easier to just buy atom.
---
He's right though. If you can't take the heat stay out the kitchen princess.
---
If you can't accept criticism, don't express opinions. 
---
We've spoken to the CMs directly and at length before the BethesdaReplied hot was set up, and they said that discussion threads in general, with megathreads for specific issues (like this), are the most valuable source of feedback to them. They didn't seem interested in anything else, so with our limited number of sticky threads (max of 2) we opted to operate this way. 
---
good to know. never knew how useful they were.. 
---
Yeah I’m on xbox. How much are you offering it for?
---
Would be sweet along with the 4 horsemen armor 
---
We have no intention of stopping the backlash. Did you perhaps read the post? 
---
He's right though, if you can't handle criticism, don't throw your opinion around in peoples face.
---
Never heard the expression: If you can't handle the fire, stay out the kitchen?
---
Enjoy your lonely, isolationist life.
---
So they created a much much bigger uproar, threatening the loyalty of the remaining fanbase in order to stave off a minor one that would be forgotten in two months.  Sure, makes sense.  It is Bethesda, after all.  As much as I love their games, some of their decisions can be a bit...*puzzling*.
---
Their approach seems to be lots of small updates from now on rather than any huge new content additions. Which should hopefully keep you entertained if you come back.
---
Off the top of my head, recent new content would be
---
1. Short quest to learn how to brew your own booze
---
2. This leads to a new repeatable daily quest to learn booze recipes
---
3. Survival (PvP) Mode - everyone is hostile, you lose aid as well as junk when you die. You also lose a lot of caps.
---
4. There was a daily season parade that you've just missed
---
5. A random encounter lemonade stand
---
6. A shit storm about weapon repair kits
---
Next week we are getting a new quest which looks to be a little longer than the booze one and involves cryptids. Very soon we will be getting player vending.
---
I may have missed things.
---
I want to cleanse the wasteland with Abraxo armor
---
So what am I supposed to do with the thousands of Atoms I have earned ? Maybe buy some emotes nobody uses.
---
Nobody is talking about it, because it's a non issue. Things get delayed, big deal. The only people that would be most likely dont have anything constructive to say about actual issues, imo.
---
I’m curious about this too. It was initially talked about launching next week, but I wonder if it’s being delayed because player vending is. Guess we’ll have to wait to find out 
---
It's not predatory if they want to dress sexy they're going to get what's coming to them.
---
Also if anything I blame zenimax not Bethesda.
---
Exactly. THAT’S the part that makes me nervous. Once you introduce paid items that actually affect gameplay, you have the ability to tweak the game to push people towards favoring those paid items because they’re more convenient than spending all of your play time farming. It doesn’t matter what your intentions are, it’s going to make the player base lose trust in you regardless.
---
My first character I tried to RP as a non-vault dweller. After reaching level 60 and learning tons about a lore, I retcon'd him to being infected by the scorch disease like everyone else and deleted him to reflect this change.
---
This is my second character. (I also have one that runs around in his underwear but I haven't fleshed out that story yet).
---
A Vault 76 resident, selected for his background in genetics and uses of radiation to create controlled mutations for the betterment of mankind. He worked for Wes-Tek developing mutated gene serums in an attempt to eradicate congenital disease as well as a project to lessen the affect of radiation poisoning on people who worked in environments where radiation exposure was a concern and military personal exposed to it.  He was fired for being outspoken about the Super Mutant program he was transferred to as his compassion caused severe guilt over the conditions and treatment of the subjects. He soon after found employment at Vault-Tec preforming medical screenings on potential candidates for different vaults, mainly looking for individuals with specific gene abnormalities. It wasn't research, but it was in his field and it was a paycheck.
---
While in the vault his primary function was of an internal medicine specialist. He'd see other residence who had symptoms with no clear cause. This was typically due to stresses caused by living in the vault, and although he wasn't a therapist, his compassion was usually enough to, at the very least, keep them from going crazy in the vault. His secondary job was to continue his work on radiation and it's effects on humans but he had to do this with only tissue samples as the vault residence could not not put at risk, since there were so few and they meant so much to restarting the new world.
---
When the vault door opened he was amazed at what he saw. The levels of mutation were far beyond anything he could have imagined. Plants, animals, insects; all drastically changed. Never before had there been such a large sample size exposed to such a high level of radiation. He wished the vault wouldn't be resealed or that he could at least be able to take his lab. That wasn't an option, there wasn't enough time. He'd have to make do with what he had and what his CAMP could provide.  
---
The implications of everything made his mind explode with new ideas and theories. Maybe it was the over-stimulation of his past field of work, maybe it was being cooped up in a vault for a couple decades, but something caused him to make the decision to experiment on himself; to expose himself to the radiation in different ways, to mutate himself in ways never thought of using this new world as his template. It was the beginning of his journey to be able to survive in this harsh new environment by adapting, nay, **forcibly evolving** himself to suit it.
---
Ok, I can agree with that.
---
Still greasy, imho. And a disturbing precedent.
---
I would love to see the Responder vendor bot occasionally put the beat down on the Raider vender bot.
---
Or if they would talk trash between each other to get your business.
---
If things don’t work with meeting HonestVaultDweller I can help you with that too. I also have optimized bracers, motion assist servos, targeting HUD and a few others if you’re interested. 
---
It’s a non issue for me so yes I will complain
---
Yeah with heavy guns you can apply those effects far more. I usually carry my syringer down to her hit with it after I get my instigating sneak shot off and for 2 minutes the endangerol effect allows for more dps. Once she’s ready to mutate I fire it again or if need to refresh the effect. 
---
I’m a stealth ahooter so my damage is good but not on here the whole fight. So I can build up adrenaline and switch back once it’s full rinse repeat. 
---
Sounds to me like your build lacks certain perks that would allow your gun to repair itself ie. Luck of the draw. Look I’m not attacking your knowledge or skill in this game, what I do question is how you consider these items pay to win then they are literally available in game for free and purchasable with in game currency. You can claim that someone can purchase way more of these items than you and have a tactically advantage but that to me is a weak argument and I find it to be a nonstarter. Want more repair kits? Kill more legendaries and farm atom points. 
---
It’s fine to have strictly PvP characters but just understand that if you don’t grind a little PvE then you’ll be at a disadvantage against players who do and have improved repair kits. This is not pay to win but rather play to win, the nuisance is there I promise you hopefully you can see it.
---
I use max gunsmith and my guns still break fast.
---
Power armor lasts ages without repair though without wearing Power Patcher.
---
I'll probably try out these new quests thanks.
---
The sad part is that a lot of players see nothing wrong..
---
Despite the lack of human NPCs to tell it, it's a dark, depressing story that offers none of the optimism that Fallout 4 had, and that's one of the reasons why I like it.  You aren't some omniscient god dictating the future of the wasteland.  You are ordinary.  Your actions are often futile.  Others have tried, and they're all dead.
---
I don't think it would be the best choice for someone with limited time, though.  Many stories span across several locations in the world and tying them all together almost requires the kind of thumbtacks-and-thread corkboard that a conspiracy theorist would have.  But that's part of what makes it cool, in my opinion.  You don't have NPCs to stand there and provide exposition and answer your questions.  You're more of an archaeological detective going through notes, terminals and recordings trying to understand what happened.
---
I think the Wastelander DLC sort of hints at NPCs returning.
---
At least that's my $0.02.
---
Should still be coming. The player vender is just delayed. 
---
Never gonna happen. From the beginning the multiplayer mode is about encouraging murder and robbery, they set up more than ten rules just to make sure that happen and aggressors are well protected. That cost them a shitstorm so they had to remove slap kill but that doesn’t change their core value. They will never limit griefers’ ability to enjoy what they do. 
---
Personally, I feel the kits are for not low level but casual players that don’t want to spend 20 minutes at the beginning or end of each session repairing gear. Same with the refrigerators if they do indeed wind up in the atom store. This saves the casual player from having to craft food each session. 
---
WoW never used to be free to play either. Now it is. I can see FO76 becoming free to play just so they can justify the Atom Shop.
---
Agreed they give you free atoms.... also it’s a crappy 100% ...
---
Wow..they have some insane analysts working for them.  I do this sort of thing for a living, not in games,but for a fortune 500 company, and while thats a good approach for finding missing features you would like to develop, it's a pretty horrible methodology for a binary should we or should we not sort of decision.  Lack of professionalism in sentiment analysis really explains a lot of the strange decisions they make.  Probably comes down to their devs making decisions based on the kind of game they want to make, over the kind of game their market wants to play.
---
I will also contact To Catch a Predator I am sure Chris Hansen could use the bottle caps.
---
Which is just crazy to me. 
---
You guys are seriously out of touch lmao.
---
You think the golden gates will open if they put that in the game? How clueless are you?
---
It would create **MORE** hate because people will be outraged over seeing this lore inconsistency and their precious new vegas being desecrated to sell microtransactions in fallout 76.
---
To be honest I'd rather have it delayed than to dump some things I have to sell into a machine only for them to disappear or others find ways to dupe them and crash the market.
---
Sounds like overreacting to me
---
I hope so. I need more foot traffic coming through there for my plans shop!
---
It's different, but I think it's worth every penny.
---
I really prefer the single player experience with NPC's, but 76 still has the vibe that sucks me in.  
---
When someone finally opens the door, yell "Go Away, I'm batin'!".  You'd be surprise how much grief this has saved me before.
---
Long before survival mode, I was being chased around the golf club by a couple of people aiming to kill me.  I ran around a bunch of rooms, dodging as best I could.  Made a loop near a counter and opened a door that led... no where.  Crap... I said screw it, ran in and closed the door.  Didn't take them long to open the door so I just blurted out the line from Idiocracy, "Go Away I'm Batin'!".  These two dudes started cracking up and just left without finishing the job.  One of my highlights in FO76 if I'm honest.
---
If they want their Atomic Shop to take off I concur: Walmart pricing all the way. Walmart makes \*tons\* of money selling name brands in addition to store brand. Same thing here: price the items for our "dolls" (characters) at the $1-$3 range and they'll sell them in vast quantities because "it's only a buck, even I can afford a buck!". 
---
Quantity is a quality all its own. In environments like these the shop has negligible overhead once the item is coded/created. I'd estimate they have 4-5 million active players currently. 
---
Price something at $10 for this, maybe a thousand people buy it. They made $10k, quite possibly losing money in the process. Price that same something at $3, maybe ten thousand buy it, quite possibly a lot more. They made at least $30k almost certainly making a decent-to-significant profit.  Price that same something at $1 maybe a hundred thousand people buy it, making ten times as much as they did at the $10 price point. 
---
$10 is a matinee movie ticket or an fast food meal. $3 is a cup of coffee. $1 is a small candy bar. Guess which ones sell the most on impulse buys, BGS monetization people? \*grin\*
---
Because it isn’t like this industry hasn’t already set hundreds of precedents about why allowing this shit is a bad idea. Sure, it looks like a logical fallacy if you only go by the context of one game. If you go by the context of contemporary gaming as a whole, it isn’t a logical fallacy, it’s a legitimate concern based on previous evidence.
---
They were not. 0,0025% possibilities of drop.
---
I will I'm 7 hours 
---
I have been trying to run a bos character and running t60.  If I could get a bos flag or other stuff I'd spend some atoms!  That or make a heavy BOS paint for ultrucite armour!  Or easier chances for the t60 ones
---
Happiness in the wasteland is a XL Stash Box.
---
I think Blade and Soul would be a great fit for you
---
We have Insult Bot wandering the Wasteland but what we need is a hoarding intervention bot.
---
Well luckily while your opponent is repairing their gun with the baby repair kit they got in the atom shop you can repair your gun even better with one you got in game for FREE. 
---
I hadn't thought of that.  
---
I don't think it's p2w, to me, p2w would be if they released a lvl 100 3* legendary that could only be Purchased with atoms that you paid money for. 
---
To me, I think it's a negligible difference, one that I don't feel motivated enough to fight for or against. I think the idea of repair kits is kinda cool but end of day not something I'd ever see myself personally using but for people who get a ton of free atoms but don't care about cosmetics, it gives them something at least usable to buy that by no means is game breaking. 
---
He'll trigger at the train station in Charleston if you do the thing to get the vendor bot to spawn.
---
Duping should be fixed. But someone will find a way to bring it back. Just make a new character til then.  Market is already tanked. That’s why I sell low. More customers and can I handle my profit. 
---
Unlike the repair kits, you are asking for a p2w system.
---
Yeah.. was just commenting on a post. Multiple people just saying I'm in my little corner wearing my tin foil hat
---
Can't speak to Hunter attribute first hand, but my Zealot Dragon does noticable more health bar damage than my non-Zealot. (I bring them both- they break easily).
---
I don't care about them either way.  Jesus Christ, if I don't want to buy them I won't.  I've been playing the game for this long without them.  If someone else wants to buy them, good for them.
---
If and when the Atomic Shop gets some problematic items in it, I'll reassess.  But I'm not getting worked up about repair kits when junk is so plentiful and free.
---
lol! just wait until they let us decorate our CAMP with odds and ends...THEN you'll see hoarding
---
No it isn't. 
---
Pay to win means buying an item that gives a definitive advantage over other players and it is only purchasable through a store and not earned in game.
---
Repair kits are not pay to win but should not be sold in what is supposed to be a cosmetic only store. 
---
It would kinda have to be a skin, because it wouldn’t make sense in the lore if it was ingame
---
I’m looking for the arm mod that increases the power attacks, is that optimized bracers ?
---
Oh wow. That’s like 1 out of 4000. Jeez
---
EXACTLY! +100000.
---
Bitter comment is unhelpful.
---
I've only been in two since launch
---
That effects gameplay so no. That would be even worse than this lol. How did you think this was a good idea?
---
Thanks for the input. With all the comments here i think i'll grab a copy. Can't wait to play next week.
---
We don’t know the price of these repair kits yet so I find it hard to engage with your statement, but I didn’t gloss over it I actually mentioned how I’m able to grind 300+ caps easily per week, most players can get about 500. 
---
This isn’t a rant on the atomic shop tho it’s addressing how QOL items aren’t P2W. As of now there’s nothing in the atomic shop that interests me although I have bought the blackbird paint and about 10 other items and am sitting on 6k atoms. So if you’re running out of atoms because you’re buying everything in the store then maybe purchasing them isn’t such a bad option? I personally have no need and won’t spend a dime more than the $60 I paid for the game, comfortable knowing that I’m not at a disadvantage to those who do even with QOL items added. 
---
Well... get out of here with your logic!! Lol
---
No you’re right, I hadn’t considered that. 
---
I’m asking for a way to purchase caps, so I can buy weapons and ammo from other players. I also would like to buy stimpaks and rad away, and fast travel all the time. 
---
All this rage over a stepping stone?  I understand worrying if they're given an inch they'll take a mile but a year from now they could be strapped for cash and go straight up full blown pay to win, stepping stone or not. There are few actual guarantees you can count on in life. You guys are overreacting plain and simple. I get it's a reason to be concerned about the future but all this rage? When they start selling more powerful weapons and armor in the atom store and take away our ability to make atoms in game I'll be right there with you.  You guys need to quit overlooking the fact that you can earn atoms in game also.  So no one has access to something you dont.  They can just have more.  Who cares?
---
no workie
---
Its not p2w, its a convenience.
---
Specialize in two major goods. And one minor. I see any decent legendary item in th market here. And the 1* back into the game. 
---
Primary is laser weapons. Second is the above decent gear and. Minor is lead. It might be low numbers but I can pull in 5k a week by not being greedy. 
---
And my ESO banks are chock full of repair kits I'll never use -- I usually sell or give away what isn't bound. If '76 dumps them on me at a similar rate, then fine, but the current line is that they'll drop from the SBQ, which by definition makes it a rare drop. 
---
It decreases the AP for power attacks:
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Optimized_bracers
---
Of course not!  Thanks so much for hard work moderating. It a thankless job most of the time. 
---
They simply don’t get it. If they have twenty skins for pump shotguns, priced at 100-200 atoms each, people will buy a shitload of them. Instead they have one skin and want to sell it for $18 in a bundle. And in order to sell it they made the original in-game version butt-ugly. Whoever is managing the shop needs to get his brain examined. 
---
Now you have.
---
The train stations need to be friendly and not fire zones. 
---
Shooting at someone in Whitesprings should summon a horde of Assaultrons and robo sentries to wipe out the shooter.
---
Trading -w- vendors is a vital piece of this game and needs protection.
---
There also need to be a few more fast travel spots, this map is HUGE!
---
Terminals and holotapes are fine with me. I was really fearing an empty world of crafting and arcade type shooting. You guys reassured me enough to try it out. Will grab a copy for next weekend. 
---
Or just the vault security/swat armor it's based on, plus Marine helmet we're halfway there.

Selling qol items is no better than p2win and it's still breaking their promise of a cosmetic only cash shop.  People are "losing their minds" over small shit because this is how games start the slide into micro transactions required land.  Small items get bigger and bigger, Bethesda is just testing the waters right now.  If a huge fuss isn't made you can be sure they will jump in head first.
---
yes please
---
They can be found in game?
---
Ok well than that's a different story all together.  Guess I just haven't found any yet.
---
The hate is probably all coming from Bethesda saying atomic shop is cosmetic only way back before launch.
---
I actually bought the playtime PA paints and just love how I brutally murder enemies while having in comic sans “Let’s play”
---
Ya.  Drop rate on Rares we’re almost non existent.  And then so many people farmed for them that the 5 commons were so abundant as to be worthless.  So there was no “trading” for the rare masks as Bethesda implied in their explanation for the event drops. 
---
I dont think you understand why this is a huge deal.   
---
The item itself is not game breaking, it's the fact that the atom store will have an item that effects game play. Bethesda stated that it will ONLY have cosmetic items in the store. With this addition, it is now breaking its promise to the players. Are we going to be okay with that? Are you okay with this route? You should not be, we can take this and assume more will follow this.
---
Why bother about other people with other perks (until they make them suck), while you are okay, right?
---
Off to re-watch that Diablo video right now, always makes me chuckle.
---
 "What, you guys have phones, right?" 
---
Well when its too late at least u will be able to buy that special 5day sale of the weapon of ur dreams....
---
Its not the repair kits. Its the bigger problem.
---
Wow your description looks like exactly what i am looking for. Looks like i'll have to free more time to play. I'll be sure to grab a copy. Thanks !
---
I’m gonna need my shit back
---
See the point I was trying to make? 
---
I still play the game and enjoy it. But I want to be loaded with gear. I don’t have time with work and life to sit down and grind for hours. Bethesda can make some good money this way, and bring us more content.
---
[They tease it after they explain what their new repair kits are](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019) 
---
But while I am using mine that I spent my own time and some douche with 10 of them just  running around repairing with no worry while I either have to take the hit and not use mine that I  deserved or waste my only one cause this guy has 10 and doesn't care. I definitely agree with you for obvious reasons but I don't think you're looking at the big picture.
---
For your build bloodied Explosive. 
---
Boo! You stink!
---
Definitely duped. Be careful. 
---
I will try that out then and hope it helps.  
---
On another sidenote, do you know why aiming might be completely broken (as in you can't even ADS at all), when having these lines in the \[Archive\] section:  
---
sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2, SeventySix - 02UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 02UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 02UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - Animations.ba2, SeventySix - ATX\_Main.ba2, SeventySix - ATX\_Textures.ba2, SeventySix - EnlightenExteriors01.ba2, SeventySix - EnlightenExteriors02.ba2, SeventySix - EnlightenInteriors.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedTextures.ba2, SeventySix - Localization.ba2, SeventySix - Materials.ba2, SeventySix - Meshes01.ba2, SeventySix - Meshes02.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - MiscClient.ba2, SeventySix - Shaders.ba2, SeventySix - Sounds01.ba2, SeventySix - Sounds02.ba2, SeventySix - Startup.ba2, SeventySix - Textures01.ba2.

---
Seen a good ammount of people using the "Better Inventory", and wanted to use it myself, but with these extra lines and the BetterInventory.ba2 aiming is completely gone.  
---
Does not matter if the BetterInventory.ba2 is in the sResourceArchive2List or not. :/
---
My builds are two steps further into meta than common understanding of meta is. This might sound like bragging but its just the way it is, people still think assassin-sentinel sets to be viable in PvP when they require stealth boys not to be irrelevant in actual encounters with decently thought opponent characters, and even with stealth boys you can dominate them simply by moving away and forcing them to pursue you, while leaving your own sneaker behind. I might give you a private example of what I'm talking about, write to me privately, my collection of neglected godrolls is big enough I might start sharing my findings to drive the prices up, but I don't want to do it all out as I still can greatly benefit by buying them for caps until people learn their value.
---
Yea man I remember I had 2 days to grind for a rare mask but never got one. I was a little sad. On PS4, I know for sure there was a guy with the clown mask. I think its a rare one but it had to be a clown mask
---
Can't find anything about it. 
---
Creating this kind of a game puts the onus on the **developers**, not their customers, to create sufficiently engaging content of various types, tiers and so forth that they generate a revenue stream. 
---
If 76 isn't making enough money to cover their operational costs plus \[insert profit margin here\] then they have two fundamental options. Step up and own their mistakes while making their cosmetics content legitimately affordable *and* generating new content. Or own their mistake, convert the game to single player and let the modders do what they have so often done before: fix their mess, then make it better.
---
If he had that many serums I’m sure he’ll just dupe more haha. Most players around reddit buy/sell serums on average for 100-200 caps. Still a lot of caps if you start a serum shop!
---
Till next when they announce. Nuka-Black buy from the atom shop and earn 300%... 
---
I just do it to give back. And so I can have fusion cells for my lasers. 
---
That is literally the issue, even from the peoples mouths themselves, you haven't found any yet because they're not available yet but they will be when implemented next week. 
---
Alot of people just auto-assumed it would be locked behind a paywall - it isn't
---
Alot of people think its paying to win - its not because you only repair to 100% durability, losing out on the 50% gear bonus
---
I do get it, because it MAY set an "allowable" precedent for genuine paid items, but i don't see it at all like that when this was a damn community requested feature.
---
And now said community is crying at the potential of paying for it. Forgetting this game is a money pit for Bethesda.
---
You could have this, but then you would also have a game with very few players in it. You can't think of the game in a vacuum. Most players who don't have cash to throw at fake items will leave and find a different game to play. 
---
You missed one, ammo converters.
---
Why did Bethesda not allow us to sell excess ammo to vendors or allow us to break them down into parts in either tinkers or chem bench?
---
Because that wouldn't make players spend atoms in buying a ammo converter 
---
Plot twist: on top of all that, they increase the Bobby pin weight to 1lb / each. 
---
Lol, that would be cool.
---
No. If its not cosmetic it shouldn’t go in the atom shop.
---
The bigger problem which does not exist.
---
If and when it exists, I'll worry about it then.  Repair Kits do not rise to that level for me.
---
Caps can be obtained by just playing the game.
---
Buying them with Atoms clearly is not p2w. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I make you some then :D
---
Drama queen.
---
Yea but it turns into a pay to win system. 
---
(level 17, second character) I modeled my dweller off of Frank from always sunny. He was a wealthy business man before the war working to frack the mountains of applachia. He bought his way into the vault. While living in the vault he grew anxious and paranoid that lead to heavy drinking upon leaving the vault he drank to much radioactive water and it damaged his already shaky mind. he is slowing going insane and things are taking a dark turn as he travels the waste land 
---
He is a pistol build but carries a (toe) knife lol
---
PS I wish we could name weapons 
---
And then its too late. 
---
Bethseda already broke their word. 
---
How would it effect game play? Well i guess it could damage your floors they can add reinforced  floors to the Atom Shop to support all that weight. Do you use your Stash Box in PVP ? 
---
This might be the end of Fo76...
---
YES YES YES
---
I really believe this is what is going to happen, time passing
---
Yes, when it's a cosmetic CAMP item. If it has any other in-game utility then no.
---
Awesome thank you! I use the Reddit is fun app. I know there are all kinds of new apps for Reddit now, but I've used it forever. I will check out boost.
---
Haha wow, such fantasies. Why not wait until something is released before complaining. So much hysteria over something that nobody on here knows exactly how it will work. Patience is a virtue young one.
---
I’m happy to discuss this privately as I’m not here to try to disprove how meta your build is, we just fundamentally disagree on the definition of pay to win it seems. That’s alright tho, the great thing about this community is that we can have disagreements but it’s only because we all love this game equally and want to see it succeed. Some have different ideas on how that success can be achieved but at the end of the day with support and input from the community, this can be one of the greatest games and I truly believe that. 
---
Bit it puts a smile on my face :D
---
no longer do I have 'kids' all grown up.its not the mic tho,its the phones.the level of audio detail is way up there.should a rabbit fart - you can hear that - and from exactly where from.total emersion. I think,the emotes kind of break that bubble.
---
on the other hand , chating with someone from Arizona or france,well,that aint to bad either.cheers
---
The challenges for some refresh actually. 
---
&gt; Only the laziest player would ever pay actual money for one of these.
---
Like all those losers who bought TSE junk...
---
You're right i noted the fermenter is a beta version of the display(it even have the "display" button).it's also a bad system since it counts everything as 1 weight unit,even if a bottle weight much less in the stash or on you.
---
 I have about 100 pound of space in the stash but i cannot pour all my aid in it. 
---
It's gonna be tough to arrange everything.
---
Bath tub full of pre war money I can't wait.
---
Been playing games for years and already been down this road.
---
**cough** ESO **cough** they have a history
---
instead of adding these things to the atom shop, they should be introducing more end game events/bosses where theres a chance of dropping the plans/materials for this stuff, so we have new content that keeps us playing and that keeps us checking the atom chop for cosmetics
---
adding non cosmetics to the shop wont keep end game players playing when theres nothing to do and only sets bad blood
---
Other than bloodied, instigating or anti-armor
---
Lol. So you want a bloodied 3* handmade or something similar. Current value is 30000 caps. Have fun spending $300 in real money on a digital asset that will get nerfed next month and forgotten about completely in a year or 2. Or do you want a sent assassin set. $800 and it's yours. 
---
Stop being rediculous.
---
Gets downvoted for explaining to a kid that not all of us get to play 5+ hours a day ...
---
Thank god they are trying to make the game less annoying for us casuals 
---
Martha Higgins was the daughter of a poor mining family from Beckley who was accepted into Vault 76 as something of a child prodigy. The mining strikes and near-warfare of the Ash Heap region rendered her a quiet and serious girl, and she resented her older sister (my Fallout 4 character) for leaving to follow her dreams at college up north while she and their parents struggled in an increasingly automated Appalachia. Martha kept to herself as she grew up inside the Vault, studying hard and learning as many practical skills as she could to make herself as useful as possible come Reclamation Day.
---
Twenty-some-odd years later, Martha is a very smart woman who possesses the know-how and the will needed to rebuild Appalachia, but is also so reserved and socially awkward that she comes off as stony and unpleasant despite all she does to help her fellow survivors. This translates to a high Intelligence, middling Strength, Endurance, Agility, and low Charisma build with lots of utility perks equipped. Her tools of choice are high-tech weapons like the Gauss Rifle, Tesla Gun and Power Fist as well as Garrahan Excavator suit that she’s been refurbishing.
---
The state of Appalachia in general after the Great War is more or less as bad as Martha feared it would be, though the existence of the Scorched and of Cryptids cane as extremely unpleasant surprises. After learning of the Responders, all the good they’d done and their tragic end, she took up their work and their colors and continues to offer whatever aid and assistance she can to the survivors she comes across. To these ends she’s opened up a safe house in the Mire (which will include a shop once player-vending is introduced) and attempts to repair or upgrade whatever broken infrastructure she comes across.
---
I have two other character but this is a LOT or text and don’t want to bore everyone with more.
---
Log in and form your own opinion. 
---
I don't have an issue with people spending money, but in your original comment, you seem to be assuming everyone has a boatload of atoms because they have the time to grind like you do. That's what I was talking about. My biggest issue with the fact that it's a super shitty business move to say you will ONLY put cosmetic items in a game and then as soon as you have a small amount of good will, just to suck as much money as you possibly can out of casual players.  
---
In my personal opinion, its beyond me why anyone would need repair kits, considering in my grind to lvl 95 have never once needed something like that. I would say I'm the "average" player. I don't play a ton, but I'm also not a try hard. This seems like something that was mentioned once or twice, and they swarmed on it like hungry cash grabbing sharks. 
---
"not cosmetic" is only a point if you are draconian or only care about a company changing policy to survive.
---
Your second point is moot as this game is a survival game, if you aren't collecting junk, you are hardly playing.
---
player vending prob isn't ready yet. 
---
Here’s the thing you have to have investors like myself who is willing to buy fake things with real money. Then I take my purchased caps and spend it on items that other players crafted or retrieved by playing the games. 
---
I prefer bloodied fire rate. Fire rate is not nerfed in pvp is and is not negated by perks and arnor mods. 
---
Why not settle for URanus_Hammer
---
People will complain because at some point they fell in love with Fallout and want the best for the series and to a certain extend it's healthy to show Bethesda what they can and can not do with the series. Bit you are right. If this game causes unhealthy nerd rage just quit and move on. Play the old games or play something different. We live in a time where we can drown in new quality games. I made the mistake and bought Minecraft on Switch and Yoshi's crafted world last week and now I am struggling because I cant decide what I play.
---
It would still be pay to win if you can buy the currency buddddy
---
Currently available information would indicate that 76 hasn't come *close* to outselling FO4. 76 is probably doing *relatively* well. 
---
The repair kits et al are not a big act of desperation. They are testing the waters to see how their customers respond to a relatively minor in-game item, a type of "stimpak" as it were, being available for purchase. Based on their social media feeds they're getting feedback before implementation. Depending on how they price these single-use basic repair kits ... and my guess is going to be "vastly overpriced" ... 
---
The DMV quests were quite good
---
Right? Fanboys against any criticism and then the worst trolls on the planet once they realize servers aren't free.
---
Don't forget the mod shop they tried to set up for Skyrim. Making money off of others' hard work? Christ... 
---
Nooooo, the unstoppables test literally led us here. It's *already* getting worse
---
You don't need a fridge if your a cannibal 
---
Teddy bears will be more valuable than TSE weapons I predict
---
you see how they also said about bringing refrigerators, ammo converters, as well as a method to send scrap to your STASH without heading home? what if they also added that to the -COSMETIC ONLY- store? 
---
Well not much has been said on it's steam release, but on Twitter they said all physical editions of the game will still come packaged with a code for the Bethesda launcher(and that the code can't be used on steam), so most likely if you want to buy it for steam (when it does comes out on steam, no official date yet), you'll need to buy it off the steam store page.
---
yeah but it's true, some people actually do want to discuss more than one topic. and reddit karma system is ripe for this sort of thing. 
---
Except they are not "winning",  any more than those lazy bastards who paid caps or cash to buy TSE weapons or Ass scented armor are "winning", they're just taking shortcuts in a game where half the fun is admiring the scenery.
---
Even after the nerf, i'll take any TS or TSE. But I have a AA gauss rifle for those sneak shots. 
---
They said no. Repair kits instead 
---
i agree!  I think they should fix all the glaring issues with bugs and server instability before they start to push more and more ATOM store stuff on us
---
I’d like it but just you saying that is going to send some of these people into a rage induced frenzy. If you’ve ever played Path of Exile I’ve always been a fan of how they do their shop. It’s all cosmetics for your character, cosmetic effects to make your skills look different, and stash space. 
---
jeffrey dahmer did...
---
you dont even want to know how many finger sandwiches he had in there
---
BOS and deep pockets. I bought the pockets plan.
---
In my opinion I don't think they could have gotten the game to even run properly at all with numerous NPCs at quest hubs with 24 players.
---
If your opponent is using a TSE weapon then he's dead anyway, who cares whether his weapon breaks or not?
---
This is two orders of magnitude more complicated than it appears initially and there is no such thing as best possible legendary combination.
---
Please also note that with last patch combat viability of many items have increased a lot, and even craftable weapons can now kill a godbuild, if used properly.
---
Currently, the odds seem to favour Bloodied weapons in sneak based build, but I recently met a super tough son of a bitch sneaker that definitely did not use bloodied weapon as he ran on full hp. He also used long distance energy weapons and he rocked hard using them.
---
Basically, it doesn't mean what answer you will get, this answer is wrong because this question cannot be answered. Bloodied explosive will give you the greatest possible damage output, but there is dense chest mod, there is fireproof perk, and there are enemies which will get more damage by non-explosive weapons, and to fight people that use them (i.e. the extreme majority), it might be better to skip explosive damage. 
---
Also, new tier of items arises right now. They were considered crap and sold to vendors when duping was rampant.
---
The best advice I could give you when it comes to weapon selection is to gang up. Find friends with good characters and PvP builds. Try to kill your friends. Learn what works against who and what doesnt. I spent tens of thousands of bullets shooting my friends to learn how to kill them. Trade a lot and test what actually works.
---
Alright. Im going to wait for that then
---
Okay yes, thanks !
---
He throws his stash box at players attacking his base. 
---
I'm totally sending you a secret right now for what you said.
---
We'll pass your concern on to the developers. 
---
Fell better now?
---
they mention a refrigerator, ammo converter, and a way to send your scrap to your STASH without "heading home". 
---
So I'm probably going to catch hell for this, but am I the only one who thinks this whole thing is getting a little overblown? Unless I read this wrong (which is a possibility), what Bethesda is offering to sell us in the Atom Store is a player convenience item. How exactly is this "pay to win"?
---
They are not offering an overpowered weapon or something that gives you double health. Sure, they originally said "cosmetics only", but are they now allowed to evolve the idea of the Atom Store during the life of the game?
---
And no, I don't work for Bethesda. 
---
Nice! My kids are still small and just hoping they'll be proper adults... Long way to go, until then I keep working hard for them. (and play FO76 while they are asleep.)
---
Go to Camden park defeat everyone and sell their weapons it is not rocket science 
---
Right , we all know the game was like 75% off release date price 2 weeks after release . They probably need some money . I’m far and away happier with them bringing in revenue with rl money convenience items than idk , a subscription 
---
Totally cool with Camp and other new (cosmetic) content being added to the atom store but I think we should still get some stuff added as free dlc. 
---
But yes desperately need new hair. I want to make an actual attractive female. Also new stairs.  And yes all fallout 4 furniture and assets because tbh it’s lazy that they weren’t launched with the game when they’ve already used fallout 4 assets to build the map. 
---
Cant work
---
Even buying them to buy weapons in game
---
the problem is, with easy caps, people will buy stuff from vendors, buy all the plans, mods, you name it. Not just buying from players like you intend.
---
Youll have some gear, and theyll be insanely kitted out.
---
Not to mention theyll buy crazy modded items from other players, with ease
---
And itll drive the value of caps down farther
---
Game dies.
---
Just play with the time ya got, sell everything you pick up, get the trader perks too for better prices
---
Youd be amazed at how many meds you can find and what they can sell for in bulk
---
People have an issue that allowing even a repair kit plan would lead to even bigger things being sold in the store.  Such as armor and weapons.
---
I don't believe repair kits are pay to win but the store is supposed to be cosmetic only.
---
uh, really?  Who wastes points in int?
---
There are at least a dozen posts on Reddit for serums for 100 caps and they’ve been dropping in price big time. 
---
Have a sale on them, 2 for 100.
---
Read my response below about investing. I respect you opinion though.
---
Sentinel+assassins.  
---
The multiplayer aspect helps with this..play on a team 
---
I’ve had this happen a few times plus no VATS when they’re within arms reach.
---
I’m using anti-armor/furious a lot these days. For your build though it sounds like you want a bloodied. 🙂
---
Perk cards such as white knight were randomly nerfed a couple patches ago and then this came out so... and with the introduction of dungeons, I think it's all heavily schemed so that you'd get cornered in a dungeon, broken weapons/armour and need to buy a repair kit.
---
And the in-game repair kits are for ludicrously hard events such as the SBQ, so it'll be a very very rare item, and most likely (this is a guess, don't take it fully but do keep in mind) a random drop. These kits will surely not drop for events like Forbidden Knowledge or other normal events/quests, because if they did it would hurt the sales of the ones in the atomic shop, even tho the shop should be cosmetic only as they promised...
---
I dont mind the idea of that if they do it like they did with the ferminting quest. Make it free for a month then sell it
---
Yep exactly 
---
I mean the post literally says it will be *unlockable* in the atom shop. That makes it sound like a plan you learn and can then craft anytime after, no? If this is true and the price is like \~300 atoms for the plan, I dont have a problem. I will have a problem if this is a gateway item to add more items to the atom shop that will actually affect gameplay/non-cosmetic. This to me just seems like a QoL item.
---
He only drops a portion of what he has which means he had a ton
---
Definitely. Don't plan on selling them for stupid prices. No point.
---
Remember first seeing a serum and being awe struck at the price, 5000caps, 25k for a recipe lol. 
---
I suspect the no VATS is some Chameleon exploit (they ARE visible, no sneak).
---
Ok I’m just getting caught up on Survival. These are armor mod builds?
---
this is a joke post right???
---
Hmm
---
   Ok thanks
---
Call it riot armor though, and put it in police stations. 
---
No I just implied that obtaining atoms in game by completing daily and weekly challenges is fairly routine, and it is. I collect 300 atoms through no real deviation from my normal gameplay, if I wanted to devote an extra hour a week then I could get 500+ atoms a week easily. 
---
I understand people’s backlash over the “only cosmetic items” statements and subsequent backtracking. But if QOL items are going to be a part of the atom store, which it appears as though thy will be no matter the outrage presented by the community, then should we consider those items P2W? IMO they are not P2W as they do not provide a clear benefit that can’t be achieved by playing the game without purchasing. I understand your concern tho and I’ll be the first to call Bethesda out if they cross that line, but it’s obvious their business model is not working and if QOL items allow them to create bigger and better future updates then I’m ok with that so long as they’re not P2W.
---
Food left out for decades is OK until you pick it up then it spoils in less than 45 minutes...lol
---
Yeah they’ve been getting cheaper and cheaper. The last time I tried to buy a couple they were just given to me. 
---
I'm sure he will enjoy it more than you.
---
Yet another one unable to read. Repair kits can and are earned in game through events and the SBQ kills.
---
It is not locked behind a "paywall" (even though you can earn those Atoms FREE)
---
It is not Pay to win when you can only repair items to 100% condition.
---
Sometimes I replay the Overseer tapes for that one and for McClintock just to get a giggle. 
---
Yeh he left server straight after lol. 
---
I have crippling depression, to the point that this game at launch pushed my suicidal tendencies. I haven’t touched it since Unstoppables and despite a promising DLC future I might not be playing it again
---
What middle ground? Bethseda point blank said the atom shop was for cosmetic items only.
---
If Bethseda follows through on this plan, they r literally telling all loyal fans, we dont give a duck.
---
The folks okay with this are either trolls, idiots, or the folks already pulling out their cards.
---
Sorry, I'm drawn to serious topics, at which point I meme.
---
CAN WE WAIT UNTIL WE SEE HOW IT IS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED BEFORE DEMANDING EVERYONE'S HEADS ON A STAKE
---
Jesus christ reddit.
---
ha! yeah ive also wondered about that !! its like, do i smell that bad its spoiling my food?!?!!? i need a shower stat!
---
Karma farming is disgusting
---
I usually give them away if someone’s asking and I made some extras. I usually make extra to lower my stash of junk or I farm too much junk or flux. 
---
What if they plan to take out most benches in Appalachia and give the base repair kit plan for free through the atom store so that everyone can have the plan? If they needed to trim down the game to add npc's this could work. It should be free or not at all. Not just free for a time frame but permanent. This would also give a choice to players that want to limit themselves to more difficulty. Just my thought....
---
Exactly. Users cost the same to maintain whether they paid full price or 25%. 
---
Like you said, Ranger Armor is a very popular mod for FO4. And in general I’d say if you want to sell stuff in the Atom Shop look at the popular armor and clothing mods for previous titles. There is, to a certain extent, a gap between how the folks at Bethesda and players feel equipment in the game should look and to sell cosmetics there has to at least be a compromise between those aesthetics.
---
Their current business model isn't working because like I said earlier, They rarely release anything anyone actually wants. They claim to care about what the community wants, but they either dont whatsoever, or are completely delusional.
---
I'm not an idiot, I'm not a troll, and I want to see this game survive far into the future, not just survive, but improve and fulfill its potential. To me, this really ain't shit. 
---
They are legendary armor prefixes that give -15% damage and -8% from players.  Together adds up to a ton of direct damage reduction.  
---
How about lowering the atom shop prices too while we're at it
---
That Diablo disaster was so much more out  of touch than this. Not  defending Bethesda or their profound corporate stupidity and evilness, but Blizzard lost the plot so long ago it's funny. Evil Activision makes record profits, Satan Kotick fires 100s of devs.
---
Bioware now  too is a joke, just another sweatshop to enrich EA execs. The garbage clown they brought in from Disney is suspect number  one  in blatantly exploiting workers while producing a shit game, but he  will get a golden parachute and another six-figure job because rich people.
---
Go Epic, I guess? Hard to find  good-guy game companies above the indie ranks.
---
Would it be possible to keep this thread up until we get an actual response. Like many have said, if we let it die off in a few days most people may forget or choose not to care.
---
In future,( please god no more fuck ups Todd) if the general consensus of the sub is debating a controversial topic the Devs have brought up, could we get a stickied thread, that way people could see it's a clear issue everyone agrees on, without having constant new posts about the same thing
---
Yes yes yes. This, and other beloved outfits like it would absolutely make them some real money.
---
Personally would love to see the pint sized slasher mask, and the grifters fit outfit too. Though that’s probably a long shot.
---
Eulogy Jones suit (or a variation)
---
Mechanist Armor 
---
Trapper Lobster Helmet
---
Just a few items I’d love to see 
---
I don’t know if I am the only one but I was thinking the Enclave Power armor skin from FO3 would be dope to put in the shop.
---
Hideously expensive actually, since you get them for free by doing a few power-up quests.
---
What materials are super rare. 
---
Don't blame youtube for this one. This is Bethesda dropping the ball. They called stated that the Atom Shop will have Cosmetics only. The point being behind that, if you liked some of the cosmetics you could buy them to bring even more customization to your character. You could earn Atoms in game so you could save up eventually for what you wanted though. That idea was great. **The way they said it made it seem that their stance was against using money to change gameplay.** I am not going to argue here on Repair kits being good or not. that is not the point. We are allowing Bethesda to get away with their promise for the store to be cosmetic only. there is no reason at all these items cant exist without the store. Bethesda is literally, by accident or not, making these features seem ideal to have by nerfing condition and perks that relate to it. This is not okay period. If you don't understand the reason for the current rage, then im not sure what else to say. You don't seem to care what the company promises or not. 
---
I know right! I think most is 200 caps a piece. If you have them all make a try out bag to sell and then they can buy the ones they like. 
---
Some aren’t great depending on your build.
---
Anything faction related from wall ornaments to stash boxes and beds/chairs
---
Thrones 
---
Anything Gold plated from gun skins to toilets
---
Hidden rooms maybe even a basement crafting option
---
More Vault Boy stuff posters etc., 
---
Bobble head display stands 
---
power armor display stands 
---
For fucks sake literally ANY display stand
---
the ability to craft taxidermied creatures from the Wasteland that you have killed
---
heads on pikes
---
Fences
---
Prefilled bathtubs of pre-war money or nuka cola (decorative only)
---
New turret skins turrets work the same but look way cooler. Or have them look like nerf guns maybe have them shoot baseballs or sometging else IDK
---
Masks (already popular)
---
New halloween costumes
---
Anything nuka-cola related
---
Anything alchohol related like funny vintage beer and wine ads. Or even serious ones or anti-drinking and chem PSA posters
---
Playable board games and pool tables with ability to bet on the games. (Also could lead to PvP if you lose)
---
Pip boy skins/costumes that change the appearance of the pip boy. Make it look like a shield or like a shark is biting your arm.
---
Broken down Cortegas to use as lawn ornaments.
---
Lawn mowers (also for decoration)
---
Lawns to mow maybe a floor skin that looks like a well taken care of lawn. This would also cut down on congestion at WS
---
Seriously these are ALL things that have been asked for on reddit at some point or another. If they want to make $$$$ just read the suggestions on here once in a while these are all cosmetic items not even close to being controversial.
---
inb4 bethesda apologists
---
I still do not get a fixed group My 4 friends only played the first 2 days 
---
What's your weapons? Are you using Fix It Good? Do you go on any supply runs?
---
Gotcha so going back on their word is meaningless.
---
And if u dont see where this is going then sorry but I put u in the idiot category. 
---
If Bethseda wants to add things to the atom shop, they have years of cosmetics from all the other games to choose from. Plenty of things people want to buy and see in the game.
---
I don't really have a good answer for what they could offer PvP'ers, except to say that I'd like to believe that CAMP builders and RP'ers would be enough of a market to keep it afloat.
---
It's hard to say.  Back when they released the 100 days roadmap, I'll admit I was surprised that all this free content was coming.  I was convinced that Bethesda would write off 76 as a loss and re-launch it down the road, if only to get away from its obligations (cosmetics only, all DLC free).  But they didn't.  Even Wastelanders would actually be free and they deserve respect for that.  But in doing so, it seems like they must have considered how profitable the existing Atomic Shop was and whether or not they needed to go down this road.
---
That's why this comes across as a surprise.  Why is this even a thing?  I thought everything was fine.
---
You, you are overreacting still. 
---
I agree tho that they need to release better content I the atomic shop and I’ve been saying it for a while, hopefully someone’s listening to the player base because while QOL items may be profitable in the short term I don’t know that they’re a good tool for a sustainable economy and player trust all things considered, thanks for your input tho I truly do value it.
---
that isnt the issue. Regardless if you can get these items in game without purchasing isnt the point. Atom Shop is supposed to be strictly Cosmetics. Go read every interview regarding this and you'll see that the answer was all the same. Cosmetics only, no game play changing features/items will be in the shop. With the addition of Repair kits, we run the risk of adding refrigerators/ammo converters and much more things the community has wanted. That is the part that is getting the hate and it's justified. how is it not?
---
Why, almost everyone here has fo76 already, and those who don’t don’t number anywhere close to 1,000?
---
I agree completely 
---
Lol
---
I  bought a nuke-proof Pulowski IN THE ATOM SHOP!
---
It's  totally worth it to pay $5 in a videogame  for a nukeproof Pulowski shelter because  that's  not really a microtransaction it's  not, i mean it's not like the owner  of  Bethesda  Games was banned  from the banking industry for being a greedy fuck.
---
While the repair kits is a questionable decision, I doubt they would add refrigerators as atom only purchases. If that was the case why would the have given us the Nuka shine benches. Doesn't seem like their intent, but obviously you never know.
---
Just to get my voice potentially heard, since I feel this issue matters;
---
I strongly dislike the idea of selling anything in the ATOM shop that affects gameplay directly.  These repair kits qualify.  That kind of business model makes sense for a free-to-play game that needs to monetize SOMETHING, but I paid full price up front for Fallout 76.  As did many others.  With the promise that future content would be free.  This is future content.  That isn't free.  That's a broken promise, and that matters, if this goes live as expected.
---
I don't think the repair kits THEMSELVES are that big a deal; this is about principle.  I don't have repair costs that I can't already meet with materials I get without farming directly, even ballistic fiber I have an overstock of.  Maybe some other players do, maybe they don't want to spend perk points on things to extend weapon/armor longetivity.  That Improved Repair Kits will apparently drop from events/boss type mobs makes it even less of a likely problem, in this specific case.   
---
 Regardless, it's an in-game benefit, and creates a pattern that can be followed by subsequent releases.  
---
It's that pattern, and the broken promise, which is what people are angry about.  Not the repair kits themselves, as a mechanic.  So please, Bethesda, don't mistake the outcry.  Repair kits are fine.  PAYING ATOM for repair kits is not-fine. 
---
I fucking love the red stove that they put out, they need to keep doing immersive shit like that 
---
Ad Victorium  RIP DeSilva as well
---
Yeah.... as other people have said, weapon skins and more camp items. Weapon skins should be damned easy. But some reason we aren't getting them. I've been waiting for more and better selection. So far I've purchased the only two that are for guns I like using.  Hell, some one else pointed out clean walls... how about being able to make nice looking camps, not just shambles. Just cause the rest of the area is in shambles doesn't mean the areas that are new and built up should be also in shambles. Hell, they are new, being upkept by living people, they should look in better condition! Hell, I'd pay for that nuka cola lamp (well not now since you are introducing non cosmetic MTs, you crossed the line where I will refuse to pay a dime for your MTs).
---
Well that's a sure fire way to get down votes. 
---
That may be true, I never asked for a repair kit personally, I think its convenient though, but, nobody told them to put it in the Atom Store lol
---
I wanted that too tbh, but during development people were ranting about how it was just gonna be a shitty battlefield remake. Now everyone says it should of been that. It's not an amazing game  but its an amazing star wars experience
---
I understand the outrage, but at the same time the secondary market for this game has always been Pay to win. I see no difference between the TSE/sentinal 25k cap markets and this new p2w accusation. Kids have been paying real money to beef up their characters for some time. And even if they don't, those caps are going on eBay to generate real world money. We're talking about an item that cuts off gameplay motivation at the head; it's purely designed for players who want to fight, but not worry about junk. Frankly with weapon condition perks and all the condition oriented changes that have occurred in the last patch idk who even wants repair kits or sees them as over powered. TLDR; I can spend $20 on screws right now if I want to, and P2W aspects have always been in this game 
---
Where's the recipe though?
---
😂😂😂
---
OP, forgive me but I must tell this person some **facts** (Also damn beautiful post)
---
Advanced repair kits are unlocked within ludicrously hard events may I say, so doing a quest/event like Forbidden Knowledge or Uranium Fever will not give a Repair kit, that would harm the sales of the atomic shop ones.
---
Also it is p2w, it makes life easier, giving an advantage over others who don't buy them or who can't.
---
And with atoms, people grind with em, so why is grinding for junk so much more of an effort? I mean you'll find more looking for the junk. (Weapon damage and armour damage threshold scale with its durability but thats whole other topic, but repair kits affect that)
---
Also I'm pretty sure the one who can't see, Atomic shop was pitched and promised as a "Cosmetic only", I don't think an aid kit is cosmetic dare I say.
---
Also yo OP, beautiful beautiful post, and when this all blows over and Bethesda don't try it, I hope you'll find the will to play this game again! But I'm guessing this ain't the time, maybe when Nuclear winter/Wastelanders releases it may be worth another shot, eh?
---
(Also maybe sorry if this may start a argument in your thread, don't mean it hehe)
---
Somewhere Snoop Dogg cried
---
And No Mans Sky developers went around saying there was PvP from day one when there wasn't. Your point is?
---
ALOT of companies state what isn't. Heck have you NEVER seen a Todd Howard interview before? Or 90% of interviews for that matter?
---
Also, can you literally give me ONE statement where they implicitly stated the atom store would be COSMETIC only? 
---
God yes. I'd also really like the option of having my non-power armor visible over my outfit without having to run around in my undies. 
---
Spot on.
---
No worries. It’s one downvote. *shrug* 
---
Internet points =/= validity of opinion. The whole point of this thread is to convey said opinions in hopes of it meaning something in the bigger picture. Maybe Bethesda will take our thoughts to heart. Maybe not. 
---
Then it’s a difference of definition.  By your standard beth could sell level xo1 power armor and tse gatlin guns for cash and that isn’t pay to win because those are items available in the game.  Many would disagree with you.
---
Buttressed ass armor is the best armor.
---
Exactly. Most of these assets people want already exist. Itd be super easy to port the ones from 4 over and I'm sure making the older textures a bit higher def and modifying the meshes to be higher poly wouldn't take that much work. 
---
I spent money on a lot of things in the atom shop but i never bought those outfits cause they looked dumb. Didn't care about 15hp. Repair kits? Don't really see the point- repairs aren't hard to manage. I usually repair things before they break every couple of days. I think your just looking to feel apart of something and online rage is easier than actually supporting a cause that matters. I will keep buying stuff in the story shop but i probably won't get a repair kit
---
You are the Darkness....
---
I honestly couldn't care less if mod support comes. Every Fallout game doesn't need it.
---
If you're doing an event and some one else is as well, you can't hurt them or lock on in vats. As soon as the event ends you can attack each other.
---
Of course the refrigerators will be in the Atom Store.
---
It's quite obvious at this point.
---
I think more people are upset is that the Atomic shop was promised to be cosmetic only when this game was announced, alongside at Bethesda Days saying that this game "Did very well", so it leads to the question with whats up with this and many (and I) are against it because it can may lead to a slippery slope of "small" things being added that do impact on gameplay.
---
Then you are part of the problem. you are giving them incentive to make food spoil so quick it's not a fun mechanic anymore because people liek you will give them money for a fridge to make it stop. This is exactly why people don't want to see a fridge in the atom store (no one is asking them not to make a fridge item, they are asking not to make it available on the atom store because then they can make game design in a bad way for gameplay to convince you to pay to fix the problems).
---
If you love something, you criticize it.
---
&gt; **but lets all remember, we are ALL fans of Fallout,** 
---
No we aren't. Not anymore.  And something like this latest atom shop item   couldn't do this by itself.   It's  matter of continually testing the player base's patience and everyone having their limit. There's people who wanted to give this game a chance, went out of their way to give it every chance they could but over time little  things have added up. The mole hill grew into a mountain. For many people, this  latest atomic shop thing was the last straw. 
---
Many of us hated the idea of  a Fallout multiplayer, but wanted to give the game a chance. So we gave it a chance. And then a second chance,  third chance and a fourth chance.   And now, many of us are at the end of our rope. 
---
You can't get TO the building without Marsupial. There's a certain verticality to this game that makes finding unique CAMP spots fun. It actually might be a fun experiment to see how many people actually traverse the ground where my CAMP is.
---
By Jove it works!
---
Don't ruin the only good post on the sub right now with this bullshit.
---
Agreed. I see it being as simple as making it an in-game craftable, one you can trade, sell, whatever. If a lot of people hadn’t been so vocal about wanting this specific item, it wouldn’t be an atom shop item. End of story imo.
---
definitely happened to me outside of events. i dont really try to pvp during the events actually
---
The problem isn't that you have to pay for them, that's not what we are pissed about. The problem is that you \*CAN\* pay for them. Meaning that this gives Bethesda incentive to start rebalancing the game in a bad way in order to convince people they need to pay for them to make the game more fun (i.e. fix the bad game balancing by paying).
---
It’s more that they said it was coming to be honest.
---
Aside from that I have a large group of friends that is waiting for private servers and mod support before playing.
---
Also, of all fallout games that could benefit from modders fixing things, it’s this one.
---
As long as it’s not another alcohol challenge, sure.
---
Yep it's pay to win when you DO NO NEED TO PAY TO USE IT.
---
Rest of the post is completely pointless, and over-worded to try an give yourself a more credible comment.
---
Sorry but no, it was NEVER implicitly stated the Atom store was cosmetic only. It was heavily IMPLIED but not implicitly stated. So if anything people are once again, jumping to conclusions, and the stark reality upsets them.
---
Gotta have atleast 5 int for makeshift warrior / gunsmith. And then you just swap it for weapon artisan whenever you're repairing. Other than those 5 points, nah dont need int.
---
The problem isn't that you have to pay for them, that's not what we are  pissed about. The problem is that you \*CAN\* pay for them.

---
from Pete H himself: "We have microtransactions in Fallout 76. But, they’re only cosmetic."
---
Karma thirsty. 
---
I would really really love (and would pay for) Kellogg's Outfit from Fallout 4. I wore that thing all the time even though it had poor armor stats. It just looked awesome on any character.
---
Mods will have to be on a tight leash because this is a multi-player game.
---
Mods should never be allowed to be loaded in Survival as that is the core PvP play zone and mods can provide a competitive advantage to users.
---
Because camping a spawn spot and farm people for caps and supplies is way easier than hunting down super mutants. The pvp mode is pure garbage because it uses players’ assets as incentive. It’s not about skill or tactics just straight up repeat murder for virtual assets. Buy a set of duped magic armor and stand still and you’re good to go. There hasn’t been a dumber shooting game in history. 
---
The first thing they say is " Basic Repair Kits are single-use consumables ". The second thing they say is " Basic Repair Kits will be unlockable in the Atomic Shop using Atoms ". The first eliminates they are 'unlocked' as a plan. They're stimpaks for gear. My guess is they'll launch at 300 atoms per single-use repair kit. 
---
The concern has not been the nature of the specific item. It is 
---
(a) that implementing them starts the snowball rolling downhill towards more and more Atomic Shop goodies that have greater and broader in-game effects; and 
---
(b) that they will have flat-out broken their on-record word that ***no*** items other than cosmetic items would be acquired via the Atomic Shop.
---
 I had this issue too!
---
i have the exact same problem
---
Im definitely in the minority not seeing the  correlation between convince and p2win.
---
I dont get all the fuss. 
---
A repair kit that saves me a trip to a work bench...that i might not even use. Very few times have i failed to repair my weapons prior to a queen fight, and honestly thats the only thing that might be worth carrying one around. And without it, i have other weapons. Lol we also dont know if its an instant  fix or something that takes a few seconds... so its probably not even a viable pvp option....i also dont think if it is an instant,  that this will be the breaking point that saves me mid one shot.
---
Besides we dont even know how many atoms there going to cost... Bethesda has been pretty reasonable with the atom store of late,  and if you dont have atoms and dont want to buy atoms,  grind for them.  Im sick of all these kids crying foul and championing these fake out rages.
---
I agree.  I don't think reasonable people expect to play FO76 forever. Do you think they do? I expect them to complete the development they should have done for launch, but I'm not expecting a subscription-level of content off an upfront-purchase model. Cosmetic purchases should be enough to develop minimal content. 
---
I think they would sell more cosmetics if people felt like the game was trustworthy and stable. Of course, I cannot see their financials, so I'm assuming based upon peer purchases, which may be a poor proxy. 
---
I assumed mods would only be allowed in private servers, which hopefully mitigates all that.
---
"We have" not "will have"
---
Emphasis on the present-tense wording.
---
Yes I understand that this is going back on their word of only cosmetics. But this isnt anything. Nothing has happened. People dont know how it will work. Just the idea of something non cosmetic being purchasable feels wrong but we just dont know yet. 
---
People here act like they know the direction a company is wanting to go. I think this is a good descion. People already find the smallest thing to shit on their game about so they just ignore most things. Like the Bobby pin thing. That shit was so small but people acted like it was the end of the world. 
---
How are you supposed to trust a community that gets the same amount of upset over bobby pins accidentally weighing too much after a patch. (Hell someone sent the CEO a box of bobby pins thinking he was being clever.) That shit was stupid as fuck and just childish. Like saying I never forget about your mistakes small or big and I'm not going to recognize the successful things in your game. 
---
People ask for so much from this game when it has a lot. And when they finally get what they want they ignore it and give it little to no praise and use a magnifying glass on the patch notes to highlight the thing they feel is wrong. Without even knowing how it works. This community is fucking blind.
---
You may sell it for 30000 caps but there is always somebody that will sell it for cheaper. I purchase weapons with the caps I have and can always find a player with doubles, that sell for cheap.
---
I mean it could, but if you got enough skill and the right weapons it shouldn’t matter.
---
How is this karma farming? By talking about a relevant topic in the community? By giving my opinion? I haven't played this game since December, but I literally said I'm gonna go back and play it, I don't hate this game, I hate the way that it's been handled.
---
In some games, players who are willing to pay for special items or downloadable content may be able to gain an advantage over those playing for free who might otherwise need to spend time progressing in order to unlock said items. ... Such games are called "pay-to-win" 
---
Not my own quote, got it from Wikipedia.
---
What the hell are you talkng about?  Those items are in the game.  
---
I read your entire exchange and completely agree with you, can I know your secret meta as well?  Lol.  All good if not.
---
I didn't even say people shouldn't like it :/ 
---
I actually said I was going to go back and play it just not now.
---
Your anger is misplaced. I didn't put repair kits for sale  in the Atom Shop. Bethesda did that. They got together as a group and thought yeah, we should  do that. 
---
Posters, statues, etc, ARE cosmetic items
---
Sounds more like you are assuming they wont be atom shop exclusive
---
Been playing since January...about 200 hours in, so more or less the same as you.  
---
I do not actively/consiously complete tasks/challenges with the goal earn atoms. I can't fast travel, so I don't chase challenges around the map.  I think I've looked at the challenges screen once.  
---
Through my normal gameplay, I have collected somewhere around 3500 atoms.
---
===
---
My opinion on this whole firestorm:
---
Will I buy repair kits?  No.  
---
 I find enough mats and workbenches in my rambles, I have the repair perks for weapons and armor, and I carry more than one weapon appropriate for my build - if one breaks, I switch to another until I can get back to a workbench.
---
==
---
The endgame is to launch a nuke and kill the SBQ.  
---
How many players have accomplished just that /without/ a repair kit?
---
In order to make repair kits P2W, the current repair perk system  would have to be completely reworked (or eliminated) *and* a lot of workbenches made to go away, *and* weapon break rates woud have to go way up, or your ability to repair (anything) would have to be removed.  Thats a major game mechanic change. 
---
Unless/until that happens,
---
**Repair kits are not necessary to reach and complete the endgame.**
---
Ergo, it's not P2W.  
---
Long fights, or long runs like WesTek require several doses. A hotkey makes it very easy to refresh. On PC, I have 12 easy hotkeys to use, so why not?
---
And they're clearly stated not to be......
---
Karma No!
---
Where the hell did you get legal from? Of course it's not illegal. That is NOT the point. They promised to us, the consumer, that their will NOT be game changing items/feature in the Atom shop. The Atom Shop will house Cosmetics ONLY. 
---
As soon as they decided to break that promise, now us, the consumer, now have to be worried with what will come next. you get the outrage now?
---
I'm good, thanks... but take my updoots anyway. 😋
---
I don't currently use fixitgood but think that's a good starting point. I'm a melee build but also use a shotgun, rifle at the moment although I never have issues repairing them it's just the armor. I do runs in a few of the forts but barely pick up a decent amount of ballistic fibre, is there somewhere you'd recommend? 
---
Please learn what cosmetics means. Cosmetic: "a product applied to the body, especially the face, to improve its appearance." Cosmetics only effect the character body. A statue isn't a cosmetic cause it doesn't change the person appearance 
---
I play a lot and if it takes A week to reach my goal it's no big deal. Have played 3 and Nv to death and back. But if I am getting tore up in the game by P2W players it will kill it for me and I will simply move on to another game. And there are plenty of them out there. Hope Bethesda realizes this. Fallout is my fav series but they can change that and ruin it.
---
That's my point. This isn't pay to win but it is not cosmetic which means they are breaking their word.
---
Why would you rather have it be part of the cash shop than part of the game itself?  People want repair kits,  just not as a microtransaction.
---
I don’t know if they expect any given player to play forever, but a reasonable churn of players that pays for new content, keeping the servers ticking, and allows for some profit was probably part of the plan. So long as add-ons remain free, that revenue is going to have to come from new purchases (likely heavily discounted) or microtransactions. 
---
If you discovered them during Beta, they may not have registered. Solution: Send a new character out into the wilds.
---
Ill tell you what, you seem to like buying ATOMS, ill allow you to take on my "share" of how many ATOMS you think everyone should be buying.  then you will feel DOUBLE satisfied!!
---
problem solved!  development can continue!
---
True. The secret recipe in this model is cheap cosmetics that can purchased *en masse*. You don't want to sell 1k cosmetic items at $10 each. You want to sell 100k items at $1 or $2 each. The current pricing makes me very comfortable not buying anything at all on the Atomic Shop. Cut those prices down to something far more reasonable and I'll seriously re-examine what's on the Atomic Shop.
---
Ok, so it’s about their promise and not them trying to make money, as your post stated? 
---
Look, companies lie. Every day. The pushback is fine, and is completely justified. But as a way to make money, this is something that is going to happen. Now whether they give us the plans to make them in game or not has yet to be determined, but I can almost guarantee you that regardless of the pushback, repair kits are coming.
---
Being mad at a company for trying to make money, promises or not, is like being mad at a snake for biting you. 
---
Yep, they're testing the waters.
---
Dare I mention the Horse Armor and Orrery from Oblivion? Those two were instances where Beth was also testing the waters.
---
Or if they do them for less then 100 atims. Like 20-50 per
---
You get the stuff as you play the game. You don’t have to farm it, you don’t need that much. And you sure as hell don’t need repair kits. Don’t believe me or think I don’t know what I’m talking about? My 1300 hours played begs to differ.
---
I appreciate you! I'm also left with a bad taste in my mouth about the bags that we still haven't received, but that's worthy of another post. It sucks the in this community it doesn't matter whether you praise or criticize (or both) people still make you out as the monster.
---
I tried collecting teddy bears before but gave up since they filled up my stash. I think there are a dozen variations or so. 
---
So I’m thinking what happened here is ESO sells potions and a few other things that DO affect gameplay in their shop. Nothing serious but it’s been going on for years now. I think Fallout was trying to introduce similar things that are small for convenience purposes just like that. ESO players had no reaction to the introduction of these items (at least none that I recall). I’m thinking they probably didn’t expect any or at least very little backlash here.
---
I’m not really for it or against it. I honestly don’t even play the game at this point (has nothing to do with this subject). Just throwing that comparison out there. But if it’s handled anything like ESO all the items introduced will be very mild. Nothing game changing or serious in any way.
---
Well said. Regardless of someone’s circumstance, play time, and the like, being outpaced or at any disadvantage to someone simply because they can drop some / more money on a cash shop undermines the whole experience. 
---
Which telephone pole exactly? Lol
---
there are two types of repair kit, the better one is droppable by enemies.  just saying.
---
Isn't he Snoop Lion now?
---
That’s as may be, but you have to tread carefully, because once you lower prices of digital goods, you can’t realistically raise them again. 
---
Nothing atm. But in the future updates you might be needing some rare mats for repairing 5 star legendaries. You can never be certain what this game will be like in a year.
---
Congratulations you're a winner. This is now the 10000th post on this subject today. Your prize is a FO76 holdall (in plastic) and an atomic shop mug (online)
---
All servers will be reset to Zero on Tuesday at 11am est to allow all pissed off players to be removed from the game. Thank you and goodnite Bethesda.
---
&gt; In what way is the ability to repair your weapons and/or armor during combat not a combat item?

In what scenarios would it make a difference? If you're participating in PVP the only time when you'd use this is when you and your opponent are both unprepared but they use a kit when you can't. When fighting mobs it doesn't matter how much damage you do, just that you tag the enemy so that wouldn't affect loot dropping.
---
I will stick to that subreddit then, since it is less cancerous.
---
lol,  This same guy replied to a post of mine yesterday about how his generation should have taught my generation how to read.   He's uhh,  S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
Thanks for the detiled answer! Yeah one question I had was with flying enemy types (scorchbeasts and queens). Do you have a recommended weapon type for those enemies or should I go with whatever?
---
:cough: Sexy nurse outfit :cough:
---
Same problem here - it's a bug. 
---
I can't find anything saying the refrigerator won't be atom shop exclusive, I find the opposite
---
&gt;" As we look to the future, we’re exploring ways we can bring other community-driven ideas to the game as well, such as refrigerators for C.A.M.P.s, ammo and food converters, and even the ability to send scrap to your stash without having to head home "
---
This is all in the same section as selling repair kits for ATOMS.
---
goddamn this is the best reply yet, thank you for this, i doubt anyone can counter this.  i fell the exact same way
---
definitely an issue right now..my stash is Teddy Bears and mini nukes..
---
But by that logic, if they put a really good weapon in the store, "it's not pay to win" because,  "you can get it in the game"
---
I have that issue in savage divide with top of the world, one place in the bog, one in the ash heap, one in the mire, and two in toxic valley. I think I got credit for all the locations in the forest (if that was a thing)
---
the slope, it is slippery
---
But.... atoms can be bought?
---
The CC was on a single player game with free alternatives in the form of mods; the CC wasn’t pay to win.
---
Really? There's blatant evidence it was stated to be cosmetic only. In interviews Pete Hines said "And to say, **the atomic shop is cosmetic stuff**. To make sure folks understand -- Look there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we're going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how the stuff works and what you're getting for your $60".
---
Unless you're illiterate and don't know how to read (because really man you suck for saying that to OP where he stated his feelings towards this, so back right at you), one of his first things said on this atomic shop was that, may I repeat, "**the atomic shop is cosmetic stuff**". Don't believe me? please find me a source where Pete Hines or Todd Howard say that it isn't cosmetic only, and I'll be generous, I'll give you a month, cause hell you ain't gonna find one.
---
And yeah, you may not need it at all, good for you! You can play a game! But that doesn't mean others won't use it. And if they do, Bethesda will get the idea that what they've done is okay, and push more scams, because this suspiciously gets put out a couple patches after white night (a perk card which means armour degrades less over time, and also food is spoiling at an alarming rate all of a sudden, and they also mentioned refrigerators).
---
Also credibility? Nah, I'm not that low (unlike you), but I didn't want to ruin OP's post with an argument, but look at what you had to do (again I'm sorry OP)
---
They quoted 4-6 months back in December so probably June for an update
---
What do your boots have to do with anything? lol
---
DON'T TEMPT THEM TO ADD A NEW CURRENCY THAT WE CAN'T EARN IN GAME.
---
Seriously--if they start adding cool gun skins and all the really cool stuff people are asking for in here, they're going to go the way of Ubisoft and R6: Siege and have a two-tier "Atom" system.
---
I'm just going to quietly ignore the uproar and keep playing this great game.
---
Ranger Sequoia skin?
---
Might be. I absolutely despise the delete/edit function here. If you are willing to say something, you should be willing to stand behind it. Only mods and admins should be able to remove a post once placed. Let edit add to the existing post, but not change the original. The cowards that delete something as soon as they realize their scumbaggery is not acceptable have skewed ratings. they should be much much lower than they show. 
---
Well put. This can go well, which I feel the majority would find unexpected (single plan / recipe), or it can go poorly. I just feel like no one wants to find out day-of.
---
Not really, people asked for a quality of life improvement which was not in the base games design, which requires time and work. You're paying for that work.
---
What's hard to grasp? You know you really are asking alot when you want Free:
---
DLC's
---
Feature updates
---
Storage space
---
Server uptime
---
Free earnable currency taking away micro transactions.
---
Like are you actually for real? You do know networks cost to run? Storage costs? Then development time and costs?
---
This community is a needy joke sometimes.
---
Cosmetic items.
---
Yes, kill the messenger, as always. 
---
I want the ghoul mask from Fallout 3
---
Nothing. 
---
cosmetic articles 
---
[We Bare Bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Bare_Bears) collector here (not really).  There is a stack of the bear brothers somewhere in Appalachia.  My loading screen pictures are exclusively bear related.
---
How am I fanning the flames? How is "no homo" even remotely linked to this convo? It's people like you who ruin this community. There's plenty of posts like this - what, scared to speak up on those because they have more upvotes? Hypocrite.
---
Are you like obligated to only ever respond with lol?
---
right. im saying id be cool with the decision of putting game-enhancing items in the shop if they changed that.
---
Just use the built-in aimbot (they call it ‘vats’). You don’t need to know how to aim and the gun doesn’t point to the target when firing either, but the bullets will hit your target like magic. No need to see your gun or your target. 
---
A tactical skin for the Handmade rifle 
---
My point is I feel raked for enough cash so far, and I expect what's promised from people who make promises.  Bethesda didn't. I don't give a shit about the sale. I don't care that I lost 40 bucks. At all. Hell, I bought my ps4 JUST TO PLAY FALLOUT. So to me, it's a fucking 400 dollar game and it is still worth it. So go wrap your teeth on a curb and shut up already. 
---
NCR Ranger Armor.
---
Maria from FNV
---
Oh ok. Seemed like you were unaware.
---
Statues, posters, artwork and bric-a-brac are cosmetic items. They provide no meaningful benefit in game mechanical terms asides from, perhaps, providing some cover.
---
They most certainly did promise cosmetics-only. You can find numerous clips of it on YouTube with a very quick search.
---
Your 1300 hours in more time than I will have to play in several years.  I have way too many IRL commitments to even consider that.  That’s almost 55 days of total time which suggests to me that you are either still in school/unemployed/not working and currently have no kids or partner.  Lots of players can not do that. 
---
To fix things in this game you need to farm. You can go without an armor piece here and there but for lots of content it helps to have armor and a weapon. 
---
Not everyone plays the way you do.  It is likely not financially sound to base your decisions as a game company around the tiny population of hardcore players.  For casuals this will help a great deal.  
---
I’d pay a fee thousand atoms just for the proper marine helmet thing.
---
\*laughs in stupid looking PA\*
---
There are literally plans for stimpacks... so saying that they are stimpacks for gear does not eliminate the possibility that they are plans.
---
If they are plans, then you would have to craft them.  Also, if they are plans, then they wouldn't be gouging you repeatedly for additional atom$.
---
Also it is unclear how fast you could repair your kit.  If it takes a few seconds, that's also time that you are getting pummeled, so the benefit of the kit in a PvP situation is still unclear.  I could see it being useful against a SB, because you can usually find cover and take a few seconds to do this kind of thing. 
---
Not saying it is the right way to go, just saying that there's a lot of raging against something that needs clarification.  I am disappointed that they are letting this rage fest going on without clarifying what is going on and how it will effect various game mechanics.
---
yeah that's a huge investment. My build does not allow for it, not even close.  I have friends apply weapon mods when I need.
---
That guy had really bad dandruff.  Apparently they found a lot of Head &amp; Shoulders in his house.
---
except you have to craft the repair kits
---
They didn't bury it, it was one of the major bullet points of the ITV. And you don't think they can't see the several dozen identical posts about how much of a "betrayal" this is? What could they possibly post that would appease the people frothing at the mouth over this? They don't have the authority to reverse course without someone else's say so, so they're doing the smart thing and letting this blow over, just like all the other past controversies and betrayals did. When this community blows its top over every infraction, don't be surprised when the CMs stop engaging when it loses its shit for the umpteenth time over barely anything, fueled instead by wild speculations about what may happen.
---
Did they say that the ammo converter was an atom shop item? 
---
They mentioned it in the same paragraph as the repair kits, but it was also referring to new features, to me it looked like a poor choice of formatting by putting it in the same section.
---
This would be the ad hominem, because now you’re coming after me instead of my argument that these arguments are faulty. You can paint it any way you want but a logical fallacy is a logical fallacy and a non starter for people who understand them. 
---
"fun fact" there is a grave yard where the soldiers have been dug up and you can defile them by looting their bodies.
---
Yep real fun ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I kid but poor choice of words
---
IS cosmetic, again. NOT WILL BE. Talking PRESENT-TENSE. 
---
Jesus christ i'm actually conversing with uneducated children who cannot and do not understand the English language.
---
Oh, you mean white knight? Like how Scrapper now yields more junk to offset that change? But don't worry... it's to push repair kit sales right?
---
The food spoilage has been a post after EVERY major update because people do NOT know how to manage spoil timers. FACT. Has nothing to do with fridges, since this was happening before fridges was EVER mentioned so, there goes that theory.
---
also from the same interview of Pete: 
---
"And part of the main reason we’re doing it is because we want to provide all of the post-launch content that we do for free. So any DLC or new content we add is free to everybody"
---
That’s what I’m saying, I’m still going to play and win. Does it matter how I get there in the end. It’s just a matter of perspective. Adults don’t have time to be running around the map back and forth grinding. 
---
Yes, because this subreddit is so cancerous and many people realized that.
---
I thought rifle perks affected it?
---
Im guessing you saw the wild appalachia trailer but none of tue dpc roadmaps.
---
I figured people would assume all of that got added already... i really wish they put dates in that trailer...
---
Go play in traffic
---
I’ll bet the finance guys are pressuring the content guys to find a way to hit more of the market.  It makes total sense to do so, if you don’t think through the gameplay implications.  My bet this is a case of shitty internal corporate politics not maliciousness 
---
Hey Bethesda 
---
Your gat will suddenly look like $hit after the next patch, then a skin will come out in the next $18 bundle. 
---
Like they are right now? You blind or just ignorant?
---
Yea because schmucks are letting themselves be treated like this.
---
This is my first time back in this subreddit in about a month and I've had the game uninstalled pretty much since the third week of release.
---
Every time I pop back in here there is some new dumpster fire going on in this game.
---
Why do people still even consider this game?
---
I agree, I love this game so much, don't get me wrong it's got it's bugs and issues but at it's core it's a very solid game and I truly enjoy playing it. That said, if it goes pay 2 win, I'm going to stop playing. It's a shame, but I don't want to support a game that's pay2win.
---
I think regardless of playstyle preference, we shouldn't support them blatantly going back on their word. 
---
I wish they had this. Two games that I thought did customization great are SWTOR and AC: Odyssey; in SWTOR, you can create custom outfit sets to switch between at any time using any piece of gear and in Odyssey you can change armor to look like any piece you’ve already unlocked. I wouldn’t mind spending 5-10 atoms to change a gear piece, or hell even dropping 500 to buy outfit load outs that I can customize and change between at any time. I love the OG Vault suit with thin leather armor strapped on, would definitely make that one outfit load out and have a couple others like the Nuka Girl rocketsuit
---
Yeah. But they gotta keep the servers on somehow. And only a moron pays $15 for a power armor skin. So they gotta monitize the game somehow. That's what "live service" means: tricking you into paying long after you bought the game. 
---
ok ill admit i laughed a bit too loud at this at work, my coworkers gave me a weird look
---
I didn't say that you couldn't still play normally. Look, nobody seems to be getting the point. It's nothing to do with the repair kit. It's all about what they are making the stim shop into. Big picture people!!!
---
Agreed, it's just about honesty. I love this game but it feels like the people in charge take one step forward and two steps back sometimes.
---
I play in mud. 
---
I paid money for this product, I expect it to be what it be was advertised as and I expect it to stay what is was advertised as.  I do not need to deliver praise to a corporation for delivering what it advertised.   I don't need to praise competent  patching methods, I don't need to praise bug fixes or qol issues which shouldn't have existed in the first place.  When you buy a new car do you thank the  dealer for including a steering wheel and tell him great job for including the tires?  Bethesda has basically sold a car with no seats, steering wheel or tires.  After launch they added a steering wheel, we should thank them?  Now they are adding seats to the cash shop, we should thank them?  Gtfo
---
Gary?
---
This is not the end. It's just the beginning.
---
They are slowly and gently adding their money-making-machines to the cash shops. Also remember, there are lunchboxes(lootboxes) slumbering within the esm file and waiting for their moment.
---
(Eddard Starks voice) Lootboxes are coming. 
---
Yeah but as long as they are not removing features you dont need to buy anything
---
I get sucked into this whenever they discount items right before they pull them from the Atom Shop
---
Hey so I've been working. Can you link me where all this hoopla is coming from before I grab my pitchfork too?
---
Yeah I agree with you man... I only want the best for this game, but with all the controversies, (I'm so sorry about the bag fiasco, also they haven't even sent them out yet? Damn man I hope they do), I find it hard to either critique or praise the game. Cause to all my friends I praised Bethesda after their talk at the Bethesda days, but after The Inside the Vault I was like "Remember that stuff I said? Forget it".
---
I only want good for this franchise yet all of this...
---
The bugs are the features.
---
What we know is a lie.
---
Never said I would rather it but if that's the way their going. + its not a microtransaction
---
pls. copy link to this info...im outta the loop.
---
Did you use PA with sneak?
---
Xbox has a recent player function built in and I used it both times, but when you rejoin you don't get any loot because the server doesn't recognise the damage you did before you crashed. Really sucks
---
Lets assume you magically know that they are actually plans and the post just left it out because they figured we'd recognize that everything comes as plans..  ya ya,  whatever.
---
Even if it is a plan...  If it doesn't cost as much to craft as the most expensive repair it's going to be the same thing.  You buy the plan,  craft a kit with nuts and bolts,  apply it to an item that requires ballistic fiber.  Same thing,  you've just skipped having to use ballistic fiber because you paid with atoms.  
---
I don't understand why people are defending this,  it's really simple for bethesda..  make it an in game thing only.  
---
Goddamn good point! XD
---
But play to win against WHO?
---
Are people raging because their co-op partners are going to be stronger, or raging because their PvP enemies are going to be stronger?
---
I honestly don't care about my co-op partners being stronger.  More help for me.  I can take out a SB, but am happy to have help doing it as long as a get a decent tag in (and I always do).  I hate the weak player who pew-pew a tag in and then go hide.  I would love to see them be able to buff up, even if they spend to do it.
---
In PvP, they have already demonstrated that they are willing to limit P2W by nerfing a lot of stuff that let's be honest - you can buy it via ebay, et cetera.  So P2W already exists, and if they keep limiting its impact in Survival, I am cool with that.
---
Personally, I’m quite enjoying it. 
---
I login, scavenge around, still finding new locations, meet other players,trade something and then making some changes to my CAMP. 
---
Yeah same
---
Alot of people are just bitching about this game to bitch about this game, but it does set a precedent: This item does essentially allow you to pay to improve yourself in-game, and if this item is acceptable, what else will Bethesda sell us?
---
Personally, I'd be okay if it was like a portable "workbench", as in you can repair your items anywhere, but at the cost of your materials, maybe some extra steel to maintain the kit's tools. This is sounding more like New Vegas's repair kits, and I'm not sure that's a good thing.
---
So maybe not "pay to win", but it could easily lead to those kind of things in the future.
---
Plus who the fuck wanted this like hurry up with some faction-related stuff. I'll buy an Enclave skin for my X-01 in a heartbeat.
---
Yeah for now. But if this trend keeps up you'll eventually have to buy stuff from the atom store just to keep pace with the people willing to blow their wallets on this game. 
---
Oh yeah. People are pissed. But if they're going to pay their bills somehow, they gotta bring in the $$$. That means finding ways to keep YOU paying them money despite having already bought the game. Welcome to the "live service" model.   
---
The writing was on the wall the moment they announced that you couldn't host a server on your own, you could ONLY play on Bethesda's servers. 
---
And that's worth funding Bethesda becoming the new EA?
---
This is essentially the Genetic Fallacy, because you’re stating that it should be not trusted because of its origins. 
---
Look, I get it. The Repair Kits seem like a problem right now and are worrisome, but people need to calm down over something with little info revealed 
---
yeah me too I don't think repair kits is such a p2w feature... but i guess what people is arguing about is that this is just the appetizer, the main meals will come later with real p2w stuff in the atom store
---
Either they pay $100 or work really hard to complete challenges.
---
You must be both. 100% isnt a buff. My 200% repair gives me more attack damage on melee and more armor on that, it's literally abfisadvantage to use them. 
---
I hit you with a proper fact and you duck. Typical. I can tell you. This game isn't cheap to run (advanced networking diploma gives me an idea of the cost to run a network) 
---
Right? And how's that not true? You got Fasnacht free? Sheepsquatch free? Biv and the alcohol quest free?
---
You're paying, for a REQUESTED feature. It's really that obvious an simple to understand.
---
This is the Genetic Fallacy. 
---
Jest a little sarcasm on the repair kits for sale in the near patch on atomic shop
---
Cards can be removed to replace with ones u need. Respec comes after lvl 50
---
Maybe have hotkeys when needed.
---
Look I'm all for defending the company and all but let's not pretend backlash over paytowin aspects after being promised cosmetic only is a reason for then to go silent. Its like a spit in the face and them saying we basically aren't allowed to be against this because "well it makes money"
---
Well, I already payed for the game, I’m not spending money on atoms so I’m really not funding them. 
---
All BoS paints are for T60
---
Why? This aint call of duty, i dont compete against other people.
---
+ that is pure speculation and nothing else, like i said in another thread on another manner you could speculate that they might start charging you 10$ every time you die.
---
They wont though, because they aint stupid.
---
Yeah  ppl are overreacting... 
---
Man, if it wasn't for food spoiling my STASH would always be over weight.
---
They will drop in game as well just fyi. Says so right in inside the vault, not sure why folks keep skipping over that part..... maybe people just like to complain?
---
I see your point, but I really believe in this player vendor concept. Maybe only players have the ability to sell their inventory and modded items and NPC just sell essentials like aid,ammo, bulk junk etc.
---
I'm confused..  If they implement it how they say,  putting in the shop where you can buy things with Atoms, available for real world money,   how is that not a micro transaction again?
---
i think the best items would be CAMP items, as I spend a lot of time in my 'home' , and some paints for PA or regular armor/weapons
---
THIS! This is why I haven't played in the past few days (that and BL1 got a nice update), if they remain on this path I wont consider buying atoms EVER. 
---
I would be cool if the basic repair kit is a plan, and the advanced repair kit is a plan you can win by defeating the SBQ.
---
Then, just like stims, you can build them at a work bench for mats, and use them in the field.
---
You can win the plans, or buy the plans.  But it would not be an endless revenue stream or gouging.
---
Yeah ever since the rumors I was hoping it was battlefield 3 with a futuristic spin. A shame some people didn't want that. Either way, I don't think it affected Dices decision to make it super accessible 
---
Most scorched carry all kinds of shotguns with them. You should find one pretty quickly.
---
Me too! I've had my fun. It's a decent game.. but I have not logged in since this decision was made.. Hope they reverse it so I don't have to uninstall. 
---
From what I can tell, they CAN actually be used as normal fusion cores in normal power armor frames. It does not have to be ultracite power armor, which doesn't really make sense either way since it's the frame that takes the core, not the armor.
---
I cannot say for certain, as it might just be the good ol' placebo effect playing a trick on me, but it somehow feels like the ultracite cores last longer than the normal ones?! It would have to take a lot of testing, which I'm too lazy to partake in. But seeing as it only requires ONE violet flux, ONE ultracite scrap and any type of fusion core (either full or nearly empty) to produce ONE whole ultracite fusion core, it seems like a good way to upkeep your cores.
---
Simply drop all your full cores, and only have the nearly depleted ones on your person, and make the ultracite version. Mine comes out at 108/100 charges aswell. Not sure what stat increase the charge (Perhaps Intellect?) But it seems like a win/win, seeing as making a single NORMAL fusion core costs ONE OF EACH flux. Has to be an oversight, or simply how it is. As it is now though, it seems to be working just fine as a power armor core. Not sure if it gets auto-used like the normal ones do, but you CAN place them inside the frame manually (Pressing open inventory on frame, moving to ammo tab and placing it inside the frames inventory).
---
Hope someone finds this useful!
---
Specifically regarding repair kits and similar utility items, I wouldn’t mind paying for the plans to craft them if that’s what they’re going for, my quarrel would be if they decided to sell individual consumables.
---
Personally I’d like more practical, armoured looking clothing items, like the couple raider looking ones that were datamined. 
---
I have a full 15 in int for my sniper.  5 goes to gunsmith, 3 to first aid, 3 to Power Patcher, 1 to scrapper, and 3 to batteries included.
---
Low level scorched use lvl 5 pump-actions. Morgantown airport has them.
---
Yeah true it COULD,  but its all speculation at this point...save your outrage,  you know. that's all im saying 
---
I don't use twitter. So why is it better? Political garbage there like facebook is full of.
---
Power armor paint. Nothing else
---
It isn't pay to win and has some useful use cases.
---
For instance I play solo exclusively. I'm not at the point of being able to launch nukes solo so I have to farm what flux I can at others nukes. As the nukes have slowed down I have certain gear I cannot repair because I like the rare mats.
---
I can't buy flux as I am always cap broke and have no gear of merit to trade.
---
So with these I could earn a repair kit, or if the price was low enough to match up with the expected value of grinding challenges I could get a kit for free from the Atom Shop.
---
I would never buy one.
---
It would be more likely that I slough off my anti social ways and find a discord that coordinates nukes than to pay money.
---
But it would be a nice convenience.
---
At the same time we were told cosmetic only, and we were getting good momentum behind the game till this and I expect them to keep their word.
---
The repair kits that they say will be in the shop only repair to 100%.
---
There will be 150% repair kits exclusively in game from things such as SQB drops.
---
With perks you can repair to 200% so both repair kit options are weaker than existing mechanics.
---
Im usually into buying skins, id like to see more mens hair styles and thicker beards. 
---
I’d love to see your evidence of the spoilage rate, because a lot of people have been saying this but can not provide proof other than “It just seems that way” which is NOT definitive proof: code is. 
---
Did you know he played hockey?  When the police walked in, there was a face off in his living room.
---
Downvote the karma farma
---
\&gt;.&gt;
---
oh I'm not gonna last until 50.
---
Can you edit your original post with a list of all of the bears you have?  Nice to see something other than Atom Shop Snafu discussions.
---
Cool, source?
---
I wouldn't mind that if they didn't completely abuse their power and actually removed zero quality posts. However they don't. They remove high quality well-detailed posts. You can take any post criticisizing Bethesda and go.
---
"ur just saying Bethesda bad"
---
The fact that they use that sort pro corporate anti-consumer talk in their post should tell you guys that lol. 
---
Well seeing how this games monetization method is nerf player ability then sell an item in the shop to make up for that we will see how long this game remains in a playable state for you.
---
They nerfed White Knight in order to bring it in line with other perks that reduced condition deterioration, and they did this weeks ago, and it's still a powerful perk. Even if you disagree with the nerf, can we **please do not make up unsubstansiated conspiracy theories about how this was actually a ploy to prepare for pay to win repair kits?**  
---
Look, you want to be angry, fine. But this doesn't help, this only makes us look stupid and paranoid, like any change Bethesda makes is actually an attack on us. Just stop.
---
The CM's are alive!!! I was about to mount a search party I was afraid they all got into the nuka-shine and ended up on strange sub-reddits like r/grandpajoehate  r/birdswitharms and r/pointlessstories
---
I'm glad to see they made it back here in one piece
---
I thought so, but also that maybe TSE was still the best combo even after the nerf, so I had to ask. Thanks!
---
I appreciate your optimism, but what they described is clearly not a free item. It’s a consumable that will be purchasable through the atom shop. It’s totally different than the Nukashine poster. 
---
They’re dipping their toe in the water with a minor item to see how far they can push the line. The community has to show them that this is where it has to stop, otherwise we’ll see more items that monetize avoiding in game mechanics. 
---
When that happens, developers stop focusing on quality content and shift toward balancing mechanics to optimize monetization. 
---
Exactly 
---
Agree with this, if you want a nicer looking fridge, the atom shop will be there for you. But I really doubt that the fridges will be atom only. 
---
They really need to tighten these things up. it creates unnecessary speculation. 
---
You can either start over, or force your class to change over time.
---
I refer u to Fallouts own FAQ page. Where they specially state on their own website...atoms r for cosmetic items.
---
This is a clear betrayal from Bethseda. 
---
Alright thanks man, I thought I saw somewhere that the lower ranks could go on t51 and stuff. 
---
Wavy Willards is maybe the first place I saw combat shotguns on scorched.
---
Why does criticisizing have to be downplayed as rage? Is it because they're criticisizing a corporation you happen to like? Wouldn't be surprised. 
---
Solid point. Make plans available as a one time use item, much like the stimpack, and avoid the potential money pit fiasco. The thing is we don’t know for sure that this isn’t exactly how they intend on doing it, but like I said elsewhere, given the possible ramifications, no one wants to wait and find out what exactly they plan to do with availability until the day-of. Cheers
---
Has anyone from Bethesda responded to this uproar? They seem to be active on the sub but I haven’t seen a response
---
Should have specified that the build is for PvE, sorry! Thanks for the detailed answer.
---
The hair, cosmetic &amp; tattoo options are all so incredibly lackluster.
---
Not heavily impressed with any of the skins (got the PA &amp; Armor camo cause that just kind of makes sense).
---
Don't really care for reskinned stash boxes or that ilk either. Same bed different sheets whoopdy doo Basil.
---
Frankly I don't know what I'd like in there, but what's been offered hasn't been the least bit tempting especially at the full prices. 
---
While that is true you have a crowd of people that don't know about this issue on Twitter and making a commotion will spread the word and hopefully change the devs/Bethesda ideas.
---
The Atom Shop is whatever Bethesda wants it to be. There is nothing for them to justify. They are a business. They are either making money or they go out of business.
---
FH - f***in Hollywood  ; p
---
And yet you removed high quality posts with actual points and structure last time there was controversy. You can pretend you're not censoring all you like. Maybe that helps you justify it? But in reality you're actually stifling discussion as soon as you feel like you're able to get away with it. 
---
What can I say. I can be hurtful. Just find out the whole truth before you post something like that. 
---
Yeah, then they introduce survival mode, where you, idk... compete. Then theres the other modes coming out and what do you think those will entail? Probably more competition. Yes this is speculation, but it's not that hard to see a shit storm before it's in your front yard. I'm not saying what they are going to or not going to do, but the more transactions they get for these repair kits, the more this game will push towards pay-to-win. Just like everyone else has done. So speculation, yes. Also history that's repeated itself hundreds of times already? Also yes. 
---
You're missing the point. Nobody wants to listen to someone when all they do is yell. This community only wants to talk about the bad shit. The car industry and gaming industry are totally different that was an awful analogy. 
---
Bethesda came out and said this is their first attempt at fallout online so bear with them but it seems everyone forgot about that. "It needs to be perfect because I paid for it" fuck that mentality. It doesnt get us anywhere if you just complain and offer nothing constructive. 
---
I'm not saying you need to price everything either. There needs to be a balance of discussion. But the fact that people upvote what they agree with and downvote what they disagree with it creates an echo chamber of everyone in here agreeing with themselves and sucking each other dick. 
---
Yes putting p2w stuff in the shop is bad. This is not a p2w item and people are trying to make it one because they want to be mad at bethesda instead of give any real feedback. They just dont like the idea that someone can work a real job and still be better than them when they only play this game. This isnt a competitive game people need to chill and just enjoy what they have. 
---
And also "I paid money for this". I'm sure there are lots of games that you've paid for but you can no longer play the multi player on anymore. So that argument isnt very valid. I pay money for lots of things that dont work the way I think they should. 
---
Because the currency is in game and it can be earned unlike, for example cod points if they gave a advantage.
---
Nah, it's selective knowledge, people see what they want to see and only that, these are just people "coming out the woodwork" to hate from the FO Subreddit guaranteed. The 76 hate circle-jerk is real
---
Yeah, I thought that maybe fire rate was good too. Thanks!
---
that is why i made this post, so Bethesda can end the speculation by letting us know if the change was intentional or not
---
and there WAS a change, it was quantifiable from the day it started when they released fermentors, i make 100's of soups a day for my clanmates, we all noticed that day
---
plus, anyone who has done flux nuke runs can attest to the huge change in spoil rates
---
I respect your opinion... if your pc add me and you can remain anti social...and ill just dm you when we do nukes 😃
---
Yeah you will.  You'll find a gatling somewhere and turn heavy arms.  Come to the dark side.  
---
I've been reading this sub since the BETA and i don't recall one single post about repair kits. Ok, maybe one post ? 
---
I can confirm that it does not. My main can run for FAR longer out of PA than in.
---
Ok, we'll wait and see if it's an atom shop item or not but it's highly likely it is given Bethesda's paragraph. But it still begs the question of why we need it in the first place.
---
As I said in my post why couldn't we have just sold them at the vendors? Why couldnt we deconstruct them in existing benches, Why do we need another item to do this for us
---
Fair enough. To be honest I posted my response before finishing reading your post, which I apologize for. 
---
It's not about the the repair kits it about what it Will lead to. What next? Pay 5 bucks get more exp pay 10 bucks instant lvl 50. Look at other games and what they are doing. This is not a free to play game this is a game is played 80 plus bucks for. I expect that someone that just came into this game will not be at the same playing field I am at after 500 hours. I expect new players to start where I started . I will help them if they ask but they should not be able to be as powerful as me on day one because they payed  to be that way. I payed  for this game I spent a lot of time getting stronger  and farming caps or whatever to get what I have. Look at a game like Destiny you can buy a pack that gets you to max lvl  and close to max light just by paying. People playing that game have spent years to get to that point and newbie420blazeit can pay 20 bucks and get the same thing. Maybe you are a causal that only plays 5 hours a week and would like that convience but I play a lot and expect someone not to be at my playing field by paying for it.
---
&gt; refrigerators, ammo converters will not be AS items as far as I have heard
---
Heard from where? It's literally in the paragraph titled "Repair kits in the atomic shop".
---
If your weapon breaks and you don't have a spare you're getting pummeled regardless, so I don't think that's enough of a "downfall" to consider them not pay to win. And the biggest argument isn't repair kits, I'ma just keep repairing to 200% at my camp. It's the fact that they're choosing to go back on the cosmetic only promise only 5 months after release. If enough people buy these what does this say for the years they plan this game to keep going. It's just a bad omen seen it too many times in games.
---
One effin thing is not a betrayal in any aspect to me after shit I’ve been through like Facebook games with auto purchase that I never played or again Crossout.....
---
Or various online games ... fO76 having one thing doesn’t bother me at all. So cool down, enjoy the breeze, eat healthily, and relax dude or dudette all is fine.
---
CM's are not paid and not Bethesda employees. They are volunteers who keep this subreddit under control. 
---
This is a fair response to any hot highly posted topic. Personally I'm sick of seeing reposts especially since it's mostly karma farming.
---
I paid 60 bucks for this game, not gonna spend any more until they drop some real content for this. All we have are words and delays.
---
It’s not really about the repair kit. It sets precedence for other gameplay elements to be put behind paywalls. Bethesda said themselves that the atom shop was for cosmetics. This goes against that. 
---
Someone doesn't practice enough necromancy to understand real fun! 🙄
---
You don't have to be "unemployed" to "win", gaming just needs to be your main hobby. Say you work an 8-5, Mon-Fri job. That gives you about 5 hours a night and a whole weekend to play. That's about 45 hours of possible play time. 
---
Just face it, you're arguing for lazy, entitled people to have the option of paying to progress. 
---
Even further back than that, how about fixing the horrific performance on Xbox one. I can barely play it without the frame rate dropping to 2fps when there's more than three ghouls on the screen. 
---
I've played since launch and have suffered through crashes and horrible fps performance and assumed they'd be addressing this but it's clear to me now these issues will never be fixed and adding items to the atom shop is more important. 
---
Shame on you Bethesda. Release a game riddled with problems to take our cash and then work on grabbing more cash before fixing the broken state of the game. 
---
This will be the last Bethesda game I'll be purchasing and I've always been a strong supporter. You lost a customer for life here. 
---
i guess nobody knows what the word "precedent" means anymore
---
YeongYea is a heavily opinionated guy he dosent just "read news" he also tells you what to think about it.
---
The notion that repair kits themselves are p2w is a little bit of a stretch, I agree.  What people are worried about is that this is the start of a trend toward more tangible monetized advantages. And they don't want to wait for that to happen, they want their voices heard on the subject now. 
---
I am curious what you mean with your comment in refrigerators and ammo converters.  All I've seen officially is what was in the inside the vault, which wasn't clear either way.  
---
Ok your speculating though. Save your outrage for when its actually a p2w item
---
I’m just poking fun at your title, if that wasn’t obvious.  
---
Buuuut, you obviously thought you were important enough to create your own post even though there were 100 other posts saying the exact same thing.
---
I imagine you are also the type that when you don’t get your way with a big company, you cross your arms, let out a loud hrumph and scream “you just lost your best customer!”.
---
Yup, because you, a single lowly individual means so much in the grand scheme of things.
---
It seems obvious to me, that people don't buy atoms because it's super easy to grind in game. Make new toon, do easy achievements, profit. You can even stockpile certain things to make it easier.
---
The news article on their website states:
---
&gt; We also felt we could try out something new with these, both in-game and in the Atomic Shop.
---
To me, this suggests that the repair kits won't be sold as a plan but as single-use consumables. Probably they're going to offer different packages with different quantities, e.g. 5, 10, 50,... buy 50 and get 10 for free... I also expect those to end up in bundles... an outfit, a weapon skin and 10 repair kits for 1000 Atoms... or something like that...
---
One word : FRIDGE....
---
  \*Coming soon in the Atom Store !!!
---
Lol there are 0 items in the atoms shop that are not unlocked as plans. They don't need to explicitly say it because that is how the Shop is.
---
Odds are that its going to cost some high level junk to craft, but yes I can't guarantee that. Also everyone seems to be missing that the improved kits are only in-game drops.
---
I don't understand why people are so upset about this. Have y'all been asleep for the past decade? Micro transactions are here to stay, and guess what... they work and gamers like and use them. That's why they still exist. You are asking a company to do work and allocate resource to the creation of content, but you are not willing to pay for the additional content. When has that ever been what the gaming industry has done? You're right is is simple for Bethesda. They are charging money for their products.
---
Spent $25 on microtransactions for a shitty dead game LUL
---
In some games, players who are willing to pay for special items or downloadable content may be able to gain an advantage over those playing for free who might otherwise need to spend time progressing in order to unlock said items. ... Such games are called "pay-to-win"
---
Not my own quote, straight from Wikipedia
---
Wait what’s this
---
It doesn't work like that. When you overrepair you get weapon damage bonuses and armor resistance bonuses. You can't overrepair with basic repair packs 
---
I want more emotes, but I don't just want new emote icons above my character's head. I want actual new animations as well.
---
I always feel bad when I'm on mic and my teammates aren't because they end up spending so much time typing messages instead of playing
---
Guess nobody knows what the word "speculation" means anymore
---
yup! this is what i was gonna say, most scorched seem to love pump actions
---
thats the problem with all MT games, its all so ffn expensive 
---
1800 atoms for a power armor paint... seriously
---
if its like a couple buks more people would be inclined to buy some stuff, like spend 20 buks, and be able to buy a bunch of skins and stuff, not just 1
---
thats what I dont understand, its catered to only the whales
---
make it cheap and add a sh\*tload of skins, and alot of people will spend a buck here and there
---
but with these prices everybody is like "thanks but no thanks" except for the whales IMO 
---
This!  They still haven’t fixed previous glitches like scrapping bulk items.  
---
Clearly something is wrong with food spoilage rates (and hunger and thirst for matter) so I hope this isn’t a precursor to having us buy things to address the problems.  Call me a skeptic but the legendary drops (or lack thereof) could open the door to them selling items in the atom shop. 
---
To be fair let’s compare these games equally. I’m sure these Facebook games are free and never claimed that they wouldn’t sell anything other than cosmetics.
---
It will drop from SBQs. You do realise that many players have never even seen one?.
---
They're putting a vendor from each faction at the whitesprings, or something along those lines 
---
You have a speed demon serum I’d trade for that or 600 caps
---
All factions except the Enclave will have representatives in the Whitespring Resort.  They are also planning on combining vendor cap pools instead of splitting it up amongst 7 factions.  
---
Making it much easier and faster to sell your daily 1400 caps. 
---
It also doesn't say that it will be exclusive.
---
Flooding the main page of reddit isn't the way to do that. Duplicate posts and up votes only artificially inflate the amount of people actually complaining about this. 
---
Wait let's try this, ahem... 
---
`repair kit`
---
yeah i cant wait for this change, a great QOL update!
---
and i was thinking, now that the max limit is over the 200 caps up to 1200, when we empty out the caps at the vendor, and then BUY expensive cap stuff, MORE of our caps will go back to the vendor if the return would be more than 200!
---
:)
---
hope that makes sense
---
You looked under the door mat? Right below the key card reader?
---
Iirc it didn't waypoint it accurately for me on my recent play through 
---
To be fair you aren't just carrying around flakes of pepper and spices. Your also carrying around the pepper shaker and spice container.
---
It was never ever promised. People assume it was but it was only stated that at the time it was for cosmetics because there was nothing else planned to be put in there
---
I don’t have a speed demon serum, but I’ll do 600 caps. I’m in class right now but I’ll be back on in about 30 to 40 minutes. Will you be on then?
---
I like how you’re describing people who play videogames 45 hours a week as “not lazy”.
---
Don't tell us how to eat, how dare you try and campaign for our health. But seriously, while you may not see an issue with it, the idea of Bethesda adding a non cosmetic item, let alone a one time consumable, opens up a door that could lead to much more intrusive monetised items. Most fans are reiterating the same points because of this. 
---
You can do this. Remember your rules of three and you'll be ok. Start collecting your pee, you're gonna need it.
---
So this is where you draw the line LOL. Bethesda has no integrity the fact that you are still playing Fallout 76 shows to them that they can do whatever they want. 
---
THIS.
---
Why can I not season the meat as well?  Mutt Chops.  Seasoned Mutt Chops (+salt, +pepper, +spices).  Sweet &amp; Sour Mutt Chops (+spices, + sugar).  Mutt Jerky (+salt x2, +spices).
---
Some are even standards.  Angler meat?  Lemon Pepper Angler Fillet (+pepper, +acid).
---
Granola Bars or Trail Mix?  Something we can make that has a VERY long time-to-spoil.
---
Some things seem to have just ONE recipe.  That's it.  And that's simply lazy.  Chicken Noodle Soup?  How about Fried Chicken (+oil, +salt, +pepper)?  How about Buffalo Wings (+oil, +spices, +salt, +pepper, +firecrackerberry)?  Or any others?
---
There is a HUGE potential here.  Even small variation in the buffs, or slightly higher/longer ones for the more involved recipes is EASY.  And it would let us be more creative as well.
---
Personally, I'd like to see some more farmable flora types as well.  Pepper plants, grape vines, wild strawberries, wild onions, wild lettuce, etc.  
---
It never even got prompted. The objective went right to the uplink that was locked away
---
I hope they make it like a DLC with an aliens theme, where the project unintentionally attracted the flatwood monsters from outer space. China was very interested in this place too, and some places there are hints that aliens started the actual war. 
---
They mentioned it at the recent Con 
---
im kind of a sucker for CAMP building items, its my true endgame- making my CAMP amazing
---
Not selling ammo makes some sense though. The minimum price for anything is 1 cap, so 200 of any ammo would eat up all the caps a vendor has. It also helps you to focus your supplies to what you need and not hoard ammo you don't use. And it also helps in player trading, teaming or gifting when you have excesses of ammo you don't need. And not breaking them down also makes sense from a design standpoint. Why gather lead, steel, and gunpowder if you could just break down the ammo you don't use into new ammo. If you could do that, there'd probably be a need to lower the amount of ammo you can craft or find in the world. Without knowing how the ammo converters would work, putting on your tin foil hat is kind of useless.
---
Bethesda is now playing hold my beer with Activision and EA. 
---
That'll do it!  😂
---
Why not google Fallout 76 issues...Its not one thing.
---
And going back on their word isn’t something we wouldn’t notice. I am not the type of person to sit back and let things happen.
---
I like all the others, want Bethseda to hear me before its too late. This was a game that is suppose to last forever. Servers that never die.  
---
Your points are valid: requested features have development costs. Online games have expenses required to host and operate. 
---
Considering that the release cost and continuing digital purchase cost of the game is $60, what was delivered was a glorified FO4 asset flip with at best six months' work put into it. It's going to take them this first year after launch to deliver the game it should have been at launch. This includes Biv, Sheepsquatch, Faschnact, Nuclear Winter, Survival Mode, Wastelanders, Pioneer Scouts and everything else included under the 2019 roadmap. 
---
I have a good idea as to what kind of money they're spending ... and how much they made. They have no worries about 76 having fully paid for itself, their expenses and 76's hosting servers for well past the first year just from their pre-order revenue. Their income since launch has been profit regardless of source (Atomic Shop, additional copies sold after launch day, et al). 
---
The trick is that they're nearly half-way through that first year...
---
Yea I can hop on in 10 mins and send you a message 
---
Lol I don't think they're on a payroll. Probably just very young and impressionable. Beth looked at them once so now they think they have to whiteknight her for the rest of their days.
---
"don't critcisize pay to win because it makes the corporation I like look bad :(" 
---
I was about to comment that lol
---
It's an unlockable meaning you pay once and can craft them 
---
As in the shopping area
---
but a random person named Slyrentinal from the internet should? 
---
It’s almost too logical not to believe it’s a set up.  
---
Could be the same reason why we can’t re-spec perk cards.  Imagine them selling a perk card converter?   
---
I wonder where ..I guess upstairs in the resort?
---
Or just sunset sasparilla, as a recipe that gives the same benefits as a nuka-cola.
---
Yes, we need the horse armor but NO horses!!!!
---
My kingdom for a horse!
---
I mean technically speaking, the ranger armor would be viable Bc it’s made from us army riot gear so idk why they wouldn’t add it.
---
The Red Wedding was a betrayal. Bethesda giving me an option to buy repair kit plans (an option I wouldn’t be taking anyway) is just annoying.
---
But if that’s a betrayal in your eyes, that’s okay. I’m not here to tell you what to do with your atoms.
---
I doubt that will be the only event they drop from, it was used as an example. Also, If you have multiple characters you will notice atom shop plans span all characters on the same account. So it will likely be plans for them you are buying from the shop, not individual items with a one time use, or how would they do that? Give one to each character on an account? They would need to roll out an entirely new system within the atom shop which is unlikely without saying so within inside the vault.
---
I literally just made a post that mentioned people who want horse armour can fuck right off. Wtf haha. 
---
I doubt we would see it in the game though, as it was community content and untill we get that sort of support we won't see any non canon stuff.
---
Camden park and Morgantown airport 
---
Yeah, I bought a 'don't want it' emote and kinda disappointed that the animation is the same thumbs down animation:( Typing indeed takes so much time and inconvenient as hell, if only I could use a mic freely, man
---
Isn’t Apex Legends free?
---
I know its dorky, but I'd be down with a Skyrim Iron Helmet, or even a DOOM guy helm!
---
It is pretty damning that in the one area specifically about atom shop stuff they mention refrigerators and long distance scrap storage, the fact that you don't see it just makes me think you are deeply cognitive dissonant when it comes to this game and may need to take a break from defending it
---
Very likely.  
---
None of those things are pay to win. Cosmetics only was something that was said at the time because they had no other plans for it. 
---
at work..but I'll see what I can do once I'm home
---
How do u not get that Bethseda said the words themselves. They not my words.  😂😂
---
Can we buy ***any*** other in-game item's plans for Atoms? This is the trick.
---
sorry. adjusted my wording to be more clear
---
I don't see why not. You'll need to have some points in perception for the three tiered cards of rifleman (I wouldn't put more than one point in each, although you *may* want to max out perception so you can eventually). Gunslinger is in agility, but if you switch out those cards with sniper/sneak stuff you could be fine. It's going to take a while though.
---
So we should all just sit here quietly while they these companies fuck everything up? Noo you call them out publicly on there bs and hope court of public opinion will sway them. If not you go further. So congrats i guess your right they did win vs you. Not all of us are ready to give our world up to greedy shitbags though. I really hope you are some rich douchenozzle cause if not your defending people who see you as notging more than a dollar sign.
---
I feel you. I'm not too concerned about this, alot of people tend to forget this game requires upkeep, any online service demands maintenance and income to keep it operational. 
---
That said, they've stayed true to the word, we'ce had no competitive AS items and the repair kits don't fall in that category.
---
1. They can be earned in game.
---
2 They only repair an item and offer no competitive advantage
---
3 Atom points can be earned in game.
---
Fasnacht/Bic/Sheepsquatch etc are all free. The only reason you're paying for these, it's because it is a community request. No ifs no buts.
---
i agree, if they lowered the price of individual items in the ATOM store, id maybe actually spend real money for some, but $18 for a PA skin is ridiculous
---
Just don’t go playing in the quarry. Mirelurks, man. Mirelurks.
---
What I find bizarre is not only that they made this obvious blunder, but that this game has just been one blunder after another.
---
It's almost like they're doing a social experiment to see how much they can piss of customers. 
---
That’s the all point of these posts, to raise awareness and to avoid that. 
---
I’m not sure if they will succeed but this doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be vocal about that. 
---
If the game will be changed in a P2W I’ll stop playing for sure. 
---
Or music packs, or pip boy upgrades, or anything else that doesn't give an advantage in the game that people have been asking for!
---
I think most people are so vocal because they never want it to get to that point. Rather than playing wait and see, they want to make a hard stance on no consumables in the atom store.
---
They way it's implied, Repair Kits would be an infinite item in the atom shop. Ala "damn I gotta repair my weapon, let me dip x atoms". There are people who frivolously and frequently spend on such in game items to the point they would do it every time over repairing their weapon. Repairing a weapon in PVP mode would make you vulnerable because you would have to collect the resources and find a workbench while not properly armed. 
---
Okay so you can earn 300 atoms a week, that is cool.. but at the end of the day will it be enough to cover it each time your weapon break? Also do you really want to actively spend your atoms on in game items over everything else that will be coming to it? This will be contingent if they introduce these new character pvp sessions where people will bypass collecting/repairing to get an edge on everyone else.
---
I like to bring up MGS5 for this topic. In that game you can earn MB coins every week or buy MB Coins. MB Coins can be used for a couple of things, the biggest is spending it to speed up the development of new weapon plans you find during in game events. One of the most OP weapons was a tranq gun that can knock people out in one hit and without MB coins it would take 7 days to develop. There were people spending upwards of $50 to develop it on the day of the gun's release. 
---
White Knight was just brought in line with Power Patcher. Before the ''nerf'' you could repair your armor with like 1 plastic, 1 steel, 1 cloth and 1 leather, basically free, and you could go days without having to repair it.
---
And they just buffed the durability of most heavy weapons and some energy weapons by like 2-5x like a week ago. 
---
I disagree with a few of your points, but I’m not here to discuss those. I just wanted to thank you for your call to civility. It has been seriously lacking since this sub was created, and it cannot be stated enough that we need to be nicer to each other. If you’re a dick to someone, they will immediately stop listening to any point you are trying to make. Be nice, make your argument, then respond with a counter. So simple.

---
&gt;Basic Repair Kits will be unlockable in the Atomic Shop using Atoms you’ve purchased or those you’ve earned for free by completing in-game challenges.
---
You make a good point that it shouldn't be all on the devs, or the community people. 
---
It seems like somebody in sales is jockeying for a nice bonus come next xmas and they need to get those numbers up. 
---
It's not too late, this can be reversed (it probably will be) and the person or persons responsible can use this as a learning experience, like doing basic marketing research, for their next job(s). 
---
What system and wanna share some serums?
---
&gt;I would find it surprising if Bethesda didn't already know this was going to cause outrage.
---
This is the company that bait &amp; switched canvas bags to grocery bags. The decision makers are completely oblivious.
---
All BoS is t60. There is a red nuka cola paint for t51, and a blue nuka paint for x01. That's all the findable paints at the moment
---
It wasn't in the patch notes, but it changed for sure.  Unless it changes back soon, I'd have to say it's intentional
---
5-12k lol.  There are people offering 50k on trader groups and can't find a seller now.
---
It is a slippery slope. It only doesn't show their complete negligence of the promises they made, but it might serve as a slippery slope until more P2W things are added.
---
When the goal is to make as much money as possible from assets that have one significant cost to them there's no reason for them not to cut the prices to where they rake in the money from sheer volume. 
---
yeah im totally ok with nice clean skins for the ingame items like they did for the cooking stove red makeover
---
You need to take a step forward not back.
---
I would buy 2k atoms just for this armor.
---
I guess to me this is the line in the sand where it is officially pay to win.
---
Once the game is being tweaked to implement real money purchasable consumables it really becomes pointless to try and just face that with grind.
---
I'm struggling to find that :D  Don't suppose you have a link or anything?  Legit curious not trying to be difficult.  
---
No because there are no steam keys yet
---
In the inside the vault it says that they are thinking about adding refrigerators as an atom shop thing like the repair kits. 
---
I agree that it is a nice addition for when that happens in a pve situation. It's when some tool breaks his bloodied tse whatever spawn killing the same person for the 30th time, a quick trip to the atom shop and he can keep spawn camping. 
---
Clean camp items like clean freshly painted interior brick walls, curtains for my windows, faction flags, weapon skins, message board that you can enter text onto e.g I can have it next to my vending machine when it comes saying stuff like “today’s star item, BOS shielded plan only X number of caps” or one to have by your front door so you can type in “please shut the door.... because.... mole rats” that would be my dream item lol

"Basic Repair Kits are single-use consumables that immediately restore one of the items in your inventory, or an object in your C.A.M.P., to 100% condition."
---
It is the first sentence in the Inside The Vault about Basic Repair Kits.
---
You missed the part that I didn’t play them ever or know that they were autopurchasing from me until my bank called and told me that they saw a massive purchase amount that seems suspicious.... after racking up around $2500.00... and I had to take someone to court.
---
The complaint cycle is fun to watch unfold with this game.
---
Prices:
---
&gt;Why are things on the Atom Stop so expensive? -&gt;  
---
Why are things entering the Atom Shop pre-discounted?
---
Weapon metas:
---
&gt;Why is Melee OP and guns not as strong? -&gt;  
---
People with guns are OP in PvP.
---
More Weapon Metas
---
&gt;TSE is OP. -&gt;  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Why did they nerf TSE's?
---
Gimmies:
---
&gt;We want &lt;insert thing here&gt; -&gt;  
---
&gt;I wish they'd fix &lt;X&gt; instead of focusing on &lt;insert same thing here&gt;
---
Pretty sure people just like to complain about what's trending to farm Karma.
---
So now instead of hoping to find a weapon bench or wasting caps and time to fast travel home i can repair in place. Saving me caps time and having to rekill enemies when i fast travel back. This advantage is paid for. Sooo you are basically paying a small fee to save some time. Sound familiar? Sounds eerily similar to every single p2w mobile game where you can pay 10 tokens to get 10 more trys today.
---
But what with my king sushi ?!
---
It's a slippery slope.  Today it's not a big deal.  The next non-cosmetic may not be either, but the more you allow it without resistance the more they will push the envelope.  Then one day you wake up and they are selling special ammo or a mutation or whatever.  Far fetched? Maybe, but not impossible if people don't voice their concerns now.
---
&gt; If your weapon breaks and you don't have a spare you're getting pummeled regardless
---
That's my point... repair packs don't look like they will replace quick switching to another weapon.  If you are PvPing, you are still going to want to quick switch, not repairing.
---
In terms of the "it's QoL, not just cosmetic, so I hate it" argument... still on the fence about that.  It is true that a lot of games clearly have a "gem" system where you can buy shortcuts, and it seems like a lot of parts of the game become just an excuse to make you need gems.  I would hate to have to keep buying gems to play the damn game.
---
I guess for me it would depend on how playable the game is without the "gems" system.  If it is as playable as it is now, I have no problem with it.  If it keeps getting nerfed until I have to pay 2 play, then I'm out.  I already paid.  Heck... I'd rather pay for DLC then a "gem" system.
---
Well given their name, not pointing out the obvious it converts ammo you have to other ammo types.
---
If we can already craft ammo this ability is largely pointless, why gather lead, metal, gunpowder etc... if we can just convert ammo instead.
---
Ammo could've been sold and bought in packs with the cheaper ammo sold in 100's for a certain amount of caps and expensive ammo sold either individually or in lesser packs of 5-10
---
The food spoilage is a bug cause by the introduction of the fermenter. 
---
*grabs pitchfork* mother fuckers. 
---
When player vendors come out you won't have to worry about that sort of stuff. You will be able to pick up anything you need without having to interact with other players. Personally I don't blame you though, most people on 76 don't understand trading and it ends up being a very awkward situation, unlike in games with trading stores where prices can be set and you have to adhere to them if you want to make money. 
---
The thing about repair kits though, is would you not rather they were all in he base game, obviously we don't know the drop rate of the advanced one, but if it's only a queen drop, then most players will never see it. Rather than having one buyable with real money, why not just have it buyable from vendors or craftable.
---
Todd! You were the chosen one! You were supposed to bring pride to Fallout76, not shame!
---
You were supposed to help the community and not destroy it!
---
I swear to God I'm going to buy atoms, then repair kits not because I want or need them, but because the spazzs spamming posts are spamming so much, I cant find and read sheepsquatch news, which is all I really care about.
---
&gt; it loses its shit for the umpteenth time over barely anything,
---
I mean, gamers are well known for being unnecessarily hysterical, but I definitely don't feel like this is the community losing its shit over "barely anything".
---
FO76 is hands down the worst game purchase I've made since Colonial Marines. It's been one big disaster from start to finish and Bethesda doing stuff like this is really not helping. 
---
My whole view is that they never promised anything. People are putting words in Bethesda's mouths and crying about it. They clearly stated that when it was released "the atom shop contained no advantages over others" they never said that it never would add these to it.
---
They stated that it is a trial they are trying out, confirming it to be a new idea, once again they NEVER promised anything.
---
Agreed. They've been far too vague with the posts from early on. Transparency is highly desirable. 
---
Why wouldn't they roll out a new system if it made them more money? We've all seen how fast Atom store issues get fixed. Money talks. Corporate gives a rat's ass about your gameplay experience. The article does not mention anywhere that repair kits will be given as plans. In that case, making individual kits drop from SBQ is even worse. The article strongly indicates that kits will be individual items. Also, they likely have such a system in place already: the data mined info about the lunchboxes show that lunchboxes went to each individual characters and were not account wide. Of course, I'd be very happy to be proved wrong.
---
As for events dropping rare items, we all know how well that works. On any slow news day, this sub has three posts on how crap the RNG for the queen's loot table is. And then there are "rare" drops, like the Fasnacht masks. That went spectacularly well, didn't it?
---
They nerfed White Knight way back when making it more tedious to repair gear. Rumor on the street is they silent nerfed everyone's weapon condition in the latest patch. Currently, repair kits are not pay to win. But don't forget they're sitting on loot boxes (lunch boxes), just talked about salvage beacons (FREE mod from Fallout 4), and weapon converters. All of these could easily be implemented in a loot box with xp boosters and tons of other shit. If you see yourself complaining about that, it's best to make your voice heard now before it's too late.
---
Thx man
---
i think so too!
---
I'm just happy I'll no longer have to fast travel 7 times to do my cap run. I'm also hoping the WS vendors they're adding actually have the rare plans. Otherwise I'm back to server hopping for vendor bots.
---
No I can tell you for fact because me, a no lifer, has like a good 400 hours into this game, and food has been spoiling since the update of the Nukashine, now that may have seemed a bug at the time but it's suspicious.
---
Also Scrapper won't yield you thinks like screws, springs, just an abundance of steel and wood and rubber, maybe a lil more glass, but not the key components, so unless you wanna scrap that weapon and re- oh wait its gone whoopsies (unless you have a legendary effect).
---
But when you say it doesn't require a microtransaction, it still does. Because if you don't have atoms, done all the weekly quests and stuff, and you don't get many a day to make it viable to for ludicrous spending on the atomic shop.
---
With the logic you impose, lets just convert it to real cash. So lets set the scene, Where ever you live, you find a note of whatever currency you use on the floor. You then may go spend that money and maybe buy a small little treat at a kiosk. That is still a transaction. Just because you didn't directly pay for it since it didn't affect your normal money balance, doesn't make it not a transaction. A Micro-transaction is an in-game currency (not caps, the atoms) that you hand over the money and convert it, it essentially masks that it's real money by inflating the number and giving it a fancy name. when a PA paint costs around 3000 atoms, that can be directly converted as around (in USD, I figure USD is better for conversion rates(Because most stocks I own are bought in USD), even though I'm not american) 30 dollars. So just because you grind in the game, they still have a value, not as significant as directly paying for them, it doesn't stop the fact that others may just blow cash and buy them like that because they can't or be bothered to grind for atoms.
---
And all ontop of this, Pay to win mostly is put in the sense that it puts an advantage over others. Lets say 4 people in the burrows, all their weapons break because they didn't plan to bring extras and there's no workbench, but one out of the 4 buys a repair kit and uses it, but the other can't/don't want to. This puts an advantage on the person who bought it, meaning they'll have a better chance at survival. The other 3 who are not able to do this will be in the deep end while the one who used atoms, which breaks immersion to the game no doubt, will most likely suffer via dying or may be able to scavenge and find another weapon, which in my opinion is better because it makes it really a tense feeling of survival, not a "Oh my TSE broke, ima just buy a kit and repair that".
---
Also really man, don't go around just calling people children just because they don't agree with you, kinda scummish if you ask me.
---
Go sell dupes. 
---
100% this. "Your opinions dont align with mine and i find that offensive" kappa
---
People are interpreting their words to mean they promised it never would contain advantages.
---
Had the same problem, and confirmed- this is the solution.
---
Because Bethesda knows that the FO76 players who are left will never leave the game.  The remaining players are Bethesda’s battered wives.
---
Hopefully not random, current drop is already a random mess, if we travel to this mole to trade in our unwanted random for other unwanted random, what’s the point. Might as well keep farming for random instead. 
---
We should be able to trade in an item for a specific effect and reapply it to a similar item. Say when I scrap a stalker’s Gatling with 25% faster fire, I get to keep a token that says 25% faster fire for Gat, and I can apply that to my Furious Gatling. That would be the best way to recycle those legendaries. 
---
Was hoping there was a bos for my t51b. Oh well I guess I’ll stick to my blackbird!
---
You’re not getting it though. You admit I’m hardcore and you’re right, all my extra farming has been for getting all those extra hard to get hardcore mods. I have never needed to farm anything because I lacked materials to repair an item, since the day 1 of beta.
---
Like people are telling you, there’s junk everywhere, just open your eyes.
---
I actually want to test by putting something in the fermenter and having a copy in my inventory and see if it does have its cnd go down faster 
---
This actually makes me curious about something that I've never tried...
---
If you build a camp in an area that has a pulowski shelter in your camp's radius, can you place a lock on the door of the shelter?
---
Or a better question - can you place locks on doors that you haven't built?  Doors that are pre-existing parts of the area (like workshops for example.)
---
If you were able to, you would have a near indestructible hiding spot that someone would have to spend time picking the lock to get in to.  Or they could nuke the area, but that requires a lot more effort if they are gunning for you specifically.
---
GTA online proves you wrong.
---
I can see survival mode players buying a lot of these to repair gear rather than be vulnerable at a workstation, without having to fall back to adventure mode.
---
I see this as exploitation by Bethesda trying to force players into paying up. This lines up awfully well with the changes to armor repair perks.
---
I know on the other hand I fell terrible because last night my 3 man team added another to play with. We were all bantering and such but not being the most politically correct people. Were we just crashing on ourselves, but my friend Lily who is hispanic started calling herself a 'sp\*c' joking. The no mic guy messages me to say now his 2 year old daughter who is also hispanic can now say the word.  I felt so bad after that, so i understand not being able to use mic.  
---
In my early days my dogs would go crazy thinking I was just talking to no one or getting mad at them haha.
---
Not even nuclear fallout can stop the SJW.
---
Oh I have no doubt it will be reversed, they tried to test the waters with this and got a resounding no, I only hope in future they don't risk there reputation to get some quick dollars
---
Not the point I was commenting on.  I was simply saying that your argument that it definitely isn't a plan doesn't hold water.
---
As for making Quality of Life items something you can buy with atom$ (or win in game), I'm on the fence about that.  If they don't nerf things to the point of being unplayable, I actually don't care.  If it becomes pay to play, then screw it.
---
If you started a fight or dungeon below 100%, then you are a bad player, and I feel sorry for you, so sorry that I'll let you buy a kit to fix your items to a level that's STILL beneath my level of repair. 
---
Also camp is a free travel, costs nothing. 
---
Also - by adding a lesser paid item in the game they are adding a 150% item in the game on a boss, That is still lesser than what a player can do with perk cards. 
---
Say what you want, your only trying to convince yourself this is a bad idea, when in reality is provided no real advantage to a good player. 
---
Old man winter and the sun masks were never in the dev room as they were introduced closer to the time the event launched and after the dev room was moved to another world space making it inaccessible
---
Rainbow Power Armor paint would be fantastic.  Don't mind me, I'll just running around in Voltron themed power armor.
---
More weapon/armor skins, hairstyles/facial hair styles and more unique clothing items would all be great. There just isn’t much there right now. 
---
Weapon/armor skins also have the added benefit of making your item untradable—so other players won’t see and request it. I’d love skins for my handmade, and armor pieces. 
---
CAMP items are probably where I’d spend real money though. New floor, wall and lighting options would be a great start. They could make the decoratable stuff atom shop unlocks and I’d be totally fine with buying it. How ‘bout greenhouses and planters? There’s so many CAMP things that would work. 
---
They could also bring back items from previous games. The NCR Ranger armor could be slightly redesigned to be lore friendly and purely cosmetic—everybody would get it. 
---
The other thing that would sell like wildfire would be two person beds. There are lots of couples that play together and repopulating the wasteland is going to be difficult with only one person per bed. 
---
People would also pay up for some new underwear options. It doesn’t need to be anything overly suggestive, but we’ve all been out of the vault for a while now and those things are starting to stink. 
---
What about cosmetic utility items? Something like a washing machine that lets us convert dirty clothing to clean versions. I’m sure there are other things in this area too. 
---
50% longer chem duration
---
&gt;Now you have to grind for HOURS to repair your gear that breaks halfway through one of the cool new raids.  
---
&gt;Now you're frustrated and "fine I'll buy a weapon repair kit whatever."
---
No ill just stop playing, it works simple as that. 
---
Guessing they won't have them.  Otherwise, they wouldn't be rare and it wouldn't be cool to finally find them.
---
They said it's because it will break the economy. Even with vendors' limited caps, you will be selling thousands of bullets and wrack up a lot of money.
---
I have always been a wait and see kind of person. I am speaking about actualities. How things actually work now, and what they have actually said. There are many scenarios one could conjure up about what may happen. Until it does happen, i’d rather not sit here and bash people who have worked hard on something without anything having happened yet.
---
It's like they completely lack the self awareness. How could anyone at Bethesda think this will fly under our radars and it won't spawn a shitstorm.
---
Don't forget Fallout 2 inspired X-01 paint! I'm an Enclave officer; let me look like one!
---
I have a bloody melee character and a pipe double-dipping meta so it doesn't effect either. The pipe character goes actual weeks without repairs. That's not the point I'm trying to make. Cosmetics only was advertised as a stance they were taking. It was the one thing at launch received really well. People shouldn't be able to circumvent game mechanics by being able to pay more money than others. If a whale looks cooler than me, that's fine. It's their prerogative and I'm happy for them. If their gameplay experience is significantly better than mine just because their able to throw money at the game to avoid the grind then that is a problem as this isn't a F2P game. I already payed my 60 dollars. 
---
What worries me most is the mention of highly sought after features like fridges and ammo presses being mentioned as possible future content in the same paragraph as a repair kit. Not having to worry about weapon condition is one thing, but when the entire survival aspect is opt-in based on whether or not you're willing to pay then you are doing your other customers (who payed the going rate for a AAA release) a disservice by subjecting them to the same issues people run into on fremium mobile games dominated by a small minority of players that can afford to drop thousands on the game. That may sound like an exaggeration, but it happens with every single game that has these mechanics.
---
Legendary items so I can see some real P2W posts 😂😂
---
They reduce the effectiveness of perks that reduce armor damage and then monetize repair kits....
---
I have over 20 different bears if you include all the different colored tie Mr fuzzy.  I had a friend who was collecting them but he isn't speaking to me any further.  I'm going to scrap these bitches now.
---
I just re read the post, I really hope they were just speaking in general but it does look like there intent is atom store stuff. Which makes the uproar about the repair kits all the more prevelanr
---
MAXONS BATTLECOAT! 
---
It's an unlockable meaning you buy it once then craft it yourself
---
Exactly.  let me play devil's advocate for a moment, say they kept this feature and bundled in the next Paid DLC would people still complain its P2w?
---
Best mod is Brotherhood of Steel.  But it cannot be learned by scrapping and you must find the Plan for it.  Currently only available as a very rare random spawn or event reward. 
---
I have no problem with repair kits. They will definitely come in handy for the high lvl dungeons. It’s not like it’s a game changer. It’s not taking a low level character and making them OP or anything. It’s just a repair kit. Just my opinion. Also no need for the old slippery slope argument please. 
---
The outrage isn't JUST because of the repair kits being what they are, it's about the implication. Bethesda PROMISED that there'd ONLY be cosmetics in the store. Repair kits are not cosmetic, they have an effect on gameplay directly. This already is a sign that they're not taking their previous promise seriously, and it could very well lead to them selling other things that cross the P2W line.
---
I tire of people defending practices like this for no reason, usually it seems people just wanna be contrary just to feel like they're going against the norm, I've noticed that there's a lot of people who genuinely love having the "unpopular opinion" - whether to spark debate or just to rustle some jimmies.
---
Either way, whether or not you understand the implications of this action Bethesda have taken and the need to criticise it accordingly doesn't mean it shouldn't happen or that it's "fake outrage."
---
Cheerleader is an understatement. Prior to this post I thought you were a paid shill, I would have bet on it given your attitude towards anything critical..
---
Packs of camp items, sort of the way they bundled stuff like this in Fallout 4. If a pack contained, say, 25 types of interesting items, I might slap down 5-10 for it.
---
I don’t know if it was filmed... but some folks who were at Game Days were talking about it. They did say next Vault post will say more about those plans in it along with the new dungeon. 
---
I mean it is a crawl to find the fate of the Brotherhood... and if there is a quest you would get a ammo bench or fridge from that would be it.
---
I couldn't disagree with you more. Your opinion is based purely on speculation.
---
The community did pick up on this when it was first implimented, no one complained about their armor being too effective and thought it was strange that they nerfed them at the time, now we know by they did it 
---
I couldn't care less how it sounds. If it's a fact it's all that matters to me, everything else is just detail, and again it offers no advantage. Am i retricted from repairing my armour? No. Do you have an advantage over me? No. I can find them myself, nor will i need it manually repairing to 200% for an extra 50% in defense/offense statistics.
---
It's the same argument as "i never had enough junk to repair my weapon before i left camp"
---
P.S i have 600 hours, and i'm not complaining and i won't be buying them..... Get my point? 
---
It's not an advantage. At all.
---
Matching sets of furniture. Oversized nuka bottle statues or other nuka stuff. Sets of static weapon or armor models for wall hanging. Log cabin style building set. More importantly, if atoms were a bit more valuable, I would buy more of them. I would easily let go of $25 for 5000 atoms. I bought the blackbird paint with free atoms before I realized it was worth almost $20 which is ridiculous.
---
I didn't want to discuss the issue itself in this post, more the reaction of everyone about it. While I don't like the idea, people have a right to their opinion.
---
So Bethesda is threatening to commit fraud by breaking a public promise to keep things cosmetic only? Wow. And when I was thinking about buying the game to boot, guess I'll wait as F2P stuff rubs me the wrong way and goes against my gameplay experience not being a whale but a grinder. GG Bethesda, great way to kill your fan base. Go F2P if you're going to add it. Drip the inane price of the game. Stop being greedy. This is 2019. People are getting more and more disgusted with this kind of industry behavior. Stop it. Be a trend setter, not a trend follower. 
---
You agreed to play this game with the knowledge that those kinds of people CAN do this to you though in this game that they also purchased, right? They don't need to be assholes just because they are free to be, and you don't need to play nice either just because you can.
---
I like the idea that a new boss would drop fridge plans. If they wanted, they could add fancy skins to the atom shop for said fridge, just don't make us pay for the base model.
---
There no need to go angry indeed, but as long as you introduce a gameplay element into the store, it becomes pay to win , no matter one's opinion about it or if the perk gives only 0,00001% advantage.  
---
This is why people are mad about, and as soon as you say ok to these practises, then its open door for more and more p2w elements .
---
Spent 60 bucks on it like an idiot, stuck with it. Can't afford a new game , gotta make this one work. Made some great friends along the way, love hanging with them, it is what it is, I'll keep playing but yeah. It's not been without its total dumpster fires
---
- Skyrim Iron Helmet
---
- Doom Guy Armor and Helmet
---
- More Holotape Games for my Pip-Boy
---
You're entitled to your opinion, but I disagree with you.
---
It's more about intensity of coverage. The more bmVethesda sees, the higher the PR "cost" they're going to have to factor into the equation to decide if this direction is worth it for their bottom line. I don't think it's worth making an account over, but if you already have one go ahead and @them with a quick dissatisfied blurb. That will potentially turn off new players which is a much bigger red flag to the marketing team than discontent on a community I guarantee they've already categorized as core/loyal playerbase.
---
Agreed. If you want caps without hunting down players, the stations need to be safe zones
---
Holotapes?!?!? how would could that be considered P2W...I wonder...………..
---
I unironically want fallout 1 as a pipboy game. Also that grognak text adventure game from fo3. I think thatd be an acceptable atom shop item. 
---
At least you can still play. Im one of the unlucky souls who got wrongfully "temporarily" suspended. That was a month and a half ago and still haven't heard back yet. I have a ticket that has  been ignored for over a month and a half. Ridiculous 
---
This happens to me with enemies in PVE so its just a bug that needs squashing
---
Oh, I try not to kill a thing when I'm playing FO76 in front of my kids. I just don't want them to see a body exploding in blood lol My wife hates this game, honestly:(
---
I'm glad you know that. You're also entitled to your wrong opinion.
---
With over 5000 upvotes on some of those posts you can hardly claim that its "few people" can you ?
---
Or is your parainoia gonna tell you next that they are all fake accounts ?
---
Honestly I would buy atom shop stuff if the game was more stable. Once this game is in a good state, and has more content, I’ll buy atoms.
---
I wondered on this too. Upstairs makes sense. Either way, them having a pool of 1400 caps means we only have to visit one, once and we're done. It's gonna be so easy to save up to buy plans for PA mods now
---
&gt; It's a tricky situation since Bethesda truly did go back on their word, no matter how you spin it this change to the Atom Store goes against their promise of "only cosmetics" that we so happily agreed with. 
---
This part right here is what people are upset about, more so than what the repair kits actually do.  They're worried its a sign Bethesda will do more prominent monetized advantages once we're used to this one.  
---
weird. this has never happened to me with PvE but does with PvP, both Adventure and Survival modes.
---
Sadly, You're most likely correct
---
Their CEOs and such want more money. They always will. Bethesda is just easing us into the modern day way things are in gaming. We'll all be paying for loot chests within the decade, this is just them beginning it, little thing here, little thing there. We're a frog in a pot of water that is slowly being brought to boil
---
No, I’m not saying that lol. No one should dictate your life really, I just was commenting on your lack of knowledge on cheese. I hope it didn’t actually gross you out though since cheese is delicious.
---
People seem to think that its an item you buy.  I am of the opinion that the Atom Shop wouldn't support selling it as an item, and its a plan that unlocks for all your characters at once but has to be created in game.  
---
As far as I can tell though, *No One* thinks is a good idea, but some people aren't convinced its as apocalyptic an idea as others.
---
I hope its like when you learn any plan for consumables like, lets say, Disease Cure. The Disease Cure itself is a single use consumable. To be able to make the single use Disease Cure you have to find the plan and learn it(unlock it). I think it's the same thing here, just the only way to get the plans to make the Basic Repair kit is with atoms, but once you get that you can make however many you want without spending more atoms other than that one time 'unlock' fee.    
---
I share the same concerns as you with the snowball effect of this item though. If this is a 1 time only item that works how I think it does, it wont be a problem.
---
Faction related PA paints (like for the Responders and Free states) and maybe some paints for the Raider PA, since that seems unloved at the moment.
---
Definitely Definitely new paint schemes for guns, along with melee and armour. I think the new lever action skin is gorgeous and more like that will be great.
---
Maybe some unique outfits, such as better looking ragged clothes, or winter jacket like coats (and for me and I know some others before have said it maid outfits(I mean c'mon its just to fit in with the maid Ms Nannies at whitespring(Insert lenny face))) but I don't think under armour would benefit much since you don't see it.
---
Maybe small mini game activities for C.A.M.P.S and just some nicer looking walls like log cabins, hidden doors as others want, some nice new lamps with animations (Like the fish bowl lamp that was gorgeous) and also some nicer looking bar stools. But of course, a bar themed mega drop of stuff like bar counters.
---
Also maybe some things to better promote player vending like signs where you can type what you want and leave it like that, and not have to stick like 50 little letters.
---
Turret skins may be nice to some people, but also just general workbench skins that look nicer and works (looks at Vault Tec workbench).
---
Also hell the VTU jumpsuit that goes over armour because it looks great honestly XD
---
There were a few old man winters grabbed from the dev room, and none of the other rare masks have surfaced.
---
If there was a realistic chance you grab some of the masks, there would be at least a single Jester or Beekeeper.
---
Even if it's plans for the kit from the atomic shop, isn't it a clear breach of trust when they boldly said that AS will be cosmetics only? Should we really stand back and let them do this and convey the message that we are ok with them doing whatever they want? Bethesda is not doing us a favor by making content for this game. We paid them for it. We paid them for content that we expect them to make in future. Imagine buying a house, but then when you go, the previous owner says that you need to pay extra to get water in the bathroom. Sure, you can get water from elsewhere and us it in the bathroom, but the extra payment would give you an extra "convenience", just like repair kits are an extra convenience for people who can afford it. It just paves the way for the owner cutting off access to your bedroom next and asking you to pay more for it, even after you paid for the house in full.
---
I used to dislike the idea of using the weight reduction perks in place of combat stuff, but these days I happily run Traveling Pharma, Bandolier, AND Thru Hiker. I never have to worry about picking up too many aid items or ammo.
---
At the Bethesda Days of play fallout 76 panel Todd said the wastelanders dlc is gonna change the game drastically
---
Happens to me all the time. Standing right in front of an enemy with 0% chance to hit, just to exit vats and punch them normally.
---
Actually, I'm curious. What is it that you disagree with? the notion that people should be disillusioned and angry with blatant BS business practices or my assessment of the situation?
---
That is an excellent point that deflates my argent at least partially.  Does this bo us apply to all weapons armour and perk loadouts?
---
Fortnite made 3 billion in profits off cosmetics alone. If you are providing cosmetics people want, you bet your ass they can keep the lights on. I support developers I like. I will buy atoms if they remain cosmetics only as a show of support. I will not play a AAA title with fremium mechanics.
---
This sub has 180 000 subscribers so 5000 is a few. 
---
Well I guess in the off chance that they aren't listening, I won't be spending/wasting any dailies earned atoms on vanity skins and items if there's potential for a fridge and an ammo converter that might be for atoms :|
---
&gt; they are blatantly making one of the big selling points of the game a point of false advertising at best. Honestly it could be argued to be a bait and switch, as they baited people in with promises of x, and then substituted in y instead.
---
Conferences and interviews are not considered "advertising" in this context, so what they say then is not binding in any way. It would have to be stated on actual promotional material.
---
That’s what I’m saying, I’m tired of all these posts, these people need to contact Bethesda directly.
---
I say we stage an assault on their main offices!
---
it's obvious at this point that they're not going the right the wrongs. How much more abuse do you all care to enjoy before taking the walk? 
---
I figured I'd be able to come back at some point when the game was, well, finished. Not looking so hot now. They haven't added a single thing that appeals to me since I left. I don't care about the broken survival using existing characters, I don't about crafting booze, I don't care about building non-functional housing, I don't care about  maintaining food, water and meds as it has NO place in this game (save for survival mode), I don't care for farming caps for 3 days to afford a flashlight on my PA.
---
I don't know what you're all seeing here, but I wish I did.
---
oh i’m talking about VATS never actually activates. like no one is even there.
---
Your speculating. This doesn't negate any in game factors and dosnt give any one an advantage in any situation. Furthermore as i stated in the original post, everyone earns atoms.
---
It applies to all weapons and armor unless it's bugged like grognaks axe which can't be overrepaired for some reason. The regular repair packs won't be able to overrepair regardless of what perks you have equipped. 
---
Dude, i have like 450 hours in this game and i have bough like 4-5 items from the shop. They are releasing free game content all the time, i have very few complaints compared to other actual pay to play/win games tbh.
---
Taking it out of context bub... it’s a paragraph on community ideas and suggestions.
---
Also you do know that if you read the article in question it sounds more like they are doing a public beta for the kits with a limited way of getting basic ones... maybe to see if they work. The advanced are obtained in game free... so again sounds beta-ish and like a gear up to just making them all craftable via a plan found or received in game.
---
I guess we’ll have to wait for their response. I don’t want to rush to judgement. 
---
Of course it is based on speculation. I offered my opinion not a statement of fact.
---
If you have an xbox, battlefront 2 is free on games with gold rn and I hear we are getting a free weekend on the handsome jack collection.
---
My gf recently picked up trove and it's free and kind of fun if you don't mind the graphics.
---
Warframe is a great time burner if you need a place to spend a couple months grinding while saving up for different games.
---
If you're a star wars fan and haven't gotten it yet, star wars battlefront 2 regularly has been going on sale for 10 bucks or less and they have pumped a bunch of free new content into there recently.
---
Just trying to help you find some stuff to play with in your drought.
---
After this was discussed in an earlier thread, it's been looming in the back of my mind on why certain things in 76 behave the way they do.... And I'm of the mindset that the Pulowski being protective against a Mini Nuke sadly was not a conscious decision by Bethesda :(
---
From what I've experienced, it seems that the only reason for that is because of the way the engine handles explosions and if there's no Line of Sight to the point of detonation, it seems all of the damage (or at least the majority of it) is blocked by whatever obstruction is between you and the explosion.
---
That's at least what grenades have been teaching me. Granted, a metal office desk or building wall *(since they'd be thick plaster and wood paneling in this 50's era construction)* *could* save you from the Frag Grenades, but I'm not sure a Plasma Grenade would be too phased by it. heh 
---
I'll have to do some solo work to see how much of this actually turns out being true... All I know is in terms of the mobs we fight, they seem to take far less damage than one would expect when their position is occluded by some relatively flimsy object :P
---
I'm on PC, thanks for the reccos though
---
I had never noticed extra dmg on my lever, just picked up that perk card a week ago.  I will.need to go check that out.  Thanks for the info.
---
&gt; It was never an issue.
---
It was an issue to me
---
Actually the way that it's implied they are going to be an unlockable as everything else in the atom store is. This means that you will pay for it once and be able to craft them yourself. They even used unlocked as the word for obtaining them. 
---
Wasn't it that regular version will be Atom shop exclusive. 
---
Blame capitalism and false scarcity. Unless we regulate this shit, we'll only see more of it. Mobile games are like the STANDARD now when it comes to Pay to Progress.
---
I think PtP is incredibly anti-disabled folk and should be banned. It's like gambling except worse because you can't win your money back.
---
I wouldn't say you cant learn it by scrapping. I scrapped a leg or arm last night and oddly got the BOS mod.
---
Hearing other opinions doesn’t mean you can’t form your own.
---
I agree with this but even with the slippery slope... as long as everything stayed as plans and stayed cheap enough to buy with "earned atoms"I'd be fine with it. 
---
But at the end of the day FO76 has repeatedly disappointed fans and continuously degrades fans trust, so it's hard to trust Bethe$da not to fuck us here as well. 
---
&gt;  also wonder with the real "haters" of the Repair Kits, how long they have played and or if they are still playing..
---
Over 200 hours, and yes, I do still play... for now.
---
Np! I had no idea about it at first either. Someone on the discord told me about it and I was super surprised
---
yes and looking at how it is the most-upvoted thread in the entire sub of the entire time since the sub has existed with the one the is coming closes having barely half the number of upvotes, this should tell you that it is not "a few" but the majority of the active users.
---
Can a hotdog even spoil?
---
All I want is a Fallout 2 inspired X-01 paint job. I just want to look like the Enclave officer I am.
---
Yeah I hope they at least see the backlash and say "maybe this is a bad idea". However I have lost all hope that gaming companies are decent people. Gaming companies in general have fucked over their customers way to often.
---
Yeah I thought about packaging ammo, but since it's still pretty easy to craft and find excess ammo, you'd still hit that 200 cap pretty easily, imo. Plus you'd still hoard ammo, even easier if they were packaged.
---
And what I mean by not knowing how the ammo converters will work is what the ratios and cost would be. And what it can convert them to. Does it convert them to mats(I wouldn't call that converting though, so maybe unlikely) or other ammo types? Can you convert ballistic to non-ballistic? Do you need additional mats to make the conversion work? Is the ammo converter a machine or is it a single-use consumable item(don't know how that would logically work but it's possible)?
---
Point is, we don't really know what effect it can have until we know how it actually functions. And I seriously doubt they'll lower the amount you can craft or find, that's easy to see if they change it. I haven't noticed this claim that food is spoiling faster, but that may be harder to quantify on both sides. I don't know if there's some confirmation bias going on or if it's actually happening.
---
If it is a major selling point of how they promote it, then it is a form of advertising.  Just like if I went and announced that product x I was making had y, it would be advertisement.  The fact that people say it isn't advertising is absurd.
---
Agreed, adding to this people keep forgetting you can EARN ATOM IN GAME
---
Additionally the Improved one is only AVAILABLE IN GAME
---
But we don't know if the regular one is ATOM SHOP ONLY or in additional to IN GAME (preferred)
---
As long as the price is reasonable, say 40-60 ATOM, which is easily  earn able IN GAME daily I see no problem with it.
---
People need to stop looking at the ATOM SHOP as a store and more like what it really is, Unlockables. Remember when in Mario who had a score and it meant NOTHING? Now you can trade in your score to get skins and now a convenience items.
---
That's perfectly cool with me.
---
It costs caps to travel back to where you just were farming from your camp but nice try on that piss ignorant arguement.
---
 Clearly though im just a shitty player for not constantly checking my weapons repair status. Evidently using the same gun enough to break it in the same scrap run makes me a "bad player" too eh? 
---
No what you are really saying in all of this is "this doesnt affect me directly so it isnt a bad thing." Let me guess your probably white so "racism isnt really that big of a problem cause i never see it". Just because a problem doesnt directly affect your life doesnt mean it isnt a problem.
---
They look brand new and fresh off the grill...ha! 
---
&gt; If it is a major selling point of how they promote it, then it is a form of advertising.
---
As I said, not in this context.
---
&gt; The fact that people say it isn't advertising is absurd.
---
I don't make the rules.
---
I want a Moo Moo to carry all my CHIT!
---
Wait so how to you get in or out the cave exactly? As I recall, the section you walled is the only entrance. Do you fast travel directly inside?  
---
Also this is a GREAT optimization of the space. Love it.
---
ooh or they could open up that closed off area
---
No.  You learned the Brotherhood of Steel paint job for the Combat Armor Helmet.  It can be learned by scrapping any piece of combat armor. But it is not the same as the Brotherhood of Steel mods for combat armor. 
---
If you act like an asshole you are an asshole.  There is no reason in game to do this.  Bethesda should fix it.  It’s no different than the legion of people bitching about what they sell in the atom shop.  You knew they could sell whatever they want when you bought the game after all.   
---
It’s honestly confounding that this was even something they came up with.
---
No ones arguing that a repair kit is inconsequential.  It's the fact that Bethesda is adding something that affects gameplay that you can get for money _instead_ of grinding.  The first of many to be sure.  When people start buying these, Bethesda will add more things, and eventually we'll get to the point where you _can_ buy legendaries, etc.  The slope is slippery.
---
Fallout 2 inspired X-01 paint. I want to look like a proper Enclave soldier.
---
So the ranger armor won’t have any DR, and be cosmetic only? Because if not, how is it any different than the repair kits?
---
I have literally been saying the same thing. People also don't seem to understand that this will be an unlockable meaning you'll be able to craft it yourself not buy them over and over
---
You can make it sound like a lot of things. If you want to do a beta, do a beta like Survival Mode. You are completely making up the part about the gear up to making them craftable. There's nothing "beta-ish" about selling these in the shop.
---
And as for advanced ones being obtained in game for free, they will never be as easily obtainable as the ones in the store, forcing people to consider buying them just for sheer convenience. Pearls are available for free under the ocean, you could just dive in and get them. But people still go to jewellers, right? You could farm your own crops, raise your own cattle, but we go to the grocery because it's convenient. 
---
I just don't like the concept behind it. I've been burned by enough pay to win games, so it's like a PTSD ... Hopefully we're wrong. 
---
Great RP post lol 
---
I hope you promptly recover from your wounds after that  journey through the Yao Guai's digestive system!
---
That's a bit of a odd bug if its for the helmet lmao. I'll have to check when I get home if I know all the BOS stuff, apparently I've got the chest and arms, hopefully I have legs too xD.
---
Thanks I found the one I was looking for it was the civil war era dress now I look incredibly stupid!
---
I mean, from the term "repair kit" it implies that it is an advantage over having to find a work bench to repair gear that way. It's the super convenient factor and by the sounds of it (not 100% sure) it will repair your gear without consuming materials. The advantage is definitely there over a simple cosmetic item, as it effects gameplay in a directly positive way for the purchaser.
---
I'm not speculating about the reason for people's outrage, it's clearly that Bethesda broke their original promise of "Cosmetic Only." Everyone's concerned that if they're willing to break the promise and sell these repair kits, that they'll sell more egregious gameplay-effecting items in future.
---
Yes, everyone can earn Atoms, that is true. However, once you've done most challenges that aren't weekly or daily, it becomes a purposeful slog to earn them, thus encouraging the purchasing of said Atoms.
---
you mean mods? the ones we have to break down a million off for the chance to maybe find the one we want? Or some other kind of Mod?
---
Cause i would have no problem with them selling a Recipe (cause that would work on all characters and multiple instances of a gun) for a particular mod. Its possible in game but is a Huge Grind, i really have NO problem with Bethesda letting us trade our in game points to reduce the grind.
---
Agreed, it's almost willful ignorance. As if we had to explicitly say "we want this thing, but not in the atomic shop."
---
fixed it, better inventory mod was the culprit.
---
I still recall my obese jedi that ran around in his undies...good times.
---
Yeah, repair kits remove/alter an aspect of the game for those willing to pay. No need to spend play time farming materials to repair anything.
---
This can be both a benefit to some and an annoyance to others. It depends on how you value your play time and what you enjoy doing with that play time. Bethesda is counting on this being a desired benefit.
---
The question for me is... Did Bethesda alter the game design with the intention of giving a pay mechanism to reduce or eliminate certain aspects of the game.
---
It’s not a bug.  It’s by design.  And mods learned thru scrapping are not specific to the arm/leg/torso.  You can learn every mod (that can be learned this way) for leg and torso by scrapping just arms.  
---
Two shot is fine unless you use vats. There is a severe loss in accuracy in vats that makes two shot horrible. 
---
Even better, I can see into the past. History repeats itself, and there is definitely a history of shit like this only being a first step.
---
Not to mention the fact, again, that Bethesda literally said as much in their blog...
---
They where looking to implement refrigerators yes. It’s not a fact they are coming . And food on you will spoil if you don’t carry a refrigerator on you’re back that is . 
---
I feel like the white knight perk is useless now. My armor is breaking at an alarming rate. To be honest it’s a little ridiculous.  Nerfing it will not make me buy repair kits. I’ll just suck it up and continue repairing at a workbench every ten minutes. 
---
You have ample opportunity day after day week after week to earn Atom's maybe you can't buy it in the 1st 24 hours… but that doesn't mean you can't obtain it through grinding. We also don't know the price point on these as I stated earlier...  I'm speculating, like everybody else, that they might be reasonable.
---
This is not hard evidence, that you’ve “noticed it,” and exactly what I was saying: no one can prove the rates were altered without datamining. 
---
\^\^\^This. Im all for letting Bethesda know Repair kits as an Atom shop Purchase is bad. But lets not fly off the handle and start accusing them of being malicious in their balancing.
---
That was only an example that was given
---
I think you're missing the point, it doesn't matter whether the item is p2w, the item isn't cosmetic.  Pay 4 convenience is the same sort of shitty microtransaction that most people don't want and this is what Bethesda is trying to do.  I get it, you would rather pay money for items rather than play the game for them?  That would be fine with me except games which go this route stop being designed for play and start being designed for pay, shitty systems which can be circumvented be with cash.  This is the problem.
---
It's literally a microtransaction. 
---
Then why are you here? Honestly. Why comment on a subreddit for a game you do not play and have no intention of playing?
---
That's not how it works. It's still a microtransaction.
---
Have you tried completely emptying it?
---
Because the industry knows that all the complaining in the world on discussion forums doesn't translate into lack of $. This is a business model that works.
---
Shutup already 
---
Are you trying to store all junk?   If it tries to put one very large stack of items in first, and cannot fit, it will not store any and give you that message. 
---
Try putting just one item in manually.  
---
But with that logic,  you've taken away some people's reason to live. 
---
Bethesda has said themselves that this is the best place for feedback.
---
It is called flooding for a reason, by your logic, ie "leave the high quality posts alone" you know what r/fo76 would look like in a day?
---
99% of all posts would be on Repair kits with 1 or 2 others topics between them and being lost as well as fracturing the community as they would not know which topic to post their thought on Repair kits to go because theirs 40 of them
---
Oh, it totally did, but i still ate cheese with my dinner = )
---
Ok. Why do you downvote everyone that disagrees. It’s not a good way to come across as good willed 
---
[Tell that to Blizzard](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/family/world-of-warcraft#mounts).
---
Considering the uselessness of armor resistance in pvp is, I have been thinking about the viability of a berserker weapon. You could run around in wood sent assassin armor with minimal Dr and full health while maximizing berserker output. It's kind of an antibloodied build.
---
So just ignore the part where I point out you can absolutely work 8-5, Mon-Fri and *still* play 45 hours a week? Unfortunately for you, you can't just buy a better argument. You're honestly just making yourself look like an ass. 
---
Imagine if you didn't have to simply by telling Bethesda "no" ?
---
same here, i couldnt care less about repair kits. It all depends on how you play the game. I play the old style, 500 hrs in and only lvl 115. Exploration and survival is everything for me. I dont care about PVP.
---
The only thing I wish I will never see on 76 is a real p2w item, like crazy legendary weapons/armor/PAs that actually give you a huge boost in PVP. It wouldnt be fair.
---
But if they add more stuff like increased stash space/camp budget I will be more than happy to support the devs by buying those extras.
---
I think that when a game deserves to be supported with transactions we must do it, according to our financial possibilities. This people is working hard, every day, to make us enjoy a huge game like this... to make FREE DLCs (dont forget guys, It's 12 years of xbox that im so used to PAY for every single sometimes stupid and useless DLC)... to simply make the game better and better.
---
Sorry if probably lot of people does not agree... but this is what I think, and sorry for my english which is not that perfect.
---
Cheers and enjoy the wasteland
---
You are my hero.
---
So every time you spend caps you have made a microtransaction
---
A beast weapons isn't a beast weapon unless it's overrepaired. It'll be worse than when you started with it by a large margin
---
So why not make PA cheaper to repair? They said they want us to spend less time repairing, right? So why make the grind longer and then add paid methods to skip the grind?
---
Don't forget to scrap all the extra shotguns to learn the mods for them.
---
daily and weekly, also if you make a alt the Character ones are new on them so for each character you have the one time character ones + account wide daily and weeklys
---
If you're listening Bethesda I've been making MMOs since the early 00's and I have this person's vote ✨
---
The top voted one. That's how reddit works.
---
I mean, I haven't bought shit from the Atom Shop, haven't really encountered a lot of bugs outside of the usual Bethesda stuff. I'm having fun with it.
---
Honestly, you're allowed to say what ever you want anywhere you want, but what compelled you to post this? Like, you've apparently not played the game, so why did you care enough to think about your sentiment and post it?
---
Never knew that, kinda just expected whatever I learn is for whatever I scrapped. Thanks for the info 😁
---
&gt;i need a shower stat!
---
Next patch:  New shower stall added to Atom Store!
---
Good job too. You would have been banned from FO76 as well.
---
Dreadlocks.
---
so EVERYONE who has posted that they "noticed" it, enough that it was "noticeable" that they came to reddit to post about it, you think we are all making things up for no reason!?!?!?!??!?! how can you deny all these people saying the SAME thing??!?!?
---
Wow
---
Paints. All the paints. Statues. Power armor displays.
---
They don't make challenges buggy. A bug is an unintended side effect of a code change. 
---
Yeah mine is the same way too still
---
The problem with having it all on one server like they wanted is the Balance is truly fucked. When players can become one hit killers then the ability to self police/regulate is thrown out the window. You will just have assholes who just come in and kill everything because they did the OP build. 
---
+Karma
---
\*shitposting intensifies\*
---
Actually it looks like you would have gotten perk cards from them and they would be tradable between players. 
---
First, I've heard quite a few people acting like a repair kit is some Uber powerful game breaking addition and to me that's hyperbole. 
---
My point is that if the community response is simply, no you can't release anything, they're just going to ignore the community for being unreasonable. 
---
I personally think that the repair kit is actually a very acceptable blueprint for future additions and I think making the support clear that items added always need an equivalent or better version available in game and that so long as atoms remain plentiful I'm less upset at things costing atoms. 
---
That's my take on it. YRMV
---
Can’t wait
---
By having the ability to purchase repair kits with real money I can essentially eliminate junk farming altogether, being a level 168 I already have perfect weapons to use and a perfect (in my opinion) armour set , I won’t have to waste ANY TIME AT ALL on gathering materials to fix ANYTHING  . 
---
I can essentially get ahead of anyone of similar level with grinding for caps  and plans.
---
Do you know how flux is made? It’s QUITE a process, usually takes 2 NUKE DROPS to farm raw flux in one spot and additional materials at another, weapons armour and CAMP structures that require flux to be repaired can just be PAID FOR. 
---
Please tell me how that isn’t PAY TO WIN?
---
Please stop spreading false information. The Basic repair kits can not be found in game and will only be available through Atom shop purchase. 
---
It’s a micro transaction because you can pay to get an advantage. It doesn’t matter how small you think the advantage is; it’s still Beth taking money to make the game easier. 
---
This isn't a normal game life cycle tho.
---
This game will continue to be updated with content as time goes on.
---
It started with 45-60ish hours of main story time depending on how fast you play.
---
They will continue to add quests and dungeons over time. The new content that is beyond the scope of a AAA game single release will need to be paid for. Unlike charging everyone $15-25 for a DLC pop it is financed thru voluntary MTX.
---
&gt; i feel sorry for u all
---
I feel sorry for you you cannot grasp that.
---
Woah man this post is waaay old.
---
Yup. I'd like Survival mode to heavily reduce or mitigate all the legendary prefixes and mutations. A standard human vs human experience, though many may not like that
---
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
---
In other words, better to stop something bad form happening than try to clean up the mess after it does.
---
They were going to be used for perk cards since they were originally going to be tradable but they changed it to use the current system instead. 
---
This may actually be a perfect compromise solution—and one that could be expanded on if the balance of free vs paid atoms needs additional tweaking. 
---
My speculation is that the repair kits (and maybe other future consumables) are designed to be atom sinks. Low priced items that will gobble up the free atoms many of us have been sitting on for months. Those big atom banks are probably making it so that the ratio of free vs paid atoms is heavily skewed toward free. 
---
Instead of selling these items, make them challenge rewards, replacing some of the challenges that currently award atoms. It could be done with other things too, like stimpaks, disease cures or hard to find components like ballistic fiber. More difficult challenges could be used for things like CAMP refrigerators or ammo converters. 
---
They should never sell those items for atoms, just use them as challenge rewards. 
---
In doing this, they could focus on better cosmetic items for the shop and with a slower flow of free atoms, those items will in turn be more profitable. Everybody wins. 
---
The game needs to generate money, I think everybody is on board with that reality, but there are lines that shouldn’t be crossed. Something like this would help accomplish both goals. 
---
Jesus repair kits are not pay to win. I mean my godddddd. The collective REEEEEEEEEE over this non issue is embarrassing. Also, no one knows for sure if repair kits are a plan that you buy once to craft, or how much they cost. Also, repairing is.....easy? Also also, pay to win what, the OPTIONAL survival mode you need to choose to enter? This is pay for convenience, a largely accepted and common monetization technique. Keep filling those diapers though.
---
you know those costumes are totally achievable with in game grinding, within a month of buying the game i had earned, just from playing the game, 2k atom, i normally earn about 200 a day when i play. And i don't play to farm i play to have fun and my character is 101, and has completed all the non event quests and i still earn about 100-200 a day
---
I could have EASILY afforded any costume i wanted (and i did buy a few), without spending a dime, but mostly i like the get emotes and poses but if i wanted to i could EASILY afford a costum after a week of game play.
---
TLDR: The Costumes are EASILY earn-able in game.
---
I'd just like to point out that literally in the first paragraph of that link they say they won't be adding items that affect gameplay. Tell me how being able to repair weapons without a weapon workbench doesn't affect gameplay. Then apply that to the potential fridges, unloading of scrap items without going to a stash box, and the other ideas Bethesda mentioned in the latest inside the vault. 
---
I, like many others, don't appreciate being told "we won't do X" and then a few months down the road they try to do X.
---
My dear friend... let me tell you something. You lost one of the best games ever.
---
Don't feel sorry please, we don't need it. Mostly everyone which is reading and posting here is enjoying Fallout 76.
---
Cheers
---
I say non-cosmetics are fine but don't put iteams that are importent in there like repair kits
---
Oh well guess you're are a bigger no lifer than me, I'll give you that, I do have studies and lectures to go to which lessen my average play time. But did you not read my environment of the dungeon situation? If that turns out true, repair kits will have a whole advantage on over others who don't use them. These dungeons are labelled as high level and challenging, so it can mean the matter of life or death for some lower levels or just maybe not as co-ordinated players. If you can't care less, its not all just about you. More people are against this than for it, which clearly show that most players (I know not all players jump onto forums or the Reddit, but majority here, because people have made polls and most people say "Its pay to win" or "I do care and don't want this") do not want this, for the sake of this games reputation and the stuff they were told when this game was first announced.
---
You won't be buying them then, why defend them? 
---
When you say you can find them, Bethesda gave the SQB as an example of events that you'll get it from. That already says a lot by the standard that it's not that easy to find/obtain without having to put large efforts. Unless you want to do a battle where your guns will break either way mid-fight or so, unless you conveniently have you camp in the zone and have a hazmat suit when you entered PA (or just a Hazmat suit by itself), the standards to get the advanced repair kits are in the a form that will already be tough enough of a challenge, and some may just shell and break, buying the kits. Your gun may not break, but thats if you switch between guns. I've used 50 cals 200% repaired and still have had them break after using for the entire battle non-stop, and with items such as ballistic block (which hasn't been fixed as of yet), degredation of weapons is faster when it's applied, which doesn't help at all.
---
It's an advantage for sure overall. If it was in-game and not atomic shop, it would be an advantage still, but one that everyone will have access to (not by having them on them at a given time, but that it isn't locked away unless they pay for it, just that you need to find it), and this wouldn't cause much of a riot as this is causing.
---
Also hell, I'm overloaded with junk in my stash, so the argument brought up doesn't directly apply to me, so you're aware ;)

Just want to say, if you buy one of these with money, thanks for ruining gaming.

This exactly.  How many times did people run the Fasnacht event in the hopes of getting a rare but useless *mask?*

Are you PC? Dm me if you are and want me to sling a few your way.

Chats on open mic after sbq fight is always amusing, you hear a lot of ‘come on another rolling pin?!!’ ‘Hey I got a stalker’s tire iron! Anybody know how to use it?’ It’s just hilarious and also sad after all the hard fight. 
---
Considering they nerfed the repair perks/degredation reduction perks, still don't have conditions at a reasonable level with how 'bullet spongey' most enemies are, and the near constant shortage of certain materials that are needed in large values for repairs of said 'rare' materials.....it seems like they are trying to shoehorn/push people into using the atom shop instead of doing on of the main things in the game, scavenging.
---
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
---
 In other words, don't assume. 😀
---
Not implementing it into the Tinker's Workbench does lead me to believe they want to add it to the atom shop. But, that's speculation. 
---
I've only fermented or crafted fermentable alcohol once. My food all spoils much faster than it did prior to the patch. I'm guessing they changed the spoilage rates since it seems tied to the fermentation rate of fermentable alcohol outside the fermenter. It could have been deliberate or an accident. Kind of like how they messed up the headlamps for a minute when they copied one of the templates for creating a mothman version for the atom store.
---
Basic kits won't drop in game unless something new was posted that I don't know about. 
---
Advanced kits are the ones that drop in game
---
I'm not. I escaped. And guess what... I'm not happy! I'm back for revenge...
---
Well it certainly drove lifelong Bethesda players away, and I’m staying away. I’m subscribed to this sub to find out when this game is no longer a trash fire, but Beth keep putting their foot in it. 
---
Yea people are confusing what we are arguing. **We realize that its a non cosmetic in the Atom Shop and we don't like that.**  However accepting that it is, and its gonna be put there, we are looking for the silver lining. Being that its probably the unlockable plan we are buying with atoms, not the consumable itself. If its the consumable itself and we wont be able to craft it in game, that is complete and utter dogshit and they deserve more hate than they are getting. I hope they aren't that foolish though.

we're reaching a break point, wonder how people will react when the next online game says "fine you don't want a store we'll go back to the method that no one complained about AAA Game is 60% to buy but if you want to play it past the first month is going to be 5.99 a month"
---
Anyone else rember how their was a monthly subscription for EVERY online game? I do. Microtransation which are OPTIONAL are better then a subscription that YOU NEED TO PLAY THE GAME.
---
Now that's PTW
---
hahaha game will be abandoned in 6 months like anthem already is. the only update u will get is more atom shop stuff 
---
I agree.
---
How about making games worth spending money on? Instead of buggy messes? 
---
* Raider Power Armor Skins - The Raider PA are slapped together, they should look completely inconsistent and random.
---
* Atom Cats PA paintjob
---
* Decals for Armor, PA, and guns.
---
* Hairstyles, Beards, Scars, Tattoos, Make up &amp; Jewelry.
---
Well, you’re gonna have to. Got delayed till May. Sorry buddy.
---
For a minute? If you buy any power armor skin from the store regardless of what model it's for you can make the headlamps for all models. Since the fermenter was a new mechanic my guess is that they messed up when implementing it. 
---
Your lucky, you should have seen how bad it was two months ago 😂 no joke it was prob 5 times worse.
---
But in all honesty it’s hit and miss. Some days I will get a bit of lag and other days it’s just flawless. 
---
I think it really depends on how many people are online worldwide effecting the servers. 
---
I'm surprised no one on this subreddit saw this stuff coming to be fair, when a company releases a half-finished game at full price *and* falsely advertises their special edition of said game and *then* makes fake excuses as to why they did it and offers a pitiful reimbursement of $5 of in-game currency and *then* after public outrage is forced to offer refunds (conviniently only if people can prove it with receipts and such they may have thrown away by now) and decided they suddenly found the hoard of canvas resources to make what they promised etc I think you can see where I'm going with this, Bethesda lost credibility long ago for most people, this new pay-to-win route for maximum profit they're taking isn't a surprise and is likely going to be the future of Fallout 76.
---
Fast travel pops me in right next to the hydroponics corner. When I'm in adventure I remove the bottom 2 foundations to make a tunnel. There is a third clipped into the wall that's not visible, but it lets me re-snap the foundations for survival.
---
No. It only makes you initiate the attack faster, it doesn’t actually effect the rpm 
---
Hope for peace but prepare for war.
---
Awesome post!  Makes me want to join up with a fresh character. 
---
Probably because PA barely takes durability damage, I got my full X-01 set like 2 weeks after the game launched. I have repaired it only 3 times since, and most of the time I didn't had Power Patcher equipped, I only equipped it to reduce the repair cost.
---
And idk what grind you are talking about, you can gather the materials to repair your entire armor in like 15 mins. I don't even farm for ballistic fiber or other rare stuff since by the time that I actually have to repair I already have more than enough.
---
Mad scientist-esque I like the tie ins to lore
---
 The BoS mod for Combat Armor is by far the best. It seems to be hard to acquire and I'm grateful I got mine before various changes made it much harder to get.
---
How did I miss this? 
---
It falls on the person then - i defend it because i don't need it, i've got 8 alts, 2 full of junk, 2 full of caps. People can have their repair kits it makes no difference they still have to MAKE the repair kits which cost materials, and we don't know how expensive they'll be neither, since it will be one box to apply to all weapons/armour so individualistic things such as screws/plastic needed on a per weapon basis will HAVE to be used in the making of the kit, my bad on the passive-aggressive tone, been told i'm this/that left/right because of my view on these.
---
And i'll be honest... if you go for a vault dungeon an don't pre-check, you're a fool who deserves a disadvantage in the first place
---
That would be massively lore breaking as the X-02 hasn't been invented yet in the setting of Fallout 76.
---
They straight up lied. It doesn't matter if it is not TECHNICALLY P2W or not. They claimed the AS would not have anything but cosmetics. No gameplay altering items. Guess what? This is gameplay altering. 
---
Why don't you overrepair? It gives you damage a d resistance boosts! 
---
You could pay to get an advantage but you don't have to.  
---
Still not a micro transaction.
---
Are you Scott Bakula cause that is one Quantum Leap.
---
"Bethesda should fix it". Should fix what? That their game is running as intended? I'm not saying they AREN'T ASSHOLES. Read my comment again and look at the points I am making. YOU agreed to play this game with those assholes under the conditions that they MIGHT ACT LIKE ASSHOLES, didn't you? Answer the fucking question.
---
The difference between us is I am not COMPLAINING and asking big daddy Bethesda to make the game nicer for me. And I even get being upset, but using your kid as a shield or as a tool to get recognition and ask for change is fucking low. Not to mention you are a fucking liar anyway as pointed out somewhere else in this thread. Your workshop problem wont even go away after the patch, so your ever shifting story will have to be better than this.
---
There’s a bunch in Camden park by the dross toss booth, if you’re looking for some.
---
We will be able too soon
---
I hopped on the bandwagon a little early, I'm less concerned before than I was once I stopped to really think things through.
---
The difference is, I went from "Meh, not sure I like that", to "Meh, don't think it's a big deal".  There never was any real reason to get excited about it, and even less when you really think about it.
---
I've been trying to preach the good word just like OP once I realized what he/she did.  Then I decided that no one will really listen, and no one will really care in a month, so now I just tune it all out.
---
Nothing
---
Well maybe a fairly large DLC that adds more quests.  
---
I don't care to spend money on makeup
---
Sadly console users still have to pay every month they want to play fo76.
---
Writing it out made me want to do up a lote intensive, professional resume for him. I'll post it here if I do.
---
Same thing happened to me in my on body inventory. I emptied everything into the stash room back what I had and got like 30 more lbs lol
---
That just sounds like your own dumbass fault. 
---
Add the naughty nightwear! That would be hilarious .At least if people are gonna run around in their underwear, let the underwear be interesting to look at
---
!remindme 2 months "Is Lazarus78 still playing?"

Ummm first laser rifle came from there
---
A serious pass at outfits so 'we can travel in style"
---
Exactly...this mole rat hill has been made into a huge mountain 
---
Consumable only would definitely be worse.
---
The biggest issue I have right now is that there are plenty of questions, and no answers.  I get that a lot of the rage is inarticulate and may be hard to reply to, but it's kind of their job and jobs sometimes suck so just do it already.  Please clarify exactly what the hell the plan is (no pun intended).
---
Isn’t it an advantage to go into the fight with a fully repaired weapon as opposed to one that is almost broken? 
---
yeah mostly everyone is happy with the repair kit in atom shop too?
---
Close to 400 here on Xbox and I agree with you!
---
Have fun adventuring.
---
With that logic then if Bethesda started selling ammo in the Atomic Shop would it be okay. Just ammo doesn't give you any straight PvP advantage so it is okay right?
---
Of course it would be terrible, because it saves you (accumulative) hours of grinding. The repair kits are the exact same thing but in a lesser degree. Now you see why your logic is flawed.
---
Yes, pure and simple.
---
Vanity items ONLY means ONLY not MOSTLY. This is a dangerous precedent and only bootlickers will say otherwise.
---
Just wait til you find about the rest of life. You think this is bad, get a chronic condition and deal with your insurance company if you can keep one.
---
Or an advantage not to have to go farm for aluminum or adhesive?
---
I’ve downvoted like two people.... 
---
I'm carrying like 1800 . People are saying i need to delete stuff. ima try that
---
Gotta make yourself feel superior to strangers somehow.

---
Sounds like a plan
---
wont change the fact there would still be 40 of them, and if you wanted to talk about anything else? GOOD DUCKING LUCK
---
Also your assuming everyone would flick to one post.
---
IN ACTUALLY would have 3 or 4 posts with about 4 up vote,s with with 60, a few with 10-20, several with names not 100% clear it was about repair kits at first...
---
instead of one and only one
---
If you spend some time killing scorched with a melee weapon, you’ll get a lot of .308.
---
How dare you bring logic and reality into this. You sound like an apoligamist. Its almost like you dont want us to burn down their HQ. Never forget the poor souls who touched a poly/nylon blend bag. We fight for them! 
---
I will not give Zenimax/BethSoft another dime or spend any Atoms until Tunnel Snakes skins are implemented.
---
And you 100% know this how when it's not been implicitly stated anywhere?
---
I didn't find out about until last month when I tried out military fatigues lol. They don't make it obvious.
---
P2W is defined as paying real money for an in game advantage. 
---
and Tyler Fairgrounds is a good place to start a collection
---
had the intention of buying it before i saw what they were doing with the atom shop.
---
I really hope that they will listen to us...
---
Shit you right, doesn't seem to be a fix for the pose though still. Idk
---
Question why do you wait till your weapons almost broke until you repair it? Irepair at the halfway mark at least.
---
pretty much, you arm is by your gear i mean look at the tactical knife, it's total REMODEL of the knife but is totally cosmetic
---
This just happened to me. Sucks that i have to lose all of my workshop earnings...
---
I'm not arguing your opinion,  you can believe whatever you want. You seem to think that what YOU WANT for this game = what it should be. Yes I think the game should be darker - I am using FACTS and making the argument for what is right for this game.  The FACTS are : its a fallout game, its maturely rated, its in the survival genre - destruction &amp; dark tales (rape, drug abuse murder etc), the idea of karma system choosing to be good and evil are all part of these genres/games. If you take away these things you may as well make it dora the explorer coop for adults. So far all you've said is : oh its mean &amp; oh that's your opinion (I showed my facts) .Ok so what? That's like saying oh horror movies are scary so we should make horror movies that aren't scary... You have literally ignored all these arguments because they are FACTS about these games and you have no way to respond to them
---
The trick is for Bethesda to come up with highly sought after atom store cosmetics. Then push them out quickly. Quicker then people earn atoms in game. I've purchased atoms when the store had stuff I really wanted.
---
 I like supporting the game in this way. Not by purchasing p2w items......
---
There are are an almost infinite number of outfits they could sell at 2-500 caps. 
---
More like the western duster, less like friggin' jumpsuits.
---
I'd buy the hell out of things like the BOS field scribe outfits or Ranger style armor.
---
Which is optional. Basic repair kits are paid for with atoms which you can obtain just by completing basic challenges. 
---
Yeah and that''s my problem. Since Bethesda have really pulled a number on things, showing stuff that was supposed to be in the game when it came out, then its marketing fiasco, I just cannot trust Bethesda to make these repair kits in the way as you mentioned. As great as it would be, even if it went back on their words, I just cannot trust this, because as much as your idea is a good one, it isn't really economically viable, Bethesda would make more if they sold them individually and not as a plan, and I know, and probably you do aswell, know which one of the two Bethesda would pick.
---
I find it really sad but... it's just come to this and I''m like "I just can't let this happen, for the sake of the game, company and its community"... I just want the best for this game but it always leads to some controversy.
---
I hope you understand my point, and I sure do understand where you are coming from, because it sounds feasible and still marketable but yeah... It's all just worry and tension honestly, because what will they do? And what will they do in the future?
---
Maybe the group of ghouls you just slaughtered were having a barbeque party :'(
---
Imagine having this level of frustration with life to hate on something that doesn't affect you. And on the internet. Get a life kid.
---
What would you class as a non-important non-cosmetic item though?
---
Ad Victorium brother or sister :)
---
I hope they don't nerf the dogfood perk. I never have to worry about spoiling food, and the dog food perk with the food boost perk gives me nearly 75% of my total food need being filled up.
---
Just start eating dog food people!
---
Do vendors of the same faction display the same recipes already? If they do I would expect it to work just like that except they are all in Whitespring. I don't see in what you quoted anything that implies anything different than current vendor operation. 
---
Also I would even assume this from their wording. Why would we combine cap amounts and then add all vendors. Seems redundant unless they show plans of their faction. This then comes back to my question... Do vendors already display the same recipes if they are the same faction?
---
My only criticism is it reinforces bad game design. By nerfing perks like White Knight, Bethesda stands to make more money. It creates a uncomfortable relationship between gameplay frustration/tedium and profit.
---
There's an incentive now to balance the game around what will drive players to buy micro-transactions (instead of player enjoyment and engagement), which is something I'm pretty solidly opposed to. It's not about non-cosmetics getting added to the shop, it's the implication and precedent it sets from a gameplay balance perspective.
---
Can’t wasn’t near an armor bench. 
---
Once you are more than 1500 lbs over your carry weight the game locks down most things in your character until you destroy some items. 
---
I'm not sure about the theories concerning Bethesda planning on increasing the grind so the atom shop items would be more appealing, but what I do know is they cannot afford to have stuff like this on a paid store. The remaining player base and shreds of Bethesda's public image can't take it. As far as my opinion on this sort of thing, I think it would do wonders for the game if they could add this stuff just in game and without a grind to get/create. I love the idea of a refrigerators alot, i think its been needed for a while, however making it an atom shop item means that it will have an unnecessary &amp; huge wall to get it, and no matter how you slice it that will hurt the game on all fronts.
---
The issue is that we were told there would be no non-cosmetic items in the Atom Shop.  
---
Many people rightly see this as the first step to the Atom Shop becoming P2W.  The message that we are trying to send is very clear: keep your promise, cosmetics only in the Atom Shop.  
---
This is a slippery slope towards P2W and the best way to prevent P2W is to never get on the slope.
---
Oh dang, then they didn't completely fix it. I know when they first made the problem, it was set so you could *only* get headlamps through the atom store. They must've only halfway fixed it.
---
I am under the impression that both will drop
---
Wait, there's something going on with repair kits???
---
my teammate has a character with the perks that lets her just eat dogfood and drink nuka cola, she says it freed up a TON of space in her inventory
---
There is a treasure trove of possibilities.
---
Just look at armors on the Nexus … I'd be all over 1200 Atom packs of 5 variants of an armor like that.
---
With/without coat, color variants, beat to hell variants, 
---
Give us the possibility to look different from every other player with a hunter long coat.
---
When there are 50 - 100 styles you'd feel unique
---
It’s just not a big deal to me and I enjoy the game it’s just a video game not life or death 
---
Use a stealth boy 
---
Weird cuz they're everywhere.
---
This is the real problem.  There are only 1 or 2 desirable items at any given time. Slash prices and start dropping tons of new stuff. I don't mind spending a few bucks here and there. But I'm not dropping 18 dollars on 1 power armor skin.
---
&gt;plied
---
Interesting, the plural threw me off. Still feels like something that'd fall under Utility.
---
You probably said the same thing about horse armor before devs started locking away pages and pages of expensive skins in a full $60 game.
---
"It's getting expensive for teh devs to make games!" In a rapidly growing industry? Man, idgaf. Shill.
---
Boomer is fickle. I've only ever got him to work once.
---
This is exactly how the book of revelation starts.
---
Everyone has the right to their own opinion.
---
And a present one!
---
agreed, Bethesda should be putting all their efforts into making the game as fun/stable/awesome as it can be to pull in new sales and salvage their reputation, giving back to the community who has supported them through all the launch drama would be a great start to recovery
---
You have to! Isn’t that the worst part? Or run away or just miss a bunch.
---
These are issues that just ruin the experience of high-level end game PvP.
---
Literally everyone thinks what they want is what it should be.  You are arguing you can treat people like shit and not be a shitty person. I disagree.   
---
Whoa. Sorry I stuck a nerve. I’ll just walk away now and let you have the last word. 
---
How is this a shitpost? Your post is more of a shitpost than mine, I'm trying to have a conversation here and yall just acting retarded which is incredibly offensive to mentally disabled folk.
---
Not in my experience, they tend to have more valuable plans as you move into the higher areas.  So the ones in the forest have simple plans, the ones to the S or E have advanced ones.
---
There is the question of whether the factions with single vendors will have the same plans (Watoga, Enclave, BoS, Free State).
---
Also, given they hate one another, I hope there's some fun interchanges between them.  The Free State and BoS ones have fun personalities, I hope the new ones do too...
---
You are right, for instance today you could get 60 atoms for just spending an hour grinding a level, collecting 400 resources to craft 50 booze, finding 5 items to scrap into acid, letting one of those boozes age to vintage, taking a photo. So a few hours of grinding is indeed all it would take, if they cost more than 60 atoms then I’ll just have to grind a few more hours tomorrow to get one. 
---
Then why do you keep coming here 
---
I'd guess they're waiting on their bosses to tell them how they're allowed to respond. 
---
Thanks so much guys I'll just keep looking or check to see if anyone is selling plans/service on the market.
---
Big oof 
---
Absolutely, but to find that sweet spot they have to work their way down; working their way up is just not an option. 
---
Get off the whole "the customer is always right! We're your boss!" high horse bullshit.
---
It takes time to formulate a fucking response first off, second off we don't even know exactly how it is being implemented save for a vague paragraph in a newsletter which has never been stupendously accurate.
---
How about we wait until tuesday, shall we?
---
A item that you don't need or isn't importent to your survive like a new weapon that does min. Damege
---
Darling Sister’s Lab - in the middle cabin. 
---
Thing is they are too easy to get as well 
---
Yeah,  i've done the quest once,  but I guess it can drop a rare outfit so i'd like to try for that.   Instead he just complains he's hurt...
---
Why should any of us care? 
---
So its exactly like that thing people are doing now thru the player trading feature but instead of paying an evil company they are paying random dirtbags??
---
This is the reason. Roll a new char and enjoy the atoms.
---
I hadn't played since mid January, and just came back to find the same thing happened to me. I had some awesome photos, and I'm pretty upset that they were taken away by another poorly implemented update. 
---
P2w repair kits? I haven't been following the last little bit what's going on now? 
---
We really need the actual Marine helmet not just the stealth one we have no.
---
It's just one item. You can live, it's not the end of the world. Geez.
---
I still haven't seen any formal acknowledgement of that melee swing issue.  It's quite irritating. 
---
Any official dev reply, guy?
---
What's reeeeeeee?
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019
---
My point is that it lets you cross, get mats and get back to armor bench off your todo list. In BGS own words being able to spend more time adventuring and less time laboring at an armor bench is an advantage.  
---
While we're at it, why does the canned beef stew from Mama Dolce's spoil, much less why it goes off so fast? It's. Canned. That's the whole point of canning. Otherwise we'd just take the ingredients and make our own stews to suit. I'd carry around dry goods. 
---
That would still be buying a weapon from a store though, probably the pinnacle of kicking off p2w
---
As others have stated, first, it isn't a cosmetic item so it is just a straight up lie from BGS. Second, it is a shameless and effortless cash grab which just boils everyone's nuts. Third, it is a symptom of a bigger disease of possible bigger p2w items. And if you come at me with that terrible logic of "don't assume", this isn't assumption, is prevention. And if you don't accept prevention then you're basically in the same line of logic of an antivaxxer :P
---
Btw, just wait till this post gets a like from the 100 guys who think like you so that it gets downvoted to oblivion, like it deserves.
---
I am.on PS4 and I saw someone wearing an Old Man Winter mask, but I never got anything other than the standard 5
---
Radio silence for the last 24 hours. Not a single reply.
---
So when you’re dealing with a large crowd, such as West Tek, when you shoot the first SM, do others get alerted and negate the sneak? Or you get to keep sneak killing them all? Asking because I have an instigating sniper rifle but have never used it.,
---
It's clearly made of SALT, PEPPER, SPICES and SUGAR
---
&gt;It's what the repair kit leads to
---
Which so far has been wild speculation and fever dreams.
---
yes i am!
---
that would be great. do you have discord? it would work better if you  contacted me @ AtomicMilkMan#6885.
---
thanbks!
---
They def need to go little more value oriented … the new VaultTec packs (whicle not my cup) are a step in the right direction
---
1200 for an armor paint is rough
---
1200 for something that applies to most armors and weapons is much more appealing
---
The issue isn’t necessarily them being used, they’re not “OP.”
---
It’s just a bullshit part of the game. If one person uses it, then everyone is using them, and then we’re all incredibly fast, moon jumping, and invisible as well. No one hits anyone, which is probably a good thing because everyone handmade two-shots everything anyway. 
---
Sealthboys should reveal you when you attack or are struck. They should be vanishing tools, not offensive weapons/shields 
---
Put out a fucking Laser Musket up on the Atom Shop. 
---
It was I believe at the e3 interviews before release. Pete Hines said it. 
---
Fallout should have a parody of Texas Chainsaw Massacre were the secret ingredient for the chili was human... Fallout could have a hotdog where the secret ingredient is ghoul...ha! 
---
Still making yourself look like an ass.
---
It's not going F2P, who the fuck told you that.
---
That is not what I mean. Not level up points.
---
Yeah, they need to work a little bit on their volume pricing.
---
I think someone for got to carry the 1
---
If they do I’d imagine it’ll be in an hour or two, that’s round about the timeframe that I’ve seen CM responses.
---
I accept your apology on sounding passive aggressive, I also don't want to sound like I'm jumping out and attacking, and apologies if I do (Had an extremely frustrating conversation with a guy who said repair kits are cosmetic, since you wear them, and I explained to him about how in Fo3 and FoNV they were aid items and not apparel/armour, while still refusing and just calling names left right and centre) , and yeah I also hermit the game, but studies and exams get in the way...
---
Also daaamn 8 alts? I only have a main and 1 alt, and that alt is just to goof around in survival and try and get the special legendaries.
---
Oh and when you say make repair kits, that's a bit of a weird one. Not everybody knows if its a buy one time or a buy plan and craft forever, since it wasn't said, and the advanced ones seem to be a definite use one time only reward. From a business point of view, and basing also off things such as ESO store (which isn't run by Bethesda directly, more Zenimax), they have things which are a buy and use one time, and out of the two options it can be, I'm sure you know which one will make the most money, and this is the one I'm banking that Bethesda went for.
---
A bit harsh on the person to not be checking their weapons before heading out. I mean yeah sure maybe one to five times will be enough for them to get the mentality to do check, since I know not everyone does, but it also just depends on how much health the item does, because I'm sure you know mods do affect the health of a weapon, either increasing or decreasing, which is just a factor that can be added in case a dungeon or high tier event is really long.
---
It’s horrible! Melee has no chance now! Handmade kills me in their face all the time 
---
Are you talking about real money transactions for in game items? That’s outlawed by the terms of service for FO76. 
---
Oh yeah, I'd honestly consider spending $5 for a power armor paint job if I had some extra disposable cash lying around, but fuckin $18? Hell no, not even if I have a garbage bag full of 100s.
---
Why not. I know medival style armors arent easy to make but they have to be easier then building a full set of power armor from scratch. Add all the skyrim armors
---
Wrong sub
---
Oh man you're out of date. Free to play is soooo 2 months ago. The current circlejerk is pay to win.
---
\-2 points and yet nobody wants to dispute anything I said.
---
On the second point you make, I wholeheartedly agree, and have to upvote you on principle because everyone that points out how it's OP's fault is getting downvoted.
---
On the first point you make I have some criticism:
---
You ever hear of Patrice O'Neal? He has a technique he mentions in some videos about his comedy about how the audience turns on you (the comedian) when you are performing poorly. This outlines a section of human nature that acts much like sharks. As soon as they smell the blood in the water, a piece of their mind gets turned on involuntarily and they become sharks. This helps to explain their behavior a lot, and maybe I'm just trying to convince you that they are less psychopathic than you might think, and you are closer to being just like them than you realize. We all have the capacity for evil, but RPing in a game that uses player-led Raiding as content (which was a design choice from Bethesda to allow people to explore that section of their humanity in a safe and controlled environment) is hardly psychopathic in my opinion.   
---
Anyways, I digress. The Patrice O'Neal clip is worth giving it a listen, because it's probably in YOUR nature to act just like this when you smell blood in the water and realize you have power over someone too. I've done something like this once in my life and it's REALLY important to think about this and contemplate on it. I'll leave a YouTube link below if you are interested, but I just wanted to give my opinion because I saw the language you were using was pretty strong, and I used to feel a lot like you did. Maybe you disagree, but I thought if you were anything like me when I was younger that this would be useful information for you. 
---
With all that said, I hope you have a great day, and a great life. Hope your weekend goes well.

... look at the gaming world right now and tell me this is not going to happen in a couple of months. this same thing has happened with every other game so far in the last couple years and will continue to happen until we as  gamer's say  no. it might be a small thing right now like repair kits but it will go to the point i said above. its better to tell Bethesda no now then later when its already in full swing and then we can't do anything. I'm trying to save the games I love. i would rather pay for these small things they call DLC then them having to resort to pay to win or pay for convenience. btw repairing as is not hard so I get why people dont give a fuck about this little thing because it is convenient, but you always have to look to the future and see the grand plan of it all. 
---
let the down votes begin now  
---
bethesda pioneering the macrotransaction lmao
---
Please tell me this is satire.
---
Im in caution when i shot the first one but if you take out all of them quick enough they wont notice and inside it can get a little tricky when a dog sees you or they see you. And for WS its great to just one shotting all the ghouls torso (same for SM Warlords). 
---
Now I understand what you mean, and it is even dumber
---
Just open the damn perk menu.
---
What's worrying is that from my brief pop through Bethesda hasn't commented on this at all. It's like they think if they ignore us we'll just decide it's suddenly okay.  And right after I reinstalled the game hoping it'll be better now. I couldn't be more disappointed in them right now.
---
Why? You're allowed to trade here
---
I found it the other day actually and got some pretty [sweet pics there](https://imgur.com/gallery/rGzBRPa)
---
You act like doing any of that is hard. my point is that it's not hard to do. honestly I agree with OP it's not going to be a real big deal
---
F2P is just a rumor. It will be a long time before that happens if it even does, this game is not close to a F2P mmo, so I doubt they would try to market it as so. It's a large multiplayer game, but not like that. 
---
Yes they’ve introduced repair kits that you must spend real money to obtain.
---
Thanks for doing this.
---
Check the Lead Champagne Bellini (Reduces?) mine says increases with 15 dmg resistance. I don't have lead champagne mimosa yet, but i bet...
---
Wait, you mean the CM's don't unilaterally make decisions regarding the game and content releases? Color me shocked!
---
Nope because think of this like any other event in history that has repeated itself. Not specifically fallout but games that slowly began to do the same. There is also some evidence to these claims as in that same post they mentioned ammo converters,refrigerators and most importantly the ability to send scrap home without going there. 
---
well that and the production times, but yeah. Shit, look at the price of a graphic novels compared to a handful of comics that wind up the similar length. Definite gap in pricing there.
---
That really a bad news.
---
Seriously?? Man, this shit is getting blown way out of proportion. 
---
##YES!
---
That's true, but this is also a general discussion sub. there are several trade specific subs
---
mmmm... irradiated!
---
Beautifully put
---
Blame the dumbasses that keep harassing Bethesda to make the game easier and turn into pay to play. They are going to ruin the game because they have a hard time playing an already easy game. 
---
I see it as an advantage over a game mechanic, but don’t really see the advantage over other players, which is what commonly defined as “pay to win”.
---
The gear damage and resistance doesn’t scale with item condition under 100%, to my knowledge it does over that threshold but the 150% kits are in-game only apparently.
---
lmfao... I'm stealing this for use in the future, thanks in advance.
---
Stock up on ionized meat and canned dog food. Problem solved.
---
It's pretty straightforward really. Selling something that alleviates a gameplay frustration gives Bethesda a HUGE incentive to balance around what makes the most sales. 
---
Pretending a company doesn't make long term decisions in a live service game to maximize profits isn't some conspiracy theory, it's literally how this business works.
---
&gt; most importantly the ability to send scrap home without going there.
---
We have that
---
Even if it does go F2P in the future, you will still have the number of months' worth of gameplay you enjoyed since November last year. Some people pay extra to get into Alpha/Beta. 
---
Christ alive people cool it on the posts bitching about the RK posts
---
&gt;ot grasp that.
---
ohhhh you're so wrong!!!
---
He on that tweed.
---
How many *s?
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/reeeeeee
---
For me personally, I use the Enforcer perk and have a Quad Combat Shotgun.  It holds 34 shells, and since rank 3 Enforcer has something like a 30% chance to cripple, it's a virtual guarantee that I will eventually cripple what I'm aiming it.  I do need Concentrated Fire for Scorchbeasts though, since the hit box for their wings is small.
---
&gt; The notion that repair kits themselves are p2w is a little bit of a stretch, I agree
---
and I disagree, I think they offer a direct gameplay advantage and fall well within the umbrella of p2w
---
The thing is I already have all my three star legendary weapons, it’s called playing the game, earning caps and making trades and not to mention the legendary vendor that’s coming in game and again if you really think that this is some big charity game to keep you entertained for years on a 60-100 dollar investment only then you’re a fool
---
Why not Zoidberg?
---
If they cost atoms then no you don't. You can easily earn atoms in game. 
---
Unless it has a specific price tag unique from the atom store.
---
Even then the repair kit is a shitty tool from what I've heard from those that use it.
---
OP...  I’ll suck your fucking dick right now if they comment on this post
---
Was Aama Dolce really a communist front or was it all a set up by the Enclave to scare the populace into a 1st strike on china?
---
i cant remember my lore!!!!
---
Good catch! Thank you 
---
I'm 100% betting it will be craftable, like how all the atom store skins currently you don't unlock the weapon with them, you have to craft it, same with outfits they all require crafting. I can't see it being any other way than that. Since they're getting added to the game as a lootable resource kinda paints to me it'll be like a generic item, you can craft for a cost vis plans but can get them as a one time too.
---
And yeah, i get that frustration i played the old Fallout's too, them repair kits were saints back then, now now so much given i have remote access to my stash at worbenches
---
I want it. You earn atoms plenty easily, and the point of these kits is use anywhere, so atom shop is accessible anywhere. Every mmo I know of sells these kinds of items, and it's fine. I even buy the permanent versions, (my gw2 toon has all the permanent kits and at time of acquisition that'd be over $1200 USD)... Besides, a better version drops in game, win-win.
---
Thanks that’s good to know. Many times when I try to sneak (stealthboy on PA) but always get attacked for no reason, so I gave up on the idea and use heavy weapons primarily now. 
---
Create a problem, sell a solution. Brilliant.
---
60$ games need new revenue streams to deliver new content, whether sold as DLC, season passes, or microtransactions.   Bethesda’s model is actually better because old established “whales” like myself with wherewithal can pay the Man voluntarily so that young people can get that content for free.  
---
Wild speculation and fever dreams and when it turns out that it was overblown come tuesday/or when a cm clarifies everyone here will be all "we did it reddit" *pats self on back* and continue to think they're the fallout76 Lorax and speak for the entire fucking playerbase.
---
It's still an advantage. I can Jump you after a SBQ fight with a fully repaired weapon while yours has the wear and tear of the fight.  
---
They specifically say that meaning unless they don't even pay attention they are implying sending it home from anywhere or at least any work bench that is the only one that can be up in the air. You just ignored AMMO CONVERTERS and Fridges 
---
I didn't buy this Fallout because I was worried it would be gay. This post confirmed that everything I hate about gaming has been summed up by V76.
---
They lied. Full stop. That's the fucking point.
---
But yes keep giving them an inch. Maybe they won't put in even more damaging pay-to-win mechanics like repair kits...
---
Oh wait.
---
Same here. Part of the reason I'm shaking my head at the whole thing is because literally NO ONE is forcing anyone to buy these things. They can easily be ignored. And then you get people who go to the extremes, such as boycotting the game. 
---
Mine is purified water and dog food, and I also have the 90% weight reduction for all aid items. I have so much god damn dog food and water it's not even funny. 
---
Being an end game player, I spend most my time doing dailies, searching for lead, and in the process I find tons of purified water and dog food.
---
I looked and behold, a paywall. And his name that sat on him was Todd, and F2P followed with him. 
---
I haven't watched that prick Juicehead's latest video but I wouldn't be surprised if that's where champ got his info.
---
Why does Nuka Dark stack with those perks, but the other ones do not? Kinda strange.
---
I've started to wonder if it's a flaw with a specific perk, like Martial Artist.  I haven't tried running without it.
---
I actually need to switch to a gun to fix it.  Going from one knife to another doesn't restore control.
---
What did they add or are going to add that's not cosmetic?
---
I haven’t given a name for my character but she was a librarian/scholar before being selected into the vault. She was a huge enthusiast for 18th-19th century western culture and her purpose in the waste is to preserve those old values and spread it since she sees it as history repeating itself. So in a way I’m role playing her role playing as a cowgirl.
---
She mainly focuses on more primitive firearms like muskets/revolvers/shotguns/ and for throwables she uses Molotovs/Tomahawks. As for outfits, starlet hat with the western duster and red bandana when she is out on supply runs. For appearance, she wears heavy eyeshadow to protect her eyes from the sun and some Native American inspired face paint. 
---
As for how the apocalypse changed her, she realizes life in the wastes is hard and untamed. Just like in the old west, she has decided to settle in her land but once she has enough resources she might move on to bring law to Appalachia (Taking bounties/helping other players). 
---
I don't know, but I think 1.
---
I'd rather Ranger Armor not be just a cosmetic change though I certainly want it. Still not sure why it hasn't been used yet by BGS themselves since its prewar military gear.
---
Repair kits. 
---
What?? When did this happen??? Why isn't anyone discussing it??
---
id be down with a  true survival mode where the diseases are persistent and and kill you if not taken care of, less crafting junk materials out in the world, more scarce bullets, more harsh weather  with radstorms that really give you lots of rads, nighttime getting darker and spawning tougher enemies at night, etc etc
---
I have no problem with ammo converters and fridges, nor do i with the repair kits
---
i have found ionized meat sell for a good price
---
Yes, because it's super hard to find junk. Though my stash box says otherwise
---
The slippery slope "fallacy" has worked quite well in the gaming industry. These companies are scum and continue to take the piss to extreme levels.
---
PA is anti sneak its to loud. I have some chameleon armor thats bout it and the sneak perks escape artist and sneak of course.
---
Agree that some challenges are tedious but Im assuming you have no interest in buying repair kits nor do I. So we don’t have to worry about the cost, right? 
---
But ammo converters would be pay to win if they are put in the shop. The problem here isn't the actual items it's that it's in the shop
---
My problem, a repair kit comes down as DLC to me. Gems are one thing in phone games and free to plays, but I bought this as a full priced game with the promise of free dlc and cosmetic only microtransactions, I love this game and played since beta and would hate to see this become fallout shelter 
---
Was a good game I miss the feeling you get from playing new games at a young age 😔 I remember my brother doing that same exact thing as you and laughing about it
---
Does anything fix it? It happens out to vats and with npcs 
---
Here's the thing, they have someone (multiple someones most likely lol) that are breaking this down on a yearly/quarterly/monthly/weekly/daily basis, they know exactly the price point that is going to give the greatest ROI on every update, the whales make so much more than those people throwing in a buck or two...  
---
And that's the real scary part to me, how many of these people are actually in a place where they can reasonably afford these items, especially when they start becoming a P2W scenario. At what point does this go from just scummy monetization to taking advantage of people that have impulse issues by exploiting them via one of the outlets in video games? 
---
Damn it, I should have put that in the title. lol
---
This game can't afford this move, whether I agree with it or not. Incredibly risky, does nothing to entice players to keep playing/come back to play, and breaks a core promise that their PR person \*has\* to know will be remembered. Personally I'd love them to just add all this stuff into the game and let us get/craft it ourselves (with no/minimal grinding). That way, 1. it keeps promises and cosmetic store cosmetic, and 2. gives players a bit of an easier time to hopefully entice continuing play, but of course that's just my best scenario. One thing is certain, however: **someone official needs to weigh in on this and explain exactly what the deal is with the food expiration (alleged) bug and white knight changes right before the repair kit update, as well as why they are clearly going back on the original shop promise.** if these things are not answered, they will be in a completely-preventable crap hailstorm once again, and us the players will suffer the most going down the road as they will only get more and more desperate (and ergo, predatory) in their updates.
---
Ooh spoilers ahoy.  But either way, that's some shoddy canning when it actually makes the stew LESS viable than just putting it in a bag.
---
From the spawn point walk south you’ll get to a road, on the road you’ll see a skeleton laying next to a cardboard box the telephone pole will be right there and that’s where the spawn point is, it may be easy to find when the tent or vertibird spawns but harder to find any of the body spawns since it’s in high grass 
---
I see and they repair your armor and weapons on the fly.
---
Easily found in nuke zones and doesn’t spoil either. Most cooked foods sell for about the same so if I ever end up with cooked food I just sell it and move on. Canned dog food is my savior.
---
I'd have to check this later. I just always saw similar so never verified if they had other different ones. If that is true then I'd imagine it to require us to visit each still 
---
Oh okay. I was hoping the L.C. Mimosa reduced. That would be nice to float down, but what can you expect with lead?
---
"Only cosmetic items will be present in the Atomic Store"
---
Not. Fucking. Lies.
---
This is the only logical path to take. They have already blatantly shown they don't give a fuck about going back on promises.
---
How is the logic that they don't give you an advantage in PvP flawed? They are not pay-to-win because they don't give you an advantage in PvP.
---
Also I clearly opened my post with a disclaimer that I believe this goes against their Cosmetics only promise.
---
Tried this test, point plank, single shot from a 50cal machine gun on lvl 50 protections. No damage difference, sadly it's bugged.
---
Thoughts? You need to get out more.
---
The advantage is...
---
Person spending real money dont have to stop doing what they want to do.
---
Others have to take breaks and stop playing to go get their “junk”.
---
Jesus christ everyone in this sub needs to get a fucking grip.
---
So you don't keep alternate weapons on you? I do
---
So you all jump to call out Beth cause repair kits, then the best idea is to suggest they add a full set of armor in the Atom Shop?
---
With all the bodies in the dumpsters at White Springs and no one around, you never know...lol 
---
I have interest in repair kits but not interested in paying for them. 
---
Console ? or PC ?
---
Not everyone who doesn’t care is unaware of the potential ramifications dude, honestly, it’s just a video game. If you don’t want it, don’t get it. You can’t make other people do anything. 
---
I think some people are scared that all these players with repair kits are just gonna be dominating survival mode. Just because you repair your gun or gear in the field, does not make you invincible. So if someone uses a repair kit mid gunfight and they still get killed after, its not pay to win anymore?
---
We need borderlands 3 or division 2 for take a brake playing fo76 until it gets straight again...
---
I dont watch him but with the push of in game items monetization its kinda looking thats the direction their going. They said the Atom shop is gonna be the main way they fund the game and now that atom shop is pushing for paying for in game advantages. They've basically hinted its being discussed as an option. Which once again ties into how they said Atom shop was just cosmetic to begin with as well. Like give me the Cage armor or Mechanist Nuka world armor or anything that was already in the game cosmetics people would pay for gladly. But seems their pushing for in game consumables.
---
Junk is literally everywhere I get tons of screws and springs just from doing a White Springs ghoul run for XP.
---
Why do you keep alternate weapons? 
---
Except it may not be just one item. They mentioned doing refrigerators and ammo scrappers this way as well. Its pervading the game. If we don't like it but say nothing, it will continue on. They ultimately say it will change with feedback so it's not definitive and something they can change.
---
Is there another fool claiming it’s going f2p again, wonder when there apology video comes out like the last one 
---
I'm really hoping it's not the start of something bigger.
---
I agree, I'm just seeing a trend of things offered and a model they already have. I'm still going to play the regular way regardless and fix my own stuff. 
---
Ahhhhhh you beauty. This is fantastic knowledge for me right now :D
---
I love these posts. No they aren't p2w specifically. But they are a p2w test. They mentioned refrigerators and ammo converters, if to many people go for the repair kit's, theres a possibility that those or other items that do more than cosmetic things, could be atomic store exclusives, making them p2w. Like if tons of people start buying things like the repair kit, then the ammo converter could potentially be a store exclusive, Which would be a massive p2w advantage. Or they could make the plans obtainable through a quest, which will more than likely be bugged or so rare that they aren't obtainable
---
hadn't thought of that &lt;3
---
In case my main weapon breaks. My alternate weapons are just as powerful as my main weapon.
---
Follow up question: How do you define pay to win? If for example a paid DLC made it easier for you to kill other players and harder for them to kill you... Then yes, that paid DLC would be P2W and feel like a nerf or punishment to those not willing to spend the money.
---
If however, that paid DLC instead alters an aspect of the game then the question becomes how did it alter it. With the new repair kits if you only buy the plan and have to farm more components to build a general repair kit, then that is not P2W, since you are shifting when you use a workbench for an anywhere convenience that is less effective than if you were at your base.
---
To me, what people are really objecting to is the possibility that the repair kit is not purely cosmetic if sold as a usable repair kit in the atom store . It should be a plan you get as a reward from and event, boss, or quest.
---
Is that even feasible? The first one, I mean.
---
If they did, it would probably be like how they're planning to do kits. Have a basic one on the Atom shop and have a plan for a better one (slower or stopped decay or more storage slots) drop from the SBQ or vault raids depending on how long it takes to implement. That'd be my guess, at least, not a straight atom shop exclusive feature.
---
I was in my 30s when I did that. One doesn't have to be young to have childlike fun!
---
Nothing. I earn enough in game, not even trying to do challenges, and I spend so little. I have 4K banked. I already paid for the game. If you need $5 per month or something to make the game sustainable, fine, I'll pay you a $5 per month subscription. I have no issue with that. You better have a LOT more content coming out a LOT faster with way more bug fixes if you ask me for a subscription fee though.
---
The only thing I'd actually pay for is stash space / shared stash space between characters, but I'd argue that if they wanted to go that route, it should have been a free game with fairly priced stash space / cosmetics exactly how Path of Exile is, and there needs to be content releases and bug fixes / quality control at the level that GGG does it.
---
I expected free DLC too, and we have got some.  I was just saying that if the game is struggling to make money the of the options:
---
A- they pull the plug, and we wait years for another fallout
---
B- gem-based pay to play system, where technically you can play without paying but it is set up to make that miserable
---
C- future DLC (starting Oct ideally, so we at least got one year free DLC) being pay to play.
---
That was my biggest reluctance of buying fallout 76...  it relies on the community supporting it not only in the game fighting SBQ but also in real life.  I was worried buying a server based game would mean I would be enjoying the game only to have the plug pulled.  That's what happened to me in SWTOR (would still pay if someone converted that to a single player game...  the graphics, characters, and story were fun).
---
if you think beth will keep working on this dead game, u are really out of touch with reality. 300 viewers on twitch today just to show you how no1 care anymore about this dead game. whales like you are part of the problem as to  why they keep releasing unfinished 60$ aaa beta games. shame on you
---
If you're on pc, this mod gives you the raw numbers... https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/262
---
I mean...from the info I've seen we have confirmation that the repair kits will be in the atom shop.
---
I see what you're trying to say but based on that kind of info you're just wrong, right? 
---
The one major complaint I have about FO76 is that I greatly dislike the cute and whimsical aspects. I would like it to be more Mad Max and less Fortnite or whatever. Fallout 1 and 2 provide great examples of the darker and more serious tone I miss.
---
This repair kit backlash is taking away from the positive aspects of this sub. I say delete them unless they are adding a new perspective to the discussion.
---
Did it take extra effort to get that redundant weapon? 
---
I always have too many rad aways so I eat the spoiled food all the time.  Works fine.
---
Ah okay so that's what you think, oh that changes it then. I do respect people from the idea that this can be craft-able forever within purchase, so of course like wise to you, I respect that. I come from a business orientated point after looking at schemes many phone games and other companies games have done in the past and present, and it did benefit them massively even if the community didn't like it, hence why I hold the idea it's a one time purchase (I've already basically explained so I won't re-iterate, just maybe shedding light to why I think it's a one time thing.)
---
And yeah, god especially in FoNV, I started that game when the GOTY version came out, installed the game, got bombarded with a bunch of gun runners arsenal stuff, then like a couple days later into the game I found myself with a bunch of broken items, since getting a Grenade launcher at the beginning was to much fun and I lost track, along with some other good weapons on the near verge of breaking.
---
Well i'd say this was a interesting debate for sure XD Do kinda feel bad for the OP's post becoming this kinda a bit of a opinion war ground so I may just leave it here if that's okay.
---
You sir, even tho we have our differences, wish you good a day and I guess better luck with RNG gods in game, cause I'm sure we're all sick of getting just a hunters leather left arm from a 3 star XD
---
why should you break your rules at all? it's spamming if they all post the same shit, besides it leaves the people who just play and enjoy at a disadvantage, tons of us actually love this new idea but don't have a voice among the minority ja know?
---
Get Fix-It good Park and repair your Weapons to 200% which the repair kits won't do unless you find it in Appalachia.
---
&gt; unlimited storage of crafting material space 
---
If there is anything the dupers taught us is that the game engine reacts violently to large quantities of stuff in game.
---
Probably forced on by the financially minded side of the team. Which more and more are becoming the decision makers in the industry. 
---
What’s twitch?   Is that where people watch people playing games rather than playing themselves?   
---
It’s not going F2P......it’s the first step to P2W
---
Before I learned about the leather coats and field jacket, this quest felt like it popped up every time I entered the area. I was getting very frustrated with it popping I remember. Since learning about the outfits I’ve seen it once. 
---
Put a ticket in to CYA. 
---
Preferably with a vid.
---
Not saying it's happening but if it is it's best they know to so they can patch it.
---
That makes sense. They need to fix that
---
Or it spawns a scorchbeast king which is twice the size of the scorchbeast queen and is glowing
---
Theres another settlement that needs your help
---
Whats cya and how?
---
ps- this is why the brigaders drive me nuts... it's not like fallout 4 or fallout NV.  They could literally be depriving others of a game they enjoy.
---
When have they listened
---
if they must add something to the atom shop, i agree something like this would be cool. but my opinion is they need to lay off the AS for a bit and just focus feedback for fixing the gameplay itself. they already helped out with stash space, and that was my biggest gripe at launch. we need more targeted fixes like that.
---
I will. I just came back after a 3 month hiatus, found all my photos were gone ☹, and then I hear this bs. If it happens, I will leave permanently, and attempt to scrub the memory of this game from my mind.
---
&gt;why not make PA cheaper to repair?
---
Because Power Armor
---
Read it again.  Only ADVANCED Ones Drop in game.  Regular ones are atom shop exclusive.
---
Omg they added repair kits??? I suppose that having one you are all of a sutten invincible? That’s why everyone ia crying right?
---
Tinker's Workbench
---
As much as mules are a part of MMORPG culture, I don't think Bethesda is going to promote an idea that supports mule activities. 
---
If your friend was there, why didn't you just trade the item to your friend for safe keeping and then trade back to your mule?
---
If you buy an ammo converter for atoms you get free by playing then how is it p2w, and with all the free ammo you can pick up and trade with other players for what you need or buy them from the many ammo dealers
---
Then why add instant repair kits?
---
Because money.

Not intending on buying the game, yet here you are, telling us as if one soul here actually cared.

I love how just because they acknowledged some of our ideas y'all take that as they are coming, read the article again, they only said they hear us and listed some of the feedback they have received, they never once said we are getting any of those ideas.  here is the text:
---
&gt;As we look to the future, we’re exploring ways we can bring other  community-driven ideas to the game as well, such as refrigerators for  C.A.M.P.s, ammo and food converters, and even the ability to send scrap  to your stash without having to head home.  
---
that means they are thinking about adding those things, not that we are getting them.
---
also yes, pay to win is bullshit and it's even worse if they make mechanic changes to encourage pay to win microtransaction sales.
---
I think you can play survival mode without PVP only if you put a lot of attention to the map and other players near of you. If you think some player is near, go away with fast travel to other place. 
---
Stop trying to apply logic to this situation, the people you’re preaching to are too busy lighting torches and sharpening pitchforks to hear your logic. They have a clipboard full of responses just waiting to paste into your comments insinuating that you’re either a sheep or blind.
---
&gt; cya
---
CYA == Cover your ass. Basically you say here is an issue, that way automated back end tools can't pick you up as a haxor, or if they do you have an excuse.
---
Yes. It's almost exactly the same thing. 
---
This is pay to win. Anyone who refuses to see that is lying to themselves.
---
I'd lay down some cash for some clean weapon skins, easiest redesign ever. I find it so annoying that I can manufacture miniguns out of tin cans but don't know how to use Ballistol.
---
I don't stop doing what I enjoy and I never run out of junk to scrap most of the time I have to much and I leave it in random places this game is not that hard to get the things to repair your weapons and armour. 
---
Two different repair kits
---
Normal that repairs any weapons
---
And the deluxe edition that comes with drink dispenser and cup holders* that repairs any item with 150% durability
---
*Your results may vary
---
Found my alternate weapons through normal play. Though I could easily trade for more on the market subreddit. Which might very well be an advantage over anyone who doesn't use reddit.
---
I want Maxons battle coat from 4
---
*THE only example given. 
---
I agree completely on that note just not sure why there is still a lot of freezing and disconnects still. Way better but still happens.   
---
With unlimited storage it would happen gradually I guess as a opposed to doubling it however long it takes again and again so I could see that being the dupers crash. I read on here I think that some duplicated 100,000 items at a time to make it double... so I could see that action creating an issue for sure by doubling data.  
---
Not sure but just adding like we do as we get it and bulk it might not do anything, not sure.
---
Sorry mate, you are wrong. P2W means something that gives you advantage, and you can get it ONLY for real world money or special currency that you have to buy.  So no its not P2W
---
I bought this game with high hopes and for the most part my friends and I had fun. Not $60 fun but fun nonetheless. With all the bullshit that attracts to this game since laugh in regards to patches, bugs, more bugs, patches that reverse bug fixes, and now this crap on the Atom store with P2W armor kits and this freaking post. Fuck this game forever. I hope you guys have fun in the future with this title as I'm personally out of patience. Godspeed guys. 
---
Fair enough but like how do i get it to them 
---
Context?
---
Have you never once in your life broken a promise? 
---
Do you know why you broke those promises? Life happens. Something came up that required you to say "ya know what, those circumstances have drastically changed". 
---
In this situation, people said I hate repairing. Heres a lesser altunitive. Get over it. Game industries are changing. 
---
Taxidermy is coming already. The plans exist and are part of upcoming quests
---
They have some cool stuff, there just needs to be more variety... which they’re releasing slowly,  but some some categories are still really light, such as hair, face paint and tattoos. 
---
They could also pretty easily have a bunch of colors for PA and people would buy them. 
---
also a good place too see if you like a game or not before paying 60$ since they dont let us play demo anymore.
---
Put a ticket in on their website.
---
I'm not sure where, but I'm sure someone will have the URL for you shortly.
---
Negative. Only one version will be, and you can bet when they say "rare"... They'll be super rare.
---
Ahh so since it doesnt affect you then its perfectly fine. 
---
Single minded mindset.
---
how about "dye kits", so that you can change the color of whatever apparel you have.. like, if I want a nightmarish clown suit, then I'll mix a red and black dye for primary and secondary colors
---
For anyone to believe that a modern gaming corporation would "keep their promise" is laughable. This is the future of the videogame industry, and we as consumers helped shape it.
---
I can’t wait cause ima try and get all the teddy bears and mr fuzzy’s to display on my shopping rack
---
1/4000 is not non-existent, millions of players, tons of participants in fasnacht event, plenty of us got them but we just don't visit forums often.
---
This my weapons hardly ever break 
---
I agree with you on this one, I dont see it as P2Win either, but you are just going to get slaughtered with downvotes for not agreeing with the Echo Chamber. 
---
I see where people are coming from, but I feel like they are making massive extrapolations on a single paragraph statement, that has very little detail. If these show up in the AS, I will buy them if I want to, I don't care what Beth puts in the store. I am a consumer, and it is my choice to either buy the item or not. Thanks for the post buddy, you arent alone on your opinion here.
---
I will take another video of it happening and hopefully send both of them to Bethesda 
---
1. This is Bethesda going back on their word. As if they'd earned the benefit of the doubt anyway with their performance in the past 6 months. Get a grip. 2. Sure repair kits aren't exactly a huge advantage but it could allow you to break off in PvP and repair gear without having to risk standing in your camp or at a bench OR having to bail to adventure mode. 3. This is how it starts. Look at all the dummies say "People ASKED for this," oh did they? I've seen people request repair kits along with some of the other stuff Beth mentioned in the post. But I have not seen one person ask for this to be sold in the atom shop. Not one. Doesn't mean there aren't a few galaxy brains out there who did, but it's not like people have been clamoring for this. 4. Some people will carry water for Bethesda, no matter what. 
---
no. not yours. 
---
I am not being flippant when I say that belief doesn't make a citation.  The only quote from Hines on the subject that I have seen didn't make that promise, thus the request for some sort of evidence. I obviously can't prove that he DIDN'T say it, because you cannot prove a negative, so I want someone to illustrate where it DID happen. 
---
Or maybe people need to rethink their expectations. 
---
Yea.
---
Stay away from the trainstations.
---
I’ve been wandering around the cranberry bog and the more and have only run into one other player in like five hours.
---
That's a good idea I'll definitely keep that in mind. Thanks. 
---
Sounds fair to me. You shouldn't be able to escape the validly placed bounty just by switching game modes. If your character, aids and junk can switch modes, then your bounty should too.
---
Yep, when I was doing Fasnacht, I noticed the nearby vendor never had much of anything interesting in plans, while the same faction further away had much better plans.
---
May have been a fluke, or maybe others were also visiting this one a lot so it was sold out, but I don't think that was the case.
---
Could be wrong, let us know if I am!
---
PC for me.
---
Honestly I think it's a text glitch, but it's better to be safe than sorry.
---
Good luck.
---
Hahaha niceeee. Theres a better hat, a round one, i forgot what it was called tho lol
---
You called. There, I said it. 
---
Did you guys immediately go to kill mode?  
---
I have one. 
---
One could argue White Knight was more "inline" pre nerf. Power Armor degrades significantly slower than standard armor at their base degradation rates. I still haven't had to repair my X-01 suit that I made in early December. And I don't nor ever have ran power patcher. And I literally live in that armor, I never fight outside of it unless I'm jumped by something unexpected.
---
That said though, I don't complain much about that change. Just thought it was another of many silly/dumb decisions they've made.
---
But I do wholely agree that going full Alex Jones over every little change is not a good way to look at the situation...s... 
---
&gt;I’ll give you money right now for a double camp budget
---
That’s exactly the kind of thing that makes them think it’s ok to sell non-cosmetic stuff in the Atom Store.
---
Extra camp budget is not a cosmetic.
---
Are you that pissed over 20 caps? I'd call that a piss argument. 
---
You are a shitty player if your constantly running around with a broken weapon, do u never visit your camp? Do u not do a quick spot check on integrity of your items? I sure as shit bet you do, but you dont want to talk about you, your agueing for the sake of someone else - that someone else you dont even know. 
---
And survival is in beta..good luck doing ur junk runs.
---
I don't typically post here but I was thinking the exact same thing. I don't want to admit the amount of money I would drop if I could get cosmetic ranger armor. More than I would on repair kits thats for sure.
---
Im leveling up it takes a while but i get 54 xp, then i just got 16 if i could post a video here I'd literally show you, i was 18 now im 19
---
It's a Tinkers workbench 
---
Thanks and what is "tinker's"? 
---
Then people who don't buy them are at an objective disadvantage to those that do. This is bad for the game.
---
Pretty sure you buy the ability to craft repair kits for yourself like you buy the ability to craft clothing for yourself.  You're still going to need the materials to craft the kit.  Not sure how one-time use items would work when you can have up to 5 characters on an account.  Would they charge you less if you only have one character or would every new character spawn in the vault with however many repair kits you've bought up to that point?  
---
I have similar concerns about repair kits being the only way to repair once in the dungeon. I doubt it will happen though crafting might be limited to just before points of no-return.
---
They don't care, they know how much money they'll make off of doing this.
---
This is absolutely correct. Couldn't have said it better myself. I myself only found out about this Repair kit etc issue from a youtuber. I was finally hoping the game was heading in a better direction so I was all the more let down at this news and decided to come here to exercise my voice with everyone else. theres a perfect middle ground to listening to the community of course but this is just one of those times where they have to take our word for it.
---
Can someone translate this from Prolapsed Goat Anus into English please?
---
Thx.
---
I think one thing that could be awesome is to do like Warframe and make in game items tradable for premium currency.  Have the legendary vendor take one star items for 5 pts and make atomic pts player tradeable.
---
*closes laptop* Welp. That's all for today, internet. See you tomorrow.
---
Nice one, you online, can trade now? Add FalloutFred101
---
Why should they have to give more than one? Granted that was a very poor example but they did not say it would be the only place to get them
---
Even better.
---
Keep your eyes open at all times. And stay away from train stations. My strong suggestion is go into adventure mode to fast travel to a location  away from survival transition points, then go to survival. You'll spawn where you left in adventure and should be safer
---
People like what they like, sorry that you dislike people liking something you don’t like so much.
---
What do you think I'm saying? I'm saying the claim that the devs nerfed White Knight weeks ago for the sake of accomodating the addition of paid repair boxes is conspiratorial and shouldn't be taken seriously like it currently is. They flat out told us they were going to add basic repair kits to the Atom Shop, that's not debatable.
---
Don't post it here just send it to Bethesda
---
&gt; and with all the free ammo you can pick up and trade with other players for what you need or buy them from the many ammo dealers
---
&gt;If you buy an ammo converter for atoms you get free by playing then how is it p2w
---
The same way games like GTA became pay2win. Pay2win means you pay real money for an ingame advantage in gta you can grind out money to get a rocket bike or you could spend 20 bucks and have that rocket bike. Just because you can earn something in game doesn't mean it isn't pay2win. Now the ammo converter it assuming it does what the name says that means you could convert your 5,000 .38 into 3,000 .50cal for you tse.
---
Lastly let me ask you this why? Why even have one in the shop why not both in game? Why is it im a shop that is supposed to be cosmetic? If it will be at a cheap price why even put it in the shop 
---

I came to this subreddit because I was curious if fo76 had improved enough for me to pick it up, but wow nearly every thread is negative. Guess I’ll wait longer
---
A tinker is an old term for someone who repairs things. They generally fix small items. 
---
They already nerfed the White Knight perk to repair things cheaper..
---
Gitanos. Or manitas.

I posted about the increased spoilage rate shortly after it began, and I did get a Bethesda reply saying it was being looked into. I haven't seen anything further from them, though. Their reply:

---
I think you are far too invested into something you claim to care nothing about. 
---
A repair kit plan wouldn't solve the problem (or opportunity) that Bethesda appear to be addressing: That some time-poor players want to spend more time fighting and less time scavenging.
---
There is a trading flair, I suspect it's sanctioned.
---
Lol cool, I mainly play adventure mode, so I'm probably ok , looks like it's more targeted for pvpers , hopefully you can get them in game too and not just in the atom shop.

1500 + STR Carry Weight is your max load. Over this, you cannot drop, trade, stash. ONLY DESTROY.
---
Yeah it's all very shrouded around this. I have used this theory as some points in debates, and from a business background I feel repair kits are a more pay to use one time(It'll generate more of an income via that way, games like ESO have a similar tactic), but hey, I could be wrong, a good number of people do think its just a plan, and I have no rights to say no to that since well, we don't know anything on that truly.
---
I just feel it also ties in into why white knight, a armour degradation perk that increased it's life span, was out of the blue nerfed which already lead to some angry people saying they'd have to grind more to cover the repairs. The Inside the Vault also talks about introducing refrigerators which also just makes the sudden increase of food spoil rate seem not like a bug but more planned to increase sales for a profit.
---
But yes with the burrows, its a very suspicious time they talked about them. It could honestly be a coincidence, but I believe its more like that and how you suggest, repair kits may be a decision of death if not bought or lifesaving if bought. If the Burrows is that hard as they promote it and there is no workbenches inside and just filled with enemies, then some enemies (Cough Cough Major Gutsyes Armour pen. 45. bullets cough cough) need to be re-balanced, not by a lot, just a little to retain their difficulty, but that's overall gameplay.
---
I wouldn't be against Bethesda if in a year or two, they make huge DLC expansions that take place off the map and make it paid, because we all know that they need to generate a profit. So if they introduce a completely new state to explore, if that costed like a good £15 to get, I wouldn't mind, but repair kits are so basic and were free in games such as Fo3 and FoNV, even though they weren't online they came with the base games, and that's how I feel about repair kits, they should have come with the base game or at least as free DLC (not talking about the advanced ones, I'm aware they're in-game, I'm more on about the basic ones.)

I feel like the blackmarket has kind of ruined some of the fun for me. I can't really stand a chance in PVP without God tiered weapons, or hell even in Adventure. Everyone's blowing 5k or real money on sentinel armor and whatever gun they want. Then every interaction is them bragging about something they bought. Kind of takes away from the cool Legendary Weapons.  I'm trying to play the game honest but I don't ever get any 3 stars even at level 45. I've found only a handful of useful legendary weapons to be honest. I don't even feel relevant in events or with other players with my maxed out Handmade gun that I bought the plans for and worked my ass off for. 
---
Everyone's worried about Bethesda countering this with their own sales to eliminate the black market? 
---
Twitch views mean nothing I would rather play the game than watch someone else play. Twitch is not a good source for weather a game is doing well or not

That’s nightmare material. I honestly admire anyone who’s managed to stay with the game if they’ve experienced worse than this. 
---
I’m relieved to hear it’s not always this bad for everyone. I’ll give it another crack.
---
To my way of thinking, if the endgame is this bad even 1/3 of the time, it should be a matter of utmost priority for Bethesda to sort it out because they effectively have a non-functional product. The game was utterly broken for me - trying to play it felt like indulging in a delusional fantasy. If the big fight against the boss is what you’re spruiking as the ultimate FO76 moment, then for the love of god it has to work.
---
And considering that a decade ago I was playing WOW on servers with hundreds of people and experiencing no problems - it just feels like there’s no excuse. 
---
I doubt it. No videos, no proof appearing outside the sub, only sketchy anecdotes and still shots that would be incredibly easy to fake.

All the alcohol that was in the game before the patch is effected by party boy/girl. I don’t know why the new ones aren’t; I guess they thought it would be to OP.

What a load of tripe. Anyone who paid $60 has got their money's worth 10 fold except for those that gave up too early .. I don't disagree it has been a rough ride but there is a enough content here to keep people busy and I think you are actually the minority. The fact Bethesda is putting out content, has roadmaps, I have hope the game has a future. I don't agree with everything they do but I certainly have gotten my money's worth. I always find it funny how haters have to come here to tell give us their opinions none of us actually care about, but thanks for dropping by. Now go find a game you actually enjoy playing and unsubscribe from this sub as you clearly not a fan which is OK ..

I wondered about finding a much more similar hat as well. Lol

---
It's the only nuka product on the list?
---
The way they worded that seemed pretty blatant. The thing is though that these items aren't cosmetic, and one of the key promises was only cosmetic items through the shop. They do affect game balance to an extent, and if they're willing to do this I can forsee higher level play almost requiring them as crafting costs are increased for the sake of 'balance'. It's very similar to say Heroes of the Storm where you can play the game for free entirely, but a Stimpack makes your time so much easier to the point you feel naked without them.

ultracite can also be had by at least 2 other methods:

a) scrapping hardened mass.
---
b) iron veins, when nuked, become minable ultracite veins.
---
In FNV you could only repair guns in three ways: With another copy of the gun, a weapon repair kit or at a merchant(and only a couple could do it to 100%). So if you had a rare weapon, you had to use specific merchants or weapon kits to repair it to full. In 76, you don't have this problem at all as you can use common junk at a common weapons workbench. There's no need for Weapon Repair kits in 76 apart from an emergency. They really shouldn't be common, because we already have an extremely easy way to repair weapons using junk.

Afaik there is zero video proof of them existing, either by an owner of one or someone who saw someone wearing one. All the still images would be simple and photoshop jobs. I’d think we would have seen something by now if they were out there.

huh I just got a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet myself this morning. Had no idea they were this valuable, since you can't use deathclaw gauntlets with PA. Is it a PVP thing?
---
I would love an Adventure mode with stronger PVE survival elements in them.
---
I figure that as time goes on there will be more modes and gamestyles released. 
---
Good list. There is so much stuff they could do instead of this borderline P2W stuff!
---
If they give this community some really cool cosmetic stuff, we will open our real world wallets to get it. I've just been underwhelmed with most of the atom store stuff so far... Cartoonish re-skins don't really do it for me.
---
May I ask about ESO if you don’t mind? can it be played offline or is it like fo76 has to be online even if playing solo? Also where do u think it’s better or worse than fo76?
---
Sounds like you were lucky, I’ve played a few hundred hours and gotten to level 188, I’ve got 1 good weapon drop. 
---
Possible spot for future DLC. I've had a few camps do that and I later learned that was the reason. They seem to be preemptively sectioning off spots for future content.
---
So is 50cal but it didn't stop them allowing that to be made in big batches.
---
Semi auto weapons never run out if ammo, they have very high ammo efficiency so it never makes sense to have more than 1k on you, if they really are worried about balance then the MG42 should not be .308 and be a different ammo type of its own category.
---
I wont be giving them my wallet - BEACUASE THIS DOESNT AFFECT ME. I can repair better than this item. Any player can repair better than this- all they need is 3 points and 3 skills perks.

Hines defended the game’s utilization of the system ferociously, “Folks that want to spend money on whatever the hell it is because they don’t have enough Atoms, they can, but it’s not, ‘I’m now better playing against other players because I spent money.’ It’s not pay-to-win. And it’s not loot crates.”
---
Took me 13 seconds in Google. It's from November. Would you like the link to the article? It's not video proof but it's a direct quote from Pete Hines. 
---
I'm definitely looking forward to more content releasing, but I really wish that their new Survival Mode was legit Survival. I think that would be amazing, more scarce food, harder to keep up with hunger/thirst, no story missions just focused on PVE/PVP/World Events. Definitely keep the unrestricted PVP too. When I heard the requirement for a new character was present that's what excited me most. Low level PVP was so fun, when everyone just had pipe weapons and short hunting rifles. Now everyone runs around with 2-Hand weapons and power armor, 2-hitting everyone and everything in sight lol
---
I do like the idea of the 150% repair kits dropping only in game.  They need to figure out more things like that to drive the community to once again start farming end game bosses ie. SBQ.
---
My now personal favorite (/s) is when you do the feed the people quest and get 5 cans of canned stew that gives you +5% xp for 1 hour and you eat one, wait an hour and they are all gone and spoiled. Bullshit, what is the point of doing that quest anymore? I just say fuck that now and get cranberries and make cobbler. It sucks having to eat it every 30 mins, but it usually lasts my 3-4 hour play session.
---
Wow I’m no longer bored?
---
I'm not trying to define Pay to win. I am stating that they made no such promise.
---
Everyone else thinks "cosmetic only" was a pretty good blueprint.  We bought the game on the promise that would remain the blueprint.  Now we're just praying they don't alter the deal further.
---
If it's a simple 'here's a simple thing you wanted' addition, creating a set of quests to add it in takes a lot of manpower (aka $$$).  Throwing it in the store takes a few minutes.
---
For something so basic, I'd rather they spend their time and energy on more important things.  And, there are a *few* more important things that still need to be worked on.
---
Please purchase more atoms to continue play.
---
Did you lose any caps when you were killed?
---
I once had the interesting experience of watching someone else’s camp deconstruct then mine load in. We must have logged out/in with just the right timing 
---
I had a rough time launching my first nuke too. Hacking the terminals to make the turrets target the robots was a huge help for me. I’ve heard it’s harder to launch with more than one person, more enemies spawn. 
---
Good luck! 
---
if its with player vending that got pushed back to may.
---
Have fun ignoring things if this is accepted.  New games systems will be designed with the cash shop in mind and existing systems will get tweaked to steer people into cash shop solutions.  Look at the big picture, this innocent little item is just the start.
---
I might be able to help you out if no one else volunteers. I'm taking a break from the game but I'm fine getting on for a little bit. Message me if no one comes after like 24 hours or something.
---
LOL!  I'm forgiving of a lot of things when effort is being made.  I truly believe Bethesda wants a GOOD product, because if nothing else a good product is a financially successful product.
---
But this P2W shit?  That's unacceptable, especially after frequent and explicit promises against that.
---
You can do junk runs in Adventure no one is forcing you to play survival. Also your characters inventory transfers between the 2.
---
More like “when”. Please see EA for reference.
---
I'm waiting on a duster that looks similar to the one from New Vegas
---
HOW?!
---
These Repair Kits are to REPAIR YOUR SHIT, not to make you uber strong. It's for convenience for someone who doesn't like farming for junk. 
---
I’d say ESO is to Skyrim as Fallout 76 is to Fallout 4.... 
---
I play ESO and the world is significantly bigger for sure. You do have to be online to play just like Fallout 76. 
---
Both you start out at a low level and work your way up. 
---
Solo is pretty much it and people have to ask and you accept any type of PvP. 
---
You can also team with friends as well. 
---
Some of the bosses you do need others to kill unless you’re high up the level and even still, the bosses get better as you do just like Fallout. 
---
I’ve only been disconnected once that I can remember from ESO. 
---
I think it might be on sale now also. It’s a thumbs up for me! 
---
It may just be a visual glitch. Does the exp bar actually move when you gain the exp?
---
And again the advantage is the folks paying dont have to do anything of that.
---
I'm with you there, however it was stated that it would cost atoms to get, in whatever form that takes.
---
IMO, if it's relatively cheap and opens up the ability to craft them, I'm fine with it.  If they're expensive (and I consider 500 atoms to be expensive), or if you buy the kits individually, I'm against the idea.
---
Thanks! I'm not very good, but I'll keep trying. 
---
This is a great idea but some of them would look a little weird like Marsupial or Bird Bones
---
But even the community managers aren't interacting as much as they used to. I don't understand why they say the listen to us when their community managers don't even take the time to respond. 
---
It's not p2win but they shouldn't go through with it and I bet  lot of people crying have a duped weapon or bought one with real money.
---
i would really like to see the courier duster or even the old mercenary outfits
---
I could get behind this. It'd be no different than buying a retro style game on Xbox Live or some other service, just played on the pipboy.
---
There are so many things I can personally think of that would give me an incentive to buy Atoms.
---
- Scorched Sierra Power Armor
---
- Tribal Power Armor
---
I loved these Power Armors because they were modified suits of T-45.  Would love to see them return with various other bits of customization and compatable with other suits like T-51.
---
- Classic Combat Armor
---
- R91 Assault Rifle Skin (if they choose to make it a reskin of the Assault Rifle)
---
- Rusted Power Armor
---
- More face paint and tattoos
---
- More hair styles
---
- More beards, especially a large Viking type of beard
---
The Santa Beard is a good example of a large beard.  I just wish it was not a piece of clothing and could be other colors.  
---
- Character reskins to look like a Ghoul and Scorched victim
---
Point is, there are many things that us players want to see added and we would happily buy them.
---
Take a hint, Bethesda.
---
I'm not sure that's true? Have a source? 
---
The last I heard some data mining lightly suggested that they were similar to bobbleheads and magazines. 
---
And I doubt they'd be tradable. Too exploitable. 
---
They dont even need to do that, They can just not give you any places to repair in the new dungeons and give enemies attacts that attact your condition bars. If you leave the dungeon then it resets so you have to have repair kits to finish it
---
Well Iguana Bits...
---
Yes ive leveled up off it twice not trying to just logging in to play and it happens that im already close to leveling up 
---
you'd be putting your account name on the line if you showed any kind of proof, and BGS launcher doesn't use any 2FA, therefore it's not advisable to proclaim you have it and show some level of proof.
---
Real money not in game caps
---
Repair kits. Are for those. Who don't like farming junk. 
---
No, but I didnt need to. Earlier in the day I didnt have the recipe. I had previously collected brain fungus but never ate any. The recipe didnt show up so I tossed the brain fungus. But I logged out and logged in later and the recipe was there. So I'm all set. But I never ate any raw brain fungus that I am aware of. Then again I have Lead Belly, so I do sometimes eat things in my inventory that maybe I shouldn't. Who knows? But I'm all good now, whatever the reason. Thanks for the follow-up.
---
I want to see the source saying that we need repair kits
---
I think they use that just so they feel better about breaking verbal contact
---
many toys contain screws.
---
at least 2 different train stations usually have a box of screw near the workbench.
---
2 boxes at grafton steel, I think at least one at Grafton dam.
---
fans, typewriters, guddyup buttercup parts
---
Multiple critters drop them as loot.
---
a lot of tool pegboards have a box.
---
yeah exactly how is this pay to win?
---
&gt;hey my gun broke while fighting this player, better open my pipboy and fix it and im dead.
---
yeah repair kits are pointless.
---
The other day I threw a drag grenade at some cluttered liberators in the big central room there, but they shot it midair right as it left my hand and instantly killed me. 
---
I have bad luck at the observatory.
---
Holy fuck, yes.
---
I literally cleaned out my inventory of all pepper/salt/sugar today because I couldn’t figure out why I was maxing out my limit - until I sorted by weight in the aid sections.
---
Had no idea they weighed so much. Considering how quickly food spoils, you need to seasoning on hand if you’re actually going to attempt a recipe that doesn’t involve just meat + wood. Generally you don’t have the luxury of the time needed to go farming.
---
IMO the whole cooking system is completely broken. If you need more than three ingredients, particularly if one of them is rare, by the time you’ve sourced everything, something has spoiled.
---
The turnaround is too tight and it’s just not fun.
---
I’ve maxed it cannibal and am just dealing with it that way, but aside from the visual lols of watching your character nom on a super mutant, it’s not anywhere near as satisfying as cooking would be, if it worked. 
---
(And cue a cannibal nerf from Bethesda + the addition of fridges to the ATOM store I bet...)
---
I have a furious explosive 3* lmg. By far my best gun, but I never use it because of the ammo requirements.
---
That is a violation of the TOS and can get you banned. 
---
The 200 came out of the other guys pocket but I did lose the normal amount. I'm not sure but I think it was 1-200 caps. (I'm level ~145 if that helps.)
---
Shelving that has items shown on it to make your camps more lived in.
---
Thanks for that. I will try the beta and see about it. I love fo76 and not even looking to play something else. But seen ESO is in beta and saw ur post which got my attention. 
---
I don’t know what to say other than send a support ticket or something like that.
---
Honestly it’s gonna go this way so the servers and team to make the game fresh for years to come, seriously how do you think this game can pay for the people, pay the investors pay Todd to be an idiot this game needs to be financially viable for it to continue and if people are up in arms about how they’ve now been lied to they’re forgetting they’ve been lied to from when the game was first mentioned 
---
Also people have requested stuff about ammo scrapping, about repair kits and fridges now that’s it’s offered some people don’t like how it’s gonna be, we can’t make a multi billion dollar company make a game out way with out having them make sure they profit, so they broke another promise deal with it, if people quit then they quit, more people will come, if I get bored and leave the game myself then that’s how it goes I’ve gotten my money’s worth, I can focus on other things new games 
---
If you don’t like this grey area we’re in then don’t be a part of it I personally don’t need any of the proposed items to make me play better 
---
I'm a dataminer. It's in the files of the game itself
---
How can i get a link
---
Bethesda is STILL silent on this issue.  Unbelievable.
---
I have the same problem, and Cranberry Glade is one of the locations I've discovered that didn't count, too.
---
However, I started playing just after the end of the beta. So, there must be some additional reason why they wouldn't count.
---
I also have trouble with the atom challenges that require you to complete events. It seems like most events I do just don't count. That's both on challenges that just say "complete events" with no specifics, and those where it wants me to wear a hat or whatever and I'm wearing it.
---
So what is the defense about the Repair Kits then?  You get free Atoms in game for just playing the game so it doesn't make sense for people to cry out Pay to Win.  You can use your "free" atom points to purchase a 100% repair kit or play the game for a chance to earn the 150% repair kit.  None of the examples I gave is even paying for the items.  People may still choose to spend real money for the Basic Repair Kits but it's available for anyone that just plays the game.  
---
Https://youtu.be/p_9GdnAra5s
---
I can help you ill add you when are you on?
---
I have covered that somewhere else but again, there is nothing there that says no non-cosmetic items and there is nothing listed thus far that affects play "against other players" which can only be in a pvp encounter as that is the only time in the game that you are competing against other players.
---
The argument could be made that it was very precisely worded to give a different impression than what is actually said but everything that I have seen is very precise language much like you see in most commercials that extol virtues (or wave away flaws) in VERY precise ways and language.
---
24 hours. Can't believe it.
---
White Knight nerf didn't make sense. It just made me want to use it more since I can't just slap it on when repairing to avoid Ballistic Fiber, I gotta leave it on so it breaks less because repairing with the mod on costs more. :| 
---
Spoil rates are too unrealistic as well, so is the lack of craftable fridges when we can build nuclear generators and shit. o.o
---
Okay, so they’re at a disadvantage. And? How does that affect anything other than the one 24 person server they are currently on? There isn’t a worldwide leaderboard to be manipulated. Only thing that gets hurt by someone repairing in the middle of combat is pride. 
---
And ‘let these slide’? As if we have any control whether or not these get instituted. We might be able to give ideas on what happens with other stuff in the atomic shop, but the authorization for these came from up on high. Above Todd Howard’s head. Us yelling and screaming isn’t going to change that. 
---
Also, photo mode stances for drinking Nuka Cola, beers, and liquor.
---
They did mention that there may be creating the concept of seasons for the survival mode and in those servers new characters would be required.
---
I'd submit the current backlash as an example of why. 
---
Do you have neon letters plans though for sale?
---
Player vending would take tons more manpower and testing than an inventory item that turns a number into a 100. The reason they are doing it is because it fits into a perfect venn diagram of: easy to implement, gives small QoL improvement, can test selling in Atom Shop.
---
Also a better version of the item will be available in the game.
---
I realized you, me and Jmartz13 all have the same view here lol.  
---
&gt; \-No materials needed to enact the repair   
---
&gt; \-Makes it impossible to actually get 'everything' in the atom shop via gameplay, as it is a consumable item and as such, when used is no longer considered owned as you consume it  
---
&gt;\-Devalues trade of rare mats used in repairs (prices for springs/screws/crystal/etc. will plumet in caps value most likely)
---
Where did you hear this or are you just passing speculation as fact?
---
The only thing we know is that repair kits can be used anywhere without a crafting table and that we can get access to them through the atom store and possibly events. However, getting access to them from the atom store does not mean that we are buy the kit directly from the store. Does ANY OTHER ITEM get directly purchased through the store? Nope. Everything bought is a plan for the item and you then have to spend materials to craft said item. Why would repair kits be any different? 
---
We will probably buy the repair kit and get the ability to craft said kit using materials. Those materials will probably be far and above the normal repair costs since we are using this kit on any item and don't need a crafting table. Imagine making a kit but it costs a combination of weapon, armor, and PA materials and then maybe some flux on top of that. We don't know what it will be in the end but IMO it will be more expensive than traveling to a crafting station.
---
&gt; Repairs can be done mid combat, doubly so if you set up a macro for such to be able to 'hotkey' said repairs 
---
Oh? And just how long will said repair take? We don't know. It probably won't be instant and thus mid combat and hot keyable. It will probably take some amount of time and have an animation. All that time you are being shot at.
---
Please ma'm, since you have implied that you are the only grown up here, can you explain to all us "mobs of children", exactly what the "big picture" looks like?  I'm so tired of pretending to be an adult and not knowing what to think or have an opinion about.  It would be so much easier if you would just tell all of us what is acceptable criticism to all you  real adults out there.  There would be no need to comment or have debates, civil or otherwise, if you could just tell us what that "big picture"  is supposed to look like.  I would love to keep asking your advice on this matter, but I hear my mommy calling and I need to step away now and try to comprehend how I can be such a seriously.... serious and passionate player, yet be a rabid superfan at the same time.  It's just so hard sometimes, glad you are out there!!
---
Pretty sure they just promised it wouldn't be pay to win and that Atomic shop would be "mostly just cosmetics" not solely... But if you have a direct quote from someone official saying it would 100% only be cosmetics, I'd definitely be interested in seeing it. Otherwise this seems like another "new York is nothing but a crater" fallout lore via repetition rather than fact. 
---
In their own official response to people who disagree with repair kits they state that it "doesn’t offer anything with a competitive advantage, and more so, it aims to bring joy not just to you, but the other dwellers around you.” and I'd agree with them. 
---
This all just feels like people wanting to find something else to hate on again to keep 76 in a bad light finding more useless drama now that they've been doing a lot of things right in the development and their path forward. 
---
OK. Source?
---
And even if we know what they are it's still debatable if they even ever really intended to use them. (I'm sure they were but that's beside the point) 
---
Repair kits are strait from their own mouth 
---
You can contact them in Reddit, I just don’t know their usernames although you could probably look it up.
---
I coukd see am event that requires you to father lens pieces or whatnot to repair the telescope,  then the game rewards you with some alien shit. 
---
You buggin this game is dope, I played Anthem as well, its not bad but not even in the same realm as F76. Basically one of the best games out RN. Go play farcry or some shit. 
---
You're absolutely right. I never vats a sniper shot because of this. Even my Stalkers The Dragon has storm trooper accuracy in vats at 95%. 
---
YESSS!!!
---
Yep! In their mind they see what other companies are doing to increase profits on games they make, then trying to force and implement the features into their own. I find it highly unlikely the design team has much say.
---
Someone in a conference room somewhere said “hey doing this will significantly increase the bottom line for fo76” and then that became a thing that had to be done lol
---
I was on a post earlier where a PvP pro advised us on this. Obviously stay far from train stations but they had some other good tips.
---
If possible store your caps on an alt, you lose twice your level in caps if killed.
---
Store all aid and junk.
---
Savage divide and the mire are good areas for doing this. Far from train stations and lots of cover.
---
The top 3 players tend to be battles ground so stay away from them and avoid becoming one by killing yourself when necessary.
---
If you see another player don't expect any warning, they will almost certainly try and murder you on site
---
Micro transactions are not, by definition, mandatory. 
---
Pathetic.
---
Thanks for the offer! I'm on for a couple hours today but I'm not sure when I'll get another chance. If it happens to be tomorrow and I haven't managed the quest, I'll check in with you. 
---
It's not a visual glitch. I've had it for a while now. Leveled up several times from it. I'm on PC.
---
The current backlash would happen regardless of what was said in regards to the advanced repair kits
---
See all updates besides this specific aspect of this future one.
---
If you want to RP as the devil's advocate you can no one's gonna stop you. 
---
I understand the struggle because I own a store in the game and I'm always overencumbered. But I think that it would be a bad idea because it would make your second character an infinite stash box.
---
I'm on right now for a few hours 
---
Call Orkin 877-555-ORKIN they will get rid of your bugs.
---
I don't get it. When I did the same thing I lost zero caps
---
So? It is by definition a currency, and to access this new feature you have to exchange currency for it. The post is the literal definition of “free to play” and it matches what is being mooted here. 
---
I like how they spawn on top of grills, I wish CAMP grills generated them. 
---
Dailies proc when you get close to the quest area, but some are bugged still and never proc. Boomer is notorious for this. 
---
My no power armor melee character has about 12 agility for the damage resist perk, but he doesn't need a lot of agility skills. So I've always had thru hiker on and I don't think I can go back to playing without it
---
Is that legit?
---
Its too soon after, man. I still need to heal.
---
Ill add you and join you when i finished trading then we can do that.
---
Better cosmetics + reduced prices = $$$$$
---
Party boy only affects that one. Why does Nuka Dark have both effects if the alcohol ones do not get alcohol buffs?
---
hey, you take care now! :)
---
The only thing I can think of is that they increased the stash size, and fixing bugs but we shouldn't need to ask to have bugs fixed
---
Just for you, I did. You're welcome.
---
Thanks so much! 
---
No it shouldn't affect anyone I am not some super good player I am a casual player and it's not hard. The people complaining are just complaining to complain. We don't know much about these kits wait and see what is actually released and then maybe you'll be right and I am wrong but until then settle down 
---
I'm a pretty damn loyal Bethesda fanboy and this has hit me harder than any of the other decisions they've made. They've quite simply made liars out of themselves and are punishing the fans too. I wish I knew what they are thinking. Do they not have the funds for their next games? Are their staff in danger of layoffs and they're trying to correct it with drastic measures? I want to believe there's some extremely understandable reason why they are putting the game (and blades) on this path.  
---
Before now I was scoffing at the people who declared they would never buy from Bethesda again but I'm starting to understand now.
---
No, lol. It’s a joke.
---
one day, food spoiled at such and such a rate, the next day, after the fermenter update, it spoiled like 3x as fast.
---
people made posts about it right away.
---
how can you deny this? do you even craft food to know the difference?
---
do you do flux nuke runs? how have you not noticed it spoils super fast now?
---
are you just not paying attention?  im honestly curious how you could miss this glaring change, maybe you just dont use food or flux much
---
whatever, it doesnt change the fact there IS an increase in spoilage rates,whether you want to believe in it or not
---
You would just die trying to use it lol. Go ahead open your pip boy in the middle of a fight, see how it works out.
---
I was about ready to finally pick this game back up. But this.. This is just disappointing. 
---
Let me just craft 50 alcoholic beverages for 10 atoms then.... when everything 'decent' is over 300 atoms 
---
OP is reeeeeing here because bitch mommy didn't  make him tendies today.
---
Anyone wonder why player vending machines got moved up to the next patch.....  Cmon people seriously. If this shit flies with the repair kits, we will be purchasing player vending machines from the Atom Shop next!  Refrigerators, player vending machines, repair kits, fast travel points, animal companions, etc...
---
Thanks Bethesda. 
---
No its because Bethseda lied to us and told us the atom shop was cosmetic only.
---
I see your point.  I understand your concept of this being a testing ground.  Unless they are adding TSE weapons or Assassin's Sentinel gear etc., the items are P2W.  We will have to wait and see what the future holds with the Atomic Shop but as is, I feel the state of it isn't so good because they need to release some cosmetics that will drive people there.  Something like a Deathclaw Power Armor Skin or maybe a Goblin Slayer armor set. 
---
So far, same.  Wavy Willard's, Grafton Dam in TV.  Valley Galleria in Mire...haven't updated and are discovered on my alts.
---
You have a keykard i suppose if not its fine i have some free for you.
---
Yea it makes sense about it being OP, but it is alcohol after all so it should be affected. Even if it is nerfed slightly, just going up a small percentage per card level.
---
**For each outfit the buff stacked.**  Max of +60 HP which is comparable to some chems. I said it was a data grab that they'll then have the ability to show users "you have and will pay for this because you enjoyed it. You've done it before and you will do it again no matter what you say, as the data does not lie" 
---
Just watched a youtube video of the guy using it against the SBQ.
---
Yeah, if someone is smart enough to set the fight up so it's outside the radiation zone... You'd die a lot but in the meantime do a CRAAAAAZY amount of damage. Maybe makes more sense on PC then console where you can soup up your console so you don't take as much time to reload.
---
Also he suggested something intriguing to me... have someone shoot you with Rose's syringe right as the SBQ lands, get in at least one shot before she kills you. God that would be nuts.
---
Maxson’s coat. NCR appeal. 
---
Occasionally happens to me.  
---
I have learned to start backing up and to the left as soon as I can start moving.  
---
Gets me away from the edge of the cliff and to a point where I am also not inside my house.
---
It might be the XP bar visual bug. When you login to a new world your XP bar will be at zero, then when you make your first kill it corrects itself with all previously gained XP plus the new kill XP.
---
Tanagra town hands down 
---
That is true about the stimpacks. But I just say let’s see how it goes upon release. Everything else is conjecture. But I’m totally against pay to win. I just think it’s kind of different 
---
The exact spot my camp was placed was not taken. Another camp was in the area. You may have to search around and see if another camp is located nearby. 
---
Bruh im trying to not get banned rn
---
You’re full of it too. 
---
Apparently, Bethesda doesn't want anyone to play their game so they can turn off their servers.
---
Lawl, time to uninstall again.
---
Dying?
---
Most players will still shoot on sight. But generally if you are careful around the stations you will be ok 
---
Yeah it does not have to be straight up Ranger Armor.  Ranger Armor was just police riot guard armor with an trench coat.   Could be based on it!  Some new and refreshing but different. 
---
The fact that I can't get a responder paint job at the very least for the excavator armor still genuinely bugs me. 
---
I am not disagreeing any of your points, just saying that they did a great job with booze crafting. Using a short and entertaining quest, and then daily rewards for doing related things. It got them some players back and it gave us something we could do everyday. 
---
I feel that having a repair item as a craft-able would benefit from a similar implementation. 
---
Realistically that ship has sailed, they will either put it in the Atomic-Shop and weather the negative storm again, or they will remove or trivialize it's acquisition.
---
I to would rather they work on bigger fish in the frying pan, I would also like them to keep the store the way it was explained on launch. 
---
Since seeing your original post I've been there probably 25-30 times. I got the vendor bot once and I have yet to see the civil war reenactors. I have however gotten piles of scorch beast crap like 4 times so I got that going for me 🙁
---
This...this deserves an award, Bravo! 
---
Exactly...
---
So bypass it with the cash shop.
---
Now we can half assed design systems which people won't find fun but they'll keep playing because they can swipe by it.  Now we don't have to balance tedious and fun because people can swipe by it.  Our half assed efforts deliver more profits!  If you can't see where this is headed then you are blind.
---
Just completely unacceptable from them.
---
So you made a mistake
---
No, i have leveled up off it twice not intentionally i just log off close to a level up, log back in and bam i level up 54 xp twice 
---
Probably, and then Bethesda will tell you don't let that happen and close the ticket. 
---
It's not a big deal the internet just wants something to be up in arms about
---
&gt;Also people have requested stuff about ammo scrapping, about repair kits and fridges now that’s it’s offered some people don’t like how it’s gonna be
---
&gt;If you don’t like this grey area we’re in then don’t be a part of it I personally don’t need any of the proposed items to make me play better 
---
&gt; we can’t make a multi billion dollar company make a game out way with out having them make sure they profit
---
Dude seriously think about it they need money add that shit in for free then fucking whore us out. Add a fridge for free boom add nuka,vim,vault tec,Quantum,mothman,Virginia paint for it. Repair kits? Add clothing that is the kit hang on the armor. Ammo converter add clean,Military,BoS etc variants. 
---
If they want money just add shit in for free then make skins i will whore my self out for skins hell like a fornite they add shit in for free and have little  kids begging their parents for money to buy V bucks but this adding in items that should only be found in game that's just too far.
---
Here is what is really happening. Betheseda community reps have not responded to a single post on this matter. They have the weekend off and conveniently for them this issue will be completely removed from the front page by then due to the moderator's help here. Monday rolls around and we see them hard at work spewing happy feely standard fare replies to subjects and issues that don't rock the "money boat".
---
10/10 collaboration from the mod / community reps on this one imo.
---
:/im finna get banned for their mistake bruh 
---
If they want to waste real money to repair weapons to 100% let them be dumb I can repair to 200% without spending a dime. It's still not an advantage sounds like a disadvantage to me.
---
I love this game and I want to keep loving it. Sometimes its just hard.
---
Metrics are probably telling them if you hit the whales early you then throttle back late in post production to get max $$
---
I’d pay money for an anti material rifle skin for the hunting rifle,  Or maybe even an orange and blue summer themed power fist would be great.
---
It's a good solution.  
---
You may want to wait few days and repost, because right now I'm afraid your post will not be seen with the atm flame war XD.
---
That is true for a few hours of game play you can have the same advantage of someone who spent a dollar or two. 
---
the in game community is great, out of game.....hooo boy
---
Guess I’m a bootlicker because I live in a real world where COMPANIES LIE! Get over it, or quit playing the game. 
---
I have a Nuclear Keycard
---
You’re gonna hate me when I say I got the combo twice yesterday and found the war guy 6 times, he is how ever in the tall grass so when I spawn in I scope out the spot before I run in since the grass won’t be visible 
---
It won't "totally reverse all progress" at all. You're overreacting. 
---
LOL, they could barely program fo76 to run properly, like they can add a minigame into fo76.
---
sadness and a sense of rejection? Im flowing over. I can barely find myself in the deluge of emotional pain right now. Please pray for me.
---
Yep that does sounds weird. Agree with other reply, get a video, submit a ticket
---
Technically it is part for convenience,  but you can keep grandstanding.  You aren't completely wrong. 
---
ESO has been out for a while and out of beta... 
---
I don't understand why people are shocked by this?    
---
its a FOR PROFIT mmolite. 
---
People ARE giving them money through ATOM and that WON'T stop
---
FACT!
---
Saddest loser was you when your dad pulled out to early and the best part of you ran down your mom's inner thigh.
---
Having a BOS standard attached to the armor would be awesome!
---
combat rebalances small QoL updates. 
---
to be fair

---
Discredit the game?
---
That ship sailed a long time ago.
---
Just give us all the Fallout New Vegas armor in some sort of variance. 
---
I put in a ticket when the game ate my armor doing the feed the people quest. when I submitted a ticket they in a nutshell said, "well don't let the game do that" and closed the ticket. It was pretty chill tbh.
---
In all honesty though, you're probably fine.
---
I have 2 videos and how do i submit a ticket? Their forum? And do i need an account cause if thats a yes im fucked i cant ive tried 5 times now and it wont let me i just get an error
---
I contacted a community manager. She messaged me and asked me for my account name and said they'll sort it out. I also put in a ticket. Nothing happened. After the last update I lost some progress on Keys to the past but I don't know if it was related, as Keys to the Past is kinda bugged anyway. But I still get 100 XP when I log in.
---
I definitely want to lie in the bathtub full of money
---
Convenience that will turn to p2w down the line.
---
Just look at ESO.
---
I hope they never add any type of weapons/armor because then it’s just a pay to win however I wouldn’t mind them adding things like full armor/weapon repair kits or maybe a mats supply bundle just anything than legendary weapons/armor 
---
Point, well I live in hope than. Thanks for the info
---
Transparency: I'm **not** for their addition to the Atomic Shop. TL;DR at the bottom.
---
Honestly, I thought the same way initially when I saw all the threads repeating the same thing... until I saw one that mentioned something different: they aren't exclusive to the Atomic Shop.
---
At which point I felt obligated to read what Bethesda actually said in their article on it and if you by chance hadn't know this already: there will be kits in the shop that do repair stuff to 100% condition. ***However***, there will be kits in game that repair stuff to 150% that you can get for literally "free" through the reward system of doing quests/dailies/events. 
---
So while I **completely** understand the backlash this has received, and as someone \[that's 35yrs old\] who was in a similar position as owner/operator a Minecraft server for 4+years *(with 'donation packs' to keep things running)*, I feel uniquely qualified to legitimately see the issue through both side's eyes. We did the same sort exactly sort of thing with our items by having in-game long quest chains which awarded players some very cool "legendary" items which meant everyone could obtain them free of charge, we also would eventually combine those same items into a purchasable package that anyone who wasn't able to complete them or missed the timeframe the quests were active could still obtain. 
---
We *^(\[myself and admins who created the quests and items\])* would at times have to field a player's comments regarding the fact that it seemed P2W, but that generally was tempered when they found out that originally those packaged items all were freely obtainable through the quests and only were added later as a means to fund the server's operation (site and server ran me $130/mo). On the surface it didn't come across that way to newer players and I could appreciate where they came from. 
---
**TL;DR-** After owning/running a minecraft server with similar packages for players to purchase as a means to keep the server running, and now being purely a player in FO76, I totally understand the mindset of both Bethesda and players in this situation. Yet given that ***better*** repair kits will be obtainable in the game as well, it's a bit harder for me to justify that this actually is a matter of P2W and that it will result in any sort of massive advantage in PVP.
---
For anyone worried it will, perhaps a solution would be to limit the number of repair kits one can obtain through the store per week, or how many we can have in our inventory at any one time? The latter could even apply to those obtained in-game. Levels the playing field similar to how in Survival the Stimpacks can't be spammed since their effects no longer stack. 
---
Can people talk about something else???
---
I didn’t subbed to see whinnying.
---
oh really? huh
---
that's gotta be a glitch
---
There's a megathread for this now
---
Honestly a fridge won't matter.  You carry it around with you it spoils so fast it'll start going bad as soon as you have it out, and probably bad before you can use it.  What we need is the option to put preservatives in food so it lasts longer OUT of a a fridge.
---
I would think the distance between camps wouldn't have to be that large. It seems kinda crazy if that's the reason. Cause there couldn't have been one within at least 100 yards ? Oh well. Iv been doing most of my repair and crafting at white springs anyway lately cause I kept checking for plans at the bunker vendor. 
---
I've been debating trying to do a document all the Brotherhood names, graves, and other fallen members to get a rough count of how big the Brotherhood was.  But I haven't quite gotten the motivation.
---
Well they released the game in a broken and buggy state even tho they had to know how much backlash they'd get so I think breaking a promise isn't a thing they care about too much.
---
I think that advantage is offset by the fact they can't use a repair kit to repair to 200%
---
It's after the 24 hrs? I'll take this down then
---
You just made my day!
---
“The Atomic Shop was founded to give you as much choice and variety in how you want to customize and celebrate your adventures. It doesn’t offer anything with a competitive advantage, and more so, it aims to bring joy not just to you, but the other dwellers around you.”
---
This is taken directly from Bethesda’s website. It sure sounds like the shop is intended for cosmetics only 
---
Bethseda clearly stated many times their view on the atom shop. Now 6months in how the tables have turned. 
---
I stopped playing my melee character for a while now. rip.
---
EVERYONE is gonna have a field day. Its already popping up everywhere. "OMG TODD LIED TO US BETHESDA BAD". I do wish they would stop blaming the devs for these things though. For some whenever this stuff happens they think it is Todd Howards fault and put his face in the thumbnail. 
---
I love how they think adding a parade and 2 minutes of content gives them the right to do this. 
---
Not to shift blame away from Bethesda but I think we'd have a better chance of purely cosmetic microtransactions if people (not necessarily many on this subreddit but in general) didn't flip shit and riot over even purely cosmetic microtransactions. My logic for this is if Devolpers see huge outrage online about the most innocent of microtransactions it probably makes the outrage over more profitable pay to win microtransactions less of a deterrent. For example a company choosing between some additional revenue and sizeable outrage about microtransactions even though there not pay to win and totally optional vs large additional profits and large outrage. They might go for the even greater revenue since they'll take a noticeable PR hit either way. 
---
Just logging in and out so kinda i guess??
---
How about just play the damn game or the game wasn't meant to be played by you? What happens when +50% Damage items go into the Atom Shop? Double XP cards? Timer lockouts on certain events that you can remove for a "nominal" Atom fee? I will say that we have to wait and see what they're talking about as what is in writing is intentionally vague. However the core principle stands the same. Keep in game buffs in game and keep Atomic Shop purchases cosmetic only. Progress or in game buffs should not be determined by how deep someone's pockets are. That is not what gaming is about to gamers ( I say gamers because companies have lost sight) I don't blame Bethesda. I blame Zenimax.
---
Reddit mods will censor it so, it won't matter. It's up to YouTubers now tbh 
---
Or it shows that whatever Bethesda does to the game people will still play it
---
I do not. If I had them, I'd gladly give them to at no charge.
---
Guy with repair kit can hide or find cover and repair his weapon. My options are secondary weapon or run and find a work bench. How is that not an advantage?
---
Yeah, you've really got to dig through the subreddit to find it though 😁
---
Text chat would be helpful as well.
---
I want Faction CAMP stuff. Add BoS, Enclave, Freestates, Raiders, and Responders stuff. I want people to know my camp is open to them. I want a responder sign for it
---
....................................
---
IT'S TO JUST FIX YOUR FUCKING SHIT. WHAT PART OF THAT IS HARD TO FUCKING UNDERSTAND?!
---
The boss can be a goulified Maytag repairman.
---
But as u state. There is an advantage.
---
I’m not ignoring anything, I’m simply refusing to engage in False Cause and Bandwagon Logical Fallacies. Look up “logical fallacy”, you’re committing them left and right because your argument is baseless 
---
Pls no skyrim helmet 
---
I guess you have to give people a heads up, they'll be like super amazed for sixty seconds and then super po'd.
---
Survival, especially as it stands now, is definitely not my cup of tea.
---
But in reading your criticism one thing stands out: your timeframe.  Even in a scenario where Survival required players to generate new characters... you're a week and a half late to the game.  That's certainly enough time for players to have leveled to a point that your new character stands zero chance against them... leaving you more or less in the same position you're in now.
---
And I clearly stated this was against thier word in the first paragraph of my post. I just don't think it gives an advantage in PvP so it isn't pay to win. 
---
Maybe everyone should put away the flaming pitch fork mods. And relax a little bit this isn't pay to win. It's useless
---
That "[never](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Iguana_bits)" happened 
---
Wait, would that mean they would only be selling 'cosmetic only' items in the Atom Shop?
---
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!!!!  WHY DIDN'T ANYONE MENTION THAT BEFORE??!?!??!
---
There is no paid dlc 
---
While I agree with your cynicism because I share it. Playing it and not having people pay server bills are two different things. 
---
There have been people reporting that message for weeks.  Many threads on it.  No one has actually seen the sheepsquatches come out.  The message is in error.
---
Unless you actually laid eyes on the sheepsquatches.
---
Glad I'm not the only one seeing the big picture here.
---
There’s a new upgrade coming out in the next month or two. You don’t have to get it to play.
---
Not everyone is a whore for skins, the ones I have I paid from the free atoms I’ve earned, it’s obviously a move by Bethesda to increase revenue since the purely cosmetic stuff isn’t bringing in enough, and I bet that over the next while all those rare outfits will start popping up in the store to
---
They’re gonna find a way to get everyone to want to spend money, ultimately I’d like to se the route of a 5$ a month subscription to play 
---
I'm with you.  A new quest would be great, though I think the repair kits were an afterthought (I'm not sure how), and the Bif line was pre-planned well in advance.  I'm just thinking that at this point, a new questline would be something that would take a couple months to implement (at least), and the proverbial cat is already out of the proverbial bag and walking around spraying everything.
---
If they decide to get on top of the PR, the best (if not the *right*) thing to do would be to walk back the *cost* and make it a free item in the store.  I could care less about the 'cosmetic only' promise as long as it doesn't kick off P2W (and for the record, repair kits could cross that line, very slightly, IMO).  I think *most* people that are whining about cosmetic only would shut right up if the cost was 0, as they're using that as a straw man for the P2W content, even if it's really just perceived P2W.
---
Not all mutations would get them but marsupial is one of the major ones I was hoping for, check the trailer for mutations it actually shows what I think it should look like.
---
Unless you actually went and saw them it’s a fairly common bug where it tells you your workshop is under attack by them, but when you actually go there’s none there 
---
Refrigerators? Sweet!
---
It's not a matter of finding junk, it's a matter of being able to repair during battle. It's the advantage of not having to go back to camp or a train station to repair. It's the advantage of not needing the junk on hand at that moment.
---
It's an advantage. Not a huge one, but still an advantage.
---
I find you guys to be too SJW and yeah okay it's fine to witch hunt legacykillaHD etc.. but yet I can't post backlash with shit show meme post's..... give me a break.
---
You keep thinking p2w means winning a pvp confrontation or something. That's not even remotely the issue. The issue here that this paves the path towards pay walls being put up in the game, as well as predatory business.
---
Point taken
---
First thank you for the service you provide I do the same thing. I use my mic and ask people to kill me sometimes I have to joke around with them and say" I will crouch down and not look you in the eyes when you Negan me"
---
Ah okay makes sense. I didnt go back to the workshop, so i havent seen them yet
---
😂😂 dude if u think if the company lies to us that its going to stop here. Repair kits are test. 
---
Its there gateway...
---
You're telling me you not going to be able to chase him down and kill him before he can pull that off? 
---
Seriously how long do you think a PVP fight takes?
---
I'm pretty sure a lot of players have got bored. And I doubt they have sold enough copies to counter people leaving for various reasons.
---
They should honestly just add new perk cards into the game that either make you consume less bullets  when you fire   like every three bullets you shoot you gain 1 back.
---
&gt;Rank 1: Every 5 bullets you shoot you gain 1 bullet.  
---
&gt;Rank 2: Every 3 bullets you shoot you gain 1 bullet.  
---
&gt;Rank 3: every 2 bullets you shoot you gain 1 bullet.
---
This would fit too since, at the moment at least, nobody wants 76 to be cannon in the series at all.
---
Not really leaving, this playerbase is frozen.
---
Maybe like plants we can’t eat?
---
One more question. Will I be frustrated if I play it without playing Skyrim?
---
How long have you played?  I've played since BETA and it's much better than it used to be.  There's always room to improve things, and they are, but give them time.  Accidentally scrapping bulk items was a significantly less problematic issue than accidentally using an X-01 Calibrated Shock as 1 Steel Scrap when you're repairing a piece of armor.  Priorities, after all.
---
But this shit in the Atom Shop of going non cosmetic?  Unacceptable.
---
Lol got him
---
Honestly, haven't seen a single outfit in game that would really belong in a classic fallout game
---
I’ve seen it as a horde event before, went to it and it changed to feral ghouls.
---
The secret to not getting banned?
---
Not cheating.  Shhhhh, don't tell anyone else.
---
Yeah, this specific item isnt a big deal. But I have a problem with being mislead by Bethesda. 
---
So you haven't found them then
---
I don't want to get a Mic because I don't want to hear your voice or anybody else's voice while I'm playing a video game.
---
 Last time I had the Mic volume up some dude was chewing something right into the microphone. Every time he took a sip of whatever it was he was sipping he went aaaahhhh...
---
 No thank you, leave me and my immersion alone.
---
Making challenges that generate currency rather than simply “give you the thing” is a step in the process that isn’t needed and only exists ultimately to leverage the ability to charge for things as the game goes on. This is lazy game design which can be tolerated if for novelty items only, it is there to reward people with Dads credit card who desire immediacy over effort. Hence; you. 
---
I’d rather remove the store entirely and if you collect 76 wrenches you get the plan to build repair kits? That’s the difference. This version rewards playing the game, the other is a financial exchange pure and simple.
---
I know you can earn Atoms, I get it, but what you are describing is closer to work than it is a game e.g. complete tasks for financial rewards. 
---
I guess you’re happy for the medium to increasing pander to the clueless. But I would rather not have everything cool they introduce going forwards, however small, be behind a paywall. 
---
I’m far from some troll here so let’s not characterise me as such, I’ve been playing since Beta, through all the noise and I’ve been in defence of Bethesda far more than not. If they want to make more money either make more interesting cosmetics on the Atom Store or add substantial new content ala Nuka World or Far Harbour, but leave the Atom Store as a cosmetics only place and all will be well. 
---
Anyway; it’s been fun my Mom is calling and I’ve got homework before bed. /sarcasm
---
When r/fallout doesn't like Fallout.
---
Its not about likes. I can get downvoted into non existent and i wouldn't change my mind. Its not even our yet, so start saving your atoms kid, and save the salt for when Bethesda actually crosses the line.
---
Idk how you die to FO76 super mutants, especially while in power armor
---
Reddit is statistically college educated men in their early 20s. So... we DO understand logical fallacies if we’ve taken freshman humanities classes. Which we statistically have. Implying you’re special for recognizing fallacies is embarrassing, and just not true based on demographics. 
---
That’s why it’s boring, we know how fallacies work. My argument is that you’re boring, so you can’t claim ad hominem when my entire argument isn’t about the original topic, it’s about trying to make you realize that this kind of shit is going to get you mercilessly snubbed if you try it outside of Reddit or a college debate. 
---
Ya they need to hire a 3rd party to host or run the servers. 
---
I think it's all a matter of communication once again from Bethesda :    
---
I would hate for one if they'd really introduce the kits as a pay-to-obtain element.  Because imo, whatever goes into all those games shops as beeing usefull for gameplay becomes p2w.   
---
Even if it doesn't cost much, even if the advantage ingame is minimal. As long as you allow that stuff to be either bought with real money or something else, it is p2w.  
---
One can agree or not about it. You don't see issue with it costing few atoms, I don't either because as you said, it is easily earnable ingame. But it still p2w. 
---
 People at large are roaring about this, and I stand with their point too. Not because of the price of it -wich will be low, but because it introduces now ways for bethesda to push more into it, and add further p2w elements in the future - such as maybe the fridge? etc.
---
Now all that said, the way they have communicated about it gives ground for way too much speculations about how, why, what? wtf.  
---
It is very unclear how all this work, and I guess the intent wasn't to create a flame war over, if it was not for again some shaddy wordings from bethesda communication. 
---
As well I can also say from what I've read this won't be p2w at all, but it's a maybe, because unclear. They need to review their communication. 
---
I like my chameleon.
---
For non-scoped items, modding for glow or reflex sights will help with your issue.
---
Let it go. (Bad Frozen joke I'm sorry.)
---
It's a shame as the idea of a cooperative fallout had such potential.
---
I agree completely, given it as a free item would be the easiest way to disperse it instead of an in-game find. Looking forward to see what happens with this!
---
I have been watching this Sub over the months seeing what improvements etc are made to see if I want to try and play... The addition of non cosmetic items to Atom Shop sealed it for me.
---
To start adding this already they have shown thier hand. I will not support this game or future titles. They are going after whales and mobile game tactics... It will continue to be a slow feed of items in like this. This company is far from what it used to be.
---
I've been in a few that took more than the 1 second you seem to think they last.
---
what if they have a stealth boy? mid fight repair. Chameleon mutation or armor? mid fight repair. Happy to see you are more than willing to die on this hill though.
---
Except those aren't the only options, and I did pay to play already. This isn't a small developer they aren't cancelling production if they can't sell some repairkits
---
definitely can see future quest stuff here and espec if you tie it in with alien blaster and/or star boy living on the roof of Morgantown.
---
So you’d be fine with, ammo, caps and scrap, stim packs and Chems being atom shop items. Because you can get them in game. And it still fits the definition of pay to win. You are just ok with some types of PTW. 
---
This is why Bethesda should never come to this reddit or care.
---
"repair 30 different weapon types" reward one repair kit. 
---
Just make it so a week of doing dailies pays for it.
---
Nothing magic.
---
It rewards players playing more.
---
I remember him changing it, just never heard him change it back  :D
---
Bowler hat 
---
holy shit so direct observable evidence is not enough for ya huh?  and multiple separate recorded observations from totally different people unprompted doesnt raise your eyebrows?
---
i bet you are tons of fun at parties
---
Except the red stove skin kept the janky, crooked oven door. Almost bought it too, until I saw that detail in someone else’s camp.
---
10/10 would own
---
Just get them in game without paying
---
Wow this is quality. You outlined the possible (probable?) cause for adding paid convenience items, and a way to alleviate  their problems without actually making non-cosmetic items cost atoms. 
---
I’d expand it to more, too. Take the atom rewards away from two daily challenges. One now gives you a repair kit, one gives you a plan.
---
Don’t have atom sinks, just reduce the flow of daily atoms. 
---
It's not thier gateway. Reddit is shutting that door it's crazy obvious the majority of people will never buy these. 
---
FYI pay to win already exists in the game but Bethesda aint collecting the check. Whether it be the trading subreddits (paid with in-game items) or ebay Pay to win is already in effect.
---
1. Games as a service model.
---
2. Make a shitty game, change game over time to increase dependence on items. Offer items only through cash channels.
---
3. Profit.
---
So far it's just for story, she was the decommissioned bot from the massage parlor
---
Because if enough people compain about it they will change it.
---
I like the idea of repair kits, let us craft them or find them in game and not sell them thru the Atomic Shop.
---
Leave the Atomic Shop for the cosmetic stuff.
---
they didnt just mislead, they lied outright.
---
Battlefront 2, up until recently
---
I think you are on a new server each time could be the XP catching up to you if you clear for example the White Spring club house and immediately server hop.
---
I'll tell you when you're older. 
---
Lol "If we want this game to not die due to bad PR, this is something we must resist."
---
News flash F76 is already dead. Threads from white knight defending the game and saying how bad reviews/opinions are blowing things out of proportion can finally shut it. Guess what, F76 is still shit and doesnt have enough players to keep F76 alive thats why they need these p2w microtransactions. 
---
So where are all the F76 defenders telling anyone with a negative opinion to get out? Well, we did and now your game doesnt have enough income.  Have fun with your dead game.
---
There is no way a repair kit will be viable to use in battle it takes too long to use and PVP fights are too quick
---
I wouldn't have a problem with it if you could buy mods with caps. But buying anything with atoms that isnt an emote or cosmetic is a problem for me.
---
oh I had exactly the same thing happen. I figured his leaving had opened up a slot for me to parachute in, and his camp was on exactly the same spot as mine and there was some overlap as his camp dematerialized. Pretty wild.
---
No thanks.
---
I don't plan on buying them anyway.
---
 Link to comments by Bethesda peeps. Send them a message.
---
[**u/BethesdaReplied**](https://www.reddit.com/user/BethesdaReplied)
---
I didn’t start playing until 3 or 4 days after launch, still bugged. I made a new character recently and went to those places, still nothing. 
---
...For real?
---
Are we seriously going to make this big of a fuss over it? Smh.
---
Yeah, but did you finish the job?
---
I was paraphrasing you when I said "advantage". I don't think paying Atoms to get less repair than free is an advantage. It's P2bW (Pay to be weaker).
---
Seriously.  The game cost $60 base, I bought the Power Armor edition because I love the helmet. But selling a skin that is 1/3 the cost of the base product?  Insane.
---
I have no issue with P2W. If a game wants to be that let it and people get a free game but can boost by spending some cash. I wanted to just buy a game and now they are changing the rules. Shame. I stared this game at launch, not impressed. Recently returned and find the game very addicting. But now I am wondering whether to jump ship again. Let the whales devour the sinking ship. 
---
The nerve of people to like and have interest in something that you don't.
---
You can have ONE person with you. Once there are more than two people all of a sudden tons of high level robots spawn in, super annoying.
---
Another surprise tweet was that you can now get your own real life plush MrFuzzy toy just like the ones in Camden Park but I guess the news got lost under the weight of repair kit feedback lol
---
I don't even bother stashing food.  One mole rat or wild dog attack keeps me fed for days
---
I don't know white knight seems to be buffed again to me. I rapaired once in a week.
---
Why do ppl even try to use this as defense.?So there are cheaters in the game so lets be okay with loyal fans being cheated by the company? Come on.
---
I'm not entirely debating that if that is your gripe fine but that is not the gripe that is plaguing this reddit it's saying it's p2w which it is not 
---
I can understand that to some extent, though I’d think it’d be easy to clip the video and remove the name of the account too.
---
I’ve just yet to see compelling evidence that anyone legitimately received a ‘rare’ mask, though I’d prefer to be proven wrong. 
---
Yeah tried that, can't kill anything and don't have stimpaks and the game isn't fun to play, just a chore
---
If they can be rewarded from events that means they can be traded to players. You'll be able to buy more than you know what to do with soon from other players, and they'll be better than the ones in the atom shop
---
Ah ok, I thought it was more than one person added additional spawns. I’ve only successfully launched one nuke and I did it myself. 
---
Go ahead and boycott if enough players do this then I might start to get great 3 star legendary drops please I beg you boycott this game.
---
That's one way of dealing with the repair kits, have fun playing the game!
---
Use Endangerol
---
Well, you’re right with motivation etc., but after the Unstoppables stuff a while back this just draws a clear line that there is absolutely no advantage to someone paying real world $$$, never mind how trivial the advantage or how minor the cost.
---
Naa not that one
---
MY mutations don't let me enjoy that anymore.
---
You should totally stop playing the game. Please dont hurt yourself outside of the game however.i know how bad this can be with what they did. It's just not worth it.
---
Me on the other hand? I am going to continue loving this game and have no plans to ever buy a repair kit. This affects me in no way.
---
Maybe but that doesnt explain why it levels me up 
---
I might disagree but I respect a good argument, which in this case it isn't so I neither agree nor respect.
---
I plead the fifth, Officer.

HEEERE HUMAN HUMAN HUMAN

I GOT A PRESENT FOR YOOOOOOUUUUUUUU
---
pretty much every freemium game has ways to earn their currency. that doesnt make them not P2W. Any game where paying money to gain a competitive edge is P2W.
---
I think the frustration is due to people wanting it to be like Fallout 4... I play both and have no issue.
---
After doing about eight of these I have been getting nothing but duplicates despite not having half of the recipes. I really wish the 20 hour timer was from when you start the mission and not from when you end it.
---
Listen Todd, no means no. Your not going to convince anyone that atomic shop items aren't micro transactions.
---
Excellent idea! But I've never even seen a wooden sentinel piece posted on the trading sub. Do they exist?
---
this robot is used for windows update, and she crashes...
---
Yup

---
Cosmetic only is what they sold us. Not cosmetic and utility. If they do actually follow through with repair kits..next will be xp boost. Then comes the special week only guns. And welcome to a game thats pay to win. 👍
---
This 100 percent
---
Just another heads up.  The west side of the trailer has a locked safe.  But against the wall on the right side behind the safe is a magazine spawn location.  
---
While server hopping for the vendors I found two holotape game magazines.  
---
Please use a clean syringe each time we already have enough diseases in the wasteland.
---
Trilby? 
---
I haven’t been able to play for a while, what’s all this?
---
Sounds like you are having fun with the game and enjoy the game!
---
Well, maybe we'll have rusted-out looking refrigerator plans in-game and can buy prettier ones in the Atom Store. I would be okay with that.
---
Trollollolol. You’re not witty. Just give it up. 
---
Really getting tired of values changing and things getting nerfed/buffed. It’s been out 6 months already. 6 more months it will be a totally different game. 
---
Thank you 
---
Indeed, the extreme forced opinion is getting out of hand.
---
Many people are waiting for private servers and charging for them would be a great way to make money. They also need to add in stuff people actually want. Those datamines are great but most of the time they release absolutely trash with a gem or 2. Think they put multiple items out at the same time black bird,black and gold revolver,camp stuff they'd make a killing. 
---
If they organized releases better and focused slightly less on frilly dresses and suits but more fallout stuff they'd do better like that bloody paint,survival outfit,VTU suit, raider skull cage armor. They need to treat it like a fist fight blow after blow of great items so we blow through our reserves 
---
Ill check right now i have it on my other character
---
They do it because bad publicity is better than no publicity
---
You are able to craft much more ammo if you have the prime receiver, it uses ultracite .308. The only drawback is farming for violet flux.
---
You must be responding to somebody else entirely, because that reply doesn’t make sense. 
---
Those items are currently in game.  This is adding a new item that is currently not in game so it's not really the same thing.  But to be honest I really wouldn't care either way.  You have people that claim the Munitions Factory and have thousands of ammo compared to me.  I'm not upset about that because that's their style of playing.  But yeah, it really wouldn't matter to me.  If you go back and read my original post, I just don't agree with the outcry of this being P2W but I agreed with people being upset that it's an item that's available when it's not a cosmetic item like they promised the Atomic Shop wouldn't only be cosmetics.  
---
I just can't find the joy of being killed over and over again and when I start doing something a high level character comes and one shot me, this game is not beginner friendly at all
---
That isn't PR. It is facts. Claiming that someone said/promised something that they never did is flat out lying. 
---
There might be lots of reasons to criticism Beth and 76 but just making up stuff that didn't happen doesn't work.
---
Unnamed ones are for Excavator.  Usually have Black Titanium listed as components. 
---
Yes it does I just found that the other day too..... when the safe didn’t spawn in
---
Liberty prime skim
---
OP, are you just going to keep making posts daily about this food spoilage thing? I'm going to be honest, if you are, make a video proving it's a thing first. I'm sick of everyone hopping on that bandwagon when I know the difference is imagined.
---
Lets not also forget that LARGE PARTS OF THE GAME ARE STILL BROKEN! Servers still crash frequently, and the game is still a buggy mess overall. 
---
They've made great progress, but they are in no way done fixing the core game that we bought in November. 
---
Damn it Gary! 
---
I half suspect it was purposefully placed to deflect from the delay of player vending. I also half suspect they'll do a 180 on it and say "ok no problem guys no repair kits in the shop" shortly after player vending goes live. 
---
Are you giving out tin foil hats too?
---
You realize theres a repair all button legit all you have to do is repair
---
Sadly, it doesnt matter how clear they decide to be. People will cry b/c that's what they do. They come here daily just to complain.
---
I literally just said that even if P2W is an advantage you can't call this P2W then because you can get a better version in the game for free and you can earn Atomic Points which you can use to purchase the basic version if you choose to do so.  I'll make it simple:
---
If you can get it in game for free (currency or otherwise) then it's not P2W. 
---
Are you trolling or are you just this dumb? 
---
Seems like it would be a bit too much for them but I would absolutely spend atoms on that.
---
Play to win means paying for an in game advantage. This qualifies. 
---
Read their FAQ on fallout 76
---
Right now the only recipes I am missing are:
---
* Cranberry moonshine
---
* Firecracker whiskey
---
* Nuka-Cola Dark
---
* Firecracker whiskey Manhattan
---
* Firecracker whiskey Old Fashioned
---
* Hard lemonade
---
Need to find the random encounter for the lemonade stand, and have been hitting up Biv daily ever since the quest was available.  Only have a few duplicate recipes.
---
Soon my dream to open a wasteland bar and get everyone drunk will be complete!
---
Someone told me they viewed the SBQ through the VATS perk that tells you the critters damage resistance before and after shooting her with the endangerol syringer and there was no change. He therefore concluded that the endangerol syringer doesn't work on her.
---
I dunno what to believe, TBH. Guy seems to prowl around the boards pouncing on everyone who suggests it.
---
Stay blissfully ignorant, until more information is released, whatever they're talking about is irrelevant speculation.
---
Well said.  
---
They are very good if your friends are slow sorting through their stash. Wish we could favourite then though.
---
I’ve come to see the issue is because of an increased swing speed versus server / player latency. 
---
Awesome! Thanks 
---
Black prospectors hat! 
---
\*they're and \*it's
---
and it literally is a microtransaction.
---
Thank you! 
---
I'm assuming "coming here" also implies "playing FO76"? Which if so... I suspect because this isn't all that different from any other Fallout game since Bethesda took over? Issues abound, mechanics we don't necessarily agree with, but the difference this time is we're powerless to do anything about it except either rant and hope we're heard or stop playing. 
---
We still love the franchise, don't get us wrong, so we forgive some of these odd choices they've made. However, prior to 76 we were able to do something about it through modding, which we're (understandably) incapable of since it's an MMO; thus, if we want to continue playing and still have things not get worse and even improve, all we have is our voice. 
---
Unfortunately, we seem to think that more posts = better versus upvotes and commenting on one solitary post. All that does is prevents business-as-usual posting which inundate us **all** by hiding cool stories, interesting finds, novel suggestions, or people asking for help :(
---
This is such an EPICALLY bad idea, Bethesda should DoIt!  Anything to take attention away from their pay to win mechanics.
---
The flamer is nigh impossible to use as well.
---
And yet here I am making a character that solely uses it.
---
Play in adventure mode then?
---
Wow bro, lay off the pyscho and enjoy your soon to be micro transaction infested game. 
---
lol
---
Apparently extremely
---
Thank you sir. 
---
Unpopular opinion : Ranger Armor is overrated.
---
Let the downvotes commence. 
---
spending money on virtual currency is literally a microtransaction
---
what kind of loser begs developers to releasing something as micro transactions instead of actual game content. what the fuck is wrong with you. 
---
I know Bethesda likes to pretend New Vegas doesnt exist, but in this case they should get over themselves and give us New Vegas cosmetics. Its a money maker. It would sell like crazy compared to any other FO76 cosmetic they sold before.
---
I was
---
It seems to work when I use it. Can see my damage (grey bar when attacking) start to move faster after she been hit. Mostly anecdotal but I just hit her once when she lands and switch so it doesn't eat a lot of my time either way. 
---
You sir are correct 😝
---
The funny thing is, the ones complaining (Myself included) are the ones that truly are looking at the "big picture". 
---
Not my fault that you're acting stupid.
---
They left the door open... so yeah
---
Working as intended, your welcome. 
---
I don't know why they are turning to non-cosmetics already. Fortnite has been consistently producing good cosmetics, emotes and weapon skins for a year. And people eat it up. 
---
They could add anything from the older games and people would eat it up just through nostalgia. 
---
You're more than welcome to join my husband's fallout 76 club if interested. However, you must be 18+ as it is a group full of adults who play the game together. 
---
Bravo’s actual nuke silo opening is just east of grafton steel
---
If you have pacifist enabled slap damage doesnt work anymore against you or your camp.

Toxic people cant do anything anymore besides re ree on their mics and even that's muteable.
---
Alright that one problem fixed, now where do I get some stimpaks
---
I'm acting stupid so you act psychotic?  Beat your wife because she makes you do it?
---
it literally is pay to win because someone can pay to have an advantage in PvP
---
Obviously not, cause i still can't olay and never cheated. But thank you for your caring words.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/
---
were you even playing at release? do you know how much this game sucked back then? if Bethesda wants to redeem themselves, fixing the game is the only way.
---
not adding fucking P2W items in the cash shop for entiteld gamers like yourself.
---
You're a twat. And we have to worry about what you do because what you do directly affects the kind of games we get and the bullshit we are forced to put up with. It's caused by you ya stupid fuck lol.
---
it's not a slippery slope, these literally are P2W, I can buy a bunch of repair kits and have an advantage in a protracted PvP fight...
---
If you have a good understanding of english,switch to it in every game,film or whatever is english based. You'll understand twice the jokes and won't fall for these stupid translations.  
---
Some translation change the names of things in horrible ways, sometimes even to the point of misleading you. I remember many friends that asked me what a trophy was about because the transaltion was just wrong.
---
I'm unarmed and I've made friends that burn through ammo so we worked out a deal. I hang on to and craft what they need, usually .308, and they compensate me with whatever they have. I once traded about 1500 .308 for about 300 pounds of Power Armor parts, I was able to nearly empty all the vendors of my daily cap limit with it. Another time I traded a ton of ultracite ammo for 5 recipes; two I didn't have on my main, 3 I needed for alts. I probably got the shit end of that deal but I was never going to use it.
---
There are plenty of unarmed players out there that would love to actually get paid for all the ammo they collect, just don't let them rip you off. They don't need it and any payment is pretty much acceptable.
---
Theres no way these guys haven't seen it. They just aren't allowed to say anything about it. 
---
I love that you posted that.  "with real money".  So for the 100th time should I tell you that you can get it in game anyways?  Both currency and a better version.  So if I choose to use my atoms that I've earned to purchase that repair kit, are you going to be screaming "you paid to win"?  Because then I would just no I didn't.  I played the game.  
---
If that bloody armour skin worked on outfits I’d give my soul
---
A private server with mods would be great, I love fo4 with the cavalcade of mods
---
A working washing machine.
---
I want clean underwear and clothes.
---
And all I want is a chefs jacket and butcher knife to go with the chef hat. I WANNA PLAY BUTCHER PETE, DAMNIT!
---
I normally find them all over or craft them. An easy alternative is collecting soot flower and bloodleaf around and combining with boiled water to create healing salve. If u combine this with super duper and green thumb 100 of each makes almost 250 healing salve.
---
I’ve only found Nuke Tapper and Grognak, gotta keep looking.
---
If I owned one, there is no way I would come forward.  The community would automatically brand you as a cheater, claiming that you must have gotten it from the dev room (despite the fact that old man winter and the sun were never actually in the dev room), or they would ignore the fact that perhaps you play on xbox and to the best of my knowledge xbox was the only platform with *no* confirmed dev room glitches.  
---
People claim they want proof, but that proof is never enough.  First it was, we need to see a picture of one from in-game to prove they exist. A few pictures were posted, but then it changed to "we need video proof of seeing it listed as a reward on someone's screen."  There is never enough proof to satisfy someone who is hellbent that there is some sort of conspiracy at play.  If video proof was posted, the claims would then be that the video was doctored.
---
Hell no.  If I had a rare faschnacht mask I would keep it in my stash, occasionally pulling it out to lovingly stroke it and whisper, "my precious..."
---
I didn't play in beta...
---
&gt;I've been in a few that took more than the 1 second you seem to think they last.
---
Yes and both your weapons broke and you made a frantic dash to the nearest weapons repair bench because neither of you had a second weapon.
---
I totally do not think your full of it. Or exaggerating how long it takes to PVP. You see I've bever been in a PvP fight in this game so this is all new to me forgive my innocence to the subject.
---
many will ignore this, but the point is people can pay for an advantage in PvP, that's literally P2W
---
These ingredients can be found around vault 76/Fleetwood area along that river the spot flowers are blue and the bloodleaf is red
---
It's *not real*. Prove it if you're so sure. Otherwise stop giving people bad info.
---
Something I've always wondered, and can't verify from my own experiences...if there are people where your camp would be when you load in, is it possible you get that message?
---
I was watching someone play last night, and they were exploring the exact spot my base was located (it's a bit out of the way, so it was pretty noticeable).  I wondered what would happen if I were to log in to that server at that exact moment. 
---
Wish I could give this comment more upvotes!
---
We need a method of getting these in game, in end game content.  Right now the SBQ gets you rad shower plans.  And nothing else of any import.  I would love end game content in this game with a purpose and would happily pay for different appearances of those items from the shop.  But the base item being purchasable only is BS and shady tactics.
---
we want the repair kits, but we don't want them to be items in the Atomic Shop
---
I like how the evolved versuon of tequila and champagne give no bonaus or even take out one.
---
Hard to forget since I've gotten it twice now and it's SUPER ANNOYING because it requires blooming strangler pods WHICH DEGRADE IN ABOUT AN HOUR - parachuted in, noticed heart of the swamp was active, ran to collect some blooming pods, then did the heart of the swamp event, and then someone nuked fissure prime, so I took off good with salt, and by the time I was done collecting violet flux to replace the ammo I'd just used up the strangler blooms had SPOILED GGGGGGRRRRAAAAAARGGHHHH!!!!!
---
Finally someone who noticed this how does a .38 pipe pistol do more damage then a 10mm that one bugs me.
---
I get jealous whenever I see someone post about getting a server to themselves. I've never once had it. Everytime I log on there's six people at Whitesprings, two at West-Tek, three in Watoga and the ammo factory is always taken. 
---
I would love this!  Unfortunately  Bamco and Bethesda would never agree on terms 
---
So the argument against this is that it will ruin the game someday down the road, so instead we should all ruin the game now? Makes sense...
---
P2W in a competitive online game isn't a big deal?  since when?
---
Meme, window, you...splat
---
I just imagine there's some unknown cryptid wandering around Appalachia, grilling hotdogs it finds in sealed packages and eating them. But it's a very skittish cryptid, so if it hears you coming it runs.

That or it's the teddy bears
---
I dont understand why. 
---
To be honest with all the amazing Vegas-Mojave atmosphere, quests and factions, New Vegas remains my favourite Fallout up to this day.
---
Is ballistic bock not working, I have drank it many times now, it never changes my damage numbers on screen , and I notice no extra damage. 
---
Same thing happened to me the other night. He just kept getting stuck in my camp.
---
Supposed to be-the-sta-r.... I swear I'm on to something lol
---
No idea. I also only did it twice ages ago.
---
Same with the syringer daily of talking animals.did it once,never again.
---
exactly, but it diminishes their good will even more.
---
I bought 10k rounds, made another 10k Caps while only using 3k rounds! More ammo for meeeeee!
---
The White Knight nerf happened long before repair kits were a thing.
---
The food spoilage rate is a bug. CMs have commented on it before saying it was being looked into so they are well aware it.
---
Yes THIS
---
Nah im fine with it. its not a pay to win thing.
---
Show the end result.
---
I have to quick switch to a gun and back to fix it.
---
yeah im not getting/understanding the outrage about it all other than the "gripe to just be griping" (insert the appropriate word usually censored).
---
there are 4 ways they have stated to get the things, quests, events, boss drops, and as always through you free earned atoms if you so desire. no one is making anyone purchase atoms to buy these things, and you have 4 ways to get them not using money. IF you even desire to carry those around and just not hit home or the nearest bench. 
---
 Indeed! I have wanted a "Pissing in the Fissure" pose for quite a while. ;)
---
Yea I’ve been playing the game since day one, in fact I had time off work for three months due to a back injury so from all the server disconnects to the token dispenser having no collision detection to the stick in power armour mutant bat wings I’ve seen it all
---
Funny thing is these new items coming in won’t be used by me I earn my stuff through hard work in game
---
The tequila and champagne both divide the effects of the original alcohol, but you get 3 mixed drinks for one straight liquor. So instead of gaining food and health form tick blood, you gain one or the other but triple the number of drinks. 
---
More face paints and tattoos have been data mined since release. No idea why Bethesda doesnt release them. Ive been waiting for a few of them.
---
whoa whoa whoa someone's upset
---
bruh..its a video game
---
the good thing is, we can agree to disagree, but feel free to search for all the other posts of people talking about it, totally unconnected- they must ALL be crazy right?!?!?!
---
I need to create an account but it wont let me :/ trolled
---
I was expecting the title screen for bdo...
---
But this post is spot on and is what people should be concerned about.
---
Let this man pay off the bounty! 
---
Anchorage Winterized T-51b armor, I'll gladly pay 20 for that beauty.
---
I would say if your living a long life expect to be hunted but it's rare to run into someone if your not on the map. I made a new character and love playing survival because the xp boost.
---
screenshotted, ill be awaiting my ATOMS once they explain it
---
thanks, im gonna buy the fireplace when you give them to me
---
don't call it hashtag paytorepair, call it what it is, P2W...
---
the ability for a player to pay for a PvP advantage is literally P2W
---
Wtf? That doesn't correlate to the topic at all! Quit trying to divert the topic or just stop talking to me if all your gonna do is call me a psycho.
---
I am surprised BGS has been totally silent on this. Considering how engaged the community managers have been in this sub, particularly since they began the steady patch cadence, I thought someone from BGS would at least chime in with a "We see your feedback, we'll share it with the team..." response. But I haven't seen it yet. (Let me know if I missed it in one of the many threads!) I find that really troubling. It tells me BGS \*still\* isn't committed to transparent communication with the community, despite its many similar mistakes it has made along these lines. This controversy is as much a marketing problem as it is a business problem. 
---
But wouldn't they have to contact obsidian since its from foNV the game obsidian made? 
---
Lmao, hence why I made the vid to give hope to all those who try, I did notice though it worked all day but after 4 pm pst the spawns weren’t happening for me
---
No, you cannot. Mods only
---
Yes and no. If they put a weight limit on the transfer box of let’s say 100 and you can’t get upgrades for it. It would hypothetically work. The big downside is that if there’s some way to exploit it, we will be working our way back to server instability issues. I’m not a huge fan of storage boxes just because those who have exploited the camp artilery box. I’d just hope for some way to transfer without putting a huge risk on the players or stability. Other games use mail systems but even at that, it can create the same problem of storing to much. Even though it would make selling items a bit more convenient. So I guess I can stand on either side of the view of having a transfer box or not. It’s just a shame when you lose good piece to a transfer. I know some people are against mules but every game has them. 
---
lol very true, it does kinda bug me but its so much cleaner than the original gross one
---
I don't think it's as much people coming to 'cry' as it is people are concerned for the direction this takes.
---
For example - the example they give for getting the advanced kit is taking on the SBQ - that puts them out of reach for a large number of players (because heaven help you if you aren't high enough level or well enough equipped and turn up to try it out...players seem to get very upset if you aren't already an expert). If they assured that it will turn up as a drop elsewhere making them available more broadly then it would be less of an issue.
---
I think there's also the concern that this is the first step breaking the original promise of 'cosmetic items only' in the atom store. If the advanced kits are rare, and you have to pay for the common ones...will we see a drop in how long weapons last? Will durability of items drop to make these items more necessary? What will turn up next?
---
I'm not overly concerned myself. I find it troubling that they are starting to go this direction and I hope that when it is released it will be in a fairly benign fashion with easy access to the advanced ones, but you never know.
---
&gt; I wanted to just buy a game and now they are changing the rules. 
---
That is the real issue!
---
What are you getting out of this?
---
Bethesda is out to kill you and everyone you love. They are big fat liars and wont let you win at the game unless you max out your credit cards and worst of all is that its mandatory. If you refuse theyll kill our moms and dogs. If we dont riot we will all be working in the bitcoin mines by August.
---
There’s always a way to earn these things in game, they just make it easier to pay. So yes you can spend 4 hours grinding atoms to earn 100 to buy a repair kit. Or 30 seconds buying one. As for the in game drops they said it would be a rare drop. Do you think they mean rare like the fastnacht masks were rare? As in 1/10000 chance or worse. It is an advantage that you can pay for end of story. 
---
I've never seen even close to 3k of 308 bit I've blown through close to 100k of 50cal haha
---
You're saying one thing with unsubstantiated claims. Prove it or stop saying it. Stop insisting other people are right for *also baselessly claiming something without proof.*
---
Where is the spawn spot?
---
Late to the party but mutant hound chops give melee damage also and stacks with others.
---
Player vending should make things a little easier but all that horded 308 will disappear pretty fast or be stupidly expensive.
---
And I'll be waiting for that video proving the spoil rates are faster. I'll make sure to post here daily to ask how it's coming...
---
The goal post moves again. Fuck off lol
---
We have all stockpiled our free atoms waiting for things we really want to buy.
---
Bethesda is looking for an atom sink so we spend our atoms so we have to pay out of pocket when the items we want hit the shop.
---
That’s why they haven’t released most of the cool data mined stuff
---
I was so close to buying this game with all the new updates, but I'm out again. 
---
It seems like Bethesda is set on fucking over their fanbase, and I just can't support that. 
---
It is not a very fun fact for those bh soldiers tho.
---
It's that violet flux that's the pain, getting enough of it is less sustainable than standard 308
---
Maybe all this was to divert the attention of computers to sell objects, which were delayed 1 month 
---
Thats exactly why Bethesda dont like New Vegas. Its everyones favourite Fallout game, but it wasnt made by Bethesda studios. Seems they are too proud to admit that the original Fallout creators are really good at making Fallout games.
---
Probably not. You could alternatively role with low level 3\* leather. Full set of 3\* lvl 1 leather Sent Assassin. 
---
The one I know of is near top of the world and pleasant valley cabins near one of the armor work benches close to the arena thing with the power armor
---
Just been back there. It was full of Mr Gusty's, bots and one assaultron. As you say, good place for plans (all known for me though) didn't find any legendaries. 😕
---
Sad truth is, that those consumable items generate much more money.
---
Crazy idea. Make it so food spoilers slower or not at all when you have a cryolator equipped
---
Awesome thanks
---
Adventure mode? As someone who has played since the beta and is sitting at lvl 100, that really is not an issue.
---
Play in adventure mode and turn damage to others off.  
---
I feel like having tokens with specific effects might make it "Too easy" in their mind, so I suspect we'll have to play the RNG game, but I'm hoping there's some control over it. For example, in Terraia there is an NPC called the gobling tinkerer. If you found or crafted a weapon that didn't have the effect you wanted you could take it to him, pay him some money, and he would re-roll the effect. It could get expensive on top tier weapons, but since there were only about 10-12 effects to cycle through you were assured of getting the one you wanted relatively quickly.
---
I suspect the way it'll work is that you'll trade in a 1 star legendary and get a token, trade in a 2 star and get 2, etc. Then you'll give him a weapon that you like 3/2 of the effects, pay X number of tokens, and re-roll the effect you don't want. It might take a bunch of tokens if you're looking for a specific effect, but since the mobs are literally shitting 1 star trash all over the place it shouldn't be too hard to accumulate enough tokens to roll the effect you really want.
---
I have the perk that reduces shotgun weight by 90% (brings most down to .75-.90lbs), and the one that reduces melee weight by 60% (brings knives, canes, batons, etc down to .40-.80lbs), so I've been saving everything in those categories that has at least 2 stars since they announced this guy.
---
But its going to be made out of toilet paper.
---
If we're going on realism the 50cal should be OP AF! Borderline anti-tank haha
---
&gt; rvers on somehow. And only a moron pays $15 for a power armor skin. So they gotta monitize the game somehow. That's what "live service" means: tricking you into paying long after you bought the game.
---
This isn't WOW by far. 76 wishes it was a B-Rank WOW clone. 76 isn't even a good survival game compared to ARK, Conan Exiles, or similar titles. The ONLY thing it has going for it is the fandom of the Fallout IP.
---
you could hodgepodge it.  white X01 head, blue torso, red headlamp?
---
I agree. But at the end of the day. The devs are going to do what the bosses tell them. I sucks but what can you really do but get mad and rage at them until it’s the content comes out. 
---
sincerely they tarnished their name with release fo76 
---
Stupid question but what is p2w?  
---
I made a joke about your all caps post referring to an in game drug, you started the name calling by referring to me as stupid because you are apparently unable to see why the precedence this seemingly harmless cash shop creates is very bad for players in the long term.  
---
They think they can START at WOW and Fortnight prices when they don't have that quality of a product. 
---
No. While you’re out doing quests you’ll end up as number 1 on the leader board and become hunted. Especially in an active server. Only way to not get hunted is if everyone on your server is just out questing and not hunting each other which is rare. 
---
Added you, my PSN is AldorinDK. Quite lonely in the wasteland myself.

You're right it is an mmo-lite.
---
But it shouldn't have been.
---
And as punishment the community should kill every bid bethesda makes for monetization and profitability. ;)
---
Same here. It was a slow night .
---
Did you get the bug of mobs not even spawning as well? 
---
My server had monsters taking the night off.  Easiest farm for plans I ever had but boring af.
---
Instead of stimpaks, make the healing salve. Requires water and 2 plants in the beginners area. Farm up over 100 of them in no time and go get more when you get low. You will also find your stimpak surge when you do this as you wont be using them!
---
They retconned the BoS and the FEV, why stop there? Lol
---
Can these items be taken back to adventure mode?  No right?
---
There could be a lore reason to reopen it. It could make for an interesting weeklong event like Fasnacht. A contingency that the Responders planned for or something. You have to go in with a limited oxygen supply and make repairs, and at the end of the week the vault reopens as a player hub. Maybe limit access to level 15/20 and above or something so you can’t just leave the vault at level 2 and walk right back in. 
---
Haha, didnt think you were lying sir. Just a bit salty. Good to know, I'll try during the day tomorrow. 
---
Exactly.  
---
Or, and hear me out here, I could play a game I enjoy,  and not take part in an aspect of it that I don't like. 
---
Thanks, I never knew
---
The day they charge for respects after all the massive changes they’ve pulled, is the day this game goes in the trash.
---
No need to farm mats = more time to farm legendaries and gain XP.  Is that an advantage?
---
Being able to repair items anywhere, any time, is that an advantage?
---
Being able to repair to 150% without using any perks. You can pick all combat enhancing perks and ignore the repair to 200% one until you are super high level.  Is that an advantage?
---
I get it, manually repairing items is the best outcome.  And to be honest I'm not really all that worried about repair kits creating a MASSIVE advantage because they won't do that for the reason you just pointed out.
---
But the fact that they grant ANY in game advantage, however small for me it's a terrible precedent.  If they get away with this, there will SURELY be more similar things to come.  With similar arguments "well, I can do X ingame for free and its better than the atom shop option so its OK".
---
I don't want to go down that road, do you?
---
🤯
---
Thats a downward spiral. Hold back good items that people are saving atoms for in hopes they spend their atoms elsewhere, but people dont want to spend their atoms elsewhere because they are waiting for good items. Wouldnt it be better to just flood the store with good items instead of releasing bad items until no one cares anymore?
---
I decided to quit early on because I disagreed with their handling of inventory space, I stay quit because of shit like this. Online ruined fallout.
---
Best of luck? Are you on Xbox?
---
Why are so much fallout players alcoholics?
---
I'm out. I really enjoyed my time in Appalachia, but I was waiting for new content/raids anyway and this is enough for me to just stay gone. 
---
Hi out, I'm dad!
---
What you say it’s totally correct but Bethesda said multiple times that they would ever use the atom shop only for cosmetics. 
---
They are an enormous company the made their own projection, or they were totally wrong or they lied to their costumers. 
---
I said that you're ACTING stupid, not you are stupid. 
---
you can make a point to make your voice heard, post here, on twitter, and especially on their [support](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42223/~/where-can-i-provide-feedback-for-fallout-76%3F) page.  it's not like Beth haven't changed things based on public opinion before...
---
If people want to quibble, you can call it pay-to-play instead of pay-to-win, which is still unacceptable for a game that many of us already paid full retail price for with the assurance that we would not see further charges for non-cosmetics. 
---
Thats a cool idea. I dont want to overwhelm the dev team, but it would be great together with a pip boy app. 
---
From the looks of the votes on your comments on your own post it seems you’re just not welcome here.  So move along and go whine somewhere else. 
---
That and the gold color on the eyes. 
---
We don’t give a fuck about this game dude.  
---
We care about the franchise, which Bethesda didn’t even make.
---
That’s a big difference.
---
LONG LIVE TROiKA!
---
👏 MAXSON'S 👏 BATTLE 👏 COAT 👏
---
Literally the only good reason you have to betray the Brotherhood, unless you use mods to cheat yourself a free coat without bloodshed
---
Np. I know the bos leg plans spawned there but not sure about the rest. 
---
Absolutely. Makes me wish they lit up.
---
I’m not saying they’re doing the right thing
---
I’m just saying what they’re doing
---
They’ve released a few sought after items like the Ultracite Prototype paint and the blood stained armor paint
---
The blackbird (power armor) paintjob previously available (like 6 months ago).
---
"I'm bored of the game and am using this as an excuse to play something else"
---
If you really still liked the game, you'd just continue playing it. So some repair kit that barely makes a difference is in the atom store, "oh no, abandon the entire game"
---
I disagree with their decision to include non-cosmetic stuff in the store, so I'm just not gonna buy it, and encourage others not to
---
I'm pretty sure I found the grognak game. And I have a better one, fallout boy (fallout game in the style of grognak. I just wish we could save our games in those two games). 
---
Thog
---
Yea I've heard about that. The thing is, that mod wouldn't tell me if the item costs decrease or if I need to scrap my whole camp to make it happen.
---
People need to hear a very direct NO from Bethesda before they will believe that all of this stuff is a fantasy. Or, on the other hand, I need to hear a very direct YES from Bethesda before I will believe the budget changes are real. xD
---
I like to think it's more like you're just picking them up just before they go off, like drinking milk a few hours before it goes bad
---
Blasphemy!
---
Fart
---
Im asking Bethesda to kindly let us know if there is or is not a  bug with it, am i not?
---
what more do you want? im not a dataminer...
---
i think it amazing that so many people have said this is a thing , but you simply dont seem able to accept the fact you might be wrong about your kneejerk reaction
---
anyway, enjoy your skeptical world view! hope that works out for you ignoring things that are right in front of your face!
---
and with that, i say GOOD DAY
---
Or everyone could wait until Tuesday and see what actual happens instead of making wild assumptions and having fever dreams over a vague paragraph.
---
Some maps show that West Virginia would be relatively unscathed compared to most of the east coast, except for Charleston which does appear to be nuked in the game. https://i.redd.it/gv5f5bm4b6zy.png

Single colour armor paints is a nice idea. Probably easy for them to do, and it would be great to walk around in a PA coloured in your favourite colour. Buy different colours to mix and match nice colour combos.

TBH I would be completely fine with this. 
---
so? you still have to buy the plans from the microtransaction store.
---
And I said you were acting psychotic...
---
Who cares about repair kits? Just more weight I have ot lug around. Weapon and armos stations are all over that place, just use one of those...
---
BASIC REPAIR KITS
---
Basic Repair Kits are single-use consumables that immediately restore one of the items in your inventory to 100% condition. So long as you have a Repair Kit in your inventory, you can use it to fix up a piece of gear anytime, anywhere, and without spending any of your own crafting materials. Once you’ve got a Repair Kit, open your Pip-boy to find an item you want to repair, hit “Inspect”, select the new “Repair Kit” option, and then leap right back into the action. You can also use Repair Kits at any workbench in your C.A.M.P., at Workshops, or those you find in the world.
---
Basic Repair Kits will be unlockable in the Atomic Shop using Atoms you’ve purchased or those you’ve earned for free by completing in-game challenges.
---
FO1 came out over 20 years ago and would run on a pentium 3 with 512MB RAM and 128MB graphics card. I'm reasonably certain there's enough leftover processing power in modern consoles to emulate that. Especially since the system wouldn't have to render all the environmental stuff happening in "the real game", so it could shift resources if needed.
---
How fucking hard is it to add a tab on your stash for things that take away weight but are accessible by all characters on your account?
---
You lose inventory space on all characters until you remove it to another tab, which would actually be to Bethesda’s benefit if this server shit nonsense was a real issue.
---
The only real coding change is allowing a choice of that tab to be chosen and allowing it to persist between characters.
---
My mind can’t take all these logical ideas stop it!
---
Officially deleting my game, the direction they're taking is a slow boil to an anti-fun everything spoils or falls apart without real world money waitfest. You don't need to be a genius to see this is what they're designing around and moving the game towards the worst types of monitization. 
---
Not only is FO76 getting uninstalled but my once favorite franchises that I would guarantee buy pre-order are now 1+ year wait and sees. As Bethesda has shown quite clearly their anti-consumer angle and willingness to slow burn and gas light the community on projects and direction. 
---
Did you get it? [PC]
---
Hey, if it comes with a plumbing module and running water, I'd buy it.
---
Daisy
---
The fucking immediate blind outrage over a video game is getting ridiculous
---
The lore got weird already in FO76. Might as well have fun now.
---
Also health now reduced by 75% unless a shower is taken every 25 minutes.
---
I wouldn't mind that much if it was a vastly successful and critically acclaimed release. We all know it's not quite the case.
---
Dog food still has a serious weight to it. I just apply cannibal and kill something then eat it. I also have the carnivore mutation. Then carry as many disease cures I can and just drink water I find. I get more rads, but run a bloodied/riffle build, so it works. 
---
I blame the daily and weekly challenges as of late
---
Yeah a guy gave one to me 
---
People enjoy playing the game. If they didn't they wouldn't play. That is why people still play.....because they enjoy it. The game they are playing they enjoy.....if they didn't they would not be playing.
---
Wow, and people complain about big brother governments. I live in a free country, not a communist one. So go learn to communicate in a civil manner then maybe take a civics class. Maybe get a job as well. Then you could afford to spend money on microtransactions. 
---
Idk who you think you are but tje internet exists to feed my narcissistic personality. People all over should care what i think. I have alot of free time, an internet connection and im angry. I dont have that great a life or job and my dog is getting old. So right now all those things are Todd Howards fault! Hes the reason my dad never played catch with me, hes the reason my mom never encoraged me and the reason i refuse to get help. Bethesda game studios is out to get us all. They want us to play their game and earn "free atoms" to use on an in game item that makes youre items invincible until they start getting used. How can i win in a fully co-operative game mode with that bullplop?! You think my team will just be ok with me needing to use a repair bench?? Outrageous. Im very delusional and carry alot of pull in my head and the more i complain on a 3rd party website to like minded people that have no professional ties to this game the more likely things will magically change to how i like them.
---
Ok cool

You can get 50cal prime ammo, got one quite early on. But the reliance on Violet Flux is annoying, I've got barely any of it but tons of the others.

Hell, I’d drop 800 Atoms on an Atom Cats leather jacket. 
---
Pleasure and Lolz
---
I am totally cool with it...  b/c if he didnt kill me, he is screwed when he goes into his menus to apply it. You cant instant apply it as you have to select gear/weapon and then apply to it...  so when he is paused in menu, I will kill him, teabag him, and steal his junk.
---
Also, I dont pvp... so I truly dont care. This will literally never affect me.
---
This game was GotY for me for 2018. It continues to stun in 2019. If it werent for The Division 2, this game would still be the #1 game this year. After the next update or 2, it just might be again.
---
Yeah, but that's too much effort for them.
---
Nerfing useful skills and selling related P2W items through the store is an easier path.
---
Okay job\*
---
God you need hurting lol... Badly!
---
this is a good idea. Especially when you take into account that the stash is independent of perks. Who has room in their stash for full weight food?
---
M y thoughts exactly. People act as if not having a repair is going to get you 1 shotted in PVP, oh wait that's happens already. Repair kits are trash. Who cares what they cost?
---
I have been thinking about posting this question for a few days, but chose not too. Anyways my character's name is Tommy Karate. Google if you don't know lol
---
&lt;If you really still liked the game, you’d just continue to play it
---
Not when evidence is starting to point to Bethesda stealth nerfing things in an attempt to incentivize purchasing their Utility items. Problems don’t go away by ignoring them. You let them fester and it’ll get much worse. Show Bethesda a significant drop off in players, and they’ll backpedal.
---
I also work a lot, and don't have time for doing nuke runs. Can I just buy a nuke silo for my camp? $25 for the silo, and $5 for a nuke. Then I can use all the caps I bought to gear myself, and go kill sbq a few times a day without ever having really played the game.
---
Do you really think being skeptical of something someone says with no proof whatsoever makes me what, crazy? Just because five people tell me the sky is green doesn't mean I'm not going to ask them to back that up. You and I both know you can't prove this so stop posting about it daily. It's not a thing and you're making fans look stupid on here.
---
Well said. I couldn’t have said it better myself. 
---
One day I 2k rounds, two fights later I had 300 left
---
Right.  So you're saying that until Bethesda comes out and says, "We reduced the effectiveness of White Knight to incentivise people to pay for repairs.", that people finding it shady is silly?
---
I think assuming that Beth is going to blatantly say that they're creating repair kits to make frequent repairs less of a hastle right after making repairs more frequent, would be more silly.
---
If you control the supply and the demand, and then create a higher demand artifically you're cheating the system.
---
This is all without even mentioning that from the very beginning there would only ever be cosmetics on the atom shop.
---
But that is just disgusting.Bethesda Promised that the Atomic Shop will be 100 percent cosmetic only.
---
Are you dense? Obviously this doesn't make anyone "invincible", but it gives an unfair advantage to players that pay instead of players that play. And its not like it's gonna stop here, if we let this slide by saying things like "that's why everyone is crying right?" or "why does anyone care about *this*?" Bethesda will keep going and before you know it they're selling legendary effects on the atom shop to add on to your gun at a special workbench that can only be bought on the atom shop. 
---
Ben shapiro
---
I am still all for it. No complaints from me. Bethesda killed it on this release. It is GotY 2018 in my opinion. All they have done is improve it. All for this addition and whatever is to come.
---
If it is that bad, go find a new game.
---
I will still play without buying them and have not a single issue or problem with those who do. I dont care for pvp, so...
---
Bronco
---
Food spoils 300% faster. Does that annoy you ? We've got you covered! You can now buy a mega fridge with only $15 from the atom store 
---
&gt;Or, and hear me out here, I could play a game I enjoy, and not take part in an aspect of it that I don't like.
---
[Haters:] (https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/602/308/b51.jpg)
---
I dont get why people think that because they dont like a game makes it something no one should like lol
---
Game sales tanked. So their milking the people dumb enough to still play. Sounds like EA tactics.
---
Funny part is, my main character doesn't drink. The Nuka Cola was for me, the others were with other players in mind.
---
But also, for roleplaying purposes.
---
Original thread. Surprised no one has mentioned this yet. 
---
"we plan to make adjustments based on your feedback"  
---
Cool, my feedback is to not put them in the store in the first place and let us craft them. Hell, you can even make us use raw items instead of scrap or salvage. I will gladly take the time to go through my Junk tab and one-by-one scrap all the things that aren't wrenches or hammers or whatever you elect to use for the plan, *if you leave these things out of the Atomic Store.*
---
What, were we supposed to take this well because the better kit *isn't* being sold for Atom?
---
Randy Randerson 
---
you mean like how you can ALREADY buy mods and recipes with caps?
---
That would be hilarious, especially with a Scorchbeast climbing out of the fissure.
---
I think they should be in the game, but putting them in the Atom Shop clearly isn’t the best decision.
---
I still dont understand how that effects anybody else. So i repaired my weapon quicker, so what. Pvp battles are usually decided in 1-2 hits, thus it wouldnt matter and in pve it effects absolutely nobody else in any way shape or form.
---
I’m so confused. What? 
---
It doesn't matter whether it's a single use item or a plan, the end result is the same (it did sound like a plan to make the consumable though).
---
I think doing all that is great but to hit them where it hurts we need to spam any gamer news websites. All different news websites posting will for sure get them to do some damage control because they wont be able to hide from all this and it will affect there bottom line. Visibility is key, we can't let up and we need to report to every way we can to let them know we wont accept this 
---
Yes but it would be a one time purchase that is hopefully affordable. This will minimize any actual p2w effects as you can only spend the atoms once and everyone that does is on equal ground. That means that people who have 1000 be fold disposable income have no advantage over someone who has just enough to buy the kit once.
---
Some spent CAPS to mark you.  That bounty of spent caps should absolutely follow you.  
---
It’s a BOUNTY s/he placed on you, which is kill this guy/gal for the money I have given you. 
---
Think of it as a mob hit  contract. Just because you leave the city, Country it was placed, doesn’t mean it goes away.  
---
This is the fairest reason I've heard so far.
---
This is a logical post! Congratulations. You are a sane voice in an ocean of whiny cry babies.
---
Instead of saying "most people don’t want this", you are collecting opinions to establish what "most people" want. I understand your results may still be anecdotal, but still worth while! 
---
Nah, PS4.
---
Seriously? After the poor start and outrage this was enough to put you off? 
---
I ignored the hate and found a decent enjoyable game which takes up all my free time. A repair kit will in no way effect my enjoyment of this game. 
---
This move will also have a huge problem down the road when “raids” are released. Players now can just send scrap back home and gives an ability to store necessities to give them the advantage. Weapon break in the raid? Well you now can fix that on the go instead of traveling all the way back to camp. 
---
This is truly a problem..
---
Yes. You have successfully used the copy paste functions of a computer.
---
I agree that people should post in the megathread. 
---
Just doing it to XP grind this weekend on my new character. I've gotten killed a lot, but my camp is an easily fixable shack and I leave all my meds in the stash box so I don't lose them. The double XP has been worth it so far, I went from level 7 to level 15 in a few hours. Just expect to get griefed a lot, and if you have a nice camp that's expensive to repair, I probably wouldn't recommend it.
---
Bring it on internet bully. Bigger, meaner, uglier and smarter people have tried and all have failed. 
---
As I said, go get an education then get a job. Maybe then you will have the ability to understand why you are currently making yourself look like an idiot. 
---
The Appalachian Serial Griller, doesn't hurt a soul just wanders around looking for hot dogs to grill, no confirmed sightings whatsoever, I love it
---
Reading all the complains lately and everything looks like a bunch of entitled millenials crying on social media.
---
Last I checked it is ok to show your concern but there’s a line and when you cross that line you are basically babies crying and crying again.
---
You don’t like the game or where Bethesda is going with the game, you have 3 choices:
---
1- quit the game
---
2- program your own game
---
3- whine on social media like babies.
---
Guess number 3 won.
---
ngl, I would love to have those paint jobs and colors for the T-51 
---
I am expecting to be downvoted to oblivion (no pun intended)...
---
Also, I do not have the game (nor will I ever have), I just want to reply to the implications
---
They will get away with it because most players have a really short attention/grudge span. How many times we heard that Beth screwed up again, players are outraged in just the past few months? While it lost players it still retained a good chunk of them, because players are easy to get upset, but that rage only lasts for a really short period of time....they go back, they get burned again...rinse and repeat. It will not tarnish their name because they have already proven time and time again that they can get away with murder - every single time. Who remembers Paid mods v1? Paid mods v2? Nobody cares about them anymore or remembers. People keep believing developers that "oh but there wont be any p2w system" - and they keep getting upset about how the devs went back on their word.
---
Some devs even shamed people for even thinking they would add p2w system, but they ended up adding it anyway. This is not even a new thing - remember Horse Armor? thats when they started showing their colors and where we -the customers- stood. If they had done it today (via Creation Club) it is very likely that people would have bought it  and they faced no negativity whatsoever.
---
These fuckups happens so many times in such a short period of time, i honestly have hard time understanding how can anyone have the slightest shred of respect for this company (or any other company that does this, this is about the practice not which label does it)
---
Definitely. 
---
the survey is wrong It should be Should the repair kits be in the atomic store? 
---
Yeah took me a while to find a good rotation. Was using a black powder rifle for a while and a bolt action which helped me get a feel for what and where and when to do stuff. Also a pipe revolver rifle is handy and light comparatively. 
---
Stepping up to a lever action and dragon... woooo.. its a whole different game man. Also plasma grenades and mines. Carry one or two of each but no more as they are heavy. And the perk for seeing grenades arc.. stupid handy for qol imo.
---
I SAY GOOD DAY!
---
Dr Jekill
---
I was talking about reloading components they have gun powder, lead, steel, and there should be primers without a primer the gun won't go bang thinking about it there should also be copper (brass) used for the cases we might be making crappy steel cased surplus ammo though.
---
You don’t like it? Be my guess and leave.
---
But the constant whinning... 
---
I probably won't be on that much tonight but I play at least some every evening and more on the weekends.  My GT is same as my username here so feel free to add it to your list.  Always happy to help you get that level boosted and often I have a few other teammates to join a squad.  My rule for lower level players is just that you have to pick a quest and do it. No aimless wandering (unless we both just need materials) and don't feel like you need to be polite by asking if I have any quests because basically other than dailies or timed events I've done it all.  
---
This poll is useless though.
---
Agreed, make them craftable or drops only
---
When i suggested this on a post last week, I was confronted with a massive amount of butthurt, about how im stupid because I expect Bethesda to cater to my wishes. 
---
And that players loves goofy shit. Not cool shit.
---
SMH.... 
---
Im glad im not alone. 
---
I would upvote this 100 times if I could. 
---
This is how it starts. "Let's wait and see", "It's not that bad". Until it hits you in the face.
---
As long as they add a fridge that can be unlocked in game I have no problem with atom shop fridges(as long as atom shop fridges arent better than the normal unlockable fridge). They sell different skins for the water purifiers. Bethesda should handle fridges the same.
---
Why is pay-to-win tied to direct advantage in PvP?
---
I mean p2w doesn't have  clear [definition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play#Pay-to-win), but most use `pay for advantage another player doesn't get or is really time consuming to get`
---
A lot of players don't power game and only spend a few hours in game. With two comparable players A and B, where B buys repair kits, B could:
---
* spend more time farming legendaries
---
* sell excess materials to get meds or ammo
---
* not waste time and resources to farm flux for repairing
---
* hide somewhere and repair stuff, instead of standing locked in an animation at a stationary work bench in survival mode
---
* not get repair perks at all and get combat perks instead
---
Especially, at early levels the repair kits will be really helpful. Not a game breaking advantage, but a slight advantage nonetheless. And people just feel betrayed after so many promises that this wouldn't happen at all.
---
The unstoppables outfit promotion was more pay to win than this.  This seems to be a real tempest in a teapot with how easy it is to find repair benches in the game, ease of fast travel, free camp fast travel, etc etc.  if player vending allows us to freely mark our camps to all on the map, it will give an even lower need for this.  This rings of something people begged for, that doesn’t fit in Bethesda vision of the game, so they threw it in with an “ok, but you’re paying for it, and it’ll kinda suck.”
---
“Well they’re testing the water!!” 
---
They tested it with unstoppables, with repair kits, with these phantom lunch boxes that never appeared, with the perk card packs that were free, but were really meant to be a MTX, etc etc.  this is becoming doomsaying at this point, where being wrong or wildly exaggerating doesn’t count against people, and being a smidge right somehow bestows credibility.  It’s as if people are going to loudly bitch about pay to win, when they are really bitching about micro transactions in general.
---
I’ve paid $0.00 extra for this game since launch, but let me be clear, I hope the game keeps going for years, and I hope they actually do put stuff in the atom shop good enough for me to throw money at.  I put little stock in a company’s word, so the repair kits don’t bother me in that view.  In fact this game could go true pay to win and it still wouldn’t do as much damage as the duping did. 
---
&gt;If you spent half the effort in the game you're supposedly fighting to save you'd never have to worry about materials or repairs. Bother to learn how perks work and how to scrap properly. 
---
This does nothing to refute any previous points made. 
---
&gt;And why does it seem like the same people complaining about how repair kits are p2w were the same ones defending duping, which was something that was actually destroying the game. 
---
This is anecdotal and unfounded. I don't support this Atom purchase, and I didn't support duping.
---
I care, Ill take those downvotes and troll comments for the potential the game has to be the best fallout game yet, if they just follow through on their promises and just slowly but surely implement ideas that people have modded in like the back packs for example theyre adding that in which is great! But its overshadowed by the bad marketing moves with the Atom Shop its like everytime the devs manage to take a step in the right direction some marketing bull shit ruins it. Like the canvas bags. The Nuka Dark. Now Atomshop P2W

I played 2, 3, new vegas and 4, i played new vegas the most

Yes, let's just send in our spare nuclear key cards to be weighed.
---
Since Fallout 1 way back in '97.  Have every Fallout game released on the PC, multiple copies of some.
---
Thog don’t care 
---
Keep that "we" to yourself buddy. I do give a shit about '76 and enjoy it.
---
A usable fridge? I think I'd actually get one for 5 or below
---
That's not remotely close to accurate, but nice try. Keep it up at those reading comprehension classes, you'll get it! 
---
I think the "improved" repair kits that drop as event rewards that can't be sold, traded, dropped, scrapped or made are a good idea. That would be a nice thing to get rarely that you could just kinda have and use out in the wild on occassion. But the paid for ones in the atomic shop are dumb and bad for obvious reasons.
---
You better hope noone finds you and your kind. I think we should start a witch hunt! Bit of home grown justice! 
---
you can repair your weapons in the field with perk cards?  I agree with the rest of your post, they should add more cosmetics, especially stuff from older games, but there aren't any perks that are better than a repair kit, I just wish they would add them as items that have a spawn chance and can be traded.
---
People are "whinning" because they want Bethesda to know that the majority of players dislike this move and if they do implement it, yes, a lot of players WILL leave. 
---
Plus we don’t even know the cost, 10 atoms? That’s take no time to get with dailies, plus there seems to be multiple in game ways to obtain these as well for the better versions.  I kinda get the argument for survival but maybe they don’t even allow this usage in survival or it’s on a timer like stimpaks? But let’s lash out with no real details on how this will work.   Strictly allowed in adventure mode is not even close to a pay to win imo 
---
I've noticed the same thing , I asked this question on someone's post earlier. I tested on the same bots lol. Same result , no difference in damage.
---
I was just discussing the point. I didnt understand it like you were saying that what they do is right. Sorry for the misunderstanding.
---
I would love to have a Pulowski Preservation Shelter™️ in my camp
---
My issue with this is how it would interact with the lore
---
* Loved 3, played that and all the DLC over a couple of playthroughs.
---
* Couldn't really get into NV
---
* I have about 1400 hours of Fallout 4 played. Including a "no-stone-unturned" playthrough where I did every quest, and found every single collectible, easter-egg, location, random encounter, cool item, etc that I could find documented online.
---
I'm not a fan of PVP. I played waaaaay too much DayZ, and Ark, and have basically burnt out on "hardcore survival pvp focused" stuff. 
---
But I really do enjoy seeing other people and taking part in group events and stuff in-game.
---
You can send whatever you feel like. 
---
Why did you put "hear me out" at the beginning when all you are doing is jumping on the hate train and repeating everything else that gets upvoted?
---
Ikr? I would spend money on it
---
If it’s too easy to do a scrap-and-trade, how about 10 for 1 trade, i.e. if I can get 10 fast-fire tokens, I get to use all 10 to add this effect once to another weapon. It would be attractive if it’s predicable. With the amount of useless features in this game, gambling is what we’ve been doing all along. Nothing new and nothing attractive. Anyone want to scrap an ‘explosive bullet’ feature and found out they get a ‘30% extra bash damage’ in return from the mole miner? I bet people will attempt to blow up his shop. 
---
So are you actually going to provide anything to back up your claims or just 90s sitcom catchphrases and "facts?" Sounds like you're copping out to me.
---
I would argue they need to make more of that but something within the lore or at least expand the pre-war lore. 
---
Playing a fallout 1 in-game would break immersion.
---
Well, if you’ve done EVERY quest you could do survival
---
Hell no....
---
you know, OP is rught, as a vlind person, I have a freat deal of difficulty playing this game, and I think that is discriminatory.  We should band tofether and file a lawsute against Bethesda for discrinimation.
---
(dammit, I thought I'd make more mistakes typing with my eyes closed).
---
I had it at "I can't find screws to repair a shotgun"... But nice try 👍👍
---
all rugs stack, not just bear rugs, and confetti acts in the same manner as rugs, so, duh...
---
The community doesn't want to see this game go down that path. It's simple. They said cosmetic only for the atom store. They just have to keep their word. 
---
I've been playing since 3 and have loved every game including this one.
---
I name all my people after serial killers. 
---
 I named my guy “Amelia Dyer”  
---
Could just be me, but I really want the pimp style outfit from Fallout 3.
---
High Level events and Legendary Enemy hunting are good.  You could also help low levels with their quests.
---
That Gun skin, and it changes ammo to 5.56. I dig this. And imo, I don’t think that would be game-changing.
---
Susan strong. A strong independent woman who don't need no man. Also have a chefs hat and use a legendary rolling pin.
---
Played em all started with 3
---
Workable fridge
---
Ya and the pimp boy 3 billion from NV would go perfect with it
---
Even 100 atoms, do 2 days of dailies and you've fucking gottem.
---
Good, we don’t need whinners anyways. Even if Bethesda does exactly what yhe whinners wants they will whine about something else. This is getting out of control.
---
You guys don’t even k ow whats coming or if they are taking that path. And of they choose to go that path and you don’t like it, well jus quit. You’re not the CEO of Bethesda.
---
That’s more devastating the a bombs they dropped on the wasteland. 
---
I stand corrected.
---
Pablo y Javier
---
You’ll never loose a argument 
---
I have played since fallout 1 was a new game  and have 800 hours in this game  , but that being said i would like some more content which I know is coming . 
---
Oh yea, almost forgot about the pimp boy.  xD
---
I think you misunderstand. They had all but decided to let the game tank into the ash heap. Then someone said, "what if we put items players need on the cash shop". Then a other replied, "sure but we'd have to fix up the game first." So you see, the only reason they are making changes to the game is BECAUSE they plan to milk you using the cash shop. 
---
Or farm mats for an hour and switch the elite repair perk cards on 
---
Aye, let's not model ourselves against one of the most successful gaming franchises, that would be silly.
---
Fuckin yes mate much better wording than myself😂
---
You don't even know what they're doing with the atomIC shop, no one here does.  It's all speculation.
---
Betheada has lied several times before what makes this different? Same shit different day.
---
Music packs! Both radio songs from previous games, and ambient music from past games!
---
Was blackbird never offered again?
---
or don't even have those cards cause it's not that hard to accidentally accumulate a bunch of junk and scrap
---

---
There are quotes all over the place from Bethesda where they state cosmetic only for items in the Atom Store. Apologies for referencing that in a Yongyea video... From what I know he is not popular with some people.
---
No, go pout somewhere else.
---
I would gladly pay 15-20 dollars a month for private server. Get enough people paying that, that's a lot of money, happier players. Eso has optional 15 dollar a month deal that gives you crowns , an infinite crafting bag , extra experience. I don't need all that fluff , private servers is a big money ticket for Bethesda. 
---
"Im almost out of mini nukes raiders approaching the nukes are dropping everywhere but i got in an argument with insult bo and won" - ben shapiro
---
wut?
---
Fallout 1 was **WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYAYYYYYYYYYY** before pentium 3 and 3D cards.  It would run flawlessly on a 486 with a 2M non-3D graphics card. It could be made to run on a 386 with a little work. 
---
And now we move into the Ad Hominem, great. 
---
“Observable Evidence” doesn’t mean shit, this sub already had a massive argument about it a few months ago. If you cannot present hard evidence from the code then you’re really pulling your argument out of thin air at the end of the day. Literally the only evidence that can be used is “the decay rate was set at 0.X and was subsequently increased to 0.X”. It doesn’t matter if it *feels like it has been* if the code hasn’t changed. 
---
Well I'd like Bethesda to keep making money and releasing more free content. If you'd rather pay $30 for DLC instead, that's your choice. 
---
I’d rather pay atoms for new music packs or radio stations. Can we get that instead?
---
I wrote in one of the other posts like this as well, but what if you could buy dyes? They could let you dye primary/secondary colors on any piece of apparel and MAYBE armors. Sure a lot of online games do this, but I would definitely use atoms. If I want to walk around looking like a big yellow banana in my hunter's coat, then dammit, let me do it!
---
Pay To Win. Typically it means anything you purchase that gives you an advantage over other players, usually in multiplayer games. Although a lot of people just use it to derogatorily refer to anything that isn't purchased for strictly cosmetic purposes. Some players are claiming that the Repair Kits Bethesda has announced for the Atomic Shop equates to a Pay To Win type of Microtransaction.
---
Personally, I think they are more of a QoL(Quality of Life) optional improvement that won't help anyone "win".
---
wow white knight for bethesda harder 
---
Key words: single use and not use your materials
---
Bring it on, if you make it past my dogs, then you will meet me and any number of weapons I choose to employ. I will make sure all are non lethal just so I can record you or any moron get arrested. Then I will make sure you spend a long time in jail. I don't live in Cook county so I know you or whomever tries will rot in prison for a long time. 
---
Unless you looked all over even in high grass for just the CAMP module there easily could have been one within range to not allow for yours to place.  This is extremely common for me (my camp is near the overseers camp because I need shopping traffic), especially if even the general area is a popular spot for placing camps.
---
I’m going for a sneak build :)
---
Should add a third: yes but not in atom shop. 👍
---
Absolutely
---
People cared. It was an OBVIOUS hint that betheada was trying to pull some shit and see how much they can get away without being controversial.
---
Just because they took you for a fool doesn't mean they got the rest of our asses.
---
This is exactly what I think we need! At least 70% of my load order for FO4 is customizable armor sets! 😁😁😁
---
Or the laws, which agree with what you're saying (to a great degree).  
---
Lawsuits have been brought against companies for extremely similar reasons, and went nowhere.
---
About a full day now. It’s highly unusual for the CMs to be silent for a full day. 
---
It seems like they told the community managers to stay away from this until either...
---
* they form a response to it and address the controversy or...  
---
* the vitriol subsides and they hope the controversy just goes away. 
---
I’m hoping it’s the first one. 
---
You're probably right. I just googled system requirements for FO1 and went with the first realistic option.  Point being, I'm sure they could find a bit of spare processing power to make it work.
---
That Taxidermy thing sounds cool. I could have a Scorchbeast head hanging over my fire lmao
---
New perk cards, the ability to play on a seasons server, new radio songs, more stash space.
---
I had an erection even before you posted this. Now it's actually starting to ache. Tell me, what machine are you using, and please be specific.
---
and this is why we can't have nice things.
---
I’ve played everyone in the series and love them all for their own reasons. Most common amongst all of them, getting able to explore and get immersed in a world I love.  76 has been the worst experience by far. Stopped playing a month or 2 after the beta. I recently have made a new character and trying the survival to see if that could shed some better light. I really do want this game to do well.
---
No, I'm just gonna wait to see how it actually works out instead of screeching about a vague paragraph in a newsletter because I'm not a reactionary moron.
---
Who says you'll see it coming lol? Could come from anywhere at any time...
---
man i feel sad for you, nothing better to do huh?
---
if this doesnt affect you as you dont believe its true, what do you have against me asking Bethesda to settle it once and for all and just comment on it?
---
what is your stake in this?, if you dont believe it is true?
---
As these guy stated “stop this madness”
---
ROLE PLAY
---
they can make money off of cosmetics, also how old are you?  video games have, and will continue, to make plenty of money without microtransactions, let them sell cosmetic items, no one cares, but are you seriously defending pay to win?
---
Well yes. Once you have the item in your inventory it is single use and doesn't require any additional materials. The question is HOW you get one in your inventory. My guess is that you buy the plan in the atom store and then craft the repair kits with materials. You can then use said kit at another time to repair your item without any additional materials or a crafting station.
---
ESO is fine. They have xp buffs and research speed-up stuff. Nobody cares.
---
Maybe add it in game where it replenishes teammates water status when you shoot it at them 
---
ive only played this and fallout 4..but im over 500 hours with this game i think i was 100 with 4
---
The game is dead, despite what Todd or Pete tell you. I think they are going to turn it Free to play by the end of the year so they add these now so they can make some money later.
---
Big mountain beard.
---
The black &amp; white floors in parts of The Whitespring.
---
A kilt.
---
A Saint Bernard, even if all he does is sleep on my floor.
---
lol you asked.
---
I've been seeing the increased spoilage rate since before the last patch. Doesn't surprise me. A fridge? Oh goody. We'll get a fridge and it will require power AND probably glitch to our storage limit, right?
---
Not like the betheada launcher shows us player metrics.
---
Grognak the Barbarian and I'm a white female!
---
As long as you have one foundation down you can make the rest float, and use the steel beams under Stairs as pylons, so it looks more realistic.
---
many online games continue to get free content updates, they are supported by initial sales and usually virtual currency and cosmetic microtransactions, no dev *needs* pay to win to continue to support a game.
---
Already happening and it’s friggin glorious.
---
Nothing gets proved (or disproved) until people notice something, ask questions, and investigate. We're not all equipped to do data mining, but we can notice an apparent change, ask questions, and hopefully spur someone who does have that ability to uncover the facts. 
---
Or, Bethesda can just tell us what the deal is.
---
Lol you wrote it though so.
---
This a thousand times
---
On what basis do you think you are entitled to a refund? And on what are you asking a refund on? Every dollar you've spent to date on the Atomic Shop? 
---
I've used it on a level 10 character and a level 200 ... costs were the same.
---
I think it'd be hilarious if you could get addicted to fried chicken too.  
---
If we want to solve the issue like mentioned of "but .308 is shared with other weapons", then all we need to do is add **7.92x57** ammo which only is used by the MG42 "Light Machine Gun" and is in turn crafted in 100x quantities. 
---
From a realism standpoint, that's what they actually used. However, since it's only listed as the MG42 by *plans*, it could be argued that it's not the German Mauser MG42 and so wouldn't use Mauser 8MM ammo... Ok, I'm cool with that :) Make it **7.62x51** then, and still produced in quantities of 100 rounds. Yes the rounds are, basically, identical and can be fired in weapons intended for the other ammo, but a .308 has much more powder and in return creates more chamber pressure. This would thus mean you wouldn't want to be rapid-firing .308 through a weapon intended for 7.62x51 ammo. 
---
To also address the "they did it with the .50 cal ammo", the 'balance' established through their choice to do this was obtained by having the .50 cal hunting rifles do no-more damage than the .308 rounds, despite massive real-world benefits in favor of the .50 cal rounds. The hunting rifles actually do a few points *less* damage in game when changing to a .50 receiver. This gives the player a choice: be able to make a *shitload* of rounds for your hunting rifle, **but** at the cost of doing a tiny bit less damage *(and I'm pretty sure you can't have a .50 Scorched Hunting Rifle)*.
---
Who the fuck is going to go through 10 of them? That's fucking absurd.
---
Yeah.  No.  P2w doesn't mean saves you 2min from repair time. It means it saves you 2000 hours for the best gear that you buy in the store.
---
You people think anything that isn't cosmetic is p2w.  A potion increasing leveling by 10% isn't p2w either.
---
IF I were ever to start PvPing, I'd *LOVE* it if the preson stopped mid-fight, brought up their pip boy, went to their weapon tab, clicked the inspect item button, clicked on the repair button, and then tabbed back out to the fight.
---
Oh, well actually, skip everything past the weapon tab, you can't do any of that when you're dead.
---
So that's a cool point to know and while that helps in this specific case, what about with them nerfing food and now offering a refrigerator? What is to stop them from continuing down this path until game balance completely relies on shop items.
---
And before people say game companies would never do something like that I would direct you to look at the state of mobile gaming (and look at how much Bethesda has been focusing on the mobile market recently).
---
Look it's someone defending the act of bethesda putting non cosmetic items in the shop. Downvote him!
---
I mean its kind of a common term. I didn't make it up, just using the vernacular. If the shoe fits, and all that.
---
Great
---
Its not rare
---
well its not my fault you dont pay attention to the in game mechanics, so that you failed to recognize when the chagne happened.
---
its hardly my fault you failed to grasp that totally separate people have brought it up, if there was no change, how do you explain that? why would they just out of the blue ALL say the same thing?
---
And are you HONESTLY suggesting that Bethesda has never screwed up a part of the game with a  patch? That there have been no bugs at all in this game that people noticed, then suggested just what i am doing to have Bethesda clear it up?
---
honestly your unwarranted aggression and vitriol towards this subject lead me to believe you are being obtuse on purpose, just for the sake of trolling.  sad.
---
We were promised cosmetics only. Now we’re heading down a slippery slope. 
---
Yes! And terrifying when I’ve lived way too long lol trying to level up my lower dude with unwanted attention 
---
This wasn’t meant to be a repair kit replacement idea, but sure.
---
Try survival on early morning in europe i have sometimes only one server avaible with 10people. On peak hours there are like 3servers that let me join.
---
Once i was killed and thought i will just server hop, ofcourse it placed me on same server. Rip 800caps.
---
(ADT) Intruder detected (Back Door).  Proceed with caution.
---
you are right, i think it stared with the patch that introduced fermenters
---
You can't repair in the field with perks, true.  But there are perks that allow you to repair up to 200% condition, which is better than even the Improved repair kit.
---
Well what about the money spent to actually buy the game? I could understand this logic if it was free to play, but it isn’t 
---
Haha you got botted lol 
---
but seriously that same logic would then apply to the unstoppables gear that was in the store. You can find in the game or you can purchase it for a low low price. 
---
I'm certain there are other in game items they sell in the shop. This would just be the first one to offer an "advantage" well sort of that is. 
---
Yeah once game helping items are in atom store,  they'll more than likely throttle gameplay in order for you to need so they can also attract the players that can manage repairs w/o  it as well. 
---
It's what I would do if I was going to charge for something like this.  I'm low level still so I don't see the need for repair kits anyway
---
Is that funny though?
---
Glad you agree, as this isn't pay to win.
---
Holy shit you really are dense. Lots of people were put off by the atomic shop AT ALL being in the game, lots of people bought it on the PROMISE that Bethesda gave that it would be COSMETIC ONLY. Telling consumers that your product is gonna be one way and then doing a 180 on them is WRONG. It's very obvious they're going to take that path if we sit here and say nothing. At the end of the day, yeah we don't have any direct power at Bethesda, but WE buy their games, WE give them our money, and Bethesda wouldn't exist without us. We have a lot of indirect power at Bethesda because if the majority of the player base boycott giving Bethesda any more money or just stop playing all together, which many have said they WILL do if Bethesda goes through with this, they won't have the money to do anything at all with this game so it isn't a matter of telling people who "don't like it" to just quit. 
---
We had to pay for the game you idiot
---
You were the one who started all of this with an Ad Hominem attack on my claim of the Hasty Generalization Fallacy. At this point you’re continuing to engage in the Ad Hominem while now also Begging the Question, so I’d stop because I’m certainly done with this conversation as you bring no argument to the table. 
---
... no I'm saying he has ten so to him using one is literally nothing. While to a normal player using that one might be their only one 
---
in the words of the "great" pete hines, "not interested in discussing how realistic things are in a postapocalyptic universe with talking mutants and ghouls" 
---
I started out playing fallout 1 in my school's computer lab back in 1998, and have played every single one. Fallout 2 and New Vegas were my favorites for their humor and choices.
---
Funny, because that axe had been a pain in the ass for me also.  I run 5 pieces of weapon weight reduction gear (because I'm a silly hoarder).  
---
Grognaks Axe is the only weapon in the game that still weighs full weight when I pick one up. 
---
I know but I did enjoy running around with this in FO4 so I’m all for seeing this come back 
---
Agree to disagree.
---
ESO is an actual mmo, FO76 is not... They are very different.  FO76 is much closer to fo4 than ESO is to Skyrim.  Eso uses the lore but that's about it.  It's a solid game and definitely worth trying, great community and probably a great first mmo if you've never played one before.
---
Most replies don't seem to think so.  But eh, I also did not expect a lot of positive feedback.  
---
It doesn't seem like positive feedback is given out freely here anyways. 
---
Okay, just making sure!
---
Don’t forget that supporting the game can also be being part of an active playerbase. Bethesda listens to money but also uninstall rates and the game flat-out dying 
---
If they nerf sentinelassasin set, there won't be any build that would survive more than 3hits from anything. So it is theoreticaly balanced.
---
My computer lab teacher let us play it after school, it was amazing. Also I feel very old.

Sorry for the formatting, I’m on mobile and didn’t realize it would muck up like that

Just stash your junk and jump off a cliff!
---
Then why are in a subreddit that is dedicated to a game you dont care about? 
---
I don't know where but I found a RPG Holotape in some warehouse. A RPG inside of an RPG?
---
Saoirse
---
no shit, but the ability to repair on the fly in a dungeon, then repair to 200% when you are back at camp, is *waaay* better than needing to rank up a perk card, find the mats, and then travel away from where you are to repair.
---
Ya, no. I spend real money on PA paints if they're any good. It's the only thing I'll ever pay for. Just waiting for the four horsemen now
---
Don’t judge for that’s exactly what I do depending where I’m located 😂
---
omg yes
---
Now you’re using the Strawman Fallacy: I never stated I didn’t think it was possible, I simply asked for evidence. Calm down, as you seem very upset while I’m not. 
---
And? What's the problem?
---
If your looking for a group to have a laugh with join us on discord

Oh I would if they offered skins for two handers or homemade weapons
---
Mobile spice rack to reduce the weight of cooking ingredients - coming soon to the Atmoic Shop! 
---
I am level 200. Ofcourse i will shoot on sight. Level 19once killed me with few rounds from handmade, he made 400caps. Lucky guy. Won't let it happen again.
---
What’s it do?
---
It's ok. Atoms are for cosmetic items only, so no big deal.
---
Hahaha 
---
Everyone currently playing this game already spent hundreds of dimes to support this game (600 of them to be exact) and it's ludicrous that we should be expected to spend any more at any time for any reason. This is not a free-to-play indie game -- it's a $60 AAA release from a major publisher. Our financial obligation began and ended when we bought the game. Any more dimes we spend are at our discretion and should only be for things that affect our own personal enjoyment and NOT on anything that affects game functionality.
---
weird plenty of other cosmetic only microtransaction games are able to keep the servers on
---
Any luck finding a discord server on PS4? I'm looking for one as well.
---
I played 3, 4 and NV. Probably Played NV the most. 
---
I've played every Fallout game as they came out, except the game that shall not be named. I don't go for PvP, but I don't object to it being in the game. The biggest shift in the tone of the games happened between 2 and 3, with NV being a little closer to the first two. 76 still feels like Fallout to me.
---
Sneak. Mostly you don't see scoreboard leaders, because they are crawling like pu.....
---
No.
---
I walked away months ago.  I comeback for cognitive dissonance every couple weeks from cult players who have finally come to their senses.  There are other games, they are fun.  Bethesda is playing chicken with the bottom-line, how much horseshit will they eat?
---
The real limited resource in gaming is player's time. This has been mapped out very carefully as part of the balancing process. Nuked flora "feels" rare because it's a pain in the butt to get. Changing this so you could just buy it with caps would severely unbalance the game.
---
Be thankful that these resources aren't gated behind events that are impossible to finish solo, like in Destiny.
---
And everyone bitching still is playing. 
---
Hey it might be free and for a limited time as well
---
I can get on in a few hours and I could give you some weapons if you want.
---
So they email everyone why they're banned.
---
What'd they say about you?
---
LET ME REPHRASE THEN if we're gonna be that technical.
---
When bethesda actually does this and the white knights stop defending them, think they'll allow refunds? thanks 
---
Maybe a perk where you keep bullet casings and you just use gun powder and lead or something ranked by percantage you keep 25 percent of casings then 50 then 75 
---
It's a pay 2 win setup. That is a massive deal breaker for me when it comes to any game. 
---
They came after g a m e r s.
---
how is paying for an advantage in PvP not P2W?
---
Survey says: 
---
I’d pay $50 for all of these.  
---
&gt;  I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't consider buying something to just unlock all map markers on a character or an XP boost or even WoW type "skip to level X"
---
More power to you, you play how you want and don't let me tell you otherwise, but you are asking to pay just to skip playing chunks of the game... if that's not fun enough to do why even play?
---
Todd.
---
Also i wasnt sure of how fallout would go as a multiplayer game. Because i am not rly a mmo playing person. There are a few things i would change about this game though.
---
Perk cards:
---
Some cards should be passive, lockpicking, hacking, ammosmith, weapon artisan, fix it good... Because whenever i am in need of those cards i have to swap cards every time.  So whats the use. I own those cards and its useless to keep those active in your card deck if u dont need it when you are fighting off enemies
---
Armor/Power armor
---
Non PA like assasins sentinel is so defensive its like shooting against a wall, power armor seems to be made of cardboard compared to those kinds of armor. Either increase the power armor damage resistance so its equal to assasins sentinel armor or there should be legendary power armor.
---
*, **, *** legendary enemies:
---
They drop *, **, *** armor or weapons randomly regardless of how many * an enemy has. ***  enemies should drop *** weapons, ** enemies should drop ** weapons or armor
---
Nuke zones:
---
Nuke zones are a good way to find rare materials. 
---
But dont you think it should look like the glowing sea like in FO4? . Buildings look the same as those before the blast.. Its just the air, enemies and plants that changed
---
NPC'S:
---
its hard to believe that there is no single human or non feral ghoul that survived. Just only robots. Its not realistic. Eventhough there was a scorched plague, some should have survived
---
Make reasonable prices for good content, and I will pay. Easy. 
---
Atm it's garbage for absolute shit prices, I'll event won't give my free atoms for. 
---
I know it's not what you're exactly asking but were it to happen I don't see it happening for a good while. Definitely not with this deal sea round and I would probly venture to guess would get another year's worth of DLC before you start to see that period the moment you do see to it become free to plays the moment that you realize that it's in trouble of falling apart
---
I played fallout 1 and 2 
---
Purchase of the game, they're blatantly going against one of the reasons many people bought a persistent online game; the ability to pay for in-game items 
---
I can do it later tonight, I have 2 nuke cards also.
---
They didn't have perk cards. They didn't have Sentinel armor. They didn't have Bloodied Explosive weapons. Imagine trying to take on a Super Mutant Primus when you're fresh out of Vault 76.
---
Sorry about the grammar. Stupid Bluetooth
---
I would consider that a C.A.M.P. item which is pretty much a cosmetic item.
---
Did I imply I am the only grown up here?  
---
I sure didn't intend to.  But if you interpreted my post that way, I suggest you reread and apply simple comprehension skills this time. :)
---
I am implying that the  little boys (and girls) dressed up as big boys (and girls) writing the dozens of repetitive, whiny posts about the repair kit are...well....being children about it.
---
But that is only a few dozen of the subscribers out of thousands that have said nothing.
---
Your not wrong at this point, you're a fucking inept moron.
---
Could we get a fallout version of Doom or Woldenstien? Replace the demons/Nazis with Communists.
---
This. It isn't any different any of the countless other times some studio pulls this shit. The object isn't to NOT piss people off, the object is to find the line where the money coming in from shit business decisions is greater than money lost from public outcry. Goodwill does not exist in the gaming industy. Companies do not care about their name or image once they are a certain size. People are so short sighted and have such short attention spans that they forget all previous transgressions a company makes the second BattleFuckers 7 gets announced at E3. How many times has EA fucked the consumer? Then Anthem gets announced, and they ride a new found wave of adoration, until the game comes out and it has the exact same fucking problems their last game had: buggy, hollow, and riddled with microtransactions. The bar gets lowered every time. I hope that us being in an age of public visibility that we can turn these things around, but frankly it is an uphill battle against an unending tide of kid gamers, the uninformed, and the apathetic. And with those demographics on the rise, it gets easier and easier every day for companies to lie out their ass and deliver faulty products.
---
Damned wolves always digging up their graves, too.
---
Read the fucking post. 
---
I like all things fallout, so I tried this shit stained game and it sucked ass. 
---
Your two account downvoted and dumbass comments aside, no one really likes what fo76 cane out as.  
---
It should’ve been a different game and would’ve been great had they kept it that way. 
---
I also slow down to look at train wrecks in rl too. 
---
Asshole
---
If someone feels they need to buy repair kits to repair their gear, that implies that the repair economy needs to be improved due to in game repair materials being too rare.  For Bethesda to sell a solution in their MT store represents a clear conflict of interest to fix the game’s issues.  It’s likely that the release of a vault raid is the timing here, where a player’s best items breaking during a raid would be an issue if it is challenging endgame content.  Will there conspicuously be no workbenches available in a raid in order to drive sales of repair kits? 
---
Adding a skin for the Gatling gun would be nice or if they brought back the other hot rodder skins from fo4.   Maybe bring the hockey mask back 
---
The Atomic Shop was founded to give you as much choice and variety in how you want to customize and celebrate your adventures. It doesn’t offer anything with a competitive advantage
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2a4GTCpUPyEsGCGYWyM6Q2/welcome-to-the-atomic-shop
---
Except now it does.  Because someone with a ton of money can buy a ton of repair kits and never have to worry about their TSE minigun breaking on them in a pvp firefight.
---
.308 isn't just automatic, in fact the MG42 is the *only* automatic that uses .308
---
They added a survival mode, which is basically a separate PVP mode - something that people suggested even before the game launched.
---
Sounds like you gotta bust son. At ease soldier and don’t blue ball yourself. I was doing my last sets on the lat machine. I’m just messing bro. It’s all just banter. I’m sure you’re a good dude in your own habitat. 
---
It said so in the article yesterday. Try reading it
---
Was literally about to post the same thing.  This is getting ridiculous.  WE KNOW.  You’re upset.  Why don’t we wait and see what’s actually going to happen?  
---
Or....
---
I don't know.....
---
Folks who expect people or companies to stick to their word?
---
Are you a man of your word?
---
The main point of other posts is how they lied, this one is how the repair tools will be poorly implemented. 
---
I need hardened mass.... sigh
---
I’m so passed, I missed this event by 1 day. Lol started the game too late!
---
Never mind that the repair kits are already a thing in ESO, and were still fairly common to find in game. They handled them extremely well. If the drop rates in 76 are bad complain then. The Atom Shop kits mainly exist  for people who are extremely lazy or for the impatient.
---
Not just that, but getting perk cards to repair your gear to 200% is fairly easy. People are suddenly acting like repair kits are mandatory to play the game, and everybody will be requires to run around with endless repair kits to be competitive. That's ridiculous. It repairs your gear. You already repair now, this will just give you some benefits to save on junk.
---
That said, I do disagree with your claim that they'll "never spend a dime" to support the game. Anyone playing 76 bought the game. We're under no obligation to spend real cash on cosmetics to "support" the game. Our support came from the purchase of the title. Cosmetics should be a neat incentive, but to imply people don't support the game because they're not paying extra for visual fluff is kind of ridiculous.
---
I don’t think it’s a coincidence that repair kits will be available around the time of a vault raid.  Players won’t want to risk their best items breaking during challenging endgame content so it’s a clear incentive.
---
Exactly. I somehow just lost my best armor pieces the other day out of the fucking blue and I am fucking pissed. How do armor pieces just disappear? I want some answers. 
---
You make too many assumptions, go back and take out anything that isn't actually confirmed, and try again.
---
If you want to wear your tinfoil hat and claim the world is coming to and end, you're not doing your argument any favors.  Stick to what you know, and not what you fear.
---
Or they *did* have perk cards and Paladin Swafford was mid-swap
---
I knew about it I used to watch my cousin play 3 and 4 that time after school I would watch my cousin play games lol that was twitch back then I enjoyed it mostly. I didnt get into fallout until the 4th one came out and decided to buy fallout 3 and new vegas 
---
Good point. I'm more incredulous about the amount of healthy vibrant plant growth since a massive nuclear exchange should kick up so much ash and debris into the atmosphere that global cooling and darkness would be prevalent. I'm not a scientist so I could be wrong there. Either way, the aesthetic doesn't meet my genre expectations. 
---
Helga! 
---
Lets talk brahmin, how much for the animals?
---
See thats what they want. They want us to go "oh that's not a big deal"
---
Then the next slightly worse thing wont be a big deal either. Then they keep going, and going, and going.
---
Soon enough they've ripped the doom BFG from the creation club and put it in the atom shop.
---
To also be fair, you don't use 2 entire salt shakers on one bowl of soup.
---
*"Ever"* is a long time.  Yes, I think it will eventually be free on some level.  Remember when Bethehsda gave away the Fallout Classic Collection for free, just for logging into 76?  I wouldn't be surprised at all if something like that happens way down the line.
---
But within the next couple of years?  I doubt it.
---
Skins are in the works for super sledge and homemade. Got some real cartel looking shit in the works for the handmade. I can't wait for that and the 4 horsemen PA skins.
---
&gt;if you want x, the y will be there for you
---
ion you cant reach me in fallout
---
lol good try, your trolling tactics fail, sorry, not gonna feed ya
---
this aint my first row-day-oh
---
why dont you spend all your energy on something productive instead of starting internet fights while you hide behind your screen?
---
are you capable of doing anything positive or do you solely gain a feeling of self-validation by being antagonistic?
---
the funniest thing is, if you simply take the time to read my initial post, im asking for thse same thing, real evidence from 
---
bethesda about the bug, so we will know either way
---
BUT, for you its a lot easier to just fight with random people on the internet.  Brilliant!
---
Create a "competitive advantage" which I completely disagree that this does... But that's also not saying "nothing but cosmetics" which has been the battle cry of most on here which I don't believe they ever said. 
---
There's a LOT more debate and wiggle room about whether this creates a competitive advantage vs whether it's purely cosmetic, as obviously it's a QoL item and not a cosmetic but I don't think the repair kit does anything that 40 caps can't also do.... 
---
...so....🤷‍♂️
---
50 cal is easy. 308 is stupid 
---
Also, care to explain how this is vague? 
---
"using Atoms you’ve purchased or those you’ve earned for free by completing in-game challenges" 
---
&gt; **will never spend a dime of real money to help support the game.** 
---
I didn't spend a dime of real money, I spent 600 dimes of real money.
---
Heard that. Wish I didn’t hear that, but I heard that.
---
They are karma farming.
---
I currently own all of them. I dont want to have to spend cash to keep my collection complete. 
---
&gt;I dont give a fuck about this game dude.
---
Again why are you here? I can understand not liking the game. 76 isn't a traditional Fallout game. But this subreddit is dedicated to enjoying the game for what it is. So wasting your time on a subreddit where you're the minority is a waste of both of our time.
---
And you can't just use soap found in the world!  To make the shower cooldown longer, use the new "Unopened Shampoo",  now available in the Atom Store!
---
But that does not entitle you to any new content.  
---
And how much do they charge for a new skin for a rug? 
---
Also, do you spend 90% of your time in those games talking/chatting/interacting with other players, or wandering alone through empty ruins shooting zombies?
---
LOL i mean really, they didnt much to turn their name from the place they are right now, the game still is miles from a 60dollar game. 
---
And now with this is just spiting to us. 
---
They need to break the ammo for full auto away from the rest to solve this. Instead of standard .308, make a 7.62mm or some such that can be created in batches of 100. Make .50 for rifles and .50BMG for the machine gun, so they can properly scale damage on a .50 sniper rifle.
---
Make them all use 5mm, if it is a coding limitation. But move them away from common ammo pools so they can un-break crafting and bullet damage differences.
---
It’s kinda rare , I been playing 1500 plus hours and only came by one. It’s a solid 300 caps 
---
I hate the fact that I can have 45 fresh picked corn, however, if i had a single almost spoiled piece, I now have 46 almost spoiled corn.
---
Yeah, the repair kits themselves are no big deal. The problem is this is the first step in non cosmetic pay to win monetization strategy. This is where we have to draw the line. No. In. Game. Advantages. For. Cash.
---
starts out cool, but the TLDR makes it sound like it's just you, is this an RP group or just you wanting steel?
---
The 50cal round mentality surrounding the hunting rifle perplexed me greatly, I want my anti-material rifle damn it 😁 
---
Good compromise on the MG42 ammo issue though.
---
They need the stuff from Fo3 released like the armored vault suit or the leather armor as outfits.
---
Maybe even the Brotherhood outcast, albeit being lore breaking.
---
Double XP in survival mode.  Double XP for both modes come at the end of the month 
---
&gt;Bethesda ... but also uninstall rates and the game flat-out dying
---
If they cared about the game flat out dying they likely wouldn't have done repair kits like they are doing.
---
I want nothing more than some Vault-Tex style walls! I’d drop full DLC level Atoms on that.
---
(Not some blue and yellow recolor— stuff like you see in the Vaults themselves.) 
---
How the fuck does it affect us??? How the fuck do you not understand the problem??? It affects me because I'm now buying a game but not getting the entire game. Yes DLC down the road helps with the longevity. But look at  all the DAY FUCKING ONE dlc that exists these days. Thats not helping the game, thats going yea we wanna be greedy and not sell all of the game.   
---
Why else is this a problem. Because there's plenty of examples of MTX that affect in game. That means other players have an advantage over me just because they dropped a few bucks and I can't.  
---
Cosmetic = Cool
---
New Content = Cool  
---
Charging for random shit that gives people an advantage = NOT cool
---
No doi fool. But do all rugs make cool patterns as a stair set or are invisible from ground level? 
---
Jokes aside do you really play survival if so are you on PS4?
---
Ps4
---
What? Some more "what its?" that have been repeated dozens of times already -- as a reply to my comment?  What are the odds. 
---
Do you want kit's out of the store?; I actually didn't think about that I just went with a very simplistic approach.
---
No, they can..
---
Oh ok
---
No dude lol. That is insane to say that a couple dollar micro transaction and a speculated broken promise, some how entitles you to a full refund. In case you are wondering, bethesda's return policy is basically a huge middle finger. Those who got the power armor edition know this.  
---
Yeah homie I paid like 120 for a game that comes free with USB drives now, I ain't going anywhere
---
Who spit in ur cheerios bro? I have bad memory, if i remembered to open the perk menu i wouldnt have made this post
---
Don't give them that idea! I need loads of copper as is for repairs and ammo manufacturing for my Gattling Plasma 😁
---
I appreciate it.  I'm going to keep checking these dumps and see if anything changes/if I can sus out anything more.  This is just not my area of expertise, and I appreciate anybody else's brain on this.  Truly, thank you.
---
I can model myself after Bill Gates, but there's no chance in hell I'll get the opportunity to buy DOS for a song, and take over the OS market. 
---
So I probably shouldn't go into a job interview and demand a $3,710,000,000 salary. 
---
76 ain't WOW and it's got no chance of becoming WOW anytime soon. So maybe they should price more realistically to boost sales and keep people buying. You charge too much and no one will buy the product except a few rich idiots. 
---
I ran out of cloth! I'm currently getting all the cloth from everything. Should have the rest done today. I started putting one at my own camp
---
no but the hundred or so posts people made about their usage of them for floors would lead anyone to that conclusion...
---
Agreed, my dude.  But ask for a moment of self-reflection and we all get to see everyone's true emotional age.  
---
I don't even own the game (*Can't afford too and my laptop's not good enough to.)* But I saw the word Ranger armor and instantly came to read this post more. If the mere mention is enough to make me read a post about a game I don't even own, imagine all the other NCR fanboys like myself that own the game. You'd have to restrain them from their wallets.
---
I spend a lot of money on micro transactions in general. (Gaming is my hobby, and I love cosmetics.) BUT even I hesitate over spending $15 on what’s essentially a recolor. 
---
They need to take volume into account. I’ll buy 5 recolors for $5 each, but I won’t buy one for $15.
---
I think they removed markers for longest life span.couldnt see any today. Manage to hit level 10 on weekend exp boost. Awesome!
---
That is interesting you see it that way.  So black and white.  But not unexpected.  
---
If you arent in grinding and helping other people there really isnt anything left for you to do.
---
Just like any RPG. This just has other people too.
---
Yeah that's the issue, the ammo crafting is with semi automatic/bolt action in mind and not bullet hoses 😁
---
on PC, I have seen others wearing skull and winter masks during the event.
---
Next update S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Is changing to S.P.E.C.I.A.L.S. Adding in the new Shower stat! Works in conjunction with charisma and luck. This will effect vendor pricing, food spoilage, and inversely, how far away you can share a perk with teammates. 
---
And that's why I feel that so many people are justified with their responses, expressing distaste for this change. I just think some may either be overlooking this and in turn imparting too much rage into their posts/comments. 
---
I envision a lot voicing their harshly-worded responses either read only the comments here which lacked mentioning we also can obtain *better* ones (for free) in game, or, started to read the original article but stopped after "we're adding repair kits to the shop". Taken that and applied the feeling of betrayal from Bethesda going back on their word, and, well, "triggered". heh 
---
I'd agree with their stance then, and frankly I was in that same situation... until I read the actual article and saw there was a bit more to the story. This made it not so bad for me, personally. Yes, it still means they've gone back on their word... but at the same time it's being a "quality of life" improvement for us. 
---
Which, the more I think about it the more I question then, if it really *WILL* be a matter of P2W?
---
**But hear me out!** :)
---
My initial reaction, and likely that of most, was that *"it's going to give people an edge in PVP"*. But will it? Think about how this will have to work.
---
#1 It will only restore **ONE** item to 100% (or 150% with the free variant).
---
#2 It's not a consumable like a Stimpack, that you can seamlessly have in the Hotbar and use, while continuing to fight.
---
These two aspects mean that in order to repair something you'll have to stop ***everything*** to navigate through *some* kind of menu in order to select the item you need repaired. For PVP this will open you up to someone else unloading damage into you as you stand there! 
---
In my eyes that would seem to negate any kind of edge the other person may have, thus, will it actually be P2W then?
---
Just some food for thought, for everyone, not singling you or anyone out specifically :) Just sharing my own train of thought on this matter!
---
Care to share more about your shotgunner? I’m currently building one, top 5 perks?
---
Doesn't effect me any, I'm still wrongfully banned without explanation. Best of luck to those who are riding this shit show.
---
Skip
---
because it's a high caliber round made for rifles not automatics?
---
Pretty sure half the complaints are people using trending bitching to farm upvotes.
---
Yep! I am on PS4
---
Been playing since the first, fo3 is still my favourite 💪
---
Im just very tired of feeling like i bought this game in order to have a huge dump constantly taken on my face ig
---
I'm considering unblocking the pieces of shit that came here with their irrelevant opinions (i.e. what PR crisis?), just to link em all the proofs for them being imbeciles. From today, when I notice somebody might be an irrelevant piece of shit I will not be even responding, instant fucking block.
---
I spent $60 buying the game on preorder.  Next to people who bought the collectors editions, we're probably the ones who supported the game the most. I'd be surprised if this game maintained its $60 price tag by Autumn, I'm sure it'll go on sale again and people will probably be able to buy it at a pittance compared to what people like me got it for.
---
im with your man this game can go burn on hell. 
---
im part of that "we" about the franchise. 
---
Bethesda is making all this blind idiot buy this shittty game to milk them 
---
I noticed that too and thought it was a bug! Good move if intentional!
---
We need Free States items. Liek anything Free state
---
But do you have cookies?
---
Yes it does. That's what they promised when they announced so that's what I expect.
---
Give me a variety of weapon skins -- give me gold, polished silver, camouflages (desert, jungle, forest, arctic), flames, neon, [raider styles](https://movieboozer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/chappie-szenen-12-scene-picture-ninja.jpg), and more. But don't nickle and dime me by selling each skin for each individual gun. Give me themed packages I can purchase.
---
Same with armors. Offer up armor packages that have the same themes, but with armor variants. 
---
The idea that a skin is only available for a single gun is stupid (unless it's something specifically unique and rare). I'm not paying a ton of caps for a chrome minigun that *nobody will notice.* Now, if the minigun has a deathclaw skull mounted on the tip of the barrel, and the bullets fire out of the mouth, I'll gladly hand over my credit card.
---
S: Max shotgun damage boosts, fast reload speed, and reduced damage from blocker are a must. Lighter shotguns are nice to have, letting you carry two or more shotguns for different situations.
---
P: Concentrated Fire and Skeet Shooter help your shots hit their mark, especially in VATS.
---
E: Not a lot of good picks here, but Fireproof is a great way to reduce damage from a source that usually hits hard.
---
C: Lone Wanderer and Field Surgeon help your survivability, and the faster AP regen is useful too. You can swap that out when in a group for something that helps your team.
---
I: Gun mods and slower breakage rates, must haves.
---
A: More AP for VATS, damage from Adrenaline when you're fighting multiple enemies, and defense from Dodgy and Born Survivor. Enforcer helps survivability too by staggering your targets.
---
L: Bloody Mess for more damage. Serendipity helps survivability greatly when you need it most. Starched Genes and Class Freak make your mutations manageable and better.
---
Your SPECIAL stats come out to 15/6/3/6/5/11/10, which also gives you enough stats to equip useful cards for lockpicking, hacking, and crafting when needed.
---
EDIT: Another idea - swap out Class Freak for one rank of Four Leaf Clover and one rank of Grim Reaper's Sprint. This build performs really well in VATS, especially with criticals, and those perks give you a chance to be even more deadly while in VATS and to get into it faster. They're meager chances at rank 1, but having them equipped at all adds more VATS potential.
---
&gt;There is no reason Bethesda shouldn't be able to see the extent of the backlash to this decision...
---
We don't need 50 threads in order for Bethesda to see the extent of the backlash.
---
I've already outlined in-depth why you guys should be culling these threads down to just one thread in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9fmqx/psa_dont_complain_about_the_number_of_posts/ek5csj4/?context=3).
---
If the mods of this subreddit continue to let it be overrun by a flood of posts every time the community decides it has a bone to pick, this subreddit is quickly going to lose subscribers.
---
Get off your asses and do your jobs, mods.
---
Not that much faster because levels 1-40 you are always changing weapons for better ones anyways.
---
3 minutes, not 45. Also, I eat three meals a day, my character needs like sixty. WTF.
---
Correct. It is a person that like to fix things more as a hobby, not so much as a job. 
---
A slippery slope argument is not in itself a logical fallacy. It’s a method of critical thinking in which various steps lead to a culminating effect and which the merit of is based on whether or not those steps can be demonstrated.
---
A slippery slope fallacy is when unrelated and illogical events are used to come to a conclusion. Arguing that adding an element of pay to win can lead to more pay to win is not a fallacy as it’s logical for a company to increase the implementation of a successfully adapted business model. Stop using terms you don’t understand. 
---
I’m they tell me I’m scum afterwards I’ll pay extra.
---
Would you rather this be in the game or pay for dlc?
---
Real talk?
---
They will never? More like already have. 
---
We all supported this incomplete bugfest from the start by paying AAA title prices. Some of us even bought multiple accounts. Some of us even bought a shit ton of Atoms for silly camp nonsense and other cosmetics, some multiple times over.
---
Real talk. 
---
Atomic Shop is in game, deal with it.
---
You really think Bethesda will go bankrupt because a few entitled people are not happy? I’m sorry the game is not the way you want it to be, maybe it’s not the right game for you? Maybe Farmville would suit you better?
---
They will show up on the map as soon as you completed the Enclave missions. The I become death mission will that follows will trigger this. 
---
So, tell me how you really feel?
---
I agree with, this would not help in PvP directly at least, but is a bad sign for the future. 
---
Plus they already made a lot of mistakes with these games, at least they should wait to drop something like that, I mean the game came out just 4 months ago it’s not even a year!
---
maybe a gift with the next fallout 
---
Looking how Bethesda is making Fallout 76 a milking machine for blind idiots, the game will not go F2P they game will become P2P or P2W. 
---
Keep playing this atrocity 
---
By 👋🏻
---
My main is me, so I named him Mike Watts.
---
My other characters are:
---
Rangarok - Big brolic white dude with a mohawk who runs around in the savage outfit with an axe and drinking problem.
---
Eric Hunter - Character I play as to wander the map and just hunt and ignore story line stuff. I also make this character in most open world games with the same intent. Although in medieval games, he is called Erik the Hunter.
---
I thought you couldn't buy advanced repair kits from the Atom Store. Just basic.
---
Should have known better
---
...how exactly is it the community managers' faults? they aren't the ones who decided to go in this direction with the game, and they're most certainly not allowed to speak for bethesda without prior confirmation of what they're allowed to say
---
Alpha is between Yellow Sandy’s Still and Hawke’s Refuge. It’s northeast from the silo entrance.
---
Since FO3 played and had a blast with all
---
Bethesda should remember that lurkers are a thing. I don’t play actively right now, but I’m keenly following the developments. and I’m planning to play when I have some free time, and I’ve actually had fun so far with the game.
---
**However**, if I sense that the game producer goes to a ”squeeze mode” with their monetization, I will immediately scatter. so far, Apex Legends and Division 2 has been eating my time, but FO76 has been on the ”gotta continue playing next ” list.
---
These kind of things fumble my priorities a lot, because as a busy professional I have disposable income but very low tolerance for bullshit.
---
If you need money, ask for it. do not try to skim it with ”smart” skinner box schemes. that is just low, and people **will** se through it.
---
Someone appreciated it so much I got a gold award thing.  Thanks to whomever gave that up.  I am aware the masses do not have the same point of view as I do, but I guess there are a few individuals.

I spent $175, PA edition with gamer club discount.  Still don't regret it.  I've got all the fallouts from 3 beyond as CEs, wasn't going to stop with this one.  Side note, that mini nuke CE for PC is muh favorite.  :)
---
I'm trying to get back into the game and all of my buddies have moved on. I'm down to team up in survival if you are.
---
Well we went from flaming Pitchfork posts to I quit posts. 
---
Ok I'll give you what you want here's some attention take it.
---
Shit buddy thanks! Much appreciated cheers pal! 
---
Where do they talk about fridges???
---
I'm pretty sure the masks were in the game then, even backpacks were found in the dev room and those still haven't released, and even if they weren't it's still possible to access the dev room.
---
lol  
---
/thread
---
Except it already has, and the atomshop isn't some abstract fucking concept: it's hot wired to the pay checks involved with the game.
---
So when did the advanced repair kits get put in the shop?  I was under the impression that they were only drops from SBQ among other things. Only the basic was to be in the Atom Shop. 
---
&gt; I would prefer to pay a subscription than have any micro-transactions for this nonsense.
---
Nope, not me.
---
MTX puts me in control. A subscription is a monthly drain out of my wallet whether I like the last DLC or not. An MTX lets me open my wallet if an only if I am enjoying the content and the item the MTX is for.
---
And yes this game is for all senses an MMO.
---
The purchase price pays for the base game as it was prior to the new content.
---
All of the new content and overhead cost (servers, bandwidth etc,,,) need to be paid for.
---
You aren't going to pay $60 for a game that you can pay online with friends with frequently updated content and game modes for years. That is bad business, and by bad I mean going out of business bad. I mean you may get a year of service that way but it wouldn't last long, Amazon servers and bandwidth are not cheap at that scale and development teams are expensive as well.
---
A fridge in the Atom shop is not P2W, an ammo converter in the Atom Shop is not P2W, A redirect junk to stash is not P2W.
---
It's pay to bypass some mechanics that certain people do not enjoy.
---
But again, you get to choose to pay or not.
---
I've gotten a bunch of stuff out of the Atom shop and never spent real money on it. Maybe someday they will have a skin or building set that interests me. If that happens I will buy. 
---
Fixed.
---
This is awesome and I want in.
---
I abandoned 76 at launch because it was unplayable. I got into it recently, leveled up to 25. I was having a good time. Now I'm abandoning this game again. It was a good run, but Bethesda has proven time and time again that they are not for the consumer anymore. They want money and only money. It doesn't matter if they lose their entire Fallout fanbase and kill all the lore that has been set up for years. They just want money with as little work as possible. Again, it was a good run guys. I'll come back for Wastelanders and see if they tried this time, but I doubt it. Peace
---
*shrug* I did point out my disagreement with them releasing it in the shop rather than making it a findable, if rare, in game plan.  I think its a step in the wrong direction and it shows that the really do want to make this game entirely based on microTX rather than just having collectables and pretty things be in the cash store.  But I blame Bethesda's Corporate people for that one.  Greedy bastards.
---
I thought the constant unnecessary updates to Fallout 4 creation club that break mods every single time was their social experiment, since they're *still* doing that. I guess they like to multi-task.
---
Fun fact did you know a poptart is Pre-staled before they even ship them out.  
---
10 minutes of survival will take care of that for you.
---
I work in plastics and all I see are shotgun shells and fusion cells.
---
It will only last a few days and will hopefully get the point across to bethesda
---
Haha where do you think I got all this from 
---
You are the only one.  Cause no one goes hunting scorch beasts (unless they are like... super bored and want to waste some resources, I guess).
---
Custom modeled behemoth with a fridge on the back, grab a key card and check a box at the end if the raid for a shot at the (not normal looking) fridge plan and other misc loot. 
---
the clown mask can be found in game
---
Scour the outer edges of the map. Put on your Aqua Boy scuba gear and see where all the underwater safes are. (Hint: submerged part  of the Nuka-Cola plant that fell into the river)
---
so you all are fine with what Bethesda is doing. im just surprise how much ppl can ignore how they lie to you multiple times, and now they just totally fucking you up as costumer and player. 
---
Personally, I would rather pay for DLC as long as it was worth the money...as in Far Harbor/Nuka World type DLC, not the Creation Club stuff - though to be fair, a few of the CC quests were worth picking up.
---
I am not generally a fan of paying real money for cosmetic items really. I'd rather pay for actual gameplay content (new areas, quests, etc.) than skins or emotes.
---
Wait... there's other Fallout games?
---
If you want Bethesda to stop fucking you in the ass then stop playing this game! 
---
I have the means to pay these prices. I say that not to brag, but to highlight a point:
---
The people playing this game, and therefore the people using the Atom Store, are “core gamers.” We play other games, we know what pay-to-win looks like, and we can compare the cost of cosmetics to other games (I play a lot of Overwatch, League of Legends, MMOs, etc.)
---
I don’t believe that they’ll be able to rely on us getting FarmVille’d into the game, and they’d be making a mistake to try.
---
I have fallen in love with Fallout 76, and I view each purchase I make on the store as continuing development. But I will take my money elsewhere if that development goes south.
---
Stating a possible logic fallency isn't a counter argument, or a refutation of their intent.
---
Plus 2 plastic
---
LOL bc Skins dont make good incomes. Most ppl wont spend real money on a alreayd expensive game. 
---
That why bethesda is trying to put this shit on the AS. So ppl is force to buy it and used it. 
---
People still playing this have only themselves to blaim for this. This game is a scam from the start to the end. Bought the game at release and convinced two friends to buy with me. No need to say how pissed they got after they saw the mess the game is. One at least got a refund, the other is still angry at me.
---
Been playing Fallout 1 since 2000, still go back and play Fallout 2 even though I've played that game about 3,000 times. Never got into Fallout: New Vegas, it was boring IMO. 
---
There's plenty of people who played the original who still play.
---
I don't get all the salt regarding food. I mean sure, it spoils quite fast but that's to be expected when the game's timescale is set to 15 or something. If it's so bothersome stock up on non perishables or go out and forage.
---
Part of the sales pitch for the game is that all new content would be free, and that would be supported by a cosmetic only store.
---
So yeah, buying the game does entitle you to new content, because that is what was promised.
---
Is that the only one?  I've checked a few and never saw a difference in weight.
---
Yea, it is. Not in a "haha" kind of way though. 
---
Same with New Vegas, I thought it was pretty boring. Fallout 1 and 2 were some of the best ones.
---
Hmm, I'm not seeing where you stated an actual problem. This is nothing, you've said nothing. New content isn't free, someone has to fucking make it, and you aren't obligated to receive it for free. Repair kits did not come in the game you bought. Other DLC and P2W issues(imagined and real) on other games is irrelevant to this game. There's no reason to believe they withheld repair kits in order to sell it later. There's no evidence to show that they are balancing the game towards requiring these optional purchases. You have not been affected by anything other than your own bullshit entitlement. Someone else being able to go into their inventory and repairing a single item for some atom(which you easily get for free) will not affect you in any way.
---
You can be wary of what it could lead to, but until it actually happens and it's not just fear-mongering and paranoia, then it isn't a real problem is it?
---
Why should any of that matter to me, though?  What skin is it off my back if someone else has an easier time leveling up than I do?
---
I really don't care how anyone else plays this game, so long as they're not griefing.  Let people buy a $200 edition of the game that gives them God Powers where all they have to do is sit in their perfect CAMP at perfect health and watch robot porn all day, I don't care.
---
Ranger armor is awesome but that's from the NCR which wouldn't exist yet, and they are from the west coast also.
---
Exchange caps for goods and services
---
Sorry for the wall of text and the broken grammar, but I am not a native English speaker. Of you are wondering where my mother is, she is tending my camp with a lever action, yelling to any young punks, who dare to get on my lawn. 
---
Why can't it be both?
---
let's hope they do not want to try other things like this
---
I can bring some Fasnacht Donuts. Close enough?
---
Yea. If this all does play out that way with food and refrigerators, that's unacceptable. 
---
Want to add in a food preservation mechanic through Atomic Shop obtainable cold-storage containers? Go for it! I have absolutely no problem with that and frankly, it's a cool (no pun intended) idea I think. Personally, I only eat Dog Food with my characters, as buffs are generally too short lasting for me to be interested in going out of my way to cook stuff.
---
Now to **change an already establish time-frame for things to spoil**, just to make something that you can spend money to obtain... That is indeed BS and unacceptable behavior for a company. 
---
In an effort to continue playing devil's advocate... We don't ***have*** to pay for Atoms. Creating a new character is by far the easiest way to earn a few THOUSAND Atoms very quickly and easily. Use it to reach lvl 25 and delete it to start a new one if all you want to do is farm Atoms for free.
---
It's a two-way street. We can take advantage of their system if they want to add things into the shop they claimed wouldn't happen. In the end, it doesn't benefit Bethesda really, and only sews discontent in the playerbase. 
---
We're forgiving, but please don't take advantage of that fact.
---
To which I say, GOOD. 
---
They need to see a ton of us aren’t interested in supporting this bullshit and have the will to reject the shit sandwiches. They need to see we are being vocal about it, constantly.
---
They’ve shown they’ve got zero integrity. They serve us blatant lies and backpedal when it suits them. 
---
They way they conduct business is grimy as fuck.
---
You know you can criticize things you like though, right? 
---
Dogs and cats having sex. It’s pure and utter chaos 
---
QQ why are there so many crybabies in the fallout community. Repair kits are so insignificant lol
---
the difference is that it isnt bethesda who is selling P2W items on ebay its users and if i remember right people have goten banned for that
---
It’s true! You can get some rather pretty cosmetics in those games. Bethesda isn’t renowned for their art team (and that’s okay!), but they should probably do some hiring in that department if they want to double down on a cosmetics shop.
---
That's true.  You did pay, so they aren't having money problems or seeing this project as a money pit.  Large developers are happy to keep poor rated projects that generate a lot of bad press and hemorrhage money.
---
Good to know there's no concern that people ranting over small things could ruin it for the rest who are honestly enjoying it.
---
I dont think repair kits is a big deal. Ppl are overreacting though.  I repair all my weapons and armor at my workbench and i never felt like i needed a repairkit. fallout is about survival, its exploring,  finding water, food, materials,.. And ofc when you are searching for that stuff you'll encounter enemies and you'll need weapons and ammo to defend yourself. Thats why scavenging is important.  You will need those to repair weapons or armor. Just keep your ammount of materials to a decent lvl.  So i guess players that feel they need a repair kit are lazy or they only do  the run, shoot and  loot thing. 
---
 I remember there were weapon repair kits in NV, i never used them, they took too much space in the inventory... 
---
Riot armor (cosmetic or otherwise) and you have my money bethesda
---
 you guys undestand how this work right????
---
Skin/cosmetics dont really make that much money vs a item that you are force to buy to be able to ppl the game the same way as other that buy it. 
---
That is the hook. 
---
Give them the money so they can make elder scrolls 6 with great amounts of money!
---
because one person isn't a group?
---
Well, we can all have an opinion.  And that is yours.
---
I'd sooner pay for additional content beyond what they've already announced as "free"...
---
Yes, atomic shop is in the game, but Bethesda specifically said it would be cosmetic only, going back on that promise will break consumer trust for Bethesda. You say a "few" as if since the repair kit news dropped basically the only thing we're seeing on the sub is "This is bad", I don't think Bethesda will go bankrupt, and I don't think people are entitled, I think consumers will have been lied to and Bethesda is going to lose out hard if they go through with this. 
---
Curious as to what gear you have him running around in, somewhat in character?
---
I just bought the biggest atom package that they had. I still don't want them to do this. Slippery slopes exist.
---
This is a video game. What is going on in your life that this is the kind of person you want to be right now. Grow up and stop being a little bitch.
---
Support the devs! Support bethesda! This company is a big company and i want them to make lots of money for elder scrolls 6 :)
---
Got a picture?
---
...someone else make the joke here please, I can't decide if it's worth the karma risk... :P
---
Yeah. I really hope they can see that the road to long term profit is being consumer friendly. It's sad to see my favorite franchise get beheaded right infront of me by a greedy dev.
---
Don't feed the trolls. 
---
The issue is that this isn't small man. No one is ruining your fun by being against this. I honestly enjoy this game, yet I highly disagree with them going back on their word.
---
This doesn't make you shoot straighter, hit harder, or  live longer. It let's you fix some gear on the fly and you can earn better versions in game. F you stop in the middle of combat to use one, you will die.
---
Or duel wielding melee.
---
Slice in dice
---
the issue is, it was changed drastically, but no patch notes about it being changed, we just want to know if this was intentional or a bug?
---
I mean it’s a ghostbusters reference 
---
No problem lol
---
Have a good day!
---
All I’m hearing from this post is, “Reeeeeee!” And “Orange Man Bad!!!” 
---
Seems to be a bit of a hive mind on Reddit sometimes. You hear that Echo in the Chamber? Might want to step out and think for yourself. 
---
They do not care. They want money, not to please you guys. That should be obvious by now.
---
they are super soldier serums, why would they change your appearance?  does Superman look like a bird because he can fly?  does Captain America look like an ant because he has super strength?
---
Played since Fallout 2. That sounds like a long time but I only picked it up about a year before 3 came out and didn't play it until I found out that FO3 was the sequel to that 2D grid mapped game.
---
 I thought 3 was far too different from 2 and was a downgrade from everything except play experience. No choices, no options, no funny interactions.
---
Fallout 76 is to New Vegas as Fallout 3 is to 2. Upgrade but also a downgrade. Downvotes can be used as a disagree button if you want.
---
I already don't have hope for TES 6. I think it will be full of microtransactions. Hell, maybe we will get to wait 8 hours to open a chest
---
I mean it hasn't even happened yet. This sub kinda freaks out about everything so I'm going to reserve my judgement for when the update comes out.
---
People whose job relies on numbers going up don't care. To them this is the best way to get more money from the player base without causing \*too\* much uproar.
---
Look I want bethesda to continue to support this game with new story, features, quests, and great content. If this means they need or believe they need to add some things to the atom shop like “repair kits” then i say go for it! Its either they do that or they start charging real money (not atoms) for new vaults and content.
---
You want to participate in the next fasnaught day parade? Then it will be 4.99. I dont want to pay for extra content. I want repair kits so that the devs keep supporting this game without charging for updates.
---
All of this backlash is because of optional atoms. Its rediculous. Would you rather have some repair kits and lunch boxes or would you rather them charge you 20 bucks for the nuclear winter mode and access to the legendary vendor content? I SAY REPAIR KITS!
---
Dont tell me it shouldnt be either. We all know this is a live service game and to support the live service model bethesda prefers to have us flip a buck to them from time to time.
---
If repair kits dont come out because of the backlash then expect to pay for new content!
---
I really couldn't care less. They give away atoms like candy and 'pay for convenience' really doesn't bother me in the slightest.
---
Not the core point of what I was saying, but sure... we can debate that.
---
My point was that they are actually LIMITING the PvP impact of people who buy from outside sources (e.g. ebay) in order to play to win.  So it would make sense that they would be able/willing to limit the people who P2W in PvP, so it may not be a concern if that is why P2W bothers you.
---
My only P2W concern is if they nerf it so you HAVE to pay to win.  Otherwise, I have no problem if some rich dude with limited playing time wants to enhance his experience.  Go for it big boy.  If you help me trounce a SBQ I will give you a thumbs up.
---
Mama Murphy. Gonna be dealing in a very large amount of chems once the vending update comes out.
---
I currently live in a junkyard.
---
Bravo sir, bravo! 
---
Raider?
---
well said!!
---
they should have just advertised it as a new feature that comes for free cause not only is it give others an advantage for paying money it also is a feature that has existed in prior installments it would be like charging money for vats
---
This is going to sound very lame to a lot of people, but here's what I plan to do:
---
\- Build new camps for awhile, if I'm not sick of it by then
---
\- See if any low levels need help with anything
---
\- And perhaps lamest of all, take long walks. Maybe start by following train tracks all around the map, or just meandering along the highways. When I walked from Charleston to Watoga at level 14 to get the handmade plans, I was kind of taken with just the changing landscape, day/night cycling, and weather. I only ran into two low level enemies and a benign mothman the whole way, but it was great just hopping up and down cliffs, finding crashed vertibots, etc.
---
Relax bud. RELAX
---
Ok. I was about to be like "so I'm stockpiling guns now"
---
Lol 😂
---
Bioware was getting all PR and Todd said hold my beer.
---
Automatron and grognak are the best holotape games in fallout history imo
---
Welp they may change what they said would be “free” because of backlash to the optional atom store. As a business i know i would.
---
No, sorry, there's a great one-liner to your response that is terribly funny and inappropriate, I just can't bring myself to make it.
---
Here are a few things I would like to see:
---
\-Any type of faction related decorations and outfits (banners, flags, skulls, signs, uniforms). These would sell like hotcakes!!
---
\-More power armor paint (faction related)
---
\-Wasteland looking outfits (similar to hunters long coat, traveling leather coat, etc)
---
\-Weapon skins (handmade, combat rifle, machete, pistols)
---
\-Red Rocket decorations
---
\-Nuka Cola anything
---
\-More Halloween stuff
---
\-Mothman cult items
---
\-Radio stations
---
\-Pip boy games
---
\-Manicured grass
---
\-House plants
---
\-Docks
---
\-Different roofing options
---
\-Different colored and designs of signs and letter plan
---
\-Shelves with items on them
---
\-Magazine racks/cash registers/counter tops
---
\-Log cabin building sets
---
\-Kitchen sinks (working)
---
\-Kitchen cabinets
---
\-Shower stalls
---
\-Bunker Building kits (above and underground)
---
\-Alcohol/Cigarette signage
---
\-Toys you can play with (Soccer balls, floatie toys)
---
\-Military camouflage netting
---
\-Targets to shoot at
---
\-House paint
---
\-Wooden stairs
---
\-Clean versions of all camp items 
---
\-Building Blueprints (pre-fab designs)
---
\-Normal windmills (skin)
---
\-garden containers (pots, garden plots)
---
\-More photo mode
---
\-Extra photo storage space
---
\-Emotes
---
\-Pets that stay in your c.a.m.p. zone (un-killable)
---
\-Robots 
---
\-cosmetic skins that make you look like enemies (mutant, scorched, ghouls, etc)
---
my god some widdle iddy biddy godfeeest needs a widdle nappy-poo, he is all sorts of cwanky
---
But, ( insert new outrage ) is going to destroy the game?!?
---
Seriously though, I can see how people would be unnerved by the repair kits.  I'm not mad about it myself, but I do think it was a strange move to make by Bethesda.  
---
All they have to do is put better quality cosmetic items in the atom shop. 
---
The unstoppables set would've made me spend money of I didnt have 3000 atoms saved up because everything else has been crappy.
---
Honestly, I would put Fallout 1 on a system with a Pentium 1 at 100mhz or so, with 32MB of ram.
---
Back in 2000 I had a Pentium 2 300mhz 64mb Ram 2MB on board gfx. That system was overkill for Fallout 1.
---
It's Grognak &amp; the Ruby Ruins, found inside Grafton Dam building
---
We'll see how fridges work out as you say; as much as it saves the casual player from having to craft food each session, food itself is really common, and finding places to cook (that aren't your camp) are scattered all over the place too.
---
I'd argue it's more so people can save &amp; conveniently use more rare foods without feeling like they've only got 10 minutes to cook it and 10 minutes to eat it ; as even with speed demon speeding up my food &amp; water bars, I *still* end up with way too much food than it takes to fill the bar and maintain a buff (most of it is glowing meat).
---
Thank you for speaking some sanity. 
---
Nice! Max Rhodes is a recurring character we tend to use. Works for both male and female which is great. Rangarok sounds rad
---
I want elder Maxon's jacket
---
Highkey feel the nuclear winter update will involve that observatory
---
Who the hell vendored a legacy TSE Tesla that hasn’t dropped since January?
---
We're still in the protest and possibly burn down thier HQ phase not the I rage quit phase. You're clearly seeking attention because the kits aren't live yet.
---
So here take some more attention see I'm looking at your post it was so strongly worded how could I miss it.
---
Your welcome I'll even downvote so you know I care :D
---
OMFG you are right.  Repair kits that we only have a vague clue as to how they might be implemented in the game that might help quality of play for some people.  
---
Jesus.  Do they have the death penalty where they are working from?  Because they might actually have to face that.  Run Devs run!
---
This is an excellent suggestion.
---
Melee build I assume 
---
First its repair kits, then armor kits, then ammo kits then more and more and more. If we let them get away with one think, they’re gonna keep going for more. 
---
Good one!
---
I’m betting he’s a raider 
---
I care about this game. 
---
Get a job.
---
I think that an "anti-material" round is better suited for the Gauss Rifle. It's already designed to fire rounds at insane speed, meaning a tiny chunk of metal packs considerably more wallop than bullet propelled by gunpowder.
---
Would make for a good end-game plan as a "receiver upgrade" to the Gauss, to have it fire uranium slugs. Note that I didn't say *depleted* uranium ;) I can imagine Uranium Ore being converted into these rounds (1x Ore for 3x Slugs?) which in turn not only give it 50% Armor Penetration, but +5 Rad Damage!
---
Alternatively, one could obtain Depleted Uranium (DU) from their Fusion Generators and Power Armor. Fusion Generators would generate it slowly, maybe 3 pieces of DU per in-game day? Power Armor would yield 3 DU per Fusion Core you deplete?
---
In turn... 3 pieces of DU = 9 rounds of Depleted Uranium 2mm EC Rounds? :)
---
Take that you Russian for profit troll!
---
I want cosmetic mutations in the store
---
finally, a balanced post...
---
There is a clean asylum worker hat and (I think) a nurse uniform at Fort Defiance.  Also, you can purchase a spiffy bathrobe at Whitespring.
---
Advanced repair kits repair items to 150%, work anywhere, and don't cost any mats.  
---
For comparison you can't repair armor past 150% until level  28 and weapons till level 41 and it will cost mats including rare mats like ballistic fiber.  
---
So while it's definitely not going to make players "invincible" it does give low level players using repair kits purchased with atoms a minor advantage.  
---
To me the real problem is: if something that grants even a small advantage is sold in the atom store it sets a bad precedent.  They may very well start adding more and more items that provide minor benefits until spending money in the atom store because a huge advantage compared to not spending money.    
---
I'd rather not go down that road.  YMMV, of course ;)
---
Go on.....
---
So hear me out, there was at least one Appalachia BoS deserter. What if that man painted his armor. Black and red, and Taggerdy's BoS reported that back to Maxson s BoS, and with that on record, as a protest, the East Coast outcasts chose that red and black scheme.
---
This would be no harsher a retcon than how the BoS came to be in Appalachia to begin with. 
---
Well, it was dogs and cats living together (in peace), not so much having all out sex. XD
---
* it allows you to continue to use your weapon after it broke (that's an advantage)
---
* fixing gear on the fly is an advantage
---
* the better versions will be as rare as Ultracite plans and doesn't negate the fact the Atomic Shop ones are P2W
---
* you won't always die going into the Pip Boy, but even so if it can be favorited than that negates your last point...
---
Some people don’t find the two effects worth the time or effort. In fact more people are starting to switch of them 
---
It's a nod to the real life Christmas Bridge collapse in reference to Mothman. Didn't know about it in game. Nice find OP!
---
There’s a difference between criticizing and whinning. 
---
Criticism should be constructive, bot demanding and threatening.
---
There are also a half dozen drones circling past the bridge.
---
The sad part is that people are making this much noise about it. It's just a fucking game.
---
So what you're saying is, paying real money for a free repair isn't pay to win? You realize pay to win is that by definition? Paying for any type of advantage in game? 
---
Shhhh let them rage while I grind xp. 
---
Ha! Have you killed a deathclaw in a single shot? 
---
I already spent $80 on a game you can get now for $25-30, lol.
---
Yep this guy deserves an advantage. 😂😂
---
LOL
---
Well usually knowing what people want give's an idea of how a community feels, emotion might not be logical to a certain extent it creates an understanding of what people want on differentiating opinions depending on what you value. If you have a business and you cannot interrupt what people actually want the chance's of you actually succeeding tank drastically.  
---
I just want to create clear information on how people feel or think and polls are great at this because they show what people actually desire.  
---
&lt;Insert Ben Shapiro fact meme&gt;
---
The Nuka cola lamp from FO 3
---
First off I said New content is cool I'll pay for that. I stopped reading there because you failed to read my post. Good job dumbass
---
Bum.
---
We know they'll either be sold for atoms, or obtained from difficult content. And yes it can help quality of play for people, so why lock it behind either a paywall or endgame content? And I don't know why you're getting so condescending, I'm not even hating on the devs? I'm simply saying this is a bad sign, agree with it or not
---
It is a legacy item.  No longer drops.  No one would vendor it. 
---
Let me start by saying I love the game and have 500+ hours.
---
But....

They should have released the original version with more than 40 hours of content. And they should have had better server stability at launch. This game just feels so....rushed. There was only a handful of beta test. It should have been longer. We are still experiencing issues that should have been addressed in beta. Some of us are still having the same issues we had in beta. 
---
Yea I get it, they need funding. That's all fine and dandy but I shouldn't have to spend my money to get an advantage in the game. Maybe go sell chocolate bars outside the local convenience store
---
What about minigames that support multiple players. You first need to buy the Robco brand  Linketron cable. Heck, only one person would need to buy the cable for two people to connect their poop-boys.
---
This is probably the only thing I would spend real money on.
---
Perhaps a more direct way for the company to make money would be to release a better game.
---
No idea. I've been asking around, really, I'd love to see any 3 star Teslas. I lost an X-01 Calibrated shock the exact same way a week prior and the money for it.
---
Managed to get one from TurdFergusonn at The Powerhaus to replace it.

If it is behind a paywall for you (I do research, so I get a lot of this for free) Fallout76 is 2.5 million versus Fallout 4's 15 million (as of February 2019).  Granted, fallout 4 has been out of a lot longer, but even November sales were less than 4's in its first month out.
---
Because with opinions like his that people just let shit slide is going to ruin video games. Then we won't even have them.
---
MTX has been and will continually get worse unless we as gamers fight.
---
No have an upvote. What you're saying makes total sense.
---
Right and I'm fine with that. I'm not fine with being able to pay money for them.
---
The kind of fan that loves a game enough to want it to continue.
---
Its either this or subscriptions for long term development, take your pick.
---
Idk why you are surprised a business is trying to make money . They had a horrible release that resulted in the game being 50%+ off with 2 weeks of release . They are also trying to producing new content for a game that is free to play . You are dumb if you think crying on reddit will change this 
---
I'd be ok if it was a plan difficult to find or you had to farm quite a bit of stuff to build it since well, in "reality", it would make sense. But yea not in the ATOM shop.
---
So far they haven't been like that, nothing in the ATOM shop is essential to the game. I trust they won't do that.  
---
But pleeease give me some more hairstyles! The pseudo shoulder length I have right now doesn't look like me! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO ROLEPLAY. :p
---
What did u lay down first to lay the balloons down?
---
I found Ruby Ruins in a random magazine spawn.
---
That's the point I was trying to make in the first place.
---
But I do think they have that economics person, and they're crunching the numbers, and they are also Wrong.
---
that last sentence is usually the crux for p2w games. sure you can do it if you wait/grind but if you pay money you dont have to.
---
but as other people have pointed out the wording seems more like you are buying a repair kit itself with atoms, a single use item, not a plan. 
---
Basic repair kits are atom shop, which repair 100%.  Advanced are in game drops which fix 150%.  If you're gonna be outraged, get the facts straight first.
---
Agreed. End of the day we all take a knee for RNG. Finding for buying. 
---
&gt;Yeah. But they gotta keep the shareholders happy somehow.
---
tbh I can't blame her. She's not the decider in chief and hell maybe this decision was even above Todd's head. Maybe not. I don't know. Maybe they didn't even think it was going to be a big deal at all. (Of course this was just a huge slap in the face after finding out the much anticipated player vending was getting delayed _at least_ a month.)
---
Regardless I don't think we'll see her/them/anyone until after we get the patch notes for the April 9 Shear Terror DLC and even then I think it's gonna be short and sweet and they'll probably ignore anything repair kit oriented and maybe make some tongue-in-cheek remark about the player vending delay. 
---
Quite honestly all game companies do something their “player base” don’t like and in the end a lot of the player base actually ends up liking it. Bethesda May have made a promise for cosmetic only items in the atom store however it is their game and they are the ones calling the shots not you, not me, no one but them course that’s how it’s always been with gaming companies you may not want to buy atoms but there are people with a butt load of cash who may and I believe this is aimed at those players not the ones who can’t afford to buy atoms which is freaking expensive and yes I do believe they will lose even more players for breaking a verbal promise I mean come on today a mans word don’t mean shit way back in the old days a mans word was his bond but not anymore and Bethesda ain’t no different they have broken many promises of you recall the power armor edition debacle? Let’s hope they actually listen to their player base if they don’t then you know they give 2 shits about any of us plain and simple

I quit, then I came back. Now I'm quitting, then I'll come back.
---
Waaaaaaah!
---
Shut up.
---
I love this suggestion
---
I came for the god powers and robot porn.  In fact, forget the god powers.
---
I agree with you for the most part, my concern is for those that have issues that preclude them from being able to consistently make rational decisions in regards to these kinds of purchases. They are an incredibly small number, most people are indeed core gamers with a pretty good idea of their value return, but these tactics take advantage of them.
---
Lead = Lucky Hole Mine, near Fort Defiance.
---
I made my own ranger armor with the 
---
Western duster and the enclave woodland mask
---
&gt;They should have released the original version with more than 40 hours of content.
---
How dare they only 40 hours with more to come those bastards!! I am outraged!! /s
---
Human sacrifice! Dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!
---
Well that is me, I’m usually super bored unless I’m playing with a buddy of mine 
---
"How good is feel"
---
Do you even english?
---
So start implementing pay to win features?
---
This thread is a really good example of how on-the-leash Bethesda has you kids. When they add perk cards for atoms next year at least I won't be wasting my time with a company that feels literally 0 towards its playerbase besides profit 
---
I threw them 20 bucks when Biv was released, probably will again in a week or two.
---
Who cares, the game is fun. That's all you should care about, now shut up.
---
Oh it is
---
Yep.  "You don't understand them like we do."  "They promised they'd change."  "We deserve it."
---
Easy. Playing minigames awards you a new double-virtual currency you can exchange for Todd Howard to come and twink you personally in game.
---
Tip:scrapping flamers gives like 100 ammo
---
It’s mind blowing these kids are crying about this . They are making the game less annoying . Upkeep is what I hate about 76 and they are fixing that for me . Cry more kiddos 
---
It is a bad sign, and together we can kill this beast.  You got your pitchfork mods ready?
---
I explained why I got condescending.  People raging like this might kill a game on the edge.  Over repair kits that we don't even know how they will play out.
---
You say you've seen the slippery slope before, and I've explained how I've seen player hate kill good online games before.
---
But hey... is the new Miami mod out yet?  I could always load that up and go back to single player if the pitchfork crowd gets their wish.  New Dawn looks like a dumpster fire.
---
Roman centurion paint would be bad ass
---
He’s clearly ‘woke’. Maybe we should listen to this ❄️. 
---
Or not. 🤷🏻‍♂️😁
---
Glad you were able to get your 6 karma without addressing the literal exact statement of them adding it
---
I'd argue it's a bit more than just convenience.  You get better DR/DMG based on item durability.  
---
sure, repairing an item to 100% isn't a game changing advantage but if it grants any in game benefit it's a bad precedent.  How long until a swath of additional "minor" advantages are granted via atom shop items?  
---
The inside the vault mentions refrigerators and ammo conversion in the same breath as the repair kits.  They don't come out and say it but what if the player base acquiesce to this repair kit/atom shop idea and the next thing is paying atoms to convert ammo?  Then after that it's paying atoms to refrigerate food making it last longer?    
---
Keep on down that road long enough and eventually the game starts to become pay to win.  I'd rather the atom shop remains cosmetics only but hey, ymmv :)
---
It is a good question, but my money is on the latter. I have a bunch of friends playing 76 and none of them reported having issues with food spoiling so fast, even though I did.
---
Have any of the community managers even responded to the huge amount criticisms in the last day?
---
It would be nice if there were a lot more cosmetic items worth buying; that's the real reason I am not spending money on the game. 
---
The current selection is quite poor. There really should be skins and paints for every weapon, armor, and power armor in the game, and a whole lot more. How about any of the hundreds or thousands of building parts and other items from Fallout 4 that aren't available? Put it all up there. 
---
I can't find anything to spend my free atoms on, so that precludes buying additional atoms.
---
make it a skin for pistols and sure
---
I wouldn't want to grind a new character to level 50 that often. I think if this exploit was used it wouldn't be very often.
---
I've played 3, NV, 4. I've also played 1 &amp; 2 but never beat them, so I dunno if that counts. 
---
I’m sorry but you are the second person on here to say that the game is tedious and it’s impossible for you to find things. (The other person was talking about their lack of screws) and you speak of lack of Stims, they are not hard to find at all, I constantly have 50 on me and keep another 50 in my stash at all times, excessive I just drop at the overseers camp outside Vault 76.  It seems like you are just bad at the game...sorry don’t let a virtual item in a online shop ruin your life 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I'm glad I got my refund for preordering this crap.  I keep checking to see if things are getting better, but it appears not.
---
Then they should have said this at the start. I bought the game because of promised free updates an cosmetic only shop. The Content on release was a complete Joke. Releasing an unfinished mess of a game is already bad, but monetize this mess even more, well thats just shit.
---
I have a small business myself, and if i would treat my customers like this, i could declare bankrupcy within a month
---
Also Bethesda has tons of Money from re releasing Skyrim, which made a lot of cash took barely any work.
---
XXTwat-Puncher69XX since in game names dont display only gamertags
---
Press 'F' to pay respects.
---
\*presses F\*
---
I’m betting on the lazy part. Can’t find that god roll item? Buy it. Can’t spend 30 minutes grinding but can spend that time transferring 10,000 caps and items to your mule. But you still need more time? Seems like 1st world problems to me. 
---
Only place I see repair kits being the biggest need is in Survival Mode. Where only 4 presses of a button can get you back into the fight. 
---
This day extracts a heavy toll, still he accomplished his mission.
---
I've never had a weapon break in PvP, but then maybe I'm just good enough it's not a problem for me. And I have tons of ultracite plans, they aren't rare. Skill &gt; gear in all but the most extreme examples.
---
What does this have to do with me? I'm not raging?
---
They balanced 308 crafting around hunting rifles, then later in development were just like "yeah that gun can just use that ammo"
---
Yes, totally what I am saying.  Thank you.
---
They said free dlc so people gonna start bitching when Bethesda actually charge for contents.
---
What kinda pisses me off is that people don't want to pay an extra dime but they want loads of content, want changes to the game and new features, new skins, better servers and so on and on and on. Just search for 'Dear Bethesda' posts in this subreddit and you will find hundreds thousands of them, along with 'fuk you devs' posts
---
This subreddit is very demanding without showing any support for developers. They say good things about CR guys that show up and communicate, but never about actual developers. Yeah I know they done fuked it up at launch, but that don't mean you get to milk them forever
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
So, your base is hidden inside map geometry and unreachable by the average player?
---
YTA
---
Do you also enjoy offloading you caps onto a mule so nobody gets a reward for killing you in survival? I bet nobody liked playing with you as a child.
---
Charlie is west of R&amp;G station on the west side of the mountains. 
---
Some people don’t care about that fact. People aren’t here to min-max everything and have all the cool things. 
---
Yeah they totally betrayed you . I suggest you uninstall and quit playing it asap so they know your serious 
---
Yeah I am a little bummed here. I am genuinely afraid that this idea will get shot down because of the backlash over the repair kits.
---
Honestly I think this olidea would make them more money.
---
I need an eyepatch. 
---
But you still use like 100 in 2 seconds.
---
Players just need to micro manage their weapons condition. I always make sure both my primary and back up are at max condition before heading out into appalachia. I also check it after a killing a few dozen enemies. I imagine that this would be more important in survival.  
---
Why so serious? Weirdo 
---
So nice to see people who don't see New Vegas as the pinnacle of the franchise haha.    I have nothing against the game, for the record, had fun with it even.  I've just enjoyed all the Fallout games up to now, with 76 being something of a mixed bag for me.
---
In reality yes, so it makes little sense it being used in the MG42, it would rip it apart.
---
This will help revenue to keep updating and adding new content 
---
I would love a teddy bear armor.
---
To be fair I'm not sure anyone can tell what your point is.
---
Yeah its more a thing for survival mode, i havent done survival mode tho, i think its not rly the fallout experience.. 
---
I like it!
---
I don't think they should go that route, but at least clothing up to like 70s fashion where they're starting to be a little bit more understanding with bodies shapes and whatnot, instead of keeping the fashion from the 20s to 40s. if they're going to add music from the. They might as well add some clothing from it as well, some more loose-fitting clothes with more artsy designs and looks.
---
I mean, Path of Exile demanded cat projectiles and GGG just reused the existing cat pet artwork like everyone asked for. And people bought it for $15.
---
If Bethesda wised up, they would just have to sell the existing Raider assets as an Atom shop only CAMP asset and rake in a bunch of cash.
---
Hell, sell them individually or as a bundle. Release a related questline and/or dungeon at the same time that gave enough Atoms to buy a few Raider prop for that first hit, but not enough for something big like walls or fences, just like small heads on spikes.
---
Do the same for BoS, Responders, etc. Expand content and release related cosmetics at the same time. It extends user retention and pulls in money.
---
What is you talking about? Of course they hear us. We don't need no confirmation from them to figure that out
---
This, the silence is just providing a void to read the worst into.
---
You are a shining example of a reactionary idiot.
---
Same issue. 
---
Yes I saw those too. They are cargobots. Maybe dropping gifts for the tree?
---
I've played them all.  Even tactics.  All fun games.  Significant changes of course but I enjoyed them all for what they are.  
---
I've been itching to go replay 1 and then 2 but I have things to do in FO76.  And add in a baby it's lucky I can play at all some nights.
---
40 hours is nothing. I have more hours than that logged in pacman
---
It almost looks like the damn breaking caused most of the mayhem in Charleston. Probably saw some large scale battles there as well.
---
I bet you didn’t feel the need to repair your gear on the fly did you?  I jest, lol. What’s the smashed challenge? I haven’t bothered with it yet. 
---
So when I beat the pants off people using kits because I invested a bit of time into preparing my gear, they had an advantage? This is QoL for players with less time but more money, not pay to win.
---
I do that too, just be prepared when you go wander around.  Have some back up gear with u just in case.. 
---
&gt;A potion increasing leveling by 10% isn't p2w either
---
yes it is and your opinion is inherently flawed 
---
Why the fuck should they refund a game months after release?
---
Hint: They shouldn't
---
Love me some iguana bits. Mmmm, tastes so familiar
---
Yeah I had the herbivore mutation. I was eating molerat chunks and it wasn’t doing anything to help my hunger. I looked and it said you can’t eat meat with the herbivore mutation. RadAwayed that shit so fast. 
---
I didn't know that was a thing! That's a cool detail.
---
He started out in Skyrim, drinking and bodyslamming people everywhere.
---
Haha no no just a name. First name that popped in my head and was cool. I've given out 90 purified water to low levels in the past couple days. Usually I wear suspenders and slacks with a bowler hat. But atm I'm wearing the western duster with the black cowboy hat and gas mask w/ goggles.
---
When it comes to the Ghostbusters I never joke around. I saw what happened to the twinkie.

Never again.

Hi my name is Roger.  I don't have a last name on account of not really having any family I can remember.  I was just a teen when the bombs fell and I've spent the years since traveling all over Appalachia learning about buying and selling, learning about pre-war building and design, fighting when I have to, and protecting my own including friends I've met along the way as well as the goods I've managed to squirrel away over the years.  After years of studying design, I built my own design center pop-up shop "Daily Designs."  After hearing about folks coming out of the vault I knew that they'd need help in getting some new housing and also long for the pre-war design and comfort they knew before they went in.  I have painstakingly built and rebuilt my shop around Appalachia offering both design plans and also my building and design services to any vault dwellers looking to build a more comfortable life.  I offer a glimpse of this posh life in the room layouts at Daily Designs, but of course will travel to any CAMP site/homestead to offer in home estimates and services.  Currently I'm set up close to the overseers CAMP in the forest just near the river.  Don't let my grimy suit fool you, I take my work very seriously and always welcome anyone to stop by even if you just need a spot a fully kitted workshop for specing weapons and armor.  Just to be transparent I am not a licensed electrician so if you have complicated electrical needs I suggest hiring an additional professional.  I can provide electrical equipment as needed though.
---
Pet licence, pay per-month and get a pet companion.
---
Now that’s actually funny. 
---
I hate to tell you, but you do sound alarmist. But I still value your opinion.
---
They're community managers for a reason :/
---
are you a troll or just fucking dumb?  skill won't prevent your weapon from degrading, and if skill was better than gear why are P2W gear items always frowned upon?  like the NX Shadowclaw from Black Ops 3, or the Oppressor MkII in GTaO...  gear can and will allow a shitty player to play better, your skill has nothing to do with that.  as to the Ultracite plans, I spent the past few days hunting Scorchbeasts for VATS crits, I killed about 20 Scorchbeasts and only got 2 plans, yes they are rare.
---
Dude you're literally defining pay to win 
---
If you actually read it, then you would know I was asking for opinions about the direction Bethesda is taking 76. I don't need your shitty attitude. If you just want to be a dick, then do it somewhere else
---
You cannot "reverse this change" as you stated. If bathesda has already announced it, its happening.. doesn't matter how many people bitch and moan about it in forums.
---
Seriously, yes. If everything was like $1 each i'd buy them all. As it is, I just don’t buy anything. 20 bucks for 20 items, hell yeah! 20 buck for 3 items? No way. Now you get zero.
---
Hahahahaha you guys should just all get your money together and buy Bethesda and do ehat yhe hell you want with it.
---
By 'wonders' you mean riot
---
It's probably this, or cut funding to the bug fix, expansion, and DLC projects.   
---
The game BOMBED. It's a failure. You might like it (hell, I reinstalled and am not hating it now) but it was a dumpster fire. Bethesda's investors are not going to want to see another dime put into a game that won't make them any more money.   
---
So to keep the lights on and people paid, they have to monetize. But they done fucked up didn't they when they promised it wouldn't be pay to win, and the DLC would be free. Now any attempt to bring in more revenue will result in backlash from the faithful playerbase that didn't abandon them.   
---
I would be surprised to see 76 make it to the fall and the Wastelanders DLC. 
---
Looks like we found your buddy, OP.
---
Ok, there's one who still sounds like more of a "don't care" vs at the very least the entire two or three pages on this sub. Anyone else? Anyone who LIKES that this is on the shop and wouldn't rather it be in the game? 
---
I would argue itd be the funniest thing ever. Like those people who built minecraft in minecraft.
---
Same with a porta-potty. I held off an attacker by opening and closing the shitter door between their reloads.  
---
Also a great way to stop those fast moving little PvP builds from circling around you. Come say that to my face, ya bouncy little shit. I gotta hammer with your name on it.
---
Neither have I.  But you don’t have to bite the donut to know it’s sweet. The idea is sound. The ones in NV were great. Granted you could repair on the fly with like guns with the right perk. 
---
If at the very least just knock the amount we are to get down to like 15-25% on the basic kit. And bump the advanced ones to 250% and make them more rare. 
---
Once I learned about the repair kits I took FO76 out of my PS4, packed it back up in the Collector's Edition box, and put it in storage in my closet.
---
I'll come back when they make good on their promise of cosmetic only microtransactions.
---
Until then? I've gotten my money's worth out of it, so I'm happy.
---
No, just that acknowledging what people are saying in any kind of relationship helps ease tension. If anything, it helps prevent falling outs.
---
Then maybe everyone needs to stop being a reactionary idiot...
---
We won't have video games? WTF are you smoking. At the end of the day, they're luxury entertainment goods and there are millions of them. You aren't entitled to everything they make for the game for free because you paid a one time fee months ago. The game isn't going pay to win. These repair kits aren't going to affect the game in the slightest or your ability to enjoy it. You are making the game less enjoyable for yourself because you can't see past your own bullshit expectations and flights of paranoid fancy. Take off the tin foil hat and grow up.
---
I've been thinking about replaying NV, I only played half through it the first time and got bored. After reading how many people enjoyed it I'm rethinking putting the time in.
---
Am i the only one who read the word "unlockable" in the sentence about repair kits? every single other "unlockable" item in the atom shop is a in-game craftable item. you only pay atoms to unlock the blueprint.  
---
Have we actually read a single word that says otherwise? Or for that matter even confirms you have to buy each repair kit individually with atoms? As far as it seems, it's just another unlockable.
---
&gt;Advanced repair kits will repair items to 150% for the low low cost of killing the scorch beast queen among other things. They can be used anywhere, anytime and presumably the supply is only limited by the amount of strong enemies you kill. The most popular argument in support of this: "But I can repair to 200% with junk so it's ok".
---
&gt;​
---
&gt;So let's break that down:
---
&gt;To repair armor past 100% you must take "fix it good" which is available at level 27 and starts at 130% durability. The earliest you can beat 150% is level 28
---
To repair weapons past 100% requires "weapon artisan" which is available at level 40. The earliest this perk beats 150% is level 41
---
Taking either of the above perks might mean foregoing some other perk that might benefit your build more by increasing damage, defense, stealth, etc.
---
In any event repairing armor often costs rare mats like ballistic fiber and ALL repairs cost junk and require you to be standing at a workbench. Based on the info at hand advanced repair kits do not require mats.
---
&gt;Anyone using an advanced repair kit for armor before level 27, or weapons before 41 is getting a very real in game advantage because they are somehow killing SBQ at such a low level. Imagine starting a new level 2 (when you get out the vault) character with the ability to kill SBQ at will. How much faster and easier will leveling up be for the guy willing to kill the SBQ as needed?
---
If a level 2 is killing SBG enough to farm these kits, i think that is a bigger problem than the kit itself. Also most of us are like 60+ so what is the big deal. We have the perk cards to repair stuff and probably 20 extra level points we sitting on. I know i sure as hell do.
---
Assuming the game last that long. 
---
Sound alarmist? They are literally spitting in your face with this non-cosmetic shit in atom store. 
---
There was a promise. They broke it. They can go to hell. 
---
in reality the MG42 is chambered in 7.62 NATO, which is almost exactly the same round as a .308
---
Actually, when I said "no one's RPing a raider" i meant just what I say. I mean, not "No one", but the VAST majority of griefers I see who call  themselves raiders have absolutely no RP elements to their schtic at all, it's walk up to someone, (and before the last few patches) abuse bugs in slap damage to kill them. Or walk up to their camp and smash it.  Or as soon as they see a claimed workshop, travel over and kill the person, and then hop servers so they can't be killed. 
---
And yeah, it's frustrating, because it's legitimately problematic that we as a "broader society" are embracing this form of behavior. How you treat people in a video games is, as you point out, a broader part of your basic self. 
---
I sort of agree. Any time someone gets this angry over a game, maybe it's time to go outside.
---
That being said, if Beth doesn't hear what we want, they'll never know what we want. They have every right to make the game they want, but if they make the game we want, we'll be a lot more likely to continue to give them our money. 
---
Slight correction
---
&gt;you are asking to pay just to skip ~~playing~~ replaying chunks of the game
---
Basically, I've already done everything twice for my two &gt;50 characters. I kind of want more but the grind is potentially discouraging.
---
Which in itself is just a symptom not the actual root cause.
---
The thing I'm trying to achieve: Have separate builds ready to go, so I could easily swap from a melee character who uses power armor to a stealth rifle character with weightless armor to a super heavily mutated explosive heavy weapon character.
---
Easiest way of doing that: Get several characters all to max level in order to try those builds.
---
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
Basically I just used those examples because they were in the theme of the thread for things from the atom store.
---
But another solution to the same problem would be a "SPECIAL and perk reset" chem or something you could buy for atoms, that effectively refunded all of your points from level-ups. The only difference being in that scenario, you would then only have one build available, vs multiple max level characters where you'd have multiple viable builds to use interchangeably. 
---
For the love of god, eat and drink.
---
Probably cause eso is doing it plus you get repair kits from events. This actually read doesn’t bother me I just won’t buy it 
---
I think they are more good than a pay to win advantage.
---
Plenty of games have been given out free over the years.  Ever isn’t an issue.  But if it goes f2p before the next fallout series game I’m sure it will rustle feathers.   
---
That doesn't mean they're at our beck-and-call.
---
This sub needs to stop pretending to be the fucking Fallout76 Lorax that speaks for the entire playerbase "and if they don't listen to us then fuck 'em."
---
Getting real old
---
Granted.
---
Golf all day every day
---
Give me a matte black paint job for power armor and I'll give you my left kidney.
---
Love the fence around the razor grain field. Real “put together” look
---
Holy shit you literally have no argument, you just wanna sit down and take whatever they give you like a little bitch as if you dont care about what happens to the game you payed money for 
---
Or maybe they are shopping resumes.  Great time to look for a new job.
---
Who gives a 💩
---
Exactly, her job is to eat the shit sandwiches with a smile and pass on reports. I doubt they even get much of a debrief on the updates before they drop, and when things are this acute, yeah better to lay low and lurk
---
Yes I built one across the whole river once. It’s was nice. Kinda like a dam. 
---
Started with Fallout 3, then New Vegas, and bought FO4 on launch. I’ve recently gone back and played 1 and 2 and I love them dearly.
---
Hey watch the insults, I don't want anyone getting banned, but I will report such behaviour.
---
There's a huge difference between better guns and slightly more convenient repair. It's not like repairing gear is hard or takes much time. As for the plans, you on pc? If so I've got extras.
---
So many people have abandonment issues. Just be patient.

---
Don't mention it
---
&gt;Haha you got botted lol 
---
Well those mobile links are blight for desktop users... 🙄
---
&gt;This would just be the first one to offer an "advantage" well sort of that is. 
---
I think you hit nail on the head with that. A lot of people feel betrayed, because Bethesda  said they never add anything like that, even if it is only 'sort of'.
---

---
&gt;that same logic would then apply to the unstoppables gear
---
Sure, that's how logic works. However, there are so many 'buts' with the unstoppables gear. Limited time, 4 people team, the in game earnable outfit (mistress of mysteries) doesn't allow armor under it and that all just  for measly 60 HP. Yeah, some people still called it p2w and others think it was just Bethesda testing the waters. But with repair kits, there is now tangible advantage.
---
Vladof! You don't need a bigger gun, you just need more bullets!
---
Suspenders and slacks with a bowler hat is exactly how I pictured him!
---
I don’t believe I’ve ever heard of the star boy. What is it?
---
So you're totally okay with them adding it and don't feel the slightest bit ripped off despite their promise to never add this type of item? 
---
Blind consumerism at its finest 
---
You said you have 500 hours in this? 
---
On one hand I wish I had thad kind of time for this game on the other hand I'm glad I don't.
---
I'm just saying lots of games release with 20hr or less storylines. 40 hours isn't bad considering they are still adding new content and modes.
---
They could at least say that they hear us. Silence doesn’t stop anything. I’d rather have a CM make a post or tweet or something good or bad than to not do anything. At least then waiting and seeing is warranted. 
---
the pr reps on the sub have literally no input on the upper management and monetisation decisions.
---
Spamming them does nothing.
---
To be honest Bethesda is kind of a sinking ship at this point. I hope Tom Howard looses his job and they do some much needed restructuring. I'm fine with Paying $60 for a game that works properly, followed by a few subsequent fairly priced DLCs. I've been here for 10 years.
---
But I will not support a company who lied to their community and released a half-assed game, promise to make it right only lie to their faces about a no pay-to-play policy. 
---
I would be kind of ashamed. This kind of release for a AAA title, people spending their hard earned money with only a few promises to rectify the situation. THen, they pull this shit? 
---
This is a test guys. What they're doing is starting with something like this and if we give them an inch they will take a mile. Trust me, they know what their doing. That's why they aren't saying shit right now.
---
They send out emails when people are banned, with an explanation of why.  You're telling me they sent you no email, or are you saying you disagree with what they found?
---
You are completely missing the whole point if this arguement dude. Its not that the advantage your paying for is big small or in between the problem is it exists after we were told it wouldnt. 20 caps in chump change but it is still an advantage someone is paying real world money to obtain in the game. Lets say im some 12 year old with moms platinum card and i can buy 1 of those per day for the next month. If it ONLY saves 20 caps per day which is only about half the map of a fast travel that player will have an extra 600 caps that they would have spent of fast travel to repair broken weapons. Meaning i would have paid real world money to get an advantage over someone who didnt. Thats p2w.
---
So i guess keep being you my dude, i get it man everyone is a "shitty player" besides you unless they do as you do. I played cod 5 years ago too i understand the ape like mindset your stuck in. Try to grow up and see the big picture a little though.

Worse for me, speed demon. My hunger is red every 10 minutes.
---
I played them all. Obligatory NV is my fav comment!
---
Rest in piece, my friends.
---
Sounds good when do you play?
---
I would hope they're waiting until some of the vitriol and more over the top reactions calm down a bit (today's already a bit better than yesterday). "We hear you" right now might just lead to tempers flaring out of control again. I mean, you actually had a poster today accusing Bethesda of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act today because of some lousy repair kits! 
---
I'm not saying people shouldn't feel strongly about the issue, but deep breaths right now are more important than a confirmation that they are actually reading things in this sub (of course they are, but give them some more time to ingest it).
---
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
---
Damn, that does sound really relaxing. I need to do that some time.
---
So you'll buy me an atom exclusive rifle when that comes out?
---
We complain now for the inconsequential utility stuff so that they know to never try adding non-cosmetics to the store again
---
Considering that Todd Howard said that they spend a lot of time looking at the reddit and that more than a few people made very popular posts condemning the Repair Kits, it seems more than reasonable to *ask* one of the community managers give a nod of acknowledgement to what has been said. Nothing else; just an acknowledgement.
---
They don't have to, nor will I think ill of them if they don't (they're very busy for all I know). Rather, I think it'd be a good idea to spend a minute or two making a single "We hear you" post, all things considered.
---
slightly more convenient?  how is repairing an item to 150% only slightly more convenient than ranking up a perk card, hunting down mats, and then traveling to a bench?  I'd say it's about as friggin (better?) convenient as it gets...  
---
I don't want your charity bub, thanks...
---
Indeed, my friend

Haha well in that case, closer than I thought :P

Take my upvote to go back to -1

Ooh I knew about the asylum worker uniform cuss a irl buddy found one. Didn't know about the bathrobe, thanks.

Let's both talk about something neither of us know anything about then.
---
&gt;I abandoned 76 at launch because it was unplayable. 
---
It was never unplayable
---
&gt;Now I'm abandoning this game again
---
Cya
---
&gt;They want money and only money
---
You mean like a company? Can't feed families and produce games on good fee fees and "exposure"
---
&gt; It doesn't matter if they lose their entire Fallout fanbase
---
They aren't and they won't
---
&gt; kill all the lore that has been set up for years.
---
They haven't
---
&gt;I'll come back for Nuclear Winter
---
Please Don't
---
what repair bug?  I repair mine past 100% every time...
---
The devs know what they are doing. They got hired for that position. If the content/items they add are morally odd. It’s not them that made that choice it’s the boss over them that says they should do. 
---
I have my instigating Sniper rifle chambered to .50cal just because I can craft so much ammo for it...I'm saving my .308 fort when I find a decent LMG. Though, every one of them I find has been lvl 40...I've never found a level 50 LMG...
---
IMO, I htink Super Duper should stack with Ammosmith, as ut is Super duper calculates the duping before ammosmith...so instead of a solid 360 .50 rounds, you get 280 instead.
---
Let me spell it out plainly:
---
This is the double exp weekend on survival mode. I am power leveling people there in exchange for the non legendary random weapons that they receive as loot. I've done this before and it's very fast - you can get many levels quickly. Each mutie we kill will be the equivalent of a starting area quest completion (400-600 exp each), and we will be killing 30+ every 10 minutes. I am doing this because 1 - I'd be doing this anyway, but solo (but much faster solo) because I need about 20,000 steel, and 2 - I want to help others and it's fun to do a bit of role play, even if it's mostly tongue-in-cheek.
---
To add some fun, I decided to do a bit of role play with it, and yes, I plan on staying relatively in character as we do this (my account name is Knight_Wanderer after all, and I love the BoS - favorite faction by far). Because I realize that some people might feel that me getting all of their steel is a bit of a raw deal, despite the fact that they are getting power leveled for free and can keep their found legendaries, caps, ammo, etc., I decided to throw in some extra gear as a reward for sticking with me to level 25 and 50. Those aren't cheap rewards either - I'll be spending 10 or so Violet Flux for the crafted items. 1-50 should be achievable in a day. 
---
And think about it. Would the BoS do things purely out of the kindness of their heart? No, and nor will I. In this scenario, I can accomplish two goals at once - train new recruits for the BoS while also farming the steel that I need for ammo crafting more efficiently.
---
Hope that answers your questions, and I'll be going back into character.
---
They way I see it: there is a pretty big controversy going on. Since they're the community managers, asking for a simple nod of acknowledgement does not violate patience (after all, all I asked for was "We hear you," not a lengthy post detailing their response). 
---
I had an i5 7400k and an Intel HD Graphics 630 and I could run it at 60 fps. I'm having trouble running it with a GTX 1060 3gb now. Great.
---
Atom shop kits only go to 100%, the earned in game ones go to 150%. And no worries, the offer still stands.
---
This clearly is an issue. They can cap kill rewards to 50 caps but then again, that is WAY too small for a kill. 
---
You people need to stop. This shit is getting super annoying. Have you not read the god dam sub the last two days.
---
I'll grow up when you get some glasses and see where the gaming industry is heading 
---
Both, there has been no further communication. Emails, written letter, appeals, and phonecalls have turned up nothing. At the same time the thing I was accused of are not true. At this point I've accepted the 60 dollar loss. 
---
How many active players across all platforms?
---
Preach👏 
---
You might be right. I, too, hope the vitriol dies down. People do take these things too far.
---
You are missing the point - 20 caps is a piss in the bucket. Currently you need to fast travel 7 times to get your 1400 a day caps. (New update)Now you do it once since all vendors will have the same 1400 caps(minus the bunker). Your daily spending will actually be better of you truly want to make that pissy argument. Next shit argument u want to make? 
---
All my gear is at 200% through perks, I'm literally better than them and I can do it anywhere I can place my camp.
---
It's not just reddit though.
---
That’s a good point! 
---
I *have* seen folks get out of hand with mobile games (just needing those extra boosts for the stress relief) or crowdfunding projects. 
---
I’m surprised they didn’t try the cosmetic loot box method before turning to the repair kits.
---
At least someone will say it.
---
No "further communication" so there was an email to you.  What did the email say you did that you claim you didn't do? You could just paste the text as a reply if you like.
---
I'm not sure what you mean
---
I do!
---
I got caught up in doing this I forgot about virtual self care!
---
Regarding junk: Plastic, Aluminum, Screws, Steel, Acid and Lead are the main ones I can think of.
---
Other things can include: Technical Documents (or even the apparel/plans you get from turning those in) Treasure Maps, Ammo (5.56, .45, .308, and .50 cal seem to be the most popular), and aid items (stimpaks, radaway, disease cures, ect...)
---
Agreed. But it’s gonna be a pain the arse if the Burrow dlc/event is of requirement of them to bring enjoyed. 
---
omgf, regardless of how much it's repaired to, there is not a universe where you are going to convince me it isn't convenient, period.  and just the ability to get back into the fight faster is P2W.
---
and as I said before, I don't want your charity, they're probably duped anyway.
---
Or make a good game. So the playerbase grows and thus more customers buying your cosmetics. But this game fails since release thats why the sales are bad and there aint enough players to sustain free content. This game is bad thats all. OR....make the cosmetics attractive and not cost an arm and a leg. There are dozens other free games with only cosmetics as their income. But the difference is those games arent shit and have a healthy playerbase to sustain constant free content through cosmetics microtransactions. 
---
TLDR: dont make shitty games and make cosmetics attractive to buy. F76=fail
---
And now we get to enjoy a day or two of “quit complaining about the repair kits already!” Posts. 
---
Most people are acting like RK's will give a unfair advantage in PvP when they will never be a viable option. 
---
I stated in my original post this goes against what Beth said. So you're not giving me any news there. 
---
If using a repair kit will get you killed it's not pay-to-win it's paid to lose
---
I'll be starting this evening sometime, in about 3-4 hours. I'll add you in game.
---
That's some fancy wallpaper you got there. 
---
Slowly incorporating P2W yay...
---
I wish I didnt have that time either. However current (but temporary) medical issues have allowed me that time. 
---
20 hours or less? Like what CoD? 🤣
---
Hell, took me close to a year to finish the story in fo4. 
---
I'm not saying it's a terrible game with nothing to do. I (and I'm not alone) am saying there was a lack of content upon release. 
---
Maybe he lost his binkie
---
I try to shy away from name calling just because it gets people riled up and distracts from the meaning of what I try to say. 
---
That being said anyone equating video game news to being spit in the face is obviously not someone who has had actual hard times in their lives, or at the least they have a fragile psyche. Which seems to be what you were implying. 👍
---
Peace &amp; Love everyone. We’re all humans. 
---
Nothing. I was just able to put the balloons down on the ground. They're the Fasnacht balloons found in floor decorations I believe you have to scroll
---
That’s the part that sucks. They have all this content and item pools to pull from Fo1,2,3,4 NV, tactics and even can make some to fit the lore. But haven’t. 
---
They already will be.  Challenges give atoms, with which you buy repair kits.
---
You gotta use the computer again on the 4th floor. happened to me as well
---
not to mention shit all over future games.
---
It was unplayable at launch. I literally lost frames when I sprinted.
---
They did kill the lore because supermutants, the brotherhood, and caps would not be things 20 years after in the east. Please read up on fallout lore.
---
They are losing a fanbase because the game sold poorly even if Todd lies about it doing good because we can see how poorly it sold.
---
And if you don't want more players, then what is wrong with you? I've been playing Fallout games since Fallout 1. I've loved all of them, and I don't want to see this franchise killed by greed. You need to criticize in order to make games succeed instead of sucking Todd's dick at every wrong turn.
---
So basically no perks affect it except damage based perks. That’s very odd. 
---
No, they **were** doing a good job of turning the game around.
---
They've undone all of that now. Even if they come out and say they hear us and there will be no repair kits on the store. They've already WRITTEN IT and said they thought about it.
---
For the masses that already want more excuses to hate the game. That's more than enough. They've undone all of the positives they've put out over the months.
---
Lol true 
---
I agree and disagree. They would have to upgrade their servers by a lot to be able to handle processing multi character stash boxes, which we’ve all learned is a bad idea to have that amount of processing going on. It would probably put us back in the days of blue screening endless times a day or more server disconnects.
---
I’m thinking a limited storage box that can be placed in your camp so a friend can transfer items. The other option would be is maybe a banker vendor that you can purchase timed storage space that is also limited that links to all characters on your account. So it’s not processing anything on the server that isn’t already there but still allowing you to transfer a fair amount of junk, ammo, armor or weapons.
---
Hopefully they will continue on server stability fixes or just give in and purchase quality servers to start with. I’m thankful that we can play the game now but now that we can play, we have to consider mules because not every item is a vendor item. Even though tons of people want to complain about drop rates and drop quality. 
---
For people saying they need to do this to continue giving us free content.......that means your game is not good enough/low playerbase to sustain free conent.
---
Shit game means low playerbase.  This game fails since release thats  why the sales are bad and there aint enough players to sustain free  content. This game is bad thats all. OR....make the cosmetics attractive  and not cost an arm and a leg. There are dozens other free games with  only cosmetics as their income. But the difference is those games arent  shit and have a healthy playerbase to sustain constant free content  through cosmetics microtransactions.
---
Same, though the Bomber Jacket  in game is still pretty awesome. I wish it had the BoS insignia on it somewhere.
---
We need proof of this, nobody I’ve ever asked about this has been able to repair it last 100% and it’s a known bug. 
---
I too thought they may have been duped. I usually carry around 100 stimpaks radaway/x in adventure. 300 psychobuffs are a crap ton 
---
Just to. clarify I'm against the idea of repair kitsch in the atom shop just the abundance of posts about it is kind of annoying
---
You need to literally go play in traffic
---
the only people who point out "fallacies" are undergrads that just took their first philosophy class or think they are part of the anointed.

well I mean, not longer are they a niche market, the old days of games and game development are behind us and like everything else that becomes big, the corporate fuck show fucks the life out of it then fucks it some more, because all the money is the world isnt enough, and also fuck paying devs and treating them like human beings.
---
The one item I'm constantly buying from vendors is bulk ballistic fiber. Undercut their price and I'll be your customer.
---
Actually, I've stated multiple times that they do have opinions, and generally do a pretty good job of separating opinion from fact. At least, the one's I watch. Maybe there are some out there that aren't? 
---
But points in order. I like this, it helps a lot, thank you! (no seriously I wish people would use bullet points more often around here). 
---
1) That's completely unlike any BETA i've participated in.  Maybe there's a change in trends? Can you think of any games off hand I should look at that had a "beta" that was a couple of 2-6 hour long windows?  
---
2) It's not "what type of bag" that's the issue, it's that they advertised one material, and then substituted a completely different product, without warning, or purchaser permission. This is, legally, fraud, which is a criminal act.   And the difference in produced material is actually significantly more than .50c, and it's a HELL of a lot more than .50c when you consider the broader spectrum of all the cases?(on the CPR front, we're actually in agreement, I fucking _hate_ that company, and I tend to not buy their product on principal). Your example is a "mistake". Someone grabbed the wrong roll, it happens. This was a conscious decision to improve the profitability of their product after the fact. The two aren't comparable.   Also, that wasn't the only illegal act by bethesda. 
---
3) I'll be honest, I'm just gonna step back from this one, because you're right, he fucked up in a pretty serious way. But "backpedling hard" equates to "owning his mistake". He doesn't like the game, and I've stopped watching his content, over-all.  Because yeah, he's annoying as fuck. He doesn't like the game, he never will, so yes, as a token example of "people who just hate cover the game" I'm sure he'd fit nicely.  But that doesn't reflect the broader youtube community, it's one individual. That would be like judging everyone on this subreddit based on _me_ and that wouldn't be fair at ALL to ya'll. 
---
4) I'm not familiar with that channel, but see "judging the entire community based on one user".  But if he's honest about it, if he's stating that's what he's doing in his videos, at least he's providing disclosure. 
---
5) And I shouldn't have to _repeatedly_ state that "not every youtuber is an example of a broader whole, and of course they are making a fucking profit, this is what they are doing for a living, but the VAST majority of fallout youtubers that I watch cover positive as well as negative sides of the game".  And yet here we are. 
---
My entire point is, you're (and lets be real, a shitload of other folks around here) slinging a _shitload_ of mud at youtubers as a whole, because of their negative coverage of a game. Yet you're not looking at the _fucking reality_ that the game _deserves_ negative coverage. If the company was putting out positive improvement after positive improvement with nothing seriously bad to say, we'd get more positive coverage.  
---
You're stating that youtubers (not specific individuals, but the entire job lot of individuals) should be held accountable for their actions, when what they're doing is trying to hold the _fucking game company_ responsible for theirs. Yes, they profit off this, that's their job. 
---
But if Bethesda didn't keep _fucking up_ in major ways, they wouldn't have the ammunition to put out these videos. 
---
We both know exactly what it said, I'm not sure what angle you are getting at. Everyone banned in that wave was accused of duping and that was of course the insinuation made by the email. According to that email it was in excess of "100,000"  items. 
---
That’s all I’m hearing too, and I for some reason keep picturing a certain SJW during a certain inauguration 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I have a whole lot of extra plans and aid other than stimpaks and disease cures.
---
You nailed how i feel about the game, i was waiting for all the content to drop and restart playing this fall but if they go through with the pay 2 win/pay 2 convenience stuff im out.
---
Same here. Xbox one. My food spoils pretty much the same. Think they could have even tweaked the values of some things, and I'm sure everyone is using different food for their playstyles, so it makes sense if some people experience it and others don't. Or it's a bug. Hard to tell exactly, but so long as fridges are something you can just make without buying them from the store, I'm fine with whatever. 
---
Sorry to hear about your medical issues I meant no disrespect with my comment
---
ahem, I believe you meant to call them "content creators.." aheeemmmmm \^lubes up fist
---
That would be fucking awesome.
---
Plans around that location are random. I farm it every day and I get all kinds of plans from spawns around Pleasant Valley.
---
Ah, the classic response when you just got shit on. One day you will think of an original response. Comment when you do bud 🤙
---
If it improves the game experience I am all for it.  People find a reason to complain about everything.
---
Yeah, so don't do that.  Might want to find another game then, and don't take advantage of exploits in those in the future, not sure why're your hanging around a forum of a game you're banned in.
---
Are you seriously defending Bethesda? That's messed up.
---
lmao i didn't know until this post but decent bait my friend! 
---
That falls under "they should have been fucking prepared" dude. They should have known this was  coming, and they should have been prepared to address it.  The need to prepare a response was BEFORE the announcement, not after. This is _yet another_ failure by the company as a whole. 
---
They as individuals, because bethesda should have warned them they're dropping this anti-consumer bomb on their laps, and they as a company, because _this decision violates promises made by the company_ and thus is going to get a _lot_ of hell, aside from the hell this type of bullshit decision USUALLY gets. 
---
Ahh gotcha, I was trying to put it on an arm. 
---
I’ll use it on the leg I have instead then.
---
Thank you for the info!
---
It says “limb” and I bought it for the arm, but if it doesn’t work on arms I’m SOL.
---
Are there mods for arms as well?
---
My lvl 29 alt has level 25 lever action and handmade; with a fireaxe and a mole miner gauntlet for melee.  Chances are I'll only swap out the melee weapons for a sledge &amp; power fist at level 30, then grind 5 more levels to upgrade the lever action and handmade.
---
So I can't really agree with the "constantly changing weapons as you level up" idea for low levels.  I've been stuck with the same modded out lever action &amp; handmade since level 25, I'll probably be stuck with them until level 35.  I'll get new melee weapons at level 30, but won't have decent options to upgrade them until 40.
---
That 5-10 levels worth of time is *plenty long enough* for a character without durability perks to go through several repairs of their gear.
---
I know they are random but the one I know has a chance to be the BOS ones. It isnt always them obviously 
---
"We have heard input from the players and will be instituting daily and weekly challenges completed by using repair kits.
---
As always, we encourage any and all feedback and look forward to working with our players to create a gaming experience that is prepared for the future.

See you all out in the Wasteland!"
---
-Bethesda, probably
---
Nice pic, thanks.
---
New Vegas is my least favorite of all the fallout games...including 76 lol but 2 is my favorite so, theirs that...
---
It was live yesterday, you're late to the party.
---
You know some people like to be spit on
---
No one bought the armor edition for that bag.
---
They don't have to address individual complaints, they can make a fucking post with a canned response. Which they should have had prepared, because there is no way they didn't see this exact wall of completely justified hate coming. 
---
I for one *blaim* Bethesda 
---
Lmao
---
I wouldn't call it a blunder. This isn't stupidity, this is cold hard greed.

How much is the average price you pay per item?
---
Since Atoms can be accumulated in-game, I consider them an in-game material/currency.
---
I didn't? Have you never been wrongfully accused of something in your own life? I envy that position but we aren't all so lucky. 
---
They're like a fucking dog that keeps getting into shit that they know is wrong. 
---
I want some paintjobs for the Ultracite armor. There's one right now and it's ugly. 
---
I knew this would happen, game isn't making enough money, so charge the only loyal players you have left. Classy, Bethe$da.
---
Charging money for items for a game that is barely 1/3rd of the way finished.
---
For shame, you greedy little gremlins.
---
Transmog or over armor type options like how your outfits cosmetically change your appearance 
---
If it was, it's the dumbest fucking thing they could have done.  I'm okay with player vending being delayed a few weeks if they are having issues with implementing it.  Would you rather have player vending enabled where there's an exploit that allows people to buy stuff at 1 caps each? I'm sure you won't mind that the traveling leather coat you put up for sale went for 1 cap.
---
The plans are now avaiable from the brotherhood-vendorbot in Watoga. You can find them in the shoppingmal there

Bug
---
ESO's not p2w. 
---
I'll admit it's convenient, but not a combat advantage. And why the poor attitude? We disagree on this, it's not a huge deal. It's not like someone stole your sweet roll.
---
None taken, it was a glorious feet of acrobatics (had I stuck my landing).
---
I’m not sure you’re my type, but I appreciate the offer. And I don’t hate you.
---
Mwah x

(Ps. I’m a hairy 40 (ish 😉) year old man.
---
&gt;This is the double exp weekend on survival mode. I am power leveling  people there in exchange for the non legendary random weapons that they  receive as loot. 
---
cool, I and many others I have come across do this for free, no need to give me your loot...
---
&gt;I've done this before and it's very fast - you can get many levels  quickly. Each mutie we kill will be the equivalent of a starting area  quest completion (400-600 exp each), and we will be killing 30+ every 10  minutes. 
---
are you really mansplaining how to level up?
---
&gt;I am doing this because 1 - I'd be doing this anyway, but solo (but much  faster solo) because I need about 20,000 steel, and 2 - I want to help  others and it's fun to do a bit of role play, even if it's mostly  tongue-in-cheek. 
---
so put a post on one of the myriad markets and buy the steel, then with your free time help other players out of the kindness of your heart.
---
&gt;To add some fun, I decided to do a bit of role play with it, and yes, I  plan on staying relatively in character as we do this (my account name  is Knight\_Wanderer after all, and I love the BoS - favorite faction by  far). Because I realize that some people might feel that me getting all  of their steel is a bit of a raw deal, despite the fact that they are  getting power leveled for free and can keep their found legendaries,  caps, ammo, etc., I decided to throw in some extra gear as a reward for  sticking with me to level 25 and 50. Those aren't cheap rewards either -  I'll be spending 10 or so Violet Flux for the crafted items. 1-50  should be achievable in a day. 
---
this is cool, I do applaud this, and I did appreciate that you gave them gear, but it would be even cooler if it was a full on faction with other players, not just a guy looking for steel so he can craft and repair his gear/gear for sale.
---
&gt;And think about it. Would the BoS do things purely out of the kindness  of their heart? No, and nor will I. In this scenario, I can accomplish  two goals at once - train new recruits for the BoS while also farming  the steel that I need for ammo crafting more efficiently. 
---
no, they wouldn't, which brings me to a point I wanted to make...  how is a fascist group of assholes your favorite faction?  also as I pointed out above you can accomplish both without fleecing a new player out of steel.
---
&gt;Hope that answers your questions, and I'll be going back into character. 
---
it did!  it let me know you are a douche who wants to fleece new players out of steel...
---
violet flux im at the point id pay 150 caps, other fluxes 100
---
I don't mind.  What level are you?
---
GOT EMMM!!!!! 
---
I can't get back on the 4th floor the fence for the elevator is red for me.
---
I think the cap loss needs to be capped somewhere.  Hell, I could live 100 caps, even 150.  But it gets to be a problem at level 200 when you are losing 400 caps. 
---
At that point,  there's really no incentive to even bother with the mode.
---
Yeah I can hear it already: if you don't wanna lose caps then you need to get better at PVP. 
---
Well, getting better at PVP involves trial and error.  And the "error" part  is way too expensive to even try.
---
I've did everything I could in every fallout game to oppose NCR at every step...metzger and the slavers for life
---
I'm 6 charisma with Hard Bargain 3, so IIRC the bulk (10 pieces) sells for 236 caps.
---
But u can lay them in the air tho? So I'm Cofused lol
---
Friends? Can you find me some real ones?
---
They always do this. You should have seen this coming. With Fallout 4 it was paid mods. With this game its this. They're trying to establish a permanent revenue stream. 
---
I would love to see a Bobblehead stand in the atomic shop. :D
---
What platform?but it happens to me al the time lately,on xbox x
---
sorry meant 3rd floor. So you gotta go all the way through the building up to the point where you gotta use the computer before getting on the elevator the first time. 
---
Still at -2 can I have abother upvote? Lol
---
About time someone agrees with me.
---
Yes that'd just be a cosmetic purchase and I don't give a shit about real money purchases if they're cosmetic because then it doesn't encourage it *specifically for game play*
---
Agreed, I've been asking for a fallout like this since 3, but I'm worried it's getting into dangerous territory. Hopefully this is all just rumour, and doesn't come to pass, so we can continue enjoying it.
---
I still dont know how one pays 2 win in a cooperative game. How do you win!? 
---
I haven't seen anything in awhile either about it. I'm guessing a bunch of that stuff drops when player vending comes next month. 
---
I'd love to craft a hydrometer or refractometer, an immersion chiller, counterflow chiller, carboys, etc., but yes, as a home brewer, I passionately agree. 
---
Every post is about the stupid repair kits. Why make yet another one? Sorry you're catching my built up anger but its getting reallllly annoying. 
---
Inb4 canned dog food spawn rates are decreased and ionized meat must be cooked with flux
---
You realize there's more to the game than just PvP, right? If you're halfway through a dungeon and your favorite gun breaks, you're a lot better off if you can repair it right then rather than using a secondary weapon and praying for a weapon workbench.
---
outfits I want:
---
\~Valentine's Detective trenchcoat
---
\~Piper's reporter outfit
---
\~Cait's corset
---
\~Maxson's Battlecoat
---
\~Minutemen General's outfit (Even if it was reskinned with a BoS insignia or a swappable insignia on the chest)
---
\~Irma's dress (memory Den)
---
\~Hancock's  Red frock coat 
---
There’s also Wastelanders 
---
In Europe is doing well. The game sold over 200.000 physical units last year in the UK, way more if you count digital downloads, and it was released in November making it to the top 20 best selling games in 2018 and this is only for the physical edition so not too bad.
---
The power armor display would be amazing! Somewhere to store it and easy to keep track of which ones you have/working on. It would be nice if you could build/repair while it was on display
---
sorry, I misunderstood, I thought the bug was it would disappear or something, otherwise why would OP not repair past 100%?  to be clear I repair with the perk equipped every time, never noticed if it was past full condition or not...
---
So, from what i understand.  This us a plan that you can buy from the atom store, then make in game however many times you want.
---
Opinion: fallout76 is a mmorpg like World of warcraft,  or guildwarz. Both of which, if im not mistaken have a store similar to the atom store. Usually in stores like that it includes xp boosts and other similar items that are not cosmetic only, so i don't see why Bethesda should be held at a standard higher than other full price mmorpgs. Personally,  i think that if the plans for the repair kit can also be found in game without paying, this is a nonissue. Obviously there needs to be a line drawn as to what should be able to be bought, but to limit them to strictly cosmetic only is unreasonable.  There are plenty of non-cosmetic items that could be added that wouldnt break the game.
---
I'm an edge lord at heart..I want more pointy bits and skulls...I want armor that looks like repurposed hockey gear with metal plates and spikes and skulls hanging off it...some road warrior/mad max style stuff..dusters trench coats bowler hats and hipster crap dosent do it for me..hell the raider tire armor with tires over each shoulder and some pikes with skulls in them..or a brahmin skull cod piece on some Jean's with metal plates 
---
I’m not yet at the end game but if I see a nuke go off I will let you know and I will be able to trade.
---
Yeah, I do get it, but other people might have overlooked that person's username and thus be missing out on some good joke. YoUaReSoHiLaRiOuS, please be mindful of the people who might have a good laugh thanks to this comment. Do not ruin their fun.

To the real humans reading, do not stop doing what you enjoy because some jerk decided to write a bot that makes fun of people making jokes.

Oops. Not violet flux, but fluorescent flux. Nuke whitesprings is loaded with raydodenderon.

I didn't care to PVP. I don't particularly like coming back from a PVP session to a demolished base. And it's not hidden in the geometry, it's in a cave and quite nice looking. For what it's worth, when we ran into eachother later at a workshop he was the one that died. Having a secure base is a more enjoyable experience than server hopping depending on what I'm doing at that moment.
---
Basically 
---
I’m more referring to what everyone else is going crazy about. I ask that same question. Pay to win in my opinion is like a advantage without the work/play. This is more of a nice choice with repair packs. But I don’t claim to know it all. 
---
Damn, really? I’ll check that out as soon as I get home
---
Fully  enjoyed FO3, NV and FO4...and always wanted a multiplayer/co-op Fallout game...If this wasn't a Fallout themed co-op game, I probably wouldn't of gotten it.
---
It does. 
---
&gt; so i don't see why Bethesda should be held at a standard higher than other full price mmorpgs

"No. Only cosmetic." - Pete Hines

https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1032589221398282241
---
Lol, I’ve been playing solo so far but I would like someone to play the game with if you are on Xbox.
---
You can’t be serious Batman...
---
This game costed me 60 bucks, I also spent some money to get the Black-bird paintjob for PA. I also want the Atom Shop to be cosmetic only, so your point is fucking stupid.
---
I'm worried armor repair kits are going to be required to run dungeons, like you can only get 1/2 through and then the armor breaks kick in and you have some inconvenient slog/backtracking 5-10 mins to a bench OR use some handy dandy repair kits.....
---
man that feels cynical...... almost like you cant trust companies to not be sleazy or just outright lie through their teeth.
---
&gt; If you'd rather pay $30 for DLC instead
---
Yeah I would actually. Fuck this microtransaction cancer. Worst thing in gaming today.
---
O.P ment skins for armors...and outfits that look like armors 
---
Dont worry bro. I've been reported like 20 times for my base being in a cave that I put foundations in front of. Nothing is going to happen. 
---
That's the controversy right now, I guess. Wish I had a good answer for us. 
---
If anything, I wanted this post to help stop it; the managers would say "We hear you; stay tuned for a response" and then everyone would start to cool their jets. 
---
Might not help, but it also could. Who knows at this point.
---
I think people are angry because they specifically said it would be free. Had they said paid DLC no one would have cared, as paid DLC is pretty standard. But Bethesda went out of their way to tell us we wouldn't have to pay a dime
---
Selling extra plans work! And other aid like berry mentats, buffout, bufftats ect...help out a lot. 
---
I mentioned stimpaks because a lot of lower level players have hard access them and occasionally get lucky to get them if they  don't have pharma pharma rank 3 yet nor have acquired the stimpak recipe plan. Plus, selling stimpaks at a rate of 5-8 caps a piece will greatly bring you business since stimpaks cost around 69-76 caps at a robot vendor.
---
I would also add farming x-01 mods (especially the jet pack and calibrated shocks) is a good business venture too.
---
How is that fact fun? People died Kevin. And you’re cracking wise.
---
I started with Wasteland back in the 80’s. That game was hard as Hell. That game led to Fallout 1 sometime thereafter. Played them all. Even the weird Brotherhood of Steal twin shooter that everyone hates on. 
---
That's definitely your prerogative, just as it's mine to reply letting you and anyone else reading know that doing that will only encourage the very things this playerbase is angry about right now.
---
Have a good day bud.
---
Scrap a lot of flamers 
---
&gt; You want to participate in the next fasnaught day parade? Then it will be 4.99.
---
Entire full DLCs with hours upon hours of content cost around $20. I much prefer going that route than nickle and dimeing thousands of players for unknown amounts of money to sprinkle tiny bits of content over long stretches of time. 
---
You need to learn to stop being paranoid and over-generalizing things. What one video game and its developer does doesn't make it a standard in another. You are entitled to know what you are purchasing, and you did 6 months ago. You aren't entitled on Day 1 to know the extent to which new updates and changes are made to the game as it evolves. That's fucking impossible to qualify for anything, let alone video games. All you are really mad about is something going into a game that you have to buy and that it ***could*** lead to something that makes the game worse. There's no evidence of this happening and citing it as a "trend" in the gaming industry is useless. If a bar down the road waters down their tequila that doesn't mean every other bar is going to. If they actually do something, then get mad, but it's a fucking waste of time to do it over some repair kits you'll really ever use and that'll make no difference on your experience.
---
look, if you can't see why I am pissed about P2W then you are either a troll or intellectually challenged...  how is the ability to repair a weapon, used for combat mind, not a combat advantage?  for example, dude has a Grognak axe, almost broken, he's on his way to a bench to repair, but uh-oh! another player shows up and starts attacking, he responds but on the first swing the axe breaks, either he dies or repairs on the fly and maybe wins the fight, how is the ability to pay real money to avoid death not a combat advantage?
---
I haven’t seen at t51b mod in Watoga yet. Do you know if the vendor can have them? I see the plans but I was just hoping to get the mods. 
---
Yeah it is doing better as of late. Especially with all the deals. I do want the game to do well. And I genuinely want to hear people's opinions on what has been happening. It's good to hear it's doing well, but I think criticism is important even if I get downvoted 
---
Kinda the same baby murder that’s all I find on this game 
---
after the rain my heart still dreams
---
Bobby pins don’t weigh anything anymore
---
I started with 3 when it came out. Got into 1, 2, and Wasteland afterwards. Honestly didn't care for NV. Have about 500 hours into 4 right now, but I don't know if I will go back to it since I have been killing 76 lately.
---
&gt; Grognak &amp; The Ruby Ruins,
---
So I didn't find out til after I already played it that you can close your pipboy and it keeps progress. 
---
I played it all the way thru in 1 sitting because I didn't wanna have to start over.
---
I sat hidden from Super Mutants the whole time. occasionally hearing them in the background while playing the game.
---
I feel dumb, but it was also fun. 
---
"reported"
---
OK, this feels like a two man play going on between you and u/Earthtracker.
---
Tell me for real, are either of you over 18? I'm not trying to be a jerk in anyway, but after reading this comment chain I'm genuinely curious. 
---
From an outside perspective, it sounds like you guys are being toyed with at your own expense. I don’t understand why people keep playing this game when every week there’s something outrageous or manipulative. 
---
They never said it's gonna be free. They said it won't be pay to win
---
So much overreaction. They literally asked for community feedback when they announced it. Instead we get a bunch of people acting like this is the end of the world. Which isn't odd concidering the game world...
---
I think they said they're going to make passive CAMPs unable to be destroyed by other players.
---
Where was your CAMP?
---
I was doing some googling, looks like modders got Doom to work on Fallout 4's Pip-Boy, this could totally be a thing!
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/407/?tab=posts
---
Don't get me wrong, I PVP when I'm out and about playing the game, but when I'm rearming and resting I don't like getting domed in the back of the head by whoever happens to wander by. 
---
Not sure it’s split - look at all the anti comments? 
---
Crawl in the fridge to survive the fallout 
---
Sounds like a bit of a cheat meeting a bit of an arse. 
---
It’s a bit like when harry met sally only without the friendly diner scene.
---
&gt; Relax bud. RELAX
---
From the same person who just said 
---
&gt; Look I want bethesda to continue to support this game with new story, features, quests, and great content. If this means they need or believe they need to add some things to the atom shop like “repair kits” then i say go for it! Its either they do that or they start charging real money (not atoms) for new vaults and content.
---
How delusional are you?
---
It's pretty fun and suspenseful...... 
---
With that being said I only play it to get the legendary reward. Then I go back to adventure mode. I don't mind the pvp so much but every time I die I lose 300 some caps and tons of aid items. That gets damn expensive. I got spawn locked last week trying to do uranium fever and lost 1300 caps in about 30 seconds. 
---
They really need to have max caps lost capped at 100. Then I would play it all the time. Once you have a build pretty much made (level 75) there is no advantage in being level 100 or 300. It just punishes people who invested time into the game. Right now there isn't any reason to not shoot on sight.
---
The leader board is odd as well. Honestly I have no great ideas on how to make that aspect work better. Maybe players with the most kills?  Then instead of a tab showing your location it just shows a large circle on the map.
---
Just wear the nurse hat and underwear. Works for me
---
There are a number of people who dont like NV that much. And its ok to have this opinion. But whenever theres a poll about which is the best FO game, NV gets the most votes. A lot of popular criticism against FO4 can be summarized with "its not FONV". New Vegas is generally the most liked Fallout game and other FO games are always compared to NV. 
---
To me, NV had one of the best *concepts* for a Fallout game, it was just executed poorly. New Vegas felt extremely lifeless, the missions felt very linear, the map was super linear and full of invisible walls, and very little was improved upon since 3. 
---
there is a guys left behind house etc up on the roof and he likes to watch the stars telescope and all. there is a girl up there too that left her stuff behind and they talked over the roof. I can't remember their names nor is wiki helping. the girl wrote the history of Morgantown after the bombs etc. one of the coolest things I found while exploring. grade a story telling :D
---
I put my camp by 76 and it seemingly doesnt get fucked with although I've had a few come through and use my work benches and such idk i was off exploring and doing whatever came back and all my doors were opened 
---
Psn: maxpowers_69
---
I’m not on a lot but if you see me come join.
---
But you didn't have people playing Mario also paying $10 for 10,000 points, and spending those 10,000 points on Fire Flowers and Mushrooms on demand.
---
Aha, gotcha. 
---
Or they can just add Dogmeat as a companion in the shop for like 2000 Atoms. They just have to recolor him a bit but the rest is already built in FO4. Just make it non-aggressive to avoid issues. How hard can it be?
---
Just screen record then Submit a complaint.
---
Like that is exactly what PVP is for lol are these guys just brain dead or 
---
Nope, all we ever seem to get from Bethesda is stuff we haven't asked for 😕
---
Repair kits.
---
Destroying player camps in adventure mode is about the only fun thing left to do in that game.
---
I've seen several, but why do you need them, and what mod are you hunting for?
---
It's was near vault 76...above the little lake near the moonshine shack. I've never had a problem before and now suddenly 3 destroyed it. 3 of them follow each other. I don't know what I've done for them to come after me. I'm on pacifist mode and never engage in pvp
---
&gt; DAE BETHESTARDS XDDDDDDDDDD gib karma
---
Might as well just add a flair to your username that says "I'm 12 with no rational argument". Seriously, wtf does this even mean? State your opinion, back it up, and have a discussion. Resulting to stupid meme language because you just *have* to say something but have nothing worthwhile to say is incredibly childish. 
---
Then they'll start sending people out to our homes to kill and rape us. It's all a slippery slope and it always happens. Yep, never once has a slippery slope argument never come to fruition. Remember, all those people who started marrying dogs and horses after gay marriage was legalized. We should have listened to all those completely accurate and obviously not hyperbolic slippery slope argument. MY GOD WHY DIDN"T WE LISTEN!!!!
---
\-------------------------- 
---
This is you. This is what you fucking babies sound like.
---
Not the OP, but show me a rule that says it's a subreddit for 'enjoying the game'. Not saying I like the way he's voicing his 'criticism' nor I agree with it.
---
Shhh they sleeep
---
The signs are getting more blunt every patch. 
---
Stop. Playing. 
---
I think of end game items and gear as things you can't or are not likely to get until you are finished with the storyline and your build. Start killing the queen on the regular or farming Whitesprings or other legendaries for top-tier gear - - then your in the end game. 
---
I've bought a load of T-51B mods from vendor bot Chad in Camden Park so YMMV
---
Had a guy come into my camp yesterday and just blow up my expensive stuff like my decontamination shower and my fusion generator. Sucks because someone built my shower for me and I didn’t have flux. Needless to say I store it now when I’m not there. Sucks I can’t leave it in my camp for other players to use. 
---
Powder Ganger
---
&gt; tons of us actually love this new idea but don't have a voice among the minority ja know?
---
Got some data to prove this? Seems the MAJORITY don't like this change, as indicated by the sheer volume of posts and upvotes/comments. Those who like Bethesda lying and selling game changing items in a store they specifically said would be cosmetic only are firmly in the minority. 
---
I mean I suppose. The wall is mainly to keep the scorched out from my friendly neighborhood fissure site. Having a safe place to stock up in survival mode came weeks later. 
---
IMO:  It isn't damning in and of itself....but it's not a good sign either.  A step in the wrong direction.  Setting foot on the slippery slope....etc and so on.
---
&gt; What's worrying is that from my brief pop through Bethesda hasn't commented on this at all.
---
All the community people who are usually pretty active are completely silent too, likely told to not talk about it because they knew there would be backlash against this decision. 
---
I heard only the regular repair kits were  in the atom shop and the deluxe were going to be drop only
---
Had that issue with the camo bundle. They’re cool items, but definitely not worth paying for twice.
---
The thing is that they said that no item would ever give you a gameplay advantage, this is technically a gameplay advantage, therefore, they lied.
---
And therefore, deserve all the backlash they get.
---
raw flux is pretty worthless stable flux is what id expect most people will buy ,  which is 10 raw +1 glowing mass + 1 hardened mass + high radiation fluids 
---
thefreakizoid (yeah i know weird name didnt make it though) add me bruh i play a decent bit although im only level 19 (yes im on playstation) 
---
None of the community folks that are usually active have replied, seems most haven't left a single comment in several days
---
I started with Fallout 1 and then 2 was released shortly after.  Been hooked ever since.  I even like Fallout: Tactics.
---
Make a new character and then log in and back out with him. If it happens that time you will know it's a problem with your whole game. But if it only happens with your one character, we would know it's something specific to that character. From there we can try to narrow it down even further.
---
They knew before they decided to implement them
---
They just said “fuck what the community thinks”
---
Pay to win you say? And to think I almost downloaded it after seeing the praise this sub was giving the improvements. Gonna be a hard nope from my wallet. 
---
They don’t speak for themselves. They speak for the company. Nothing will come out of their mouth that hasn’t been reviewed and approved by the suits at the top. They’re probably working on a statement right now. Before said statement has been approved by the decision makers of the company, none of the community managers will say a word.
---
A red beret. Doesn’t need the First Recon patch, I can pretend.
---
The painting of Shannon Rivers from Riverside Manor.
---
Faction flags/banners/other appropriate decor.
---
And look, if my poor dress-wearing wastelander is going to keep accidentally showing her underwear in different poses, when lying down or playing an instrument or whatever, I would pay good actual cash for better underwear. Doesn’t need to be fancy or frilly or any of that (although that would be acceptable). Plain black would be fine. Please, Bethesda. My vault dweller has style, and would never pair a fancy red dress with dingy white drawers.
---
Take a step back and look at what you're saying and think if it's normal behavior or not. Spoiler alert: it isn't. I understand that you think you deserve answers. I get that part. The part you don't seem to get is that you don't. It's ok to be upset about something, but no one has to care or do anything about it. That's life. 
---
If they decide to bring NPCs into the game this kind of storytelling could be used to justify surviving Brotherhood members. Somebody had to bury the bodies, and they may have been given a task to leave West Virginia in search of other survivors to try to find help for the scorchbeast  problem -- or to warn them.
---
PC here, only started a little while ago sadly enough
---
I'll stick around another 10 minutes. IGN same as here. 
---
Looks cool... think I saw the other Reddit post for this. Love the junker style. Can we get 10 more of these posts on the front page so I don't have to read about repair kits?
---
It’s good armor! Highest ballistic rating out of all of them. 
---
I would like to know if it’s possible to get a max level one?? I’ve gotten it a few times but all where only level 25 even though I’m level 160?
---
Alright let me do that really quick
---
He forgot to swap cards after building his camp. Poor bastard
---
Thanks dude I’ll try there. 
---
Honestly, games today should cost about $120 if they had kept up with price increases in other entertainment. Yet people complain about the cost of everything. You don't like microtransactions, I dislike paying $30 for horse armor. No wonder game devs can't win sometimes.
---
Would you like some help?
---
I would like it actually. It seems so silly that nearly every player above lvl. 70 I run into has marsupial, as though that is just the normal progression of the game. You can literally jump 20 feet in the air- you should look a little damn different.
---
Yes my trading post is doing the same thing and I reset my camp with the free move and it’s green but won’t place I don’t know what is going on or how to fix if you figure something out please let me know 
---
I don't understand what "grandfathered in wall-port" means. It sounds like you are somewhere that cannot be reached in the current state of the game. I know what grandfathered in means. I see plenty of people hiding in their concrete bunkers.
---
They don't need to do that. You already know they are reading. They probably don't want to deal with the reactionary whinging about something so innocuous.
---
My dad introduced me to fallout 1 and daggerfall back in the day. He passed over a decade ago, but nowadays the only video games I play are Elder Scrolls and Fallout. 
---
....The argument here is that in game earned currency has a practical hard limit.  Even if you gathered every single challenge reward since day one, someone who is good with math can work out exactly how many atoms you have (assuming you've spent none).  
---
But since atoms can also be purchased with cash....if they ever get around to including actual game effecting items/buffs/or other one-time-use but game-effecting things....someone with functionally unlimited atoms will always end up with an advantage over someone without.
---
That's so similar to what they did. One jumped through the window and began shooting all my crafting stations etc...i had to quit the game. And the generator.  Like you, it was built for me by a friend. They destroyed that too. It's hard to get materials in the first place but to have to do it repeatedly...it's worn me out...I  don't even want to play...except I have to as i haven't got anything else to distract me. Sounds pathetic I know but I can only be honest
---
Ill add, pull your heads out of your asses!
---
I don’t know bro, destroying all your mothers holes is pretty good to 
---
This sub-reddit is the worst sometimes. Wish the mods would aggregate all this repair kit topics into a single thread so everything else isn't absolutely drowned. I think they get it, people don't want to pay money for repair kits. I frankly don't understand how it's "pay 2 win" when repairs extremely easy and cheap as it is. There is no realistic scenario I can imagine where someone having an atom shop repair kit is going to allow them to "win". If they're reasonably priced then whatever. They aren't selling TSEs.
---
Yeah, I'm always doing the Breach and Clear quest and yesterday I once again did it, and got TWO from the same run. So its drop rate has definitely become higher. It's a fun sword to keep around, as it weighs virtually nothing and looks awesome. Only problem I have with it is that both swords are only Lvl 25 and I'm Lvl 136. 
---
It can definitely be a different level as one of mine is level 35. Really not sure if it can go higher though. Hope someone else out there has come across a 45 or something!
---
Because the community has a habit of blowing the fuck up over the slightest thing.
---
So rather than say anything just to have it fall on deaf ears or god forbid fuel the fire more. They'll probably let this go, see how it launches on Tuesday, and give a full write-up then. You know, once people actually can see how it's implemented, instead of taking literally one paragraph of text and losing their fucking minds.
---
It's hard to estimate actual numbers because of how the game handles scaling. Camp Venture is small and insignificant, but was a main base for the Brotherhood and their military, and they were apparently large enough in number that all the other factions were extremely wary of them and they were getting around.
---
Plus there were manning vertibirds and running missions all around Watoga and the southeast, setting up bravo busters with the ASAM turrets and more. In game, you'd think there was around a dozen or so, but lore-wise there could have been several hundred.
---
Why should I have to? 
---
It’s crazy how quickly you go through fuel 
---
Comment above was supposed to be my reply to you. Sorry. I'm new to this forum 
---
Let me use Waste Acid as ammo and you've got a deal.
---
Yeah, cause back pedaling on your word is so innocuous.....
---
It shows more than a lack of integrity....
---
You say that, but have you seen the business practices of Activision? 
---
Cool! Thanks! I’ll be sure to add as I’m always usually actively working on a quest :) 
---
Only that character :/
---
Send them my way and I will gladly ease their burden of legacy items.   
---
I completely understand the motivation and it’s a bloody good idea. Still a little bit cheaty, but a bloody good idea lol.
---
don't know about all that but the railway rifle sounds like a train whenever you are holding it
---
I did...but they don't do anything about it 
---
If someone ddos's the servers it is there own fault this has happened to many games when you piss off the player base you are shooting yourself in the foot.
---
Hahaha! 😂
---
Plus the super mutants are insanely bullet spongy, and if you've ever played PVP, you'll know you can still one shot somebody in power armor. 
---
Hey thanks for the offer! I’ll be on later tonight if you’re on I’ll take you up on that offer! 
---
&gt; Honestly, games today should cost about $120 if they had kept up with price increases in other entertainment.
---
Yeah, or if they were actually honest with people instead of taking the extra costs and shoving it into microtransaction bullshit and "preordering DLC" (the season pass is the dumbest fucking thing in existence and yet people buy them like hot cakes).
---
If your game costs more, own it. If it peaks my interest I will still buy it, as long as you arent trying to nickel and dime me with micro transactions, loot boxes, and pay to win bullshit in a premium product.
---
That’s not in the game so the point still stands. 👍
---
...yup. That'ed be "fair" and they're not big on that. 
---
praying for one?
---
they're everywhere.
---
Same, started with F1. IR old.
---
100 posts with 100 upvotes is just 100 people sitting around furiously masturbating. Honestly, anyone with a mind can see that 1 post with 100 upvotes is *exactly equivalent* in terms of community sentiment in your scenario. 
---
Except 1 post means the sub is still worth scrolling through. 
---
I don't need to open/close my foundation wall on the cave because I had a cooking pot phased in the wall where it picks you up one side and spits you out the other. There are two right next to eachother so going in and out is easy for humans, but it doesn't let scorched in. The other guy was too busy trying to blow up the foundation and the stuff behind it to walk around and see a few little iron bars sticking out.
---
Hmmm. Does this happen no matter where you log in or out? A specific area?
---
You can still get mutations in the wild. Which could transform your physical attributes.
---
That's pretty cool... I wonder if that damage bonus works against other players? They'd have to be the only humans in the game.
---
yeah good luck the tse handmades dont even do enough damage..u should look at stats before crying on a reddit
---
I wonder if everyone using the excuse "I paid for the game" would be okay with a subscription model after their 60 bucks is done paying for server costs?
---
Clearly it should be Skyrim not FO1...
---
Its insane how the truth hurts, yet you get downvotes because people are dumb crying babies. What is it going to be in 10 years? Are people going to demand that Bethesda CEO gets hanged? 
---
Umm i can try it in different areas but typically im always at my camp when i log out 
---
At least the DLC is free, and if it gives loot rewards that are actually interesting, it'll give me reason to play those events. Half the time I run events now and... yeah, I don't want screws or pre-war money. I want want crappy urban scout armor that *never* drops in legendary. So new and better loot is actually a good perk.
---
We'll have to see how it's implement though.
---
you should dig through the archives for a post on this topic that was made yesterday, had a lot of good details. 
---
Glad you posted back else would have forgot, but try high damage. I was using ninja, incisor, and some one handed perks. The power attack might have fullfilled the damage requirement. I dunno worth a shot. It was also on a lvl 68 scorch.
---
you're a self-righteous little prick, aren't ya champ
---
This is 100% true and is a serious problem a lot of kids/teens see nothing wrong with pay to win. I had a friend who was 15 and we played a lot of pubg mobile and all the time he said he wished it was more pay to win and wouldnt think twice about spending his dads money on shit in game. Its pretty sad really. 
---
I'm on Xbox...and it's only in the last few days this has happened.  Never had a problem there before. Feels like some kind of vendetta. Maybe because I put the mothman statue up? But why would that cause it? I just don't get it. 
---
He could've cloaked. I ran into a cloaking 3\* Mr. Gutsy at the Dyer Chemical plant before, it was terrifying as I was just doing the quesline(level 45ish).
---
People will still complain saying it’s unfair.
---
I do the same. But try in different areas. 
---
I would almost agree with the "pay for convince" thing, but then they nerf the perks to make the kits more viable. It's gross.
---
I dont understand what they want to gain from this. They game has already bled out a ton of people that would ever play it, do they expect the people that have still stuck with them to just throw more money at the screen? I imagine a majority of players still playing already have the resources to repair their stuff and know where to get food. So surely they cant be targeting that market.
---
Helps you to avoid winning your Fallout 76 Darwin award. Or possibly because it's common sense but hey what do I know. You must run to a work bench everytime your weapon breaks.
---
Ah, I see
---
its not really an end all point when you buy the game look at any other AAA company that makes a MMORPG.. WOW, Final Fantasy, and so on.. you buy the game, you buy the dlc packs, and you spend 10-20$ a month to continue to play on their servers.  
---
really to all of you people do you not realize this is on their servers? they had to buy and place the servers, they have to pay techs to keep em running.. they have to pay the net and light/power to all these servers every month. these games are not run on your machine at home. they had to buy land/property to house all these servers, pay staff, and all the coming bills for the next few years. a one time 40/80/200$ purchase is going to fund this or even general maintenance for years to come without even adding in designing new content.  
---
bethesda giving us the dlc free.. full access with no paid subscription.. and everyone still throwing a fit.. i cant understand it.   
---
they have given us a game with a decently large map, frequent updates, first expansions, and a completely free chance to play it online with our friends.. 
---
and evidently it is still not enough for some.
---
there are 5 ways to get the repair kits as they stated: quest rewards, event rewards, boss drops, then 2 ways through the atom store, 1 your freely earned atoms, 2 ya throw some money down and buy some atoms.  
---
there are plenty of ways to acquire these without money and plenty of ways to boycott like: go back to camp and repair your gear.  
---
am i going to be one to sit here and rage they put a qol item in an atom shop? no. i know theres gonna be one or two guys out there working 60-80 hours a week supporting his family making bank that wants to get on the game 30-60 minutes a night to relax that would rather drop 20$ of his money so he doesnt have to waste that hour farming to repair or make ammo so he can go hunt or kill with his friends.   
---
i have several friends that get to play like one day or two days a week due to work and long work hours, i spend my time in game stocking up steel, lead, ammo so that when they do show up its "heres 20k ammo, heres stuff to repair everything. ready? what ya wanna go kill?" and i know theyd have enough disposable income to drop 20-40 a week in the atom shop gladly to not have to depend on me for their enjoyment of the game knowing i grind for days to keep them running.  
---
so far everything thats debated about the atom shop is not game breaking pay to win stuff. its convenience quality of life stuff.. and ways to get them without paying real cash are there..   
---
now all that being said when they bring in the "splatter canon" and charge 5000 atoms for it. sure go forth and share your outrage.. ill catch up with ya and yell from the mountaintop with you how its pay 2 win and wrong.. after im done buying it of course..
---
:), nice 
---
Bethesda spends a lot of time talking about how the repair kits works and barely anything on how you get them in your inventory. I am at least discussing it as an interpretation of what we know rather than pretending I know exactly how it will work and thus Bethesda sucks.
---
It might have something to do with possible human npc's and enemies in an upcoming dlc. Does it work good in pvp?
---
Yeah probably :(
---
Even if it is blown out of proportion, it directly affects what people think of the game which affects sales, so by your logic BGS is waiting for all the youtubers shit on them to make the people think even worse of the game before saying something. Perfect logic. And btw, we aren't losing our minds, we just know it is a terrible idea which should never be implemented or it'd be the death of the game, just like other games died like Star Wars Battlefront 2.
---
I waited for a rumored game based on GURPS to come out. Then there was some sort of falling out, then license issues and I despaired. The studio released the game, rebranded to Fallout but without the GURPS license and name.
---
It was fantastic.
---
I always thought he sold all the drink recipes. However, just lemonade and hard lemonade.
---
the reason for the wall hardly matters when you are on a PvP server with leaderboards.
---
So you're okay with being lied to? Having the company that you tried to support through all their shitty decisions straight up spit in your face?
---
Criticism, whether it be overblown or actually thought out is criticism warranted when this big of a dick move happens.
---
The community devs are just the messengers
---
I can see how that'd be frustrating, but I'd definitely rather see purchasable Pipboy games in the Atom Shop than things that affect the gameplay. 
---
dude, hiding in a part of the map that is inaccessible to anyone but you on a server that has leaderboards is literally griefing
---

There you go. Outlines everything for you.
---
I hope to see more P2bW (Pay to be Weaker) items. If enough people shell out cash for items that give them a disadvantage maybe the cosmetic prices will go down.
---
I would want robots from the fallout 4 automatron DLC and the atom shop could feature paints and cosmetics for your robots.
---
Part of me thinks it was intentionally turned on to start dropping more in preparation of more content coming soon.
---
Or someone corrected a misplaced decimal and it's now dropping like it should. 
---
Either way, definitely has future story implications, so that's cool.
---
Really wish it was leveled a bit more too. I got a 35 and a 25 from the same box, so it can definitely level. Best case scenario would likely have it be 45 max. 
---
Now I'm confused! Haha the balloons are just a random decoration. I'm stacking the confetti piles until they reach off the ground
---
Nice, adding to my check up places.
---
Currently the biggest hauls come from camden park and eastern regional penitentiary.
---
Dont listen to those crying babies, they would still cry even if the game was free saying BETHESDA OWES US cause i downloaded 50 gig and try to get that 50gb of bandwith reimbourse. It’s a buch of entitled cry babies.
---
My understanding is they are bethesda employees? Who are public facing, and thus should be aware of _major fucking bombs_ the company is  about to toss at their feet?
---
I'll buy it!
---
Daggerfall was such an amazing thing when it came out. A nearly endless world that you could explore any way you wanted. Unprecedented.
---
Exactly. It's a huge slap in the face to the fanbase IMO. I've been with Fallout since the very first game on PC and this has been the biggest disaster of the franchise. 
---
There's a way in. I can't remove it or I can't replace it. It's hidden, not inaccessible.
---
The mods have given a 24 hour 'free pass' on the repair kit discussion, after that it should all settle down.  It won't go away, but it won't take over the front page with 40 identical posts saying nothing new.
---
Hopefully by then, we'll have a more 'normal' board to look at.
---
"We all (implies everybody) get upset about things....but some of us (you being implied as part of "some of us") can step away and look at the big picture.  Slightly disappointed--but totally expected the mobs of children dressed up as adults  (identifies all the people, now whiners, posting about repair kits as being children masquerading as adults) having tantrums on every platform. You mention three separate groups in your sentence: We, some of us, and mobs of children.  We is collective and it begins your statement and obviously means everyone in general. I can't help but imply that you see yourself as "some of us" since you are the sole author of your statement. So that leaves the "mobs of children masquerading as adults..." You didn't say mobs of children masquerading as people (everybody).  That you are slightly disappointed, but you expected such behavior from children absolutely implies that you see yourself as an adult, not a child since you have separated yourself from everybody else (we) in your statement.  So yes, I did get the impression that of the three groups of people in your statement, you see yourself as the sole adult as it pertains to your post (here).  I didn't say in the whole sub, or the whole world. I truly apologize and feel very embarrassed that my comprehensive abilities didn't allow me to understand exactly what you meant. I'd hate it if you thought I was some sort of "whiner".  Black and white enough for you?  
---
It seems like an optional quality of life item to me... and the repair kits are either available in-game from other sources or you can use free atoms... nobody is forcing anyone to buy them. These aren't P2W items. Honestly this seems like one of those times where they should ignore Reddit. A majority of people that play the game aren't here reading and/or vocally complaining about everything. They've got to make money somewhere guys.
---
Hmmm if that's how it's planned to work, then I think it would be fine. But they really should nip this in the bud now and explain it better.
---
Thanks for mentioning this, I'll wait for more information.
---
Yeah, just the Lemondades. The other recipes you need to get from Biv in his dailies. 
---
We need a "Fix '76" chant during their entire E3 livestream event.
---
There is a valid perspective that not everyone has the same "grinding time" resource.
---
Your real world time to spend on game is an equally valuable resource as your real world money is.
---
Many games like this become unplayable for the casual gamer, because some players :
---
A: play almost all day every day
---
B: are high enough level to destroy the new young players, and enjoy doing it.
---
I don't want to be able to walk in and buy a level 100 or 200 or 300 character.
---
World of tanks premium tank anyone?
---
I am playing and grinding, despite being a parent with two young kids who eat up most of my day. 
---
If Bethesda sells a Refrigerator for atoms that makes food not decay? While my harvests rot? 
---
Not cool. 
---
If they seel invincible PvP armour, and anti armour weapons to assassinate players? 
---
Its a different game.  They said that there is supposed to be support for a community. 
---
If it's just a kill fest, I can play call of duty, battlefield, halo, any other PvP gunfight. 
---
Fallout 76 was exciting because we could build a community.  They promised that it would be more than assassins murdering us and nuking our camps for fun. 
---
I spent a lot on fallout single player games.  If they want devoted, loyal, honest players like me, they need to be honest, and need to follow through on some of the issues. 
---
Hell yeah.  I'll pay for a mutation that gets rid of my arms and legs so I can roll everywhere.
---
I’m not sure you know what self righteous means, and because of that your opinion of me means substantially less to me
---
Maybe. But I ran around the place for a good 30 minutes clearing out everything and looting every box.  Didn’t find any enemies. 
---
From what I remember, automatics have received one buff and two indirect nerfs.
---
The nerfs are to critical vats. Originally, you retained critical bonuses while simultaneously rebuilding meter when holding the trigger down in a vats critical. First they dumped the ability to rebuild meter. Then they dumped the ability to critical on subsequent hits.
---
Automatics are leagues weaker than when the game first launched. However, the new damage cap does make it so Damage Per Second is far more important that Damage Per Shot. Some weapons do need to be able to kill in one hit. I am talking melee weapons and black powder weapons. Melee does not get hit as hard as you can grab the relevant perks and legendary prefix in order to attack more quickly.
---
Perhaps if English isn’t your first language, I think I understand why you might not directly follow the distinction I was making.
---
So, to explain: I said that calling this a “betrayal” was hyperbolic and an over-reaction. “Betrayal” is largely reserved for something that goes beyond a simple subversion of implicit trust. I did not say it was “okay”, I did not say I like it and I never said it was acceptable behavior. I called it annoying and not a big deal. I also said, to the effect, that we can spend our atoms as we choose without being insufferable about it. So, to recap: I think this is annoying behavior from Bethesda and the distinction I was making was between “outrage” and “annoyance”.
---
I just wish people would stop getting upset over every little thing as if it’s the end of gaming as we know it. We can lodge our complaints and hope Bethesda hears us, but if they don’t... we can simply not buy the damn repair kit plans.
---
You sound like everyone who retorted me way back when GTA came out and I warned how it was going to influence Rockstar to design the game to influence shark card purchases (and how it already is). And look where GTA is today. 
---
Sometimes you don't need to wait for them to start doing it to be able to predict it. All you have to know is that they are there to make money and what would make them the most money with that monetary system to be able to predict it. BEthesda isn't your friend and they aren't just trying to make a game you like, their biggest goal is making money.
---
And, on top of that, this kind of thing is easier to stop now than it is to wait until they get really bad. Good luck convincing Rockstar to stop designing their games to push you to buy to fix the grind.... they already know it makes them a ton of money and has, they have already got people jaded to it and plenty of people, even people who don't like it, who just go ahead and go with it cause the "battle is already lost" as well as people who think it's good the MTs let them skip gameplay.
---
How the fuck is it greifing if he IS ALLOWED to build there. Being on the leaderboard does nothing for you anyway.
---
It's not a rules thing. It's more of a why stay somewhere you actively dislike? It's like being wildly against torture, so every day you log in and watch at least three hours of torture porn. Like, what the hell are you doing? It's got to be bad for your mental health to steep yourself in something you claim to loathe.
---
Ever since this game has been out, the Besthesda Community people on here come out of their holes when they see the "Dear Bethesda: Thank you for [blah]" and as soon as something breaks or something shitty happens (and they know about it) they go back into their holes until the next "Thank You For Fixing [blah]". 
---
It happens every single time there is an issue going on, which is way too often. 
---
This is why I won't ever get bored of this game
---
Rad x diluted, diluted radaway and vats
---
You take recipe for fridge as reward for you been elected for president, after all player base votes.
---
no, no more nerfs
---
either things need to start becoming balanced with small tweaks at a time, and we need to buff the unused effects/weapons to be useable options. turning bullet sponges into super bullet sponges is not fun gameplay (early division1)
---
melee and tse are strong -&gt; tse got nerfed -&gt; everyone swapped to BE/melee -&gt; probably gonna get a BE nerf here soon.  nerfing anything you disagree with does not solve issues, and does not actually balance anything.
---
I have been playing since Fallout 1 as well. Played every one except Fallout Tactics, Fallout Brotherhood (I believe that’s what it was called) was utter trash. I probably like Fallout 4 the least aside from that. 
---
It sounds like you give up on things easily and for minor reasons. You don't have to buy a "basic repair kit" from the Atom Shop. They're going to be available in-game. And you don't even need them, you can just keep repairing things the normal way.
---
Got introduced to f1/f2 before f3 came out. I feel like that's not too long ago, but then I have to realize that F3 came out well over a decade ago and that yes, I'm getting old very quickly
---
* Can you say right now if the unlock is for a single one-use item or if it's a plan that allows you to craft the repair kits?
---
* Do we know how much it will cost in either case?
---
* Can we find the normal repair kits in game in addition to however they appear in the shop?
---
* Do we know the rate at which advanced repair kits will drop?
---
* Do we know which events (besides the example of Scorch Beast Queen) will have the advanced repair kits in the loot table?
---
These are all things we don't actually have ANY info on, and yet I have seen quite a few threads that are just running wild assuming answers as fact.
---
Basically we know a few vague details, and the people that want a reason to be pissed are pissed. The more level headed people may not like it, but are at least going to wait until we have enough information to be outraged. But this is hardly a nail in the coffin unless we KNOW they're doing it in a fucked up way. This whole thing could be an entirely non-issue, we just don't know.
---
That was said because of the backlash. They clearly had intentions to have non-cosmetic items in there from the start with the lunch boxes. 
---
How long do we expect this game to last if they can't make money off of it anymore? 2-3 years? 5-6? 
---
Fo76 uses the a very similar pay structure as guildwars. What have they been doing for years?
---
This is exactly why I dont play survival.  I lose too many caps per death.  It needs to stop going up past 50... 
---
I'll play survival when I get an alt to 45-50 and can gear him out.  Not because I want to game the system... but because I would have to kill 8 players per death to even break even.
---
do you need to do a wall breach exploit to get in?  if so it is inaccessible, most players either don't know about or don't use exploits, you know, because we aren't all cheaters.
---
Amen!
---
What about the reduction of mutations from diluted rad x
---
they relay info to the devs. This is not their primary job.  They have to tell the devs the backlash, and give them time to find a new plan. I’m guessing since they don’t even post the inside the vault themselves, they don’t know when theyre exactly going to be posted, which means it’s a pretty good chance that it’s the first time they have seen the info too.
---
So I suppose I should spend a good 2-3 hours rebuilding my camp every time I go on survival? I don't just sit there, and I'm not going after some weird leaderboard that lasts for a week and changes based on who is on the server. My longest survival time is 3 hours on a server that was basically dead. You don't get any rewards for a longer time and there isn't any record of it after Tuesday rolls around. Usually I go outside and fight them, but I was in the middle of Automatron. That is the leaderboard I care about.
---
A bit late when join fallout at 4. Then i turned back and actually read and see the 1, 2 walkthrough and start playing 3 and new vegas myself.
---
Oxhorn helped me much to sum up thing in 1 and 2 and may be one day i played it myself.
---
I'd like to buy a *human* npc to talk to me and give me a couple of goddamn missions!
---
Hey now I don’t even pvp so you leave my automatic handmades alone. 
---
Exactly. Thank you.
---
It is good, and honestly I love the game the gameplay loop keeps me entertained more than any other game since fallout 4. I really don’t like the crazy hatred the game has now after the repair kit fiasco. Hopefully Bethesda get through 
---
This was my exact thought as well. I'd love to have 1&amp;2 as pipboy games. 
---
I just read this... omg I died just now!
---
By every one, do you mean tactics and bos as well? I have to admit I never finished tactics, even though I put in like 80 hours into it
---
Here’s to hopes and dreams🍺
---
There's a pile of content coming... and the game is free. You aren't forced to buy any of these things. Not sure why you're so personally offended. It doesn't sound like you're spending any money.
---
Also thank you for replying to me. It is much appreciated
---
Radx diluted and rad shield don't suppress mutations  and radx on survival is easy to come by if you pvp. That's honestly the biggest weakness of that build is rads. With serendipity and dodgy perks it's pretty easy to negate most other damage
---
The default too many items email. I picked up a loot bag full of flux. I thought it was a blessing from atom himself, but now im just banned without a single word on when i can even expect to be released from suspension 
---
how is using an exploit to make you unkillable in a PvP server not griefing?
---
You have to understand when you get disconnected, it is very likely that your server went boom. When I get disconnected from a server all my friends or teammates in same server get disconnected as well
---
Tested flatwoods, whitesprings station and vault 76, it still happens :/ i really dont want to delete this character i restarted already :( 
---
take excavator armour and you'll get around 300 Lead Ore, refines into 750 lead scraps, add super duper and increase that a lot. 
---
Great tips thank you!!
---
Rad shield doesn't suppress your mutation last I checked.
---
Diluted rad x doesnt suppress mutations but normal does

Fallout 76 is ironically exactly what I wanted from fo4. That game had a lot of fun for me with the sandboxy nature of legendary items, settlements, so much weapon/armor/power armor customization, etc. I spent most of my time in fo4 running around and exploring, completely ignoring the main quest and most side quests. Now 76 is exactly what I wanted, running around and exploring without caring about some stupid settler asking me to wash his dishes
---
The repair kit isn't the reason though. Its pay to win. If you are in a fight with someone they can just hotkey repair kits they bought. People will also never have to grind to repair their stuff, they will just buy kits. This also means Bethesda lied because they said the atomic shop would be cosmetic only. On top of that, they nerfed white knight perk so people would buy more repair kits and food is degrading much faster since the new update in preparation for fridges (which I assume will be in the shop)
---
It's a lie regardless of whatever excuse you want to give it.
---
&gt; How long do we expect this game to last if they can't make money off of it anymore? 2-3 years? 5-6?
---
I don't care, I don't like this monetary model at all. I hope it fails catestrophically so they can go back to selling a FULL game for a set price and a FULL dlc for a set price. Microtransaction laden games always are designed to sell microtransactions, period. When those microtransactions offer in game benefits, they will 100% always push you to buy them, that's how they work. I disagree with the entire system, so I hope it doesn't last. 
---
&gt; Fo76 uses the a very similar pay structure as guildwars. What have they been doing for years?
---
I don't care? I don't get why you think pointing to other games makes me think it's ok? I didn't support Guildwars, so your point is moot. Whataboutism isn't a great way to sell your position on an issue.
---
Doesn’t mean he’s unkillable.
---
Just run in screaming and swinging your sword about? It worked a treat in braveheart!

Way to double down on being an asshole. If this isn't for you then move along. Apologies for 'mansplaining' but if you act like a child then you're going to have to expect an adult to come along and call you on it. Christ. 
---
Yes!
---
How is anyone this deluded?
---
This response made me giggle.
---
Kind of what my goofy self does already. Lol. Just trying to learn some more finesse in style.
---
ok, first, I get you wanting more XP, we all do, but it is a PvP server, and using exploits to make yourself unkillable is literally griefing.
---
second, don't join a PvP server if you don't want to PvP
---
I don't think anyone questions how you spend your time, no matter how much of a nonsense it may or may not be, why do you care how he spends his time? Don't like it - ignore it.
---
yes just create different meshes and textures for every possible combination of mutations.
---
Also do this without the new meshes clipping with weapon animations or power armor. 
---
Make ultracite .308. I believe that crafts in much larger quantities. It also makes you use up less ammo because A) you feel bad wasting the "better" ammo and B) it increases damage per shot, which DRASTICALLY increases dps on a weapon firing as fast as this
---
how is he not?  he is wall breaching
---
Is rad shield a perk card? Dont recall seeing it.

I'd like to see some arcade cabinets for the games.

---
Oblongs reference?  Haven't thought of that show in forever.  You earned that upvote.
---
Loving the flavour you've given it, good work. Is pc region locked?
---
Oh I get ya man, it’s just the way it goes. We’ve seen this before. Remember when they rolled out an update that reintroduced a bunch of bugs that were previously fixed? 
---
I have a legendary Pipe Rifle. They exist but are just rare because people think they're worthless and don't pick them up.
---
depressingly enough it is still not a thing, i wish it was.
---
also no idea why it is not a thing, there are a few weapons that are not included in the legendary loot list still.
---
I would love those acoustic instruments! 100?
---
Look, I play survival for the bonus XP and the weekly challenge. I'm not hurting the poor powergamers, I'm just doing what I do on every Fallout game and getting all the collectibles. I participate in PVP when I'm on, just not usually in my base because I don't like for it to be destroyed. Caps are pretty easy to make on the market so I'm not too worried about that, I am just partial to the "cozyness" of my little moonshine cave. The way I see it it's a pretty victimless crime.
---
you are trying to take advantage of new players, and *I'm* the asshole?
---
I really want the modded thirst zapper, the one that shoots the weaponized nuka quantum, in the game.
---
Coming from Anthem sub I lol'ed.
---
If you're actually trying to move your camp to a water location, the camp box that you place down from the pip boy can't be put in water, it needs to be out of water, on solid ground. Once you have it in an area you want though, like others are saying, you can build on water, as long as there's a foundation 
---
::Shrug:: Play another game made by a more integrous company.

Step two: open borderlands 2

Step three: play krieg

---
Pacificist doesn't stop douche's destroying your base, I had my destroyed 3 times or rather attacked 3 times, 1 fully destroyed. This doesn't happen often, I wouldn't move because of unless it is right in the way of something .. it will be fixed soon. It happens, block people who do it and then change servers ..
---
Oooh, goot catch!
---
&gt;having or characterized by a certainty, especially an unfounded one, that one is totally correct or morally superior.
---
Pretty sure I hit the nail on the head bud.
---
&gt; cool, I and many others I have come across do this for free, no need to give me your loot... 
---
You're free to make your own post and offer your services and time for whatever fee - or lack thereof - that you see fit. Please do. If you aren't interested in my service, then don't attend.
---
&gt; are you really mansplaining how to level up? 
---
Did you just assume my gender? The Brotherhood welcomes humans of all colors, religions, and sexual preferences. Just no Ghouls please. Never know when they might turn feral.
---
&gt; so put a post on one of the myriad markets and buy the steel, then with your free time help other players out of the kindness of your heart. 
---
I'd rather farm the steel myself. This is a way to both help people and farm it at the same time. I've done PLENTY of helping people out of the kindness of my heart. I craft BoS Sniper Rifles and hand them out to new players with 500 .308 ammo, purified water, stimpacks, food, and radaway. I've given away many free sets of power armor and asked for nothing in return. In this case, there's something that these players can help me with that costs them nothing. Most of the people who are taking me up on this offer are those wishing to level up alts quickly. They didn't just have that steel lying around, and they would probably not have earned anywhere near as much in such a short amount of time. If I were charging 1,000 caps an hour for this service, that would be a bit crappy. Most people will never need anywhere near this amount of steel (and couldn't store it with only 800 lbs of stash space anyway). If you want to do the same thing for free and think you're capable of clearing areas quickly and easily yourself, you're welcome to make your own post.
---
&gt; this is cool, I do applaud this, and I did appreciate that you gave them gear, but it would be even cooler if it was a full on faction with other players, not just a guy looking for steel so he can craft and repair his gear/gear for sale. 
---
I don't know what you want here. I'm only one player. I don't have the power to form and make other people join a roleplaying faction. Who knows though, maybe this will be the start of something?
---
&gt; no, they wouldn't, which brings me to a point I wanted to make... how is a fascist group of assholes your favorite faction? also as I pointed out above you can accomplish both without fleecing a new player out of steel. 
---
Because I love power armor and energy weapons. I enjoy the lore surrounding them. Not every chapter of the BoS were assholes. The Fallout 4 version was full of good people with poor leadership. The Mojave chapter was... admittedly full of mostly awful and misguided people, with a few exceptions. The chapter under Elder Lyons in the Capital Wasteland was my favorite by far. It's ironic that you openly support the Enclave - the group that worked to wipe out all life in the Capital Wasteland that had ANY trace of radiation in it by sabotaging Purity Project with a modified form of the FEV.
---
&gt; it did! it let me know you are a douche who wants to fleece new players out of steel... 
---
Fleecing would be taking it unfairly. I'm providing a service free of charge. They would not be able to acquire so much steel by themselves at that level and would not be able to store or use it either. If anyone thinks the terms of the contract are unfair, they are welcome to level up solo. It sounds to me like you want to have a cake and eat it too.
---
Another potential way to tweak the balance of paid/free atoms would be to increase the number of atoms you get from cash while adjusting the cost of atom store items. 
---
I know that I'd be a lot more inclined to buy a power armor paint job (for example) off the atom store if it didn't cost $15 by itself, and I can imagine I'm not the only person that has the same mentality.
---
Exhorbinantly high cost/benefit ratios are self-defeating, and when you're looking at microtransactions in games, you want to invite the highest potential for whales to get interested. Decreasing the cost/benefit ratio has the potential to turn a non-spender into a spender, and a spender into a whale. It just requires the right balance. 
---
I've seen too many slippery slope warnings go unheeded in other games. Sure, it's 'just' a repair kit but if that flies and people say to calm down and it's fine, it gets worse later.
---
Many people wouldn't have bothered buying this game if we weren't told up front it'd all be cosmetic. Even fewer if we knew it eventually wouldn't be.
---
Spamming one subject posts in a place we know they watch is about all we can do from here. If annoying a few people is the cost of that, so be it.
---
Bethe$da does not care about you.  They care about the whales.  Did anyone buy skins and cosmetics?  Guess what?  You told them you would buy more.  That's the lesson gamers never learn.
---
Hearthstone, Elder Scrolls card game, Fallout Shelter, WoW, Fortnite, Apex Legends, and any other MTX game making money hand over fist has told the big publishers, "Nickle and dime them, they'll bitch; but they'll buy."
---
Mark my words.  Bethesda is going to push this through.  This game will be a the next paid upfront MMO with MTX and even though the community is up in arms; those level 300+'s are going to shower them with unearned extra cash.
---
I feel your frustration. Let's see... Any tamed animals? I might guess workshops too but if you went all those places you didn't take any workshops Soo... Any active quests? Have you noticed any items duplicating in your inventory? 
---
DON'T JOIN A PVP SERVER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PVP, tf is so hard to understand about that?
---
Showing up first try. Sweet!
---
Thanks, I was attempting to illustrate what being self-righteous was actually like.
---
Oh got ya oh okay thanks 
---
And my point, is that as _publicly facing aspects of this company_ they should have been made _aware_ of this potential disaster. 
---
My point is, this is yet another failure for bethesda. They should have been _on_ this shit, they should have been _ready_ for this shit. 
---
Just because someone chooses not to buy the kit doesnt mean that guy over there wont. 
---
By spending real money it gives ppl the ability not to truly play “survival”. We are in the wasteland. We are suppose to be out there looking for junk rss etc.
---
This is a step in the wrong direction and by arguing and calling out ur fellow community you arent helping.

The text based Grognak game is there. I got it and it's the only reason I built a terminal at my camp lol. It's at Grafton Dam. Here is a video of it. It's only about 11/2 minutes. Not my video but it'll take you right to it.
---
cough...cough "Anthem"
---
No, you have to do a mini quest to learn how to craft it.
---
I get why you are upset, I just disagree with your viewpoint. And your repeated accusations of trolling and insults aren't allowed on this sub.
---
LOL so they can be crucified?  The repair kits are not coming this Tuesday.  So let's just wait.  I'm sure a blind person would see all the posts made already.
---
Now compare that to my next comment, which I commented preemptively.
---
Which one has more of a self-righteous tone?
---
The second.
---
That’s because it’s actually self-righteous. 
---
Keep giving corporate head, it's fine.
---
Bethesda:
---
"Cup the balls...."
---
"Make eye contact"
---
"You know we love you Fanboys, right?"
---
I feel like a dick saying I told you so to people at this point. I had a feeling shit like this would come the second they said MTX were in it.
---
I fucking hate mtx tbh.
---
I got hooked on NV, played through 4 and then 3.  I really like 76 and like the idea of making it multi-player for collaboration and social aspects, but not a fan of PvP.  Also not a fan of the real time combat.  I always liked the fact that in earlier versions, when I was attacked- I could go into my gear ( which would pause the attack) and figure out my actions and equip what made sense.  In 76, if you have to go into the pip-boy during combat, you’re toast.  The quick menus are helpful, but not great.  The real time combat took away some of the gameplay I liked to do at my own pace.
---
It’s still fun, just really different.  Most of the other players have been cool to me. I play solo and usually mind my own business - occasionally trading.
---
They are trying a lot of new things with this game which not everyone likes, but its still got many of the aspects of the fallout I love.
---
Very interesting...what is the quest?
---
XSlamxHammerX psn, I'll be on later tonight or if you want to at some point again you can add me, I'm lvl 120
---
Actually yes, 2 notes i keep dropping some how keep ending up back in my inventory the trappers note and the gourmands note
---
As a dlc pack costs the same as a single skin in this is much much much rather have dlc.
---
Your executed it with precision.
---
Pic?
---
I do PVP. Killed the guy in question later when he came after me in a workshop. Sometimes I want to PVP, sometimes I don't. But if there are weapons exclusive to the survival servers then I am going to be on them until I unlock them. They can keep fighting eachother and me when I'm out and about. If I'm at my CAMP I'm going to be doing what I normally do. I shouldn't be forced to delete the camp that is really nice and convenient in adventure just to get 120 criticals in survival. 
---
I get what you're saying, but I'm really not being intrusive on anyone else's experience. I'm in and out until next week.
---
I been playing all day on PS4.  Just stopped a short time ago to watch some TV.  
---
It’s honestly a marketing strategy at this point. They’ve kept people talking about this completely forgettable game for months.
---
I bet theres a lot of idiots with too much money that will buy these too.
---
Here's my personal wishlist:
---
X-01 enclave paint (I already have blackbird, but I would still want one with the nuclear reactor like in FNV, even if it's just painted on)
---
Excavator paint to make you look like thomas the tank engine
---
Vault 13 jumpsuit
---
Ulysses's Duster
---
NCR Ranger Duster (and maybe the desert ranger one from HH)
---
Joshua Graham's outfit (or at least the face mask)
---
Now that you mention it, I want the prostitute outfit from FNV so I can put that nipple tape over my hairy chest
---
Classic fallout leather jacket, maybe even a CLJ from fallout 2
---
Any of these would drain me of my atoms faster than the glitched assaultron head
---
I don't remember the name but you can find it in the banker where you start the free states quest line. It'll be a terminal entry
---
We all do get upset about things.  Lots of things.  Myself included.  
---
And we also have a choice about how to express our anger.  Again, all of us.
---
Including myself.
---
I think you are reading waaaaaay too much into this.  And I truly feel bad you wasted so much time  writing a novel of a reply.  I got the jist of your opinion after two sentences.  
---
I prefer fallout 1 and 2 over what Bethesda has done tbh, but I get millennials don’t like that format. 
---
You think you could make an updated post with all fixed bugs and whatever accidentally got added?
---
Yeah, I know. I run a t-51b chest, for that reason. My question is why _mods_ specifically. 
---
I been playing all day on PS4. Just stopped a short time ago to watch some TV.
---
I am on xbox and same.  Either just drop to homescreen or freezing with an awful noise.   
---
Hell yeah we would. Locking any significant non-cosmetic content behind a paywall is a slap in the face to us consumers. I believe cosmetic content shouldn't be nickel and dimed either, but we lost that battle years ago.
---
Great Camp design! Really creative and cool.
---
Creativity: 10/10
---
Loved the design of the bathroom and the use of confetti piles for the underwater area, and the use of lights make it look great! 
---
Looks: 12/15
---
I liked the inside, although the outside of the camp could use some more flair, and the top floor, while good. Practically, the top floor is great, but slightly bland.
---
Location: 4/5 
---
I liked the location, but as it is in the mire, which is my personally, least favorite location in the game. A bit gloomy for my tastes. I gave you a point for being near the Purveyor location, which will eventually help, if you stay here that is.
---
Use: 8/10
---
While the crafting area was good, I think a farm would be great, however you had some corn and razor grain, presumably for nukashine, so I can’t take off too many points.
---
Overall, great camp! Loved how creative it was, thanks for having me.
---
That's a good question. I'd have to assume so, since I've never heard anyone speaking anything but English when playing, and I'm in the US.
---
Sister Hildegard and The Fabulous Arlene. (Well, ‘The Fabulous’ isn’t on her Vault-Tec ID, but it goes without saying)
---
Thankyou!
---
Well...since Fallout 3.
---
I agree with this 100%. The equivalent of $15 for a paint job is insane. I would purchase atoms if there were more items that were cheaper but I don’t feel like much of what’s on there is properly valued. 
---
I started with ps2 brotherhood of steel and have been hooked since. I even went back and played 1 and 2 after it was gifted from Bethesda due to release issues from 76.
---
Are you kidding?  Just look at the shit gamers throw their fucking money at?  You think Blizzard is upset at their loot boxes for their paid for game?  You think Fortnite and Apex give a shit if people think MTX is bullshit?  Do you think Gearbox gives a shit that you don't want to use Epic's unsecure launcher?
---
Fuck no.  Because gamers buy this crap.  GTA online?  You guys have been buying garbage as Ponzi schemes for a decade, and it show only a minor setback by the recent flaming of 76, BF2 and Anthem.
---
They know what to do.  They are going to put out a cutscenes trailer with some dope ass music and showoff the coolest shit so you pre-order [Insert IP + sequel # here], and then dangle cheap crap toys and products as a tack on bonus.  Why?
---
Cause gamers keep buying it.
---
Then don't make PVP server exclusive challenges? I did PVP while I was on and even killed the guy later when he went after me after one of my defense events on a workshop? If I can prevent my CAMP from being destroyed (which doesn't give them any tangible benefits) I'm going to. 
---
ive given up on these guys.   lol.  have no idea how they can justify atoms no a microtransaction.    mental gymnastics
---
I'd say our most typical start time is late afternoon/early evening on Sundays, but it varies and we use alt characters to carry everything (so sometimes we'll be online but just adventuring/surviving together on our main characters) - but basically: we run the shop and post on reddit when our schedules align!
---
I'm not the one saying that he should gtfo. I was just explaining why someone might be asking why they're here.
---
In total I think I spent about 2500 dimes to support the game, so does that mean I'm allowed to complain? 😀
---
Still better than having a Gigasaur walk up and eat you base in a few chomps.  Or having months of work lost because someone glitched into your camp and jacked everything you own.  I've yet to run into any issue in Fallout that's set me back more than a day.  Ark or Rust ( referenced before ), I've lost things that would take months to get back.  Griefing sucks, but walk it off.  You'll be fine.
---
If only they had text chat. I feel bad for people who are mute and can't play this game. 
---
Winterized paint: no
---
Respec: no
---
Still better than Anthem: yes
---
I say neither bethesda lost all right to profitability from this game when they botched the launch. Heck maybe as way back as when they made it always online rather than peer to peer co-op.
---
Please dont break things in the "real" game just because you want to pvp. We gave you your own Servers for a reason. 
---
I understand your question now. I’m looking for the mods instead of the plans because I don’t have anything like flux or the power armor crafting perks yet for mods. 
---
Me too psn PepperedBacon 
---
Well come on, now you HAVE to say it. 
---
If Bethesda was paying me sure! I've spent close to 40 hours working on the original list with additions and updates. Unfortunately I'm no longer motivated to keep it up to date. 
---
That's a cosmetic 
---
Definitely wonky. Long load times and disconnects. Last night I kept getting the disconnect notice while I was in the start up menu, after leaving a server.  
---
How's about some MECHANIST ARMOR
---
(Obviously stats needs to be tweaked a bit)
---
Once we're in 'shop mode' we tend to have lines and it's hard to keep track of everyone's inventory and answer specific questions - partly, too, it's designed to be an in-game experience, so I'd encourage you to drop by next time we're doing it and see what we've got. As for me: I don't tend to keep a lot of beserkers stuff, but usually have a few things , particularly if I find it on an otherwise top-notch weapon (e.g. a handmade).
---
Salt regarding food? With how quick it spoils you'd think the food is saltless.
---
Get a life. If something like this has you so riled up and crude, you need something else in your life. Say what you want. You're not dragging me into your whinging or your immaturity or ugliness.
---
Nobody is gonna do anything, people are gonna complain for a week or two then forget about it.
---
How is it confounding?  The community here literally went batshit over buying crap from the store that was in the base game of FO4.  Why would they not try to milk more out of someone's wallet when they have already proven so many times over that they will pay for rehashed bullshit.
---
Yeah, I’m the only one around, no hits on the target.  
---
My thing with NV, is I love the exploration in fallout and the desert just felt empty, samey and boring in a bad way, plus as you get closer to the strip, I found the small towns kinda blurred together 
---
I reread the thing I’m responding to. I get it now
---
What PVP fights are you having that are so long and drawn out that the victor is determined by who can repair their weapon the fastest? That is the most absurd scenario for P2W I've heard so far. And what makes you think you can hot key a repair kit in any case? You still have to select which weapon to repair leaving you completely vulnerable in the pipboy.... this is all speculation. You're arguing a slippery slope but the facts are only as follows:  
---
They want to sell *basic repair kits* in the atom shop
---
&gt; People will also never have to grind to repair their stuff, they will just buy kits 
---
If you're playing this game at all you aren't grinding for repair materials. Personally I sell most of my junk in bulk because I collect it faster than I can even use it. You're arguing another slippery slope where apparently people are just buying repair kits all the time and it's some how making them invincible. It's basically ordering take out when you've got food at home.  
---
&gt; On top of that, they nerfed white knight perk so people would buy more repair kits...
---
They nerfed it to be inline with similar perks, then reduced repair costs overall
---
&gt; food is degrading much faster since the new update in preparation for fridges 
---
This is a bug, you are connecting dots in a non-existent conspiracy
---
You know you can just place your camp again and everything fixes.  Although I'm not sure what that does with items you didn't place.
---
PSA:  You don't have to repair your camp if you build it right.  You can just move it for the cost of caps and everything rebuilds automatically.
---
I have about 80% of my camp on the same foundation, so it all gets stored as one item.  When I move it, all I have to do is plop down that one foundation, and everything touching it is rebuilt.  No materials necessary.
---
Most recipes are useless as there's something that doesn't use the recipe that'll generally have the exact same effect. There are a few exceptions. 
---
its because this and the other things they mention cross a boundary.  if this happens the shop will no longer be cosmetic only, as it is now and they said it would stay. 
---
Its not that the repair kit itself is a huge deal,  its ehat comes next if they believe players will pay
---
Found the bethesda and/or zenimax employee. Ey tell Todd we don't want paid shortcuts.
---
person A is PVP with person B.
---
both of their most powerful weapons break. 
---
person A bought repair kits, person B didn't. person repairs powerful gun and kills person B. 
---
repair kits are 100 percent P2W. 
---
If I move my camp it will never go down again. 
---
It says you unlock them through the atom shop. 
---
I will spend real world money on that
---
Fallout Tactics wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Granted it's definitely not a typical FO, and made little sense lore wise at the time (only to be made more confusing with FO3 onwards), but as a tactical RPG it was entertaining. It's probably better to go into it with low expectations. 
---
You can't prove it without reverting to a previous version. Bethesda is looking into it and the point is to wait now and see if it is a bug or an intended feature. 
---
did any dataminers release a SS? i cant seem to find any pics. (a few times we got lucky and they were able to pull them)
---
You honestly think that's going to change my presentation?
---
You think too highly of yourself Ms. Poppins.
---
No whining from me...
---
Forgot the internet requires think skin....
---
Unless on Reddit...
---
Integrity is what makes success, if you don't know this...
---
I'll wait for you to finish school.
---
Yeah ppl are going batshit for nothing if this means cheaper skins I’m all for it 
---
The fuck is whinging?
---
So just gonna act like I didn’t say that only QOL items should be in the store? Nobody here’s arguing for buffs or legendaries..
---
BoS in Appalachia wasn't even a retcon. It was a realistic scenario.
---
I bought because its fallout. NV was good but I hated the premise, dude lived his life in the wasteland and became a badass after he was "killed", the others came to it when their world changes.
---
1) This isn't a subscription model game
---
2) if the server costs are too high then they can make an offline version and I'm all good
---
I would prefer they focus on giving us a Fallout 76 pip boy app, even one that doesn't actually do anything but display stats would be okay with me.  
---
I understand.  However as someone who's rebuilt their camp about 30+ times since the beta, it happens.  At least you know yours was destroyed by someone.  My camp was destroyed at least 8 times by the server before they patched in saving everything if someone was in your spot already.
---
That's a fair point. Over on the Destiny sub, if there's enough threads on one subject, mods make a Megathread and start closing dupe posts. Perhaps something of that nature would be good for this. FO76 shares some mods with that sub, so hopefully the idea makes the jump so we can clear some space.
---
It feels like there is a tiny amount of aim assist for controllers, so the issue would be allowing mouse and keyboard users to gain that ability. I know Overwatch let's you use both, but there is no aim assist there.
---
Lol what?
---
I'm just waiting for a power armor skin with a little more..  Dare I say..  Horsepower..
---
Gosh darnit we need the ranger armor. They could even bring it in for free and sell us skins for that for extra $$. I'd definitely buy an updated NCR desert Ranger skin
---
I would put money in the fact that these new dungeons will have workbench scattered throughout them, just like the missile silos, and pretty much every other dungeon (ie, large interior location). And it's not like you need to gather or carry around the materials--just like any other crafting, if you have the scrap in your stash, you have access to it at any workbench. Sooo pretty much workbench repairing with fix it good/weapon artisan is always going to beat using a repair kit. Even in the middle of the sbq fight, I'd rather take the 30 seconds to run over to the shack work the weapon and armor bench than use a basic repair kit.
---
That's a high traffic area, probably the reason for the attack.  I currently live in the Toxic Valley, rarely see other players.
---
I already do buy them with caps from the market, and probably for less than the vendor would sell them for, but that somehow feels less unbalanced than an exotic vendor.

Tanner Alvarez was an odd one, even before the accident. Born on the 4th of January 2077, Tanner lost his parents a near week later to the Reds. On the 10th, six days later, his father was lost during the counterattack on Anchorage-- and his mother soon after. Suicide. A real nasty business that.
---
Tanner was soon taken in by the Alvarez family, close friends of his mother. His foster father, Luis "Wally" Alvarez was a physicist, a renowned one at that. A brilliant mind among many. While his new mother Milly, was an _agricultural scientist_, meaning she could grow what she could with what she had. She weren't necessarily rocket scientists, but she was a survivor through and through. She'd earned her spot in Vault 76, along with her husband, as much to the behest of the 'real' scientists.
---
The only life Tanner knew was vault life. Recycled fluids, stale air, and dirt. Lots of dirt, vegetables, and science homework. Oh, how he hated that. Often times his homework was to do maintenance on the vault along with the Mr. Handy's, or learn how to grow carrots on steel plates with his mother. To Tanner, there was always a dull moment.
---
Sometime after his thirteenth birthday, Tanner, along with some friends, figured out how to make firecrackers from Sugar Bombs and potato starch. For years after they were the bonafide rulers of the vault. The coolest of kids. You wanted some firecrackers? See Tanner. You want the tastiest tatoes  this side of the vault? See Tanner. You want some mischief? Tanner will find you. And on and on he went for years. Top dog Tanner.
---
Until the accident. 
---
At twenty-five years old, both his foster parents had been lost to cancer. It was just him and his cronies now. He often found himself distracted from his work, or when hanging out with the guys. It was just inconceivable to him, that they'd leave him so soon. Despite his worries, he still found he needed to work. Maintenance and vegetables. Someone had to.
---
Someone had stuck a firecracker in the reactor core. He felt a pang of guilt at that. Is that the kind of thing he would've done when he was younger? Probably. It would be so much work to remove it without it going ***pop***, he half wondered how it got there. Opening the core with a hiss, he had nothing other to do than stick his gloved hand into the reactor. His face was an opened grimace when he found himself stuck. His arm thrusted into the source of power, of _life_, for the vault, stuck. The door behind him sealed to prevent radiation leakage to the vault. The was alone and would stay alone for some time unless he did something.
---
The room was slowly filling with radiation. Time was short. Tanner's hazmat suit was stuck between a rock and a hard place, pinched as the reactor forced an emergency close to the core's access panel. The only was out was to cut himself out of the suit.
---
He could feel the heat. It was the only thing he could feel. The boiling and charring of his flesh was only second to the heat. He spent hours with the heat. Days. Years. Millennia. Heat became all he knew. All he'd ever known. And he's going to make sure it's all you'll ever know, too.
---
[Tanner comes out of Vault 76 alone, dirty, and burned. He'll use explosives and molotovs until he gets his hands on a flamer. He builds small homes with expansive gardens, and many traps for the unwary.]
---
[At first Tanner will want to spread the Flame to everyone. Raider, Dweller, and the Scroched alike. Until he comes across the Brotherhood of Steel. He feels for their cause as it reminds him of his birth parents. So he'll dawn their armor (T-51), and continue his twisted crusade against the enemies of the Brotherhood.]

It's probably because this needs to more formal and thought out. The previous ones where just things fans would say and the people pass it on but this change could be a major decision so hopefully by Tuesday we'll get something official.

Add me GuidoXXL.

I'll help you out.

I know but every time I try and move it...it doesn't fit. So it isn't worth it. And I liked it where it was and feel that I shouldn't have to be made to move? Hope you understand what I'm trying to say 
---
Ewwwww we wanna be strong and have fun not this 
---
Yea I've seen it too.  It starts with just one or two, and more and more slowly fly in.
---
They could make them free, but they wouldn't make money this way.
---
It's easy to make repair kits.
---
It's easy to nerf skills.
---
Easy money for them, but that's so unforgivably short-sighted :/ The PR fallout from this game (pun intended) will be drastic for the years to come.
---
I will be certain never to purchase their release for more than 20% of the base price.
---
Even got a suspension from communicating on Xbox live for letting the fella know exactly how I felt about him. 🙄
---
Well not a revolver but i have a legendary pipe-rifle (automatic) with the 2 shot mod
---
That seems super cheap and exploitative, but based on votes, nobody agrees with me. The only way to get to you is to interact with an object and phase through a wall. You can easily kill people during animations and they have no way to fight you fairly.
---
Then be sloshed for ever! 
---
I know people are looking at the principal of it.  But these items are useless to me.  I use all the perks to keep my stuff in good shape.  Plus I carry three weapons on average along with power and full bos combat armor.  I'm well equipped if something breaks.  It's all about being prepared.
---
I want finished interior walls! 
---
I sent you a friend request! Thank you!
---
My handemade does like 90 something dmg. Guess mine sucks cause it takes a good while to put an enemy down. Mostly have to switch to my bowie knife to get the job done. 
---
This has been my experience as well.
---
Guess you haven't seen this happen to other games?
---
Black desert online was the same way at first. Promises of no p2w while they slowly introduced convenience items. Eventually it became much closer to p2w. 
---
Other games have done the same. There is right to be worried.
---
It's Wastelad. I had never heard of it and you got me curious lol.
---
Yet another reason why I won't play this game. I wanted to love it, I really did. But Bethesda lying about not making the atomic shop 'pay to win' or giving any player advantage is the nail in the coffin for me. I used to love BGS but they have become a greedy shell of their former great selves.  Next up, loot boxes mark my words. Lunch Boxes with weapons...they are coming.   
---
Pete Hines &amp; Todd Howard are no longer trust worthy; their words mean nothing.  We are cows to be milked in their eyes. Game design for fun &amp; innovation is dead at BGS, now it's all about monetization and nothing else. Exploit the players; get in their wallets. It's not even subtle. Look at ES Blades and that ludicrous cash shop. Nope. Not on my machines. Good-Bye BGS. 
---
Hahahah yes, they do. They do. 
---
Enjoy the surprise.

Rape is just a surprise sex.
---
Surprise!

You can also try Grafton but not the train station vendor.
---
I'm building a set of t51 and feel the no flux pain
---
Enough I get the point!
---
I just keep some diluted RadAway on hand.  Diluted offers a bit more control over just how many Rads I want to reduce.
---
Wow, imagine the real struggle in life, how are you going to react?
---
The carnivore mutation for me. Hungry? Just go kill something and immediately eat it. No perk card use that way either. 
---
**IF, I can build a Repair kit to bring with me, that weighs less than a spare copy of the item itself?
---
That is universal enough to apply to whichever pieces break, so I don't need spares of everything? 
---
**If that means I can play through my long mission without needing to leave, abandon and restart the whole thing over? 
---
*if that improves my individual and cooperative gaming experience. I don't hate it. 
---
As mentioned above, a repair kit is not radically different from a stim heal. 
---
And Bethesda already has in game regeneration, and revival, including, of course auto stim equipment and perks. Regen perks and equipment. Auto revival perks. 
---
Why make them untradable though? 
---
I can see one argument for that, but 7 against. At least.  
---
In a game that supposedly wants to encourage cross player market trading bartering... 
---
I have the jetpack, how much do you offer? 
---
Really I didn't know there was a any aim assist, the controller's I feel like it's so much easier to aim with a mouse but I really like using the PS4 controller
---
Posted this at work during my break, but I’ll be on soon!?
---
i have the jetpack , how much caps

Yesterday while with my friends, a level 8 ran over to us. I pulled out my chainsaw, he gave me a thumbs up.   I touch him with my chainsaw while its on, he falls to his knees.  Everyone is like "whoa dude you going to help him up" then thats where I ate him with my cannibal perk.    
---
Morale of the story is while outsiders might think I was doing bad, I was actually trying to show new player too important things, Flaming chainsaws are awesome and you can EAT people. :D
---
I'm scared to leave the vault but you've convinced me to venture out so I will join you! My Bethesda user name is the same as my Reddit name!
---
&gt;Why make them untradable though? I can see one argument for that, but 7 against. At least.  
---

---
Because they're just adding a new plan to the same system that populates the rest of the Atom shop.  New behavior would require more development and test time.
---
To be fair, inside the vault says they can’t be dropped, sold to vendors, or traded with other players.

Like they are going downhill with this game they need to LISTEN to what we would want.
---
It really is awesome. You are an inspiration for building. I hope I can one day make something so cool. 
---
&gt;Mutations you can farm in a few minutes at a pool of radiation? Stimpacks and radaway thrown at you constantly? I wouldn’t care...
---
Apparently you don't understand the concept of "creeping incrementalism".
---
It starts as repair kits. Then they add radaway. A month later, they add stimpacks. Then mutations another month down the line.
---
Then, within a year or two, all the equipment and weapons you can find in game suck ass, atoms end up extremely hard to find in-game to "provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment", and in order to not get killed every five minutes your only choice is to spend real money to buy that two-shot explosive and X-01 power armor from the atom store.
---
True, it might not go *that* far, but it'll go far enough for you to *start* caring quite a bit, and that's what you should care about now.
---
Just get the Good Doggy perk and survive on decades old canned dog food and botulism. Or source your meat fresh with the Cannibal perk like a savage wastelander.
---
Yeah it's a little more concerning now
---
That doesn't make it OK.
---
But you can "move" it like one step away from where it already is.  Pick up your CAMP item, walk one pace, put it down.  Done.  You can build everything at the same location.
---
But yes, I understand what you're saying about not wanting to be in the situation in the first place.  They're changing that in a future update, thankfully.
---
Lost of false statements in there so let me break it down..
---
Which camp structures that require flux can you pay for? A: there is none. If you’re talking about someone destroying your decontamination shower then realize Bethesda’s already patching the pacifist mode to prevent people from destroying it. 
---
The problem with your statement is that while you’re killing enemies to get materials for flux you’re already collecting the materials needed to fix your armor and weapons, the games cool like that. It takes basically no materials to fix your weapons and armor it’s almost laughable and even if you had a broken piece you would still be able to farm materials just as fast.
---
This is not pay to win because while you’re farming for flux you’re bound to run into a legendary or boss enemy who will drop an improved repair kit thus allowing you to stay out longer while farming. Repairing armor is a chore, that’s why these are QOL items but it’s ridiculous to say they’re gonna allow someone to get ahead of you in any substantial way when you could purchase them for free with currency earned in game and also find better repair kits around the map.
---
Then maybe the servers should have different rules? These changes have made PvP unbearable 
---
Bethesda/Zenimax have no public shareholders
---
You can already repair at stations for cheap you say? Lasts you a long time you say?  
---
Shhhh. Don't give them ideas.
---
Yes I think that you need to set pacifist in your settings, stay out of Survival mode (play Adventure mode) and after the next patch, people won't be able to damage your CAMP anymore.
---
You'll still have to find a place that is safe from monsters and setup some CAMP defenses, but turrets are also supposed to be improved with the patch so they may actually help now.
---
Don't despair
---
That was one thing that kind of pissed me off about this game. It is/was broke to shit and yet they still have time to crank out all those reskins for the damn store. 
---
*FBI knocks on your door* "Come with us now!"
---
It wouldn't be easy but it should really  set this game apart from other survival multiplayer games tut there
---
Now THAT would be cool, I'd hunt for his holo tape
---
You didn't do anything. They were just being jerks.
---
Beauty.
---
And let me have 7.62 for the Handmade
---
Just disconnected again.  This time whilst having a go at a queen.  Guess the game is telling me to throw the towel in for the night
---
That's why I ended up building my CAMP around a single foundation.  If it ever were destroyed, it would be trivial to replace.
---
I can't wait for them to make CAMPS immune in Adventure.  Now that Survival mode exists, these so-called "Raiders" are just lame, unwilling to take what they dish out to others.
---
A delete button
---
All those combined would be pretty P2W. Especially in survival mode where you could just dump your scrap you stole off someone into your stash and they'd never get it back. You have a direct advantage over them. Same with food preserved longer, etc. You'd be at a distinct advantage in being able to farm less food. So you can farm more of other things. If you have ammo conversion mixed in then you are now suddenly not having to farm as hard for ammo. Meaning you can be better prepared for PVP at most times than other players.
---
Where's the fun if everyone is strong in exactly the same way?
---
it feels pretty gross that perk cards got nerfed and now repair kits will make life easier and food spoils faster and now we hear rumors of a fridge... it feels dirty and underhanded and really just a slap in the face.
---
like the op, I'm neither child nor sports fan and with sadness I'll go elsewhere.
---
(and why does our disease timers not expire while logged out but our food expires while logged out)
---
So you refuse to acknowledge that you can earn these “atoms” in game? Again I said those items are not Pay to Win, maybe Pay to convenience is a more apt term but in a game with no real end goal then you can’t Pay to Win for QOL items.
---
I’ll bet the fridge and ammo station can be earned in game the same as the repair kits, whether you choose to grind for them is on you but it doesn’t make these items pay to win to include them in the atomic shop imo.
---
you can sing it
---
When you go straight to unrelated and unfounded personal attacks, I know you have quality opinions to give. /s
---
Blades is a bot different it's a phone game and par for the course 76 is a bigger issue

"I get killed in pvp, nerf it"
---
Is there anyway to stop this without me deleting my character? 
---
This isn't an offline model game
---
Or provide a way to gift the excess to someone else.
---
Pure speculation 
---
Does modding all 5 of my armor to Ultra-Light by itself allow you to gain the benefit from the Chameleon mutation?  Or do I still need the Weightless prefix?
---
As would I
---
Four words. What the hell are reactive plates? Ok, so I lied it was 6 words, LoL 😂
---
Just don't do it.  Simple.  Keep the game as it is.
---
That's exactly my concern.
---
And it's been done elsewhere.
---
Need more space?
---
Need a revive?
---
Need a character transfer bank?
---
Buy this premium item, but it's bound... 
---
Want to unlock a bound item?
---
Etc. Etc. Etc. 
---
There already is an atom exclusive rifle! Someone with a vualt tech skin on their hunting rifle **obviously** has an advantage over my stock rifle!
---
No she’s in the game bro, she’s big into cosplay lol we run traaaaains on her in watoga 😂 
---
A graphic artists isn't going to patch bugs, but someone who coded in repair kits sure they hell could have. 
---
So the Ultra-Light mod by itself isn't enough to qualify it for Chameleon mutation?  It would still require the Weightless legendary mod?
---
What are you talking about, I spent at least an 2 hours throwing buckets of paint at you for make that skin! Shouldn't my time be worth at least minimum wage?
---
The gauss has to fire magnetic slugs though, so generally just iron. You could add a heavy metal penetrator core but would lose some velocity.
---
Not that this game comes even close to hard sci-fi though, we have magic weapons and armor and gimmicky perks.
---
I have not found anything by Bethesda saying the food degradation is a bug. I still think the white knight perk was nerfed to inspire more repair kit purchase. And I have had to grind to repair before. Adhesive and aluminum. 
---
Basically do anything BUT P2W garbage.
---
Cookie?
---
You have weapon weight reductions.  Mine weighs 10 lbs.
---
Weight reductions don't count in Stash.

---
Are you using weight reduction perks or armor? Those perks will not transfer to stash weights
---
il hard pass, seems like just a ton of unneeded and indirect nerfs.  
---
on the pve ones:
---
TS: already nerfed to hell, shit hipfire, still eats extra durability? (have not personally tested)
---
weightless: already not used/not popular, people pretty much grab it for "carry everything" armor setups
---
chameleon: stealth is already having issues without nerfs
---
explosive: risk of self damage/suicide depending on build/range
---
vampire: lol it heals 5/hit, my heal perk in endurance outheals slow firing weapons, how does this need a downside?
---
nocturnal:  already useless, and already works similar to how you described, just based off the time of day
---
imho a "debuff" wouldnt change anything in survival, people would still just find the best min/max combo and run that build anyway.  all it would do is make PvE (the main game) suffer.
---
I agree, just saying blades is another example of Bethesda falling to greed
---
So animals would apply to creatures such as: mongrels, mole rats, radstag, yao guai, megasloth. Probably (but unsure) would apply to gulpers, honey beasts, deathclaws..anything in relation to an animal.
---
Scorchbeast I believe are considered scorched and I think the zealot effect applies there, while a bloatfly would be a bug and the exterminator effect would apply to them.
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong
---
Allot of what you said is speculation tho and directly ignores a large premise of my argument. I said how can it be pay to win if we’re talking about QOL items and those can be earned in game at a steady rate thru free currency and item drops? You’re basically assuming someone is gonna be at a disadvantage because a whale can just PvP all day without having to grind to fix their gun? How does that really effect anyone? Play a little PE and you’ll have even better items than said whale. 
---
I discovered fallout with 3, and have played every iteration since while also going back to play previous iterations on my PC. I love the lore and the humor present in all the games. I bought this because it was fallout, and I still love it - I accept it as a different type of game set in the world of fallout, and that is why I personally can still enjoy it as much as I did New Vegas. 
---
While I’ve had a few issues with it, I’ve never been a hardcore gamer (I play a lot, but I don’t consider myself hardcore) so I guess that’s why I don’t take issue with the game itself or the way everyone seems to believe it’s moving towards a P2W model. 
---
Man, this is a tough one. I mean this might be all code based and there is nothing we can do to fix it. I will have to give a think on the duplicating notes thing. You could wait to hear back from Bethesda, at least we have more info to go on. If you are thinking about deleting your character anyways, I would try moving my camp first. It might do absolutely nothing, but it's probably the closest thing to resetting some of the data associated with your character. Who knows?
---
Cut the current prices in half and see what happens. If the money flows, they're good. If it isn't as much as they'd like, reduce it a bit further. 
---
I think I get where you're coming from. Their cost out-of-pocket is almost entirely a one-time fee unless I'm mistaken. Spread that cost over 1k purchases it might have cost them $2 or $3. Spread that cost over 100k purchases and their cost per item sold is no more than 30 cents. :)
---
Ss?
---
The battle of Huntersville happened before the Scorched were set loose. The Brotherhood then lost most of its senior members in the failed attack on the glassed cavern, and the rest when the scorched attacked Fort Defiance. Any survivors would have to have been on a long range recon mission or deserters.
---
there are still fanboys out there that buy up all the bullshit this bastard of a game serves up. Looks like we've both been downvoted for calling out this fuckery. Zenimax is the engine behind this greedy cash grab. They did the same thing with ESO. Any online service of a BGS game is a Zenimax creation. I wish I would've seen this from the start.
---
I'll try it thank you for the help 
---
This *game* sounds like a Vault-Tec experiment. 
---
I finished tactics once, barely. It was not the best game. It wasn't even really that bad, just wildly different and slightly too clunky. Also kind of weird. I played BOS and didn't like the graphics/game play. It had that weird beginning of 3d graphics where everything was dark and painful to look at.
---
So many people here don't seem to understand the concept of creeping incrementalism.
---
That's okay, because you'll start caring in a year or two from now when I've killed you 20 times in a row with the two-shot explosive gatling gun and X-01 Power Armor I bought from the Atom Store for $50 a pop.
---
Oh super sledge my bad.  I believe I saw a dark green and black one. It looked slick.
---
Ahh, I didn't realize it was related directly to the battle of Huntersville. I derped.
---
screenshot, sorry for shorthanding i keep forgetting there are different uses for abbreviations 
---
Exactly. Where I work, when your shit is on fire, it's all hands on deck.  
---
I guess I just don't understand why it's acceptable to release an unfinished product or service and then not even try.
---
 I imagine their coding is much the same as it has been for years, if modders can figure it out and fix their games, for years, for free... 
---
I'm not one to start a pvp fight with a low level weapon, so not too sure lol. Don't exactly have friends who play to test it with either. 
---
I'd imagine it works in PvP. Seems about the same as Assassins for PvP. Player/Human seem like different flags though. Would be interesting if someone could see if it works on "former" humans (scorched, ghouls, etc.).
---
It's 3 am in my time zone, but feel free to add me if you wanna team up later.

Same I should've cancelled preorder in the beta.
---
Oh my bad again😂 I’ll link it
---
Not at all. I was just answering the original question from the title.  That's why.
---
Well, I was going for a power armor build. Right now I'm not wearing power armor often cause I have like 4 fusion cores to my name. I know where to get more, I just haven't worried about that right now. I'd be happy with both a power armor build and an unarmed build for when I don't have power armor on. I just want it to be more of a solo build than a team build for those times I'm not on a team.
---
nah its my bad, i need to learn to be more specific  with my words 🤣
---
A small fee for the plan/recipe, say 300 Atoms or less, I'd be fine with. My current guess is that they'll be as much as 300 Atoms per single-use consumable ... 
---
I paid 1k for my one on Xbox, what do u want? I have a Gatling gun cannot remember the effect. I’ll check
---
I last played on Sunday, with I recall little over 600 hours as per game's counter.
---
I've played older Fallouts inside out, 1 and 2 several times, tactics at least few times, Fallout 3 maybe with 2 chars, Fallout 4 first for nearly full playtrough, then survival mode came out and I desided to restart as it was great moment to do so, and played till about level 200 and nearly did everything the same. I didn't fully complete all addons, but mostly. For example Nuka world last few things seemed partially bugged, or I would have needed to do some more stuff out on the "mainlain". But nearly did everything, same as Far Harbour, only left some final quests incomplete as not to make final desisions.
---
I don't fully subscribe to "fandom", I've liked to play all PC Fallouts, I definitely have not tried the mobile Fallout and don't think I will. Im sure Bethesda can make so bad PC Fallout that I won't really like to play it, but well, they haven't yet. Although I worry abit like when Fallout 5 will come out. Will it be "enough"? Will it have enough of "new" stuff. Or will it be just Fallout 4, with some Fallout 76 improvements, on new map. Bethesda is doing mostly the same thing over and over. They aren't good at dropping really new stuff, like procedural dungeon creation.
---
I find my Fallount 76 gameplay very similiar to how I played Fallout 4. Sure, here I can't have 400k bottlecaps, I can't have over 10k of gauss ammo, I can't have huge amounts of different armor sets. But besides that, Im playing it very similiarly. Killing everything. Looting nearly everything(worth looting), exploring slowly everything.

Initially I guess I expected more from online Fallout before I saw how it was, but now I see it's not quite as easy to deliver game like this as full blown online game. I think this is not the last online Fallout we will see, though I'm not expecting a new "version" anytime soon. Like in next 10 years. It will probably take longer.
---
Good post, I watched few new threads here and so many are about so small things, like repair kits on Atom shop. Who cares, certainly not me, jeez. 
---
If it's anything like the ESO store, you guys are freaking out over literally nothing. ZOS has repair kits and random easily avoided or made crap in their store too. They'll probably gonna make loot crates at some point and are populating the store with filler. That's my guess. 
---
No Legendary Pipe Revolver, Chainsaw &amp; Bone club.
---
I would agree with that statement if Maxson hadn't been used in 76 to change some fundamental ideas about the BoS later. There are some very hard lines drawn that conflict with and change the tone of the BoS in FO 1 and 2.
---
But they are mostly lore neutral.

 Power armour mod that reflects %50 of melee damage to the enemy

I'm sorry they're downvoting you, you haven't said anything in bad faith to warrant it. I know mechanically it is a little gamey. I don't particularly enjoy survival on my xbox guy so I'm usually running around trying to knock out the weekly challenge then GTFO before I lose more than like 3k caps. This week wasn't bad at all but in generally I'm not in my CAMP a whole lot. For that reason alone I'm hesitant to even open it partway because repairing my camp is a pain in the ass that I'd rather not chance for the 2-5 hours I'm on depending on the challenge.
---
so thats you! 
---
Well sorry for not making the title 1000 characters long? Context is everything my friend so I’d appreciate it if you didn’t take my words out of it. If you’re gonna engage someone’s argument it helps to know what their actual stance is by, you know, reading their full statement.
---
Shhhh, they are ripped out of FO4, just saying. They didn't recode any of them.
---
Oh ok I may be able to help then
---
In my head spoiled doesn't mean gone bad. It means it is covered in blood and bullet fragments from fighting with it in your bag. It's squished and mangled and seasoned with ghoul brains, your blood, dirt, and metal scraps. 
---
That is a fair point. How one reads their comments can lead to either interpretation of the in-game item in question. "Unlocks" implies a plan. "Single-use" defines a consumable for real world money. They don't agree with each other particularly well. 
---
It is entirely possible that the wording choice was deliberate so as to gauge reaction as to which (or both) ways they wish to implement the goodie.
---
So a normal session of GTA Online?
---
No. Who are you?
---
There you go, that’s exactly how I presumed you would act. Like sn entitled kid.
---
Arcade machines for the camp.
---
Honestly, I don't have a problem with this.  No, not because I'm a slavish fan.  Not because I am cuckolded.
---
A) "Gamer outrage" is out of control, and it causes people not to even THINK about things before being outraged about them.
---
B) The items are earnable in game.  This is a lazy-tax.
---
C) Yes, I want the game to succeed and don't mind them getting some extra money that, in the end, will not affect me at all.  And don't appeal to morality or ethics: this is a friggin' video game.  If it doesn't affect me directly, I don't care how other people play.
---
Thanks for the downvotes.
---
That sounds good, if the drop rate is reasonable
---
seasons will fix this, enjoy your exploit while it lasts.
---
That is air tight logic.
---
That's right I do remember that, well I live in hope than
---
I started with 3, and have since played 1, 2, NV, and 4. I just love Fallout.
---
Well i did pay $80.00 for this game and didn’t get much for it so yeah it would be unfair.
---
Well I feel like at this point they know they’ve lost the majority of their player base and that whales and dedicated fans are all that are left. Might as well get as much money from them as they can before they leave as well.
---
I want some Dark/Creepy themed camp items!
---
It's so hard to really populate my dungeon when the best I've got is a crappy bed and a mothman statue.
---
The fanascht Parade stuff helped.  Now it's got "Free Candy" written with an arrow pointing to the door and a bunch of balloons and streamers leading up to the dungeon.  But I want some raider stuff to really complete the look.  Or at least maybe some medical furniture to make it look like a chop shop.
---
Press X for doubt.
---
Literally every comment about it.  It's almost like these people have never played an online game before.
---
I started with 3 and then NV. While I waited for 4 to come out I played the other two. Like you, I bought the game because it was a Fallout game and I simply have utterly no interest, at all, in PVP. 
---
It's literally the only legendary gun i want
---
Seeing lots of separate threads with few posts and votes doesn't equate to the concept of seeing a large crowd of support since those actually making the decisions likely will never see it.  Those who do see it are the ones tasked with gathering data and providing an idea of what the community thinks.  Making it harder for them to find specifics to pass on isn't beneficial, and to anyone that has to try and collect all that data to pass on too many subjects make it take longer to gather info and make it more likely some are missed as they unconsciously begin to filter reading essentially the same small thread over and over.  Whereas a more concentrated and focused discussion with clear support and lots of replies allows for the community to be more easily heard and has the potential to be directly passed on to those making decisions as something they could review for themselves.  There is a reason that a single petition with mass support means significantly more than hundreds of smaller ones that add up to the same amount, it's easy to dismiss small separate numbers as negligible unless they are properly gathered together (for example, looking at hundreds of dollars in small charges often makes people feel that there is an error in the total amount unless they actually do the math).
---
That annoyance isn't worse for those we need to impact, only those we rely on to carry out message to those it needs to reach.  Making their task more difficult and irritating doesn't help our message to get through, and potentially risks making our voice less impacting than we'd like too.
---
How do you get to that level, in other Fallout this was never an issue. However in 76 they are super rare and I can't find one nor can I find the ingredients to make one
---
Game companies don't **have** to care about you.  They sold you a product, and you are free to use that product without buying anything else.
---
At what point did you think this was more than a financial transaction?  Go get a hug from your Dad, he loves you.  Corporations never did.  Grow up.
---
If someone has found a level 45 one I’d be god to farm for it, if not I’ll be happy with the one I have currently for when I start new characters as it’s a great start off melee weapon. Wonder if the drop rate gets lower with the higher level 🤔
---
wait how hard did the white knight perk get nerfed? 
---
I was thinking more along the lines of Star Wars Battlefront 2. Gotta have that "sense of pride and accomplishment" that comes with being ripped off, after all.
---
That isn't what im saying in the slightest bit.
---
They still had to add code to integrate them they didn’t just copy paste it isn’t that easy. Source &gt; am a programmer, have copied and pasted shit before. 
---
Ok but who asked for repair kits, I haven't seen anyone suggest that
---
This was a full price AAA game. You should not have to spend more on the game to enjoy it.
---
I’ve looked through 3 of the most recent datamines (theyre really long) but I think it was added around a couple months ago to the files.  It’s there somewhere sorry.
---
Yeah, because they got there by throwing away money.
---
Alright I'll give that a try thanks for info, I'm just used to having stimpaks being they only good restoring item
---
Yeah, but that's moronic.
---
Same here. Fell in love with 1, never looked back. 
---
I know you are saying phone games are always full of microtransactions, correct?
---
Oh the datamines have something in store for you lol
---
If you buy enough shark cards, you can buy your way to a flying motorcycle with missiles.  There's at least 1 in every server.  Yet the game is still going strong.  
---
Yeah a lot of the arguments seem to be similar in that they feel slighted by Bethesda and that this is a slippery slope, I get that but if the game is not able to support itself financially then certain changes need to be made. Lots of people are trying to act like finding materials to repair items is such a hassle when it’s literally inform of you all the time there’s no material benefit to buying these repair kits. 
---
Anyways I appreciate your comment just as much as everyone else’s and wish people would engage rather than downvote a well though out premise out of spite, but I guess that’s the internet lol.
---
I love seeing an edgy teenager get all worked up at his favorite game getting called out for the garbage it is.  Thanks for that, made my day.
---
If everything elsefails you could put an deathclaw secured by an motorised gate in the Arena and then have the .. ahem.. participants pay a modest fee so you keep the gate closed :P
---
P.s. : If I ever find out you actually did that I WILL find you online, rip of your head and shit down yer neck Duke-style 
---
P.P.S : Mad props to everyone who actually gets that reference
---
The way I see the game, Fallout in general, is to explore The Wasteland. Not PVP because yes without a reason (there are no real rewards for pvp, so pvp for no reason in game with no pvp inmersion)
---
What platform are you on
---
I played since beta and can't get any further than level 20 guess this game isn't for me then, damn I really love the fallout series
---
I started with 3 when it came out and also played New Vegas and 4. And even a little Fallout Shelter.
---
Radiation: Hello, pay no attention to that red consuming your hp.
---
the hunt continues! i appreciate the effort though
---
My psn is raza1849

Let's just hope this doesn't start with other items being added that would be
---
Oh, when did Activision buy Fallout? Yeah, other game companies have done some shitty stuff in their games. That doesn't guarantee anything like that will happen here. It's like never buying a burger ever again because one restaurant is charging for lettuce.
---
PS4 user is thefreakizoid 
---
I bet you’re doing some work with that harness and beserker weapons. 
---
I don’t think that actually works. I hit #1 while I was already sneaking around paranoid because it’s survival and the hunters closed in on me anyway and killed me pretty quickly after hitting #1. 
---
Pot kettle! AAAAHAHAHAHAHA!  KEEP RAGING AGAINST THE MACHINE, WEIRDO!
---
thats your problem. accept the risk
---
No it actually isn't. The dev room was moved out of the world space we use and if you attempt to access it you get pushed back to the regular one
---
My decontaminate unit got destroyed in survival, dont have enough cobalt to repair. I would use a repair kit to fix it for sure. 
---
It’s basically a polished wood like a real ak and then the metal parts are gold or silver and reflective.
---
You mad.
---
The guy who knew Zenimax would bastardize Fallout. Who are you?
---
Super frustrated, on that note, with the number of perk cards you draw that are unnecessary... Just getting to that point now where most of the cards in my perk pack are duplicates of max rank perks I already have.
---
Very few cards do I see value in holding various tiers of after a point.
---
Like, having Demo Expert 5, but keeping a sharable Demo. Exp. 2? So your team can all quickly convert frag to Nuka Grenades? Or build some basic frag grenades?
---
OK.
---
Sure.
---
Why not let me trade, gift, or God forbid sell excess cards to other players who haven't found a copy yet? 
---
Standard problem. People follow the quest chain through the Forest with the level 10 enemy cap, and then they show up at Whitesprings and get murdered by packs of max-level ghouls. Bethesda should have dealt with this months ago rather than messing around with repair packs.
---
Hunting rifles are actually pretty good for a stealth build, even at level 50. Level 17 characters just take too many bullets to kill max-level enemies, and you don't even get the Sneak perk until level 20.
---
The game is bad now and the energy
---
Put into it would not be worth it, especially when there are better game studios out there not being as shady as Bethesda is being
---
So happy I quit this shit game 
---
White Macadamia Nut please
---
Because you grinders are just like GTA Online grinders - you won't pay but you will incessantly check the storefront: If your fancy, the shop, and your atoms are low you WILL pay.  Casuals don't care, except for the Whale Casual that doesn't mind spending. 
---
Ahhh. Where's a good place to find those?
---
There is so much talk going on around this and i agree that the atom shop should be cosmetic only. I am however curious as to why they were so vague about such a hot topic. They can be crafted or purchased. How hard are they to craft? How much will they cost? They had to know that making an announcement like that and not giving much info as to the reasoning behind the decision was going to stir massive backlash from an already aggravated community.
---
Still dose not answer the question my guy 
---
Are you in a glitched spot? If so dont but i highly doubt you are
---
Alright I'll start farming that if I can stop being killed
---
Well that isn’t what’s being discussed sooo
---
Three level 80 scorch beasts and one level 50 Mirelurk Queen. 
---
1400 rounds of pure sustained joy. 
---
I don’t mind farming for lead. You can hit alpha, bravo and charlie, the fire station and flatwoods for 360 lead, I walk to sugar grove I’m at 400. That’s a 1000 rounds plus with the ammosmith and super duper perks. 
---
Yes but not because "greed" what would be the point of making something that took time and effort for nothing 
---
I know but always I wonder why...can't help it tbh
---
Cant remember out of my head right now. Ill Pop on in a bit and check it.
---
Well it's not his problem considering he found a solution, mr. salt.
---
NCR didn't develop ranger armor, it's pre-war military gear.
---
It’s not progression on Xbox. It’s buying them for 100 caps a piece 
---
Liberators are Enclave
---
I do the exact same thing with my cave, keeps the griefers out :)
---
Who are you, the FBI?
---
7/10. Saving Nocturnal until the end to make the troll less obvious was a nice touch.
---
Corruption in the data most likely. But look at me my comment gets down voted hard because people here don't care about the state of the game they only care about the mass outrage that just causes more issues to be ignored. At least they pushed back player vending before they accidently push something like another duping exploit through 
---
Nah, get scammed. You have nobody to blame but yourself when you keep falling for it.
---
You'll get what they give you, because you're dumb enough to keep falling for it. Quit bitching and wait.
---
Almost every med kit I look in has one or I search and I find one. They are all over the world...you just have to look. Stims and radaway are everywhere 
---
...For those "whales" who can afford to drop shit-tons of money every month, anyhow. Otherwise? You're fucked.
---
Why are you defending grifters who's one and only goal is to take a game that's meant to be a fun experience and turn it in to something designed to take as much out of your wallet as it possibly can?
---
These people don't care about the quality of the game, or the players - They only give a fuck about how much money they can rip you off for. They'll happily turn FO76 in to a steaming pile of shit if they think they can make money doing so. 
---
Why defend these people?
---
I'm on PS4 too. If you decide to delete your character I can help you out with gear to get back up to speed quicker.
---
And when you have extra sell em to low levels for a couple caps each
---
I am on pacifist and I don't intend on playing survival. Just a shame that it was ever allowed by Bethesda. 
---
Ranger armor? What is that? I checked \*every\* Fallout game made: Fallout 3, Fallout 4, Fallout Shelter and Fallout 76, but found no mention of it.
---
I don’t see how making items worse is fun, make bad items better.  Making them more viable 
---
Im against buying Atoms personally, but I'm not gonna lie, seeing the top 3 things you listed would tempt me VERY badly
---
I don't have anything against you *asking*. You seem to be taking this personally and acting defensive but failing to stop and ask if maybe *you* might be wrong. If you can't prove there's a difference then what are you asking them to even look into?
---
Ad Victoriam
---
I'm not a long fan, but I've played all the main series games besides Fallout 2. My ranking of the games seems to be uncommon, but it's Fallout 4, Fallout 76, Fallout 1, New Vegas, and finally Fallout 3. 
---
I love the roleplaying in Fallout 1, but prefer Fallout 4 because of the perks system. I felt like there was more choice in what my character could become and have spent hours on that perk chart. Fallout 76 comes second because I love wandering and crafting, and it made me feel like I was unlocking more and more options. Third is Fallout 1 because I like the idea of the game a lot. Being able to talk down enemies is great. 
---
Fallout New Vegas comes second to last because I dont feel like the game wants you to kill everyone, which is what I built my character around. I spent the game murdering everyone I could, roleplaying as a man driven insane after having his nice and normal job ripped away from him. Sadly, I felt the combat and perks were lackluster and that the role playing was overhyped. I also ran a second run playing like a normal person because I wanted to give the game a second chance, but quit when I found out I couldn't side with both Benny, and Yes Man.
---
Finally, there's Fallout 3. The gameplay felt boring for me, with the exception of the behemoth fight. The story was only okay for me too. I never got to bond with my in game dad, so I didn't care in the slightest when he got killed. Then, following liberty prime broke and I had to teleport him into the energy fields with console commands. Additionally, little lamplight felt boring and hard to navigate for me and so did the vault.
---
Overall, I love the Fallout series, even though I haven't been here for a long time. You can play many of the games for a long time and you can really immerse yourself. My only problems with the game come in when I have to deal with hard to navigate locations or unfun gunplay, which makes up a good section of New Vegas and Fallout 3.
---
They steal our ideas and repackage them to sell in the Atom shop its f\*\*king disgusting we are trying to fix the game and improve it to try to add new elements and garner more players this is a total breach of trust between the sub reddit and the dev team  
---
yeah, i did move the node toward a red area, must have gone too far. thanks for the explanation 
---
Yep...couldn't put it any better than that 
---
Thanks good to know.
---
The fact that you feel like you deserve to know anything about me by asking -- twice -- who I am, is exactly why you're failing at internet flexing. GFYS
---
Theres a clear problem that everyone keeps calling this p2w. This is not p2w this is pay for convenience. Either way I've stopped arguing about it and just let people do what they plan on doing. Hopefully in a few days the front page will be back to normal and I can finally enjoy stuff on the reddit
---
Scrap every gun you are not using to learn the plans. It takes a while and a lot of guns but you'll learn all the mods. 
---
I'm thegunguyinc on PS4 so if you see me online I can build you a better rifle fo free.
---
and that's the problem. people going "it doesn't affect me so it's ok". It's an EXTREMELY selfish viewpoint.
---
Lol. 
---
I always thought that the scorchbeast was classified as animal. I always thought that the hunters legendary prefix worked against them more than zealots. Then again I've never actually played around with either of those two
---
😁
---
&gt;Well that ~~isn’t what’s being discussed~~ is absolutely what's being discussed sooo
---
Fixed that for you.
---
What I've brought up is literally the topic of the conversation - Or were you paying attention?
---
😋
---
I'm literally considering counting bodies.  Every forward base, static crashed vertibird, Watoga building and rooftop etc..
---
Everytime I look it's empty and when I search I get chems, or one stimpak that I have to use cause I'm constantly at 1/4 hp
---
You're welcome! I enjoy making people happy because I really enjoy this game
---
Oh? Looks like I struck a nerve
---
People only want to be recreationally angry, doing research isn't part of that hobby.
---
Maybe, but the fact they've already started the process of making good on them does.  I'm already signed up and waiting for my replacement bag.
---
I did at first but...they followed me under a different gt same contact's so obviously same people. I don't know if my space is available now.. .not played after last attack 
---
I've scrapped damn near every gun I've gotten and crafted a new hunting rifle every time I can. But now I'm stuck with a level 10 hunting rifle vs level 50 enemies. I've done really good and my armor is trash as well, but I cant find any plans for it either. I'm just stuck in a rut. 
---
I effed up and sold mine by accident :(  didn't relies it until too late and it was gone 
---
There is also a Christmas tree in the water.
---
Since Fallout 3, tried to play the originals but I'm no fan of the iso turn based.
---
Because assholes in online games is a given.  Life is too short to concern myself with creating a safe environment or getting upset by them.  Even in GTA online, with people griefing in the bikes, I fight back or just jump servers.  Takes a minute out of my day.  
---
GTA Online is also 7 years old, completely supported by online transactions.  If I felt they were that bad, I wouldn't play it.  Same with Fallout.  
---
I thought they already said on the ITV that they will be earnable from challenges. Maybe I misread? 
---
What was being discussed is repair kits being some how pay-to-win. It being a slippery slope is another conversation but just as much pure hysteria.
---
Just for ammo, armor and chems. Plus it seems to be the only weapon that was doing it. 
---
Aaannnndddd, i know what im doing later
---
What about preventing stacking of legendary effects?  No more stacking unyielding or assassins or cavalier, etc.  Increase the effects for balance, but offer more variety in how people set up their builds.
---
Personally, I'm not a fan of the "cant be damaged" builds.  I think it's trash and a trashy style of play regardless of how long you spent building/acquiring it.  
---
My point is that these effects should have some benefit to your character in a way to give you an advantage, but they should not stack to a point to always insure your win / make you invincible to all damage except for specific dmg types/times.
---
I can hook you up. I'll be online in about 1 hour
---
Would help with the 10mm smg and other in between weapons.
---
That said, because you cannot buy cards, anywhere, market, trade, atoms, vendors, nothing nowhere, as of right now, it's pure random chance and levelling right?
---
At least that is fair.
---
That would become definition of Pay 2 Win once you could buy more packs or premium perks from atomic shop.
---
With caps in game from robot vendors? MAYBE, less broken, more accessible... Maybe... 
---
But even then, how long until Atoms can buy you Caps? And caps can buy you the world.
---
I just want the low income player to be competitive in the game.
---
I do not want the rich player to dominate and Despotize the game for others.
---
Its not very Trump/Trudeau to ask for a level playing field, I know. 
---
Sorry 'bout it... 
---
Ammo would have to use a bulk system to keep it balanced. 1 ammo for 1 cap is too much.
---
My funny bone
---
How much?
---
No they weren't. People have been asking for options to reconnect to servers they get disconnect from, perk rebalancing, more endgame content, joint camp building, and event changes. I don't remember ever seeing repair kits requested at all. 
---
With the exception of 1 and 2-handed weapons (which are pretty obvious) doesn't weapon, legendary effects, and mod descriptions tell you what it is? Maybe add the missing descriptions. At the very least I'd agree and like to see an icon denoting it, but there's enough words and numbers already.
---
So again, a decision maker at some point compared looked at the product that was advertised compared to the product they were going to ship and either didn't realize it would cause a massive backlash and make their company the subject of memes for the rest of time or they decided it was worth it. Either way, the decision makers at Bethesda are completely oblivious.
---
I'm at the grocery store with my wife and kids at the moment lol once we get back I'll shoot you a message. Thanks for your help, I really do appreciate it
---
I think they were mentioned few times, but for example freezer was mentioned vastly more times. Also, noone ever suggested anything besides skins and camp decor to be added to atom shop.
---
&gt;What was being discussed is repair kits being some how pay-to-win.
---
...As well as what that leads to. Which is part of the conversation whether you want it to be or not.
---
&gt;just as much pure hysteria.
---
Now you just sound like a paid shill.
---
Share Rad Sponge or use sun-kissed.
---
Fuck Bethesda 
---
I put my look speed to maximum and noticed an extremely brief slowdown in look speed when I cross the path of an enemy. It is almost negligible.
---
Just cause I don't wear armor don't mean i don't believe in damage resistance :D
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/PhoenixPoint/comments/b0rxdq/epic_game_store_spyware_tracking_and_you/
---
the "permission" that EGS asks for is to pull your friends list over to EGS, not all of this other stuff.
---
Not really, i want the content already in the game. Nuka world armor mechanist armor cage armor tattoos face paints etc. but or power armor paints already in game like seriously all they have to do is just port the FO 4 stuff over into the shop. 
---
And on the other side of the spectrum, this game still has white knights who turn a blind eye to their practices that are ruining the game, constantly retreating the front line, accepting more and more BS with new justifications. Speak some truth? Get flamed. This fan base is delusional sometimes.
---
Well, if you don't mind being ripped off and duped like a gullible sucker, then I guess I can't say anything to change your mind.
---
Have fun shoveling your money to grifters.
---
Which guns count as “explosive”, and which ones count as “Big” confuses me
---
&gt;This game was built on our trust
---
No, it was built by developers who were paid real money. Technically, they were paid in advance, before selling a single copy of the game. Quite normal. Thing is, the game didn't turn out so great. Sales weren't great. Everyone knows this. We might not know why? Was their core idea bad. Did they have to rush the release. Is online Fallout just something rather difficult to do well.
---
If they can sell atoms for real money, a little bit better, with some functional aid stuff instead of just mere cosmetics, them hmmm yep they are going to do it. That's how stuff works.
---
&gt;Who knows what comes next? 
---
Well I do. Lots and lots of threads about complaining things. I mean it's really important to complain. The world changes if you complain enough.
---
&gt;We trusted them, and stuck through all the bad press and bullshit bugs.
---
Heh, that's you, that's your thing. I play the game because I like playing it.
---
HAHA! This game is a complete clusterfuck. If you spent a dime on in-game items, YOU are the problem and why we will never see a good FO again.
---
I'm pretty sure I see a noticeable difference against super mutants when I'm using a fist weapon. I'll check later for you to confirm though.
---
they definitely were the first couple weeks of the game being out, but i haven’t seen too many since then.  
---
I remember that post. 
---
Im more pissed that they are taking the ideas form the sub and trying to sell them back too us for cash 
---
You can get the repair kits in game without spending atoms. You can also get atoms in game. Even if you do purchase with real money, an item that lets you speed up farming/grinding in no way forces a pay to win scenario in PVP. Although if the fridge and future content is atom shop only then I’d have to agree with you that it’s at the very least scummy. 
---
I love when people ask for debuffing stuffs and mentions the three things that "everybody wields", yet mostly point out third tier gear xd
---
I am!  And I love FO76.  I play it solo though.
---
Rick is less of a captain obvious , username doesn't check out. :(
---
Listen, I've been defending this game since the damned beta. They promised that the atom shop would strictly be cosmetic-only and now they're planning to add utility items for cash, which breaks the ONE promise that made a lot of people give the game a chance at all. The repair kits don't give a major advantage on their own, but if they can get away with this, what's stopping them from purchases give you stimpaks, or transfer your junk to your stash without needing to find one, or buying legendary weapons? You're missing the ENTIRE point of the outrage.
---
Arbitrage!
---
You said like part of the hysteria lol
---
I've been playing since Fallout 3, even played the mobile game.  New Vegas is my favorite.  I have experience with MMOs, played WoW back in the day, so that aspect of gameplay doesn't deter me.  But the Fallout series is my all time favorite series besides Elder Scrolls.
---
I’d like to know this too, I’ve been running it for a while and never thought about it since the card says melee weapons.
---
I mean, you do realize I'm flaming Zenimax, right? Are you defending ZMX? I've been a FO fan since 99. Had high hopes when BGS acquired the title. Since Zeni started ESO they've been taking control of all BGS titles and stripping the studio of its creative license. This is about Zenimax you plank.
---
&gt;It's a lie regardless of whatever excuse you want to give it. You asked why they are held to a certain standard, I gave you the reason why - they said it would be cosmetic only and now their actions prove it isn't. That is why people are upset. Seems incredibly easy to understand.
---
&gt;
---
And it was cosmetic only, Just not indefinitely,  so it's not a lie. I would also point out that it was said during a time that they were under heavy pressure,  because they are being held to a higher standard than others.
---
&gt;&gt; How long do we expect this game to last if they can't make money off of it anymore? 2-3 years? 5-6?
---
&gt;I don't care, I don't like this monetary model at all. I hope it fails catestrophically so they can go back to selling a FULL game for a set price and a FULL dlc for a set price. Microtransaction laden games always are designed to sell microtransactions, period. When those microtransactions offer in game benefits, they will 100% always push you to buy them, that's how they work. I disagree with the entire system, so I hope it doesn't last. Also, you have no damn clue how much money they do or don't make, they could be swimming in dough enough to already fund 10 years of DLC and still continue to sell overpriced microtransactions, the business model is shady and I want NO part of it.
---
There are plenty of games that follow this structure.  They said before release that this would be a different experience,  even announcing that it was a mmo structure. Which has been around for years and will probably be around for a while. The paid dlc structure is dying and makes for a rather lousy mmo experience. 
---
You also dont need to know how much they made to know that they won't pour any more resources into the game than necessary. Once it stops making money, they will cut it making your initial purchase unusable.
---
&gt;&gt; Fo76 uses the a very similar pay structure as guildwars. What have they been doing for years?
---
&gt;I don't care? I don't get why you think pointing to other games makes me think it's ok? I didn't support Guildwars, so your point is moot. Whataboutism isn't a great way to sell your position on an issue.
---
I pointed out other games, because they are relevant. Bethesda made their intentions for a premium store clear from the start. This is how the game was structured from the beginning and people still bought it.  
---
Actually, I know the background.  The original bag was a prototype, when they determined what the canvas would cost to produce the bag, because they would literally have to have the canvas made before it could be cut into the bags, they changed it to the vinyl version.  The subcontractor informed Bethesda, and their marketing department failed to remove 'canvas' from the advertisement.  The rest is history.  
---
"Cant be damaged" builds are shred to pieces if you play it right 
---
I was like wow the game is changing for the better. Might reinstall. Wait what? Non cosmetic items? Abort abort. Back to sea of thieves.
---
Bethesda has left my rear end alone. Am I not playing enough? How did you get their attention?
---
I’ve never even heard of that game. Lol
---
This. The game calls for zero nerfs but thousand buffs.
---
you obtain repair kits from killing the sbq which will take more resources than the reward of the quote free repair kit I would rather be able to build it the point is it should have never been in the Atom shop to begin with this was the subs baby and the murdered it  
---
Its just fucking repair kits if you dont buy them they wont hurt you.... how much of an advantage is it really going to add 
---
Maybe the change in tone is just a generation change in perspective? Like the BoS becoming more and more a monarchy?
---
We can still repair our weapons the 'old way' at a workbench...correct?    
---
If that is the case I don't really see the problem.  Repair kits seem to be entirely optional.  Am I missing something?  
---
I mean, none of this would shock me. 
---
I’m not either
---
Unless you’re calling me fat
---
Also no, that wasn’t what was being discussed in this comment thread
---
Umm no, people make suggestions hoping to see it in the game. Bethesda can choose whether or not to include it and or charge atoms.
---
If you don't want Beth to put it in the game don't post it. Seriously when a post starts "hey bethesda we need beer fridges" your literally asking them to make it. Free or paid is Beths choice.
---
Bye
---
I wanted to use steam controller for that, and use its "mouse-like" aiming without any aim assistance from the game. I failed to achieve that.
---
Bye Felicia
---
Deal. Join my world at some point GT: LordRazumdar 
---
Yet I've never seen an iguana around here. Hmmm
---
Which, ESO? Elder Scrolls Online?
---
Créate a level one character get him outside the vault voila level up 
---
It's already fun casually, but it could be *so much more*. They could throw hundreds of things at us in the Atom Shop and many of us would lap them up lol, shame tbf
---
No no no, that's absolutely bogus - we absolutely have every right and reason to be angry, even angrier, *until our anger succeeds in stopping companies, that we support through our purchases* ***from doing things that we really don't want them to do***.
---
We should have ***more control*** it's *our money* paying for the development, distribution, and updates/changes to these products.
---
The fact that EA can be so hated, yet *stay in business* **IS ABSURD**!!!
---
I don't see how that is relevant. 
---
It seems that the suggestion is that unless we buy unwanted atom shop items, the servers will go down. If that is the case, then they do not know what they are doing.
---
There are numerous online games that do not have microtransactions or subscriptions, and pay for their costs for many years via game and dlc sales. I've been playing such games for at least 15 years, and I don't see that anything has changed to make this unviable.
---
I think we're in greed territory rather than covering server costs.
---
It may be that Bethesda had overly optimistic revenue forecasts that weren't met due to problems with the rollout and reception of the game, but that's on them.
---
None of us agreed to spend an unlimited amount on top of a $60 game to subsidize server costs that they needed to be able to cover with the income from base game sales.
---
Profits from microtransactions should be gravy, not necessary for the game's survival, so if Fallout 76 were to shut down due to poor income from microtransactions, that would probably be the end of Bethesda's foray into online gaming.
---
Fallout 4 did this and I was very disappointed to see that 76 did not. I would very much like to see this come back as I feel slightly disadvantaged in survival when it comes to sniping dudes in PvP and would love to organically switch on the fly to the more accurate mouse especially when it comes to hitting stealth specialists who can't be locked on with VATS.
---
[In general a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-paying peers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play#Pay-to-win)
---
It is pay to win. no matter whether you can unlock a bit of it by grinding or not. ***Any*** form of content that gives you an advantage over others in exchange for real money is pay to win.
---
Didn't play in Beta, did not start until Jan. There are locations that I have been to many times but still they do not register in the challenge. 
---
Wasn't an issue for a while because there were many other challenges that I was working through, but now the only way to earn Atoms is from the daily/weekly challenges. 
---
Farm bottlecaps. Next week it will become much much easier with combined cap limit for all vendors. And then buy all the frigging ballistic fibre you ever need. Lots and lots of players have extra. We will have vending machines to sell small amounts.
---
Overall it's good system. Playing regularly allows you to gradually farm quite a lot of bottlecaps. Players who play far more, can farm some resources and then sell you those. And then we can pay for ammo, for those players who farm that.
---
It's not like they have a business to run or anything...
---
Lets just agree to disagree 
---
Agreeeed
---
I have over 100 different different weapons on my character lol if something breaks I just use the next one 
---
Oh that makes sense. I didn’t think of ESO to be elder scrolls online
---
&gt;LOL nah I'll just continue being a ~~reasonable adult~~ mark for grifters to rip off, because I don't mind paying more money for a shittier quality of experience. Makes life easier.
---
Fixed that for you. And yeah, I guess burying your head in the sand *does* make life easier in some respects, if that's your thing.
---
I don't get all the rage, and that makes me think I'm missing something.     A product is being offered that can help players in the game.   I don't need it.  I won't buy it.  And I don't see how it affects my game that other players buy repair kits.  Maybe for PVP mode, but I don't play that mode.     Am I missing something?  Should I be mad like everyone else?   Or can I just ignore all this stuff and play 76?    
---
That is the most bullshit story, ever. There was no "canvas shortage", it's a meme posted on Reddit and you're doing no one any good by parroting it as fact.
---
If you’re on PC, I can help you move. I move a lot
---
):
---
Server lists make games looks sloppy 
---
I believe what they meant with this is we are going to have a shelf with certain items to display 
---
It's not ark, or rust. I don't think that would go over too well, admins would abuse the shit out of it.
---
Was wondering why 40* spoiled meat kept appearing like 10 minutes after I got any food 
---
Another Cry Baby, bye-bye.
---
What gameplay advantage are they gaining? And what are they winning? 
---
I believe is to encourage new characters 
---
Reason number 729469 why a Fallout game without mods is not worth playing 
---
I’ll pay 20k
---
I'm Fallout fan ever since Fallout 3 release. I've tried F1 before becoming Fallout fan and once after, but that game didn't click with me. But Fallout 3 was a special game for me. The Vault 101 tutorial was fine, but I wasn't impressed that much... but then came the moment I left the vault. The flash of bright light, fitting music and suddenly I saw the whole Wasteland before me. I realized that everything I see I can actually visit and I fell in love. This moment and then actually playing the game made me fall in love with Fallout, Bethesda and open-world games. The fact that every single-player Fallout game since F3 was amazing kept my passion for Fallout alive.
---
How is it any different than them taking assets from mods and repacking them for the atom shop like they did in FO4 its wrong and its a breach of trust add the recent nerfs too repairs they deliberately high jacked ideas than changed the game to force players into a paywall    
---
This I can agree with. 
---
Has Bethesda replied anywhere since this announcement? Or did they go dark?
---
Was this game ever intended to be playable?
---
You know I keep hearing that, but no one offers any tips on how to deal with them.  Just comments on how it's not open, learn2play bs.  
---
I’ll take anything you wanna get rid off I’ll be online in about 30 minutes from now 
---
Damn you got good weapons since if the team hammering it is a bit weaker, I can break several weapons. And typically I can't repair them in combat because then I have to exit my excavator, going over the carry limit, and then I can't use vats so much because my AP isn't recovering from it.
---
Played the entire Fallout series including 1 and 2 (also Wasteland 1 and 2, eagerly awaiting the 3rd installment).
---
So far I have avoided PvP altogether, not my thing.
---
Friends left the game and went back to modding FO4 after the devs imposed a strictly enforced fun per hour limit - may come back once private servers become 'a thing' - so I currently play as four man party of me. 
---
there's 4 different challenges but only 3 are required to finish.
---
\~Complete 10 events with melee weapons, while intoxicated.
---
\~Kill 10 Huge creatures while intoxicated
---
\~drink 76 Alcoholic beverages
---
\~Destroy 76 robots while intoxicated and wearing the beer hat
---
Same here! I've still got the original FO1 &amp; 2 on CDROMs floating around somewhere (I've moved a few times since then and they're in... a box... somewhere...).
---
Always carry a back up 
---
So clever.  OMG I think you just changed my life
---
I'll defend repair kits. It's the fact you get them in the atom shop that's ass. Have enemies drop them/purchase plans for them from vendors with caps just make them weigh like a pound and doesn't benefit from weight perks so people can't carry hundreds. 
---
Stop whining that it's not enough money if *hundreds of thousands* or even *millions* of people pay $50+ dollars each!!!!!!
---
JFC?!?
---
NO IT'S NOT our responsibility to pay even *more* money!
---
Seriously ***FUCK THE "WHALES" THEY'RE FUCKING DESPICABLE LAZY MOTHER FUCKERS AND THEY'RE RUNNING GAMING FOR THE REST OF US!!!!***
---
Post open?
---
This on top of pay to win repair kits. I think I might be retiring Fallout 76 for good as they seem to be taking things progressively towards a cash shop by progressively tuning mechanics to be annoying just enough to justify purchasing whatever garbage they shill out to us.
---
Here's to hoping elderscrolls 6 doesnt have all these shady microtransactions. I would advise all of you to never spend a penny on these new "mechanics" or "features" as it will only justify and pave the road to further pay to win items.
---
"Only cosmetic items" -Bethesda "oh except repair Kits" "and fridges" and anything else people put money into.
---
Sad that my favorite dev slid down such a slippery slope...
---
Wrong!
---
It doesn't eat up ammo, it just unloads it. It's annoying but not taking ammo away, just like that visual bug that used to say ammo was removed when you would learn a plan or mod.
---
Okay on my way
---
Of course, there's always the very good chance that you're just a naive dupe and a sucker. A sucker is born every minute, after all.
---
The most profitable marks are the people who are too dense to figure out that they are marks.
---
I'm out of the loop what did they do?
---
Not as far as I know, been wanting it for months
---
I will try but last time I did some One was camping there...hoping it's not lost now. 
---
Or they'll be like me, and it will be a deciding factor in not giving the game another chance right now. 
---
They can't make more money off people who don't turn on the game.
---
As consumers, we are very quick to forgive and forget. 
---
They took the mods work IDK much about it but it's way different to use someone elses code and hard work compared to Beth writing the code themselves for your request.
---
Well seeing as I won’t buy any of those things I’m not sure how you’ve come to that conclusion
---
To other players, yes.  To vendors, no.
---
Yessir. 2300 hours of New Vegas, just shy of 1000 on 3, and 800 on 4
---
I find it fun. From the people I've came across it's been a nice adventure. I'm a lone wanderer and I highly enjoy the game. Could be fun with another person. Does get lonely out there.
---
Unfortunately I'm not, but thank you for offering though. Appreciated 
---
The speed at which they degrade in this game is highly accelerated compared to other Fallouts, which I think is a bit problematic especially when paired with how you repair in this game with raw materials. Instead of fixing an actual issue by slowing it down a bit and/or requiring fewer materials to repair it, they decided to sell items to do so. That should be an issue for everyone.
---
Random encounters will throw this number off....
---
NEGATIVE OPINION RIGHT HERE
---
I'm sorry, but this game is absolute trash and the way things are going this game has extremely little potential to rebound and be "the greatest" fallout game. As of right now, barely anyone has any sympathy for those who still defend this heap of trash and only wish the worst upon those who defend Bethesda and Todd. This game will be remembered as one of the worst fallout games of all time, so there's no point in saying there's still hope for this game because there is none. 
---
Bethesda wrote the code and made the items they're not using someone elses work and getting paid for it
---
Nuka Cola has it's own effect (a small bottle in the left corner) and are affected by Cola nut in endurance.
---
Unfortunately, this doesn't stack with Speed Demon.  Just tested.  Same speed sneak running with my Sleek modded legs as without them equipped.
---
Agreed, well said dude
---
I really wish you had to put age next to your name, so I wouldn't bother trying to talk to have discussions with children. 
---
There are dozens of you! Dozens!
---
I don't give a shit whether your life is "changed" or not, pal.
---
Actually, I rather enjoy the fact that dupes like yourself exist. People like you are quite profitable.
---
Well what I heard from them that mods and user run servers were a late 2019 thing. So it isn't like I'm making it up. It is just now that they have a cash shop are they going to go back on that? I know there are several gamers that won't touch the game currently, but would relook at it once those two happened.
---
There's an issue with that actual mechanic, and it shouldn't be viewed as a way to make more money off the game.
---
Advantages: not having to spend scrap for repair and not having to wait for an available workbench. 
---
Winning doesn't mean literal winning in PvP. It's gaining an advantage in the game that the non-paying player does not have.
---
When exactly did the Super Mutants escape and become hostile to the rest of humanity? All within the 20 years?
---
I don't just not want the plague of non-cosmetic micro transactions infesting my games, no, I ***absolutely despise them with a passion***.
---
We have more than a right to be angry, speak out, and demand it to stop, we have a *moral obligation* to do so, to let these companies know, loud and clear, it's *our money* paying for these games, we absolutely have *every right* to coerce these companies into not doing such things!!!
---
Didn't the blog already say they'd be event and challenge rewards? 
---
Survival game. Not a ballistic fiber collection game.
---
I heard about it too, I believe you and all. I just don't think it would work out too well. I'd personally be down for it though
---
Yup, I'm sure Beth is rolling in all those $0 I've spent on atoms.  I'm guessing Rockstar can stop making games too and retire. Nice try, bro.  
---
Or more people like single player games with good story line.
---
I know..i just tend to take things to heart. I shouldn't but can't help it really 
---
You're sitting here defending grifters.
---
That tells me you're a gullible mark who's easily played.
---
That's okay though, because in the end I'm rather thankful that people as naive as you exist - You're quite profitable, after all.
---
Single tear runs down my cheek
---
Zenimax is the company that owns Bethesda Softworks and Bethesda Game Studios. They pull the strings and basically give the orders. That's why any hate directed toward BGS is oftentimes unwarranted. FO76 is falling into the same trap that ESO did with shoddy quality and a ridiculous amount of microtransactions. 
---
sounds good. What can you trade it for?
---
There is a difference between being compensated and over compensated. You still want a game to be user friendly. In blades you will hit a point where you can't continue unless you buy a weapon 
---
But is that really an advantage over someone? I see time being saved yes but in the end they’re not stronger or any better off that anyone else. Items of convenience have been sold in rpg’s for as long as I could remember.  I agree they should have just been available in game for free but I cant consider this pay to win lol 
---
We don't care because some atom shop repair kits don't bother us a bit.
---
I wish we could nerf how silly you sound right now.
---
Dec 24th 2082, The charleston dam is destroyed.
---
When my kids throw a tantrum I’ll let them tire themselves out as well and when they calm down they usually realize how foolishly they’ve been behaving.
---
Ok, I'm with you in principal, this is a bad decision.   
---
But the idea didn't come from this sub-reddit. It's a feature  they cut from fallout 3, that was then re-introduced in New Vegas.   
---
&gt;Yup, I'm sure Beth is rolling in all those $0 I've spent on atoms.
---
...Says the guy who was just bragging about all the money he's spent on GTA. 😂😂😂
---
Maybe it’s just me but I’ve always assumed they must not work given the remains found inside of them. I assumed someone got in when the bombs fell and didn’t make it. 
---
Actually haven’t heard this one before and like it. Can’t wait to examine a Railway Rifle and just see ???????
---
&gt;calling out any deceptive practices.
---
You mean like I've been saying about fo76 since it was announced being online only mp?
---
Yeah, tell me about it
---
But oh wait they'll TOTALLY allow private servers with mods that will make all their microtransactions useless 
---
Good idea. Everyone on r/fo76 hates Fallout 76 👍
---
Fallout Tactics was my first Fallout game. After that I went back and played 1 and 2. Then of course 3, NV, 4 and 76 when they were released.
---
Martial Artist Perk Card.  60% melee weapon weight reduction.
---
10 - 60% = 4
---
You can continue the problem people have is the chest
---
Not defending anything. I don’t think they should be in the shop but I also realize it doesn’t really matter. Again not profitable if I’m not spending money on it but alright.
---
Emotionally attached to a video game? 
---
Bye, Felicia.
---
Vault-Tec Pre-Determined Scenario Simulator. Boom.
---
While I don't agree with your first paragraph I do like the rest of your ideas so have my thumbs up 
---
As we travel the wasteland, we walk on top of the bones of the broken who came before.
---
buddy I’m not selling I’m asking to buy
---
Building in a cave using foundations is exactly what I want to do. I won’t ask for your specific spot, but at least maybe shoot me a few hints on where I could look for some good real estate!
---
Yeah the chests are annoying, but being unable to continue unless you spend money is stupid. If they wanted money they should have just made it a paid game upfront
---
First time fallout gamer here, was playing call of duty  bo4 got to prestige 7. Then got sick of it, started looked around for something different that wasn't so fast paced. Came across boarderlands &amp; fo76, watched some gameplay videos and decided on fo76. Been playing ever since, I'm kinda obsessed, level 240 with alts. This game was exactly what I was looking for, pve mmorpg with occasional pvp. 
---
Vats is the great equaliser. There is no visible character that can survive enough vats crits.
---
Sneak is the 2nd great equaliser. Unyielding bloodbuilds is how you control the map for your team denying those invincible guys enterance.
---
Map control is everything.
---
Probably should practice reading comprehension.  Maybe even try reading the sentence after the one you referenced.  Cool story though
---
Active players? How could you possibly know that? Fallout New Vegas was on PS3...
---
Either way, while repair kits aren't pay to win, they do have a tangible game play effect. The issue is Bethesda going back on their word, not "pay to win". 
---
They really did the quest-routing badly in this game...it stears you away from low level areas and towards the heart of the map, way to early. There's NOTHING that pushes where you \_should\_ go. 
---
Everyone thinks its a terrible idea...and yet we have no problems with mutations right?  
---
The reason they have debuffs on mutations is to give you variety and force different methods of play.  But no lets get rid of those too, so everyone just jumps over buildings and slices people in half with their talons.  That's more fun right?
---
Fact of the matter is legendaries are boring, because there is no reason to use anything but the same ones everyone uses.  Throw in some negatives to balance them out a bit and then you have folks trying different combos.  
---
You want to be whiney about weapon damage then buff it generally, but there should be some kind of tradeoffs for using different weapons.
---
they're too busy reading the thank you cards sent from blizzard.  how quickly people "who have phones" forget.
---
The mods already addressed this. They are allowing these posts for 48 hours to send Bethesda the message then they're limiting them to the mega thread 
---
But have you *seen* those sugar tins? There's got to be 5 lbs of sugar in there. Cranberry relish my ass, more like cranberry jelly. And the spice tins? 3 lbs.  /s
---
As for salt and pepper?
---
I got nothin. (yes, reduce the weight please)
---
&gt; Then they tried a $40 Mount, it glowed, it was badass, people said it was too expensive and then bought it anyways. $30-$40 mounts became the norm. 
---
Badass looking cosmetics we need. Nearly everything so far is quite meh.
---
 I considered the "large" pack which adds forest camo to several things. But it was 1500 atoms or something like that, and I figured later they will sell it cheaper, so Ill get it maybe then later. 1500 atoms would be okay if it would apply to most weapons and many armor pieces. But it was just too limited.
---
Hey, if you don't mind being scammed and paying more money for a shittier quality of product, whatever - You're free to blow your money like a drunken sailor if you want.
---
Just don't be surprised when some of us see you as a sucker.
---
I'm with you.  I've been downvoted for QoL ideas, suggestions, and being against putting repair kits in the Atom Shop.  I love the series and this game despite all of it's flaws is really fun and I want to see it stay that way.
---
Dude gains literal nothing from leaderboards, is not a competitive advantage unless some idiot comes waltzing in on his territory.
---
Not griefing.
---
What exactly is wall-porting?
---
A lot of the problem is that, bluntly speaking, we don't hear any "Zenimax is making us do X". We hear shit, from bethesda, about things \_they\_ have done, will do. 
---
They can only hold a certain amount. 
---
In my case, playing since launch, playing with friends...when I get booted, nobody else did. I don’t think I ever been booted with someone else on my team, ever. I think if nothing else, there should be some type of a place holder for each player on the server that will allow someone that got booted to have 3-5 minutes to rejoin, in case they actually lost it and didn’t just log off their session.
---
Or, don’t use melee in PVP. I don’t wear sandals when it’s snowing outside. Find whatever works for you. Think of real life, if you come at me from 50 feet away swinging a sword and I have a shotgun. Guess who wins????
---
I consider FNV as good as F3. No worse, no better. And I love each game for different reasons. FNV has great characters and factions but that's about it. If I had to pick a biggest reason why I love Fallout, it's the exploration. And FNV had unrewarding exploration. Most of the locations were just sitting there and waiting for side quest to lead us there. And the world was bland. The sandbox of FNV was literally it - *a sand box*. A large square of desert with some mountains and NV in the middle.
---
I can see why pople love FNV as one of the best RPGs. But saying that it's better than F3 in every aspect (as many FNV fans say) is just dishonest. I could find as many advanteges for FNV over F3 as disadvanteges. I saddens me quite a lot when many FNV fans are attempting to gatekeep the fandom with the "FNV good, F3 bad" nonsense. Hell, the setting of F3, F4 and F76 feels more *Fallout* to me than FNV. Those Fallout games were truly post-apocalyptic experiences, while FNV felt different. Like half cowboy adventure, half post-apocalyptic.
---
If there was such a thing as God, and you could make a donation to have a prayer come true then I would pray, and pay, that you would choke to death on that word vomit you just spewed at us.
---
Pay To Cheat is a vile and Evil scourge on the video game world, it's not just some petty inconsequential thing that "Internet babies are QQing about"!!!
---
I swear, I have been checking this subreddit and fo76 news everyday since launch. This has been something people have been asking for since the beginning.
---
I do not believe Bethesda has ever commented on this. It's like they don't want to respond to this suggestion. Maybe it's not possible without a big modification to the game engine.
---
When your the only one on a survival server.. Am I alone.. or am I legend?
---
No. Stop crying.
---
yep, just starting getting into Conan since it went free on ps4
---
Thank you.
---
With its piss poor damage to compensate for its high fire rate they should have just chambered it in .38 or something. Doesn’t make any sense seeing as it’s a pistol cartridge but .308 doesn’t make any sense either since it has never and can’t use anything but 7.92x in real life. May as well give it a more common round in the name of game balance. 
---
Again, I’m not spending any money on it and have yet to spend any real money in that shop and have walked away with dozens of items for entirely zero dollars. Guess I’m just an open wallet 🤷‍♂️
---
Just don't be surprised when some of us see you as the sucker you are.
---
They should add shields like car doors or sentry bot arm or moleminer shield etc. They could make it so the shield acts as a physical solid object that blocks bullets and certain perks would let you block while sprinting etc.
---
Wishing I'd done the same. I had it to my liking...live and learn...
---
With her micro-transactions and raisins!
---
Skins and outfits is all they need now they do need to up there variety you know they have full lists of items they haven't sold yet just add everything overwhelm us with so much stuff we will be forced to buy atoms side note add more bundle packs don't be afraid to offer multiple different packs at one time force the customer to want to spend more by providing maximum options on that means you can have bundles but you can also sell bundled items individually it's like they don't know how to run there own micro transaction store
---
By your logic then paying vendors caps for plans are the same thing. It's also a currency you can earn in-game. 
---
And having weapon/camp plans can give you advantages to others since you can use camp defences and weapon upgrades. 
---
I guess vendors are pay to win as well?
---
Those are already in game. At the Atomic Shop, I believe.
---
Nice Karma farm dude
---
This is all stuff that was asked pre survival beta and on like day 1-2 of it. 
---
Haven't been able to play in over a month
---
If you sneak you cannot get targeted by VATS.
---
My buddy plays one of them all dps-fist-werapon builds with all the mutations and he does very well on the pvp servers.
---
Also defensive perks are your friends.  Fireproof/dense and some other armor mods makes TSE weapons almost useless.
---
Out of curiosity, what does your armor-less builds resistance look like? And did you bypass all offensive  perks for defensive perks?
---
Why on earth is this happening?? I spawn to camp with 4 super mutants attacking me and I suddenly have an empty magazine. Why??? This never occurred before....
---
You mean the rails right? Because we already have the posts.
---
Fuck that restruant, anyway.  Hardly anything pisses me off more than companies breaking norms by starting to charge for items which used to be complementary - like a cup of water.
---
Actually our recent tendency to spend money in an undisciplined manner has contributed to us having less nice things.   If we are a little stingier with our gaming dollars we can cause companies to raise their game.  Provide us with better products and nicer things.  
---
It's very negotiable 
---
That’s what I thought, thanks!
---
Maybe I didnt explain it properly.
---
I have well over 20 water machines, the small ones.
---
When I leave (or wait in the camp) for over an hour, -- out of the 20, only like 5 have water.
---
Do you understand what im asking?
---
I would expect all 20 of them to have 2 waters each.
---
&gt;Guess I’m just an open wallet 🤷‍♂️
---
I'm going with "sucker" and "dupe", actually, since you don't mind paying more money for a shittier quality of service.
---
I also have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you, if you are interested.
---
The thing is, that the same community has also been down voting every critical post for months. Yet now the feedback is healthy? I would say the community here is bipolar.

People seem to define "pay to win" differently. For many it seems the definition is extremely loose, anything costing currency that can be bought with real money that procures any perceived advantage, no matter how minute, is pay to win, like that one event where iirc wearing an Unstoppables costumes (all or most were Atom Shop items) gave you extra HP (hell I remember people arguing that the Red Rocket sign that had a unique destroy animation was pay to win because the animation was unique to that structure).
---
My afternoon was boring until you walked into my life.  Please, go on making a fool out of yourself.
---
In what way is my service being hurt or hinder whatsoever by a near useless convenience item?
---
Or a sabot that is magnetic, but I think in terms of FO, a magnetic cored or DU cored round would be the most lore friendly. 
---
And yea, the Handmade certainly could be another of the guns that uses the 7.62
---
Perhaps as a balance, the amount of ammo you can create is not quite as high as the .50/5mm in quantities. :)
---
That’s bad.  Not sure what I’d do if it got that bad for me.  Probably head back to Boston.
---
It might be your Playstation system, how old is it? Have you ever used canned air on it?
---
Hard No.
---
Zealots doesnt apply to SBs and the Queen, only prime receivers do. As for SBs being classified as animals since they're technically bats, well there's been a lot of confusion still, with no definitive answer if it does or doesn't.
---
That’s a lot to unpack.
---
The good kits are a drop from big beasties. The regular ones are from the shop, and may be a blueprint. Not that silly things like details matter to the internet outrage machine. 
---
You can only get about 10 water per hour. Building more purifiers doesn't change this it just means any one purifier is less likely to have water in it after one hour. Any more than 2 large or 5 small and you're wasting budget.
---
You literally find meat lying on counters and other furniture.
---
Sometimes even on the ground.

But Ug'Qualgoth forbid you pick it up.

Remember Star Wars Battlefront II?  I do.  We got *so upset* that their *stock price dropped*.
---
***Be the change you want to see**"

Remember when all the guns got nerfed? And the melee users rejoiced.!?!  
---
I sure do . I made a post months back about how guns are and will always be op..

Anways , no. Just no. 
---
Dam really 
---
He really packed a lot into his post.
---
Westtek released FEV into the Huntersville water supply before the bombs dropped. It took effect slower,over a period of months as opposed to a few days. Increased hostility and aggressiveness is just a side effect of the mutation so they overwhelmed the army troops quarantining them, at least those that didn't desert after the bombs fell.
---
Except you actually know that won't happen and are being hyperbolic. In reality, where only some of us are apparently, you could be worried about other small things being added and maybe two years down the line some kind P2W-esque thing (a gun skin with +5% reload speed), but this absurd jump to $50 LEGENDARIES!!! OMG CALL JIMQUISITION!!! is fucking bullshit and the worst thing about it is that I know you know it's bullshit, yet you'll still keep pretending like it's gonna happen. People have been saying shit like this for years for every game that has MTX and it NEVER FUCKING HAPPENS. Yeah, buying a boost for your character in a competitive multiplayer game would be bad. But that;'s nowhere near this absurd bullshit you dickweeds keep frothing at the mouth about.
---
If you were just fucking honest with yourselves and didn't over-exaggerate at every fucking turn I wouldn't fucking think you guys were a bunch of dipshits.
---
Water production in a CAMP is capped at a number per hour.  Having more purifiers does not increase the amount you produce per hour.  It only increases the amount that can be held before you have to collect from them.
---
It's not spelled out well in game, but it's how it works.
---
Keep that New Vegas garbage out of here
---
I want a unicycle
---
I'm stuck with this game since launch and I'm starting to wonder if maybe I made a mistake cuz it just seems like it's going to go to a money-hungry type of game we're just to be able to play you're going to have to spend money
---
Integrate what? They pretty much took FO4 and slapped multiplayer into it. Most of the bugs existing in FO4 still do exist in FO76 because it's the same codebase. You'll still find references to FO4 in the code, you can even find references to skyrim in the code because they reused their engines so much. I doubt they integrated anything, I wouldn't even be surprised if they simply forgot to remove the holotapes.
---

Really?  Are you sure about that?  My friend has 4 large ones and I loot 20 water from him all the time.  (5 each)
---
Np! Be careful next time!
---
They stuck the tip in as soon as you bought the game. 
---
If Ideas can make it from forums to the game, great!  I want these beautiful people developing this amazing game to showered with riches, cheered on by the masses like rock stars when they walk down the streets.  Call them what u will but these people make dreams reality.
---
Again, you don't understand the concept of incrementalism.

And it doesn't matter because like I said, you're going to believe whatever ignorant bullshit you already believe. 
---
I suppose there's no point in casting my pearls before swine, so have a nice day.

You're right. I would've bet you a box of doughnuts they were there. I swear I remember seeing them for sale before. Old age may be finally catching up with me.

Do you know the number per hour?

Why cast pearls of wisdom before swine like yourself? You're dumb enough to be willingly ripped off, so there's no more point in talking to you any further.
---
Have a nice day, sucker.
---
I'm with you on some of this, the first two. Your solution for Chameleon sounds iffy to me. -10% vats maybe, but not completely removing it.   
---
Exsplosive weapons already do damage to the user, unless you've staked the build to not do that. I stopped using them because I died to much from the glitchy way mobs move in this game during lag spikes.   
---
two shots are fucking useless at range as it is.   
---
Your solution for vampires makes zero sense (then again, neither does the legendary)  
---
Nocturnal is garbage that no one uses as it is. 
---
It's a rather recent PS4 Pro with a Samsung 1TB SSD, sitting next to the TV, completely nothing around it... And it's a rather cool evening to boot.

So no. 
---
The change in tone is directly due to content introduced in F076 in speeches made by Elder Maxson. I agree that you could read it how you present it, but it is absolutely in the retcon realm as it cements an otherwise nebulous argument made in earlier games. 
---
Not the exact number.  But I believe that it's pretty much capped out with a single purifier.  Putting more in your camp does nothing but make it so it can hold more before you have to empty it.  Makes it so you don't have to baby sit your purifiers.
---
We already **paid** for the box. They just want us to pay again, and again, and again ... etc.
---
If you honestly believe bgs would just sell op guns in the shop and people wouldn’t just stop playing or at minimum stop participating in pvp then you’re the most naive person around

You have no options for foundations at all?

He didn't say about any canvas shortage. He said they switch it because of costs, which is quite understandable.

---
As I said before, I'm not going to waste my time on fools like yourself any more.
---
It still gives a advantage to someone buying infinite of them though, but people's main concern is what it means for the game. It means they are willing to go down this path which can very easiely lead to more extreme pay to win things, I mean we paid full price for this game, now if you don't pay extra you can be at a disadvantage, imagine if you can pay for legendaries, armour, rare loot boosts, it's a small walk to get to another ea
---
Do you have it set to filter by buildable, and don't have any concrete left?
---
Ok so I won
---
Yeah, much more disconnects and flat out crashes (the first day I couldn't play for more than two minutes, I thought the game was just done for me for a while) since the hotfix. 
---
There's also the 3 tiers of Combat armor, same as in FO4 Light &gt;Sturdy &gt; Heavy with corresponding visual models. If it's legendary, you can usually tell what it is by the DR/ER and the model, when you equip it, since legendary don't have the L/S/H Prefix on it.
---
Is that shops? I've looked in tbe golf course a few times but not found anything as yet
---
Unfortunate might as well change the sub count  to “Bethesda butt buddies” 
---
Nope limited time and has only been out once. 
---
The problem is that they have said, multiple times, that the atom shop would be cosmetic only. They're lying to us and cucks like you are defending them
---
I spent 2200 dimes of real money, as I bought the power armor edition
---
Farm Whitesprings or Watoga legendaries appear there frequently bit given all the types of legendaries there are it might take awhile to get keepers.
---
Sell the junk to the vendor bots there or drop them.
---
The last fucking straw.
---
Awww man.  Well I really enjoyed our time together.  I hope it was as good for you as it was for me.  You'll always hold a special in my heart.
---
$5 is unrealistic when you know Bethesda and their current pricing on skins they’ve spent probably around 30-40 minutes making
---
Honestly for me the issue isn't the grain, it's the wood and water. It's such a pain to gather for beer that sells for less than the fucking mats do. 
---
There is more than one playstyle for melee. If you are running straight at an enemy in an open field, you deserve to die. Melee is a terror inside dungeons. Wait until you are wanted or top three and walk 10 seconds into a dungeon and hide. When they get close, beat the crap out of them. The problem is with the players, not the weapon.
---
I know that literally \*every\* legendary I come across now runs away, so he could've done that. It doesn't matter what faction or race they are, they all run away.
---
I can do whitesprings, where abouts do they spawn?
---
Watoga is very dangerous for me as the assault not guys kick my ass
---
same.  Was about to install yesterday after a few months hiatus and noped the fuck out again.
---
Bethesda lied about cosmetic only.  I was ridiculed for my criticism against the unstoppables boost saying its a slippery slope.  Now look.  Fucking never buying a Bethesda game again. 
---
&gt;Ok so I ~~won~~ am dumb enough to believe that not being able to understand the concept of incrementalism means I "won".
---
Fixed that for you. Have a nice day, sucker.
---
Just a random crash.  They happen in this game.
---
Don't drop anything on the ground or in a world container that you don't want to have a chance to lose.  If it's not on your person or in your stash, it's not safe.
---
Yes exactly.   You'd be stupid not to.

---
Exactly this! 
---
I don't think they (Bethesda) understand how far some honesty would go here. At this point it seems like the San Antonio studio was treated, supported and financed like an indy studio, and they just couldn't produce true AAA quality, or even the level of buggy content we expect from Bethesda.
---
At some point the people who actually made this game are going to speak up about the experience of making this game for Bethesda, and I think it will be even less flattering to the company than most people expect.
---
Not a difficult concept nor a real threat
---
Been said before but it's kind of ridiculous to not have a breakdown of X resource input yields Y ammo output when you craft. Know before you go! But what fun would that be wastelanders? 
---
That is very likely untrue I remember people saying they were never gonna buy another Rockstar game GTA 5 added shark cards. Didn't stop them from playing RDR2. The truth is the market will speak for itself and it's said that P2W microtransactions = $$$$$ The thing is that even if you do quit, it doesn't matter they already have your money in their pocket and there is about a 1/10 chance that 5 years from now or whenever they next release a game you will actually care about this.
---
Aww, aren't you cute!
---
Still mad? Still need that hug?

I sent a request enderman_bouncer

Are you ok? Do you need someone to call your mom because you read something you didn't agree with and aren't smart enough to retort? Did you get scared? Is there a big doody in your diaper, big boy? Does mommy need to change it? Who's my big strong boy? Is it you? No it's not, you're just a shit stain who can't insult people for shit. Which is ironic, because you yourself are a piece of shit.

... and? They still have private shareholders. Private shareholders buy, trade and exchange shares they just do it privately. The value of those shares is still just as important as a public company. The top private companies in the US alone account for trillions in revenue.
---
ZeniMax’s private shareholders *absolutely care* how much money they and their subsidiary’s like Bethesda are making. 
---
I just restarted the game like 30 minutes earlier (CE-34787 error, happens every time after playing the game for a while). 
---
Game is full of bugs. 
---
It's very annoying.
---
It's not fun. 
---
Sterilized doesn’t mean that metabolic function has stopped.
---
To ‘ Fund future dlc ‘ ? They didn’t make enough money from this game to already do that? I know this game got poor reviews, but still. Plenty of people paid AT LEAST $60 (depending on what version you bought) for this game. You multiply that by say, 1 million copies sold? That’s $60 million dollars. I have no idea how much it costs to make a video game. But you have to think Bethesda made a big profit either way. Even if they only sold 500 thousand copies, that’s still $30 million dollars. They should have plenty of money for dlc’s.  
---
yeah, as the server progresses, more and more fly over that way. Semi-reliable system for judging how long a server's been active is to go over there. No cargo bots? probably a pretty fresh server. A shit ton? Hop before you drop a nuke.

A DIRECT FUCKING QUOTE from Pete Hines prior to the game's release.
---
&gt; “**All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76–all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff–is going to be free.** That’s important. And to say, **the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff**. To make sure folks understand–look there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but **we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60**. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.”
---
Shame on you for not supporting them by buying cosmetics! (Here's a /s to go with my comment.) 
---
We need the R91 back. To help differenetiate this AR from others, they can make it a 3-round-burst.
---
Then they can add more skins in the shop for this. Maybe even the [Infiltrator](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Infiltrator_(The_Pitt)
---
Ive been wanting to see something like this. I know theres basically just ghoul and human but id settle for that. Being a ghoul you could take no rad damage right from the start. I remember in F3 messing with the color and making my skin green and pretending i was a mutant human hybrid. Once i got fawkes it was over for those puny humans.
---
Seems Beth's MO has been less is more when it comes to public communication, they did the same quiet game during all the scuttle right after release.
---
How much concrete do you have left in your inventory?
---
Never said you were.
---
I said you're a gullible sucker, a mark, and clearly someone who's too dense to waste any further time on, but I never said you were needlessly panicking.
---
Try to pay attention.
---
That's just it, though.
---
Since they are private shareholders, we have no idea if they are or aren't buying/trading/exchanging shares.
---
Also, in general, private shareholders don't make any money or share in profits.  In order to realize profit, they'd have to be involved in secondary markets, and even then, you can't freely trade in secondary markets w/o it being heavily regulated by their own company.
---
What top private companies in the US account for trillions in revenue?
---
Dude it’s kind of a niche weapon. More of a goof off with your friends Gun. Shoot I’d pay 3000, but not more than that. 
---
I thought I saw a comment from Bethesda saying the SBQ was an animal. I could be wrong though.
---
27 Years old and still play! watched my oldest brother play Fallout 1 and fell in love with it, eventually he let me play and even though I was God awful at it, I fell in love with it, even as a kid who had no idea what he was doing or what 90% of the stuff going on was.
---
I mean considering there placement in the world they were literally added as features. 
---
Like bro your still salty over the fact Bethesda released this game but it’s literally been months and we’re in the dlc season. Grow up. Consumers like you are what kill the chance to enjoy games and what kill the entire market. People that play, enjoy and take part in FO76 and it’s community don’t all white knight agree with and defend Bethesda. I openly dislike a lot of what they do with they’re games, they often come across as low effort (there is no true concrete proof to that statement, it’s ignorant to say so. They still crafted an entire triple A worthy world full of quests and new mobs. In fact the new content and QoL upgrades in FO76 are worryingly overshadowed imo). It’s just salty people bandwagoning over Bethesda being stupid and doing nothing to actually help them change or improve. If you want to see good from Bethesda don’t make the same point x reviewer has made for the nth time because nobody here or there cares ?? You can’t call FO76 a bad game, it’s not true it’s just fallout with multiplayer it’s not unplayable it’s not terrible. It needs more polish yes, but with that it would literally be fine. If your issue is Bethesda why don’t you stop buying the games if you won’t change. Spreading your opinion like it’s fact helps nobody and causes more toxicity. The bandwagon for FO76 has done nothing good for the gaming community nobody has “shown they don’t want unfinished games” or anything they just overly smashed Bethesda for shit that ain’t even as bad as re-re-releasing Skyrim. Did any of this improve FO76? No it didn’t? Because if you just go “muh code copypaste” every time they get jack shit from that. Yes we get it you think a game with an entirely new crafted world, new assists, new enemies, entire multiplayer framework, photo mode, challenge and perk system, new VATS and pipboy changes and more is just a exact exact rehash of FO4. Bro if you cared you’d just report bugs, say where the game could improve and yknow mention just once or twice to Bethesda that this isn’t the direction the fans want. Nothing is going to change the reality of this game, get over it.
---
It was toggled. I must of hit it on accident. Thank you everyone!
---
It works for all melee weapons, including unarmed, but not the chainsaw.
---
Just bad timing. But yes the golf club and the houses/room north of it. Makes a big loop
---
Nothing on your list _matters_. It's a non-cosmetic item in the atom shop. Period.  The VP of the company promised that would not be a thing, and yet here we are. 
---
I wouldn't really say that's worth 14k. Junkie and damage resist while aiming are near worthless. Explosive got devalued heavily by the nerf.
---
Tesla and Gauss Rifles are still the only good energy weapons until Bethesda decides to give them more buffs. 
---
&gt;but I don't want to smell like shit.
---
Too late, you've been stinking up the place with all the verbal diarrhea you've been spewing everywhere ever since you arrived.
---
I'm kinda curious why people who aren't emotionally invested in the FO universe are still interested in this buggy trash game AT ALL when you could be play a game like Sekiro instead 🤔
---
Yeah, I'm totally the one who's overly emotionally invested 😂😂😂 not the people who are going to spend money on top of full price to make the game playable 😂😂😂 y'all have fun with that
---
AFAIK PS logs how often a player logs into a game (assuming they are connected to the internet.)
---
Yeah I've always used cannibal and it's great until you have massive robot or animal fights and you got too comfortable with fuck all aid on you. 
---
Better. More playable but still have a wrinkles to iron out. 
---
I started with 3, but I played every game. I bought this game becuse I love the idea of fallout multiplayer, lately I been playing a lot of the survival mode because it feels more like the old fallout where raiders shot on sight but also i can be a good guy role-playing as a responder ranger  protecting low level people in the first areas, so yeah i also enjoy for the PvP and the multiplayer aspect in general.
---
Yes, the point is this is an alcoholic Nuka Cola. It's affected by two perks because of that. The actual new alcohol is not affected by the alcohol perk.
---
thank you 
---
Lol your source is a self described amateur making a post on reddit. Once I see some actual sources outside of reddit, the same website that falsely accuses people of terrorist attacks while playing armchair detective, I'll believe it.
---
&gt; But is that really an advantage over someone
---
Do we need to go back to elementary school level and teach you what  a fucking word means ? advantage: any form of positive effect, buff, skill, ability that you have access to but others do not.
---
Especially when you think about the soon coming raids where workbenches most likely will not be within the raid area, this is giving those who then pay real money an important advantage over normal users as they can just repair their weapons and dont have to bring several different ones in case one breaks and therefore can even loot more freely as they have less weight on them.
---
The very fact alone that in a full-price game you can then still get microtransactions that are non-cosmetic and have a direct in-game effect should be enough to tell you that this is a gigant pile of shit of a concept. Even more so because it most likely wont stop at just these repair kits (looking how they mention ammo converters, refrigerators and so on in the very same post).
---
Haven't you thought how weird it is that they nerfed all repair perks to near uselessness THEN released these? Now food spoils really fast and fridges are coming - gonna bet these are AS exclusives too.
---
I would buy one unless it would take half of my atoms.

Don't go in there!

Big thumbs down from me.

I've managed it pretty well, visit Silvia and Billings Homestead on the west side of the map, pickup corn/razorgrain, head back to my camp, grab dirty water from my pond, forage for wood 10ft away.

Bonus: use super Duper and Woodchucker for additional boiled water and wood.

Fair point - another reason why ZMX is the devil in disguise. They take absolutely no risk when they force their will upon the face of FO76. It infuriates me. BGS is a fantastic company, they don't deserve the hate they get - not to the extent they ultimately do.
---
How is that a problem? Are your feelings hurt? Did the mean ol' game company make something that make you sad, widdle baby? It's a repair kit, nobody is going to win anything with it. Who cares.
---
Im so mad we’re getting crafting 50 as daily over and over. Come on....
---
Oh really?! That's amazing I'm off to do that now 
---
Meanwhile two mothman duke it out behind a rock 
---
I promise I will never buy an online Bethesda title if they introduce any sort of pay to win mechanics.
---
I do i remember. I havent bought an EA, Activision, Bethesda or Ubisoft, Bioware or other bigger game for a long time because of what they are going. I wanted to get DeathSpank, but then i saw that it was EA (completely forgot about it it, nice game though) so I sighed and kept to my resolve of not giving them a single cent until they change.
---
https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ea --- people forget and dips happen in stock. Ever since the great BF2 dip the stock  is already back to what it was at October 2018 or 2017, and trend shows that it keeps growing. This is why I said that people forget. Many of those gamers has a rightful WTF moment, but everything is back to normal now. They still buy microtransactions and games, so nothing will change. There is literally no incentive to them, because all they have to do is just wait it out because of the attentionspan.
---
Going back to FO76 - I just don't understand how many times game compenies can fool people until they had enough, because apparently not even the controversies that followed were enough for many.
---
Okey dokey, thanks for the route :).
---
I'll report back if I get anytjing of use! 
---
New vault raid comes with a new enemy type: Acid spitting scorch beasts or something that deteriorates gear quicker.
---
I will fucking die laughing if this happens and never buy any Bethesda or ZeniMax product again. 
---
Let it ferment. So basically when the condition bar runs out. It wont say vintage. It just says beer or w/e
---
If any alcoholic beverage still has a CND meter after fermenting, that means it can be further aged into a vintage state. 
---
Easiest way to get a vintage drink is with Nukashine. Brew one, toss into the fermenter for an hour, and you'll have Vintage Nukashine that counts for the daily challenge. 
---
&gt;You'll always hold a special place in my heart.
---
Well, since you're going to be *that* way about it... What are you wearing?
---
I don't mind making you my bitch if we're going to go there, sweetie. 💖
---
Right
---
Say you’re gonna make Nukashine. After obtaining all ingredients. You will craft fermentable Nukashine. Throw that in the fermenter. It degrades and turns into Nukashine. Then remove and insert into fermenter. Let it degrade and it’s Vintage Nukashine. But it works for all fermentable beverages. Some alcohol cannot be aged into a vintage. 
---
I’m not gonna get into a debate about the merits of capitalism here but the fact is that companies are profit driven. There’s a way for consumers to be happy and the company to still make a profit and allow itself to invest in bigger projects down the line. Personally I want to still be able to play this game 5 years down the line and if there’s not a system in place to fund the cost of servers, customer service and future development work then I see that as unlikely. You can speculate as to how much money was made but it doesn’t change the business model and circumstances of this game, if we want it to be playable down the line then there needs to be some incentive for the developer to create new content. 
---
But you admitted that these will be DLCs so would you rather them split the player base up and release it behind a paywall? I’ve played 500+ hours at this point and feel like I’ve gotten my $60 worth out of this game, I can’t expect them to pump out new content with no monetary reward. The atom shop is the best way, they just need to do a better job monetizing it in a responsible manner.
---
One, regrettably, is compelled to ask why you disagree. This is my point, exactly. Direction without reason is chaos. Elaborate, please. 
---
&gt;If you sneak you cannot get targeted by VATS.
---
But this is part of the reason why  PVP is broken. It's go stealth or go home.  I personally hate playing stealth and I know I am not the only one.  I see only a handful of successful builds. 
---
1. Players with marsupial and stealth boys with TSE (and the perk to make stealth boys last longer)
---
2. Players with all of the above and sentinel assassins armor or maybe cavalier assassins armor
---
And that's basically it. 
---
Power armor is  near useless, which means heavy weapons are also useless  in PVP..
---
Stabilized perk that ignores 45 percent of armor when using heavy weapons requires power armor. I think it should stay that way, as there are other perks that require  no power armor, I think there should be perks requiring it and weapons that power armor enhances. Entire classes of builds are almost completely useless. 
---
When I make this argument people say we need legendary power armor. Which is another problem;  you have to have legendary gear to compete and legendary gear is RNG dependent. 
---
Alright 
---
I think I'm in love
---
&gt;Right
---
Yes, I know I am.
---
they dont care if you dont play it anymore, you already paid for the game and werent going to pay for the atom shop stuff. if you quit, you are just lowering their server costs
---
Wait repair kits how do u get them
---
Other question have is: Is the only metal power door with keypad access the sheet metal kind not the heavy duty metal kind?
---
Thank you for responding.  So this means that two players, one entering via X-box the other entering via a PC can't partner?  PCs and X-box players are kept on separate Fallout 76 servers?
---
Right now you don’t just look like someone being rude because other people aren’t worried about something they are?
---
Well either way its very annoying
---
I agree. Even if they sold XP doubling consumables.... who cares. Who’s it really hurting? These same people that would complain that it’s p2w probably used in game exploits to farm xp at one point.
---
Well? What are you wearing?
---
Fallout 4 has 13 million. That game did not sell 13m copies in the month of march - not five years post launch. It's active players.
---
So you want legendaries to be like mutations? I dont think idea will get much support. The fact that you referenced TSE weapons means you are misinformed. Its bloodied explosive and furious explosive these days, TSE weapons are garbo now compared to the other explosive weapons. Posts complaining about strong gear are basically just asking to not have an end game at all. 
---
Can we stop asking for nerfs and other things to make the end game weak? 
---
Not everyone are yes men and just say what you want to hear. You ain’t nobody important. Lose the weird attitude. 
---
That's just being paranoid. If there's some proof, I'd be happy to believe you, but until it happens I'm not going to assume guilt. Stupidity is usually more likely than malice.
---
Take my upvote
---
A banana hammock.  Oh and some mismatched socks.
---
Bulking is mainly for selling.  The items you listed can be sold without bulking.  
---
Oh, I don't mind being rude to shitbags like yourself one bit.
---
I wouldn't even mind buying cosmetics, it's just I haven't really seen anything that's interested me enough to buy atoms. Once those 4 horsemen power armor paints come out i may buy atoms and pick one of those up.
---
2 mil isn’t a number to balk at, JS.
---
Yes i just completed the achievement on my alt whos lv 25 and the weapon lv 45. So its a fixed drop,do not scale with your current lv. 
---
I think a lot of players are confused about that and so was I  so i will post a thread with pics so ppl can go with a low lv char.
---
Where is your response on lying about Atomic Shop being cosmetic only?
---
To further my point... I would say 50% of the people complaining probably bought a coke or dorito product to boot themselves in a cod game.
---
Shhh you'll give them ideas
---
Are you over 21?
---
Wow so those repair kits
---
It’s not pay to win, first off you get atoms playing the game! That is the opposite of pay to win. There are no guns, or armors exclusive to a pay only currency. 
---
Second how many details are there out about repair kits? I can’t really see much since this sub is flooded with the same damn posts. Searching isn’t much better. It was a mistake to not keep this issue in a mega thread, it’s just pushing people out of the sub. Since most these threads are Just the same screaming in different ways. But that’s another issue. Are there cool downs on the kits? Can they be used in combat, or PvP combat? I keep seeing this claim they will give advantages in PvP, but no source that’s how it will be. How much do they weigh? How many can you carry? Are the consumable, or a one to few time use? I’m having trouble finding he details under the repeated screaming matches, and crying. 
---
Then if you trying bringing it up, it gets drown out by these people knowing all the answers like they can predict the future. With no sauce. 
---
I been trying to see any new information on other things, and see some C.A.M.P’s. Maybe help some people, but currently as the sub is. I think I’ll unfollow for awhile and come back in a few weeks. It’s feeling like pre-beta again, and release. Any voice with reason is being drown out under all the screeching. All other topics being buried. 
---
I really wish the mods would change their mind, because it’s going to kill off the sub if it’s allowed to be like this. When it’s better to take to Twitter to be heard, and not 500000 threads worded differently, and the comments being all the same. Just pushing the people who are neutral, or looking to do the same as me. It could even push the devs out the sub Reddit. I’ve seen it happen in plenty of gaming subs. 
---
Do I need a permission slip from a parent or guardian?
---
I'm sure a lot of the pressure for microtransactions and crap is  from the top, but I don't know how much. 
---
I do know that the VP of the company promised there would only be cosmetic items in the atom shop, and that this is the company breaking their word. 
---
If it was some...low level programmer? Ok sure, people speak out of turn all the time, but if the word of the VP of a company isn't good, then... yeah, they deserve some hate. 
---
You can only turn off turrets and certain Robobrains. 
---
Well it seems to me the one who needs help here is you as you’re literally telling me you’re outraged about something that “might” happen but hasn’t actually happened. 
---
There’s no indication any of the extra stuff they mentioned is atom shop as well, not saying you don’t have some legitimate concern but I’d consider this slightly over reactionary. 
---
At least you made an actual argument with the raids instead of just repeating the same thing over and over.  I agree with sending a message that we don’t want those other things as atom shop items at least. 
---
There's a piece of the puzzle you aren't adding in here. The game came out in such a trash state that they aren't meeting the numbers they need to stick to the free dlc model they used to market this game. They're hoping to prop that up with atomic shop sales, but the player base is so much smaller than protected they couldn't keep their "cosmetic only" promise for 6 months.
---
Saying "you can't sell me anything in the atomic shop if I'm too disgusted with the entire situation to turn on the game," isn't the same as saying I'll never buy a title from you again.
---
I’m thinking do similar to WF; allow it to be bought, and skip the quest, in essence, yet still allow the item to be available through said quest.
---
You can grind for it, or skip the grind, but either way, everyone gets it at some point.
---
I don't mess with minors, sweetie. If you aren't over 21, get back to doing your homework and remember to take your vitamins.
---
Hey man, I'm not the one viciously defending a multi-million dollar company like they're an innocent, defenseless child. You gonna cry yourself to sleep tonight, thinking about how sad Todd and Pete must be, rolling around in their piles of cash? 
---
Whether it is intentional or not is irrelevant though. The fact is that recent balance updates have incentivised new non-cosmetics is troubling.
---
Isn’t that what they did with previous Fallout games?? And other games? Regarding dlc? You had to pay for it? Btw, I wasn’t, and am not debating anything. I’m not here to debate or argue. It’s called an opinion.  
---
I believe that means that you can use atoms obtained for free or purchased to buy the repair kits. 
---
Then why were you being so gay earlier in the thread?
---
absolutely one of my favorite mods for FO4 was the personal jetpack.
---
This would help some of the primary issues 
---
I don’t think it’s luck. My base has no walls, just a bed, workbenches, 3 unlocked water purifiers, and crops. If you build a giant wood and concrete structure and lock everything, you become a target....
---
The advanced repair kits are rewards/drops. The basic are purchasable
---
SAVE YOUR ATOMS KIDS!
---
Respectfully I disagree. Bethesda is hoping this will be forgotten and swept under the rug, removing posts will just make this happen all the more quickly. 
---
Mine is pistachio. Also, I never had blueberry ice cream? I didn't know they existed!
---
Yeah, I just wish I had more time to take advantage of it. I’d be pumping out fusion cores without a lock and concrete barricade. 
---
You don't actually play this game. The prewar food doesn't spoil.
---
It's called role playing for a reason.  I figured you'd be into it since Fallout is a role playing game.
---
And what exactly makes me a shitbag? A differing opinion?
---
Exactly this.
---
Please bring back the red rocket items!! 
---
Do you want the dick? Yes or no 😂. I say whatever I want anytime I want. You can too. It just don’t matter. If someone wants to be gay. That’s ok too. 
---
Same here on xbox
---
Look if you dont give a crap about the games future just because anything that hasnt happened so far doesnt matter to you, you can do that.(although that kind of thinking isnt sustainable in any way, if you only care about stuff right when you need it and dont plan ahead thats just plain stupid, but hey if you want to be like that its your deal) 
---
Just dont waste anyones time explaining things to you then when you simply dont care.
---
I for one do care about the future of the game and the direction the game is headed to. And that future is currently looking damn bleak.
---
With that, consider this discussion over, I wont waste my time on you.
---
Been a fan since Fallout 1!
---
Well by the sound of it I don't think you ever bought any atoms from the atom shop.  Don't get me wrong here I think it's bad that it's being sold for atoms but the thing is that there is a net positive monetary increase with it.
---
Oh, I'll give you a role to play... 
---
...If you're a legal adult, that is.

Right at the top, it says numbers =/= sales

These are active player counts of people with PSN accounts. 
---
What kind of jackass only goes by 20 companies? You do realize that the Fortune 500 is a thing? It lists the top 500 companies in the US by revenue and includes both public and private companies which make their revenue publicly available. It’s one of the most famous listings in the world and every company wants to be on it. They even have a Fortune 1000. 
---
The fact you think it’s ridiculous to count to 20 shows your ignorance. I’m not going to discuss this any further. 
---
Yeah just dont overact pls. Even if Beth is bound to Zenimax and forced to make this game all this barking and complaining will someday end in a return backlash and they will for real completely ignore us and don't even care about  constructive and mostly objective feedback. Just because they didn't answer right after 24h of complaining, doesn't mean they ignore that. The Reddit Moderators already collected the feedback and will bring em to the Devs. Right know its friday, noone is going to care about repair kits \^\^ Give em their free time.

You know, now that you mention it, I couldn’t get the north lake Mirelurk queen to spawn.

People have questions about, say, plasma rifles. Is that considered a rifle like any other weapon? Or is it an energy weapon? Conversely, at what point does modding the gun potentially change the definition of it? Is the flamer attachment explosives or is it plasma energy and not affected by it?
---
There's a lot of reasons a system like this is needed.
---
If I told you, it would be a spoiler.  Those are bad according to the internet.
---
The fact that your verbal diarrhea has been stinking up this place so bad, mostly.
---
Black cherry
---
idk about others but i downvoted him for being flat out wrong.
---
it was on sale within 2 weeks of release because that was black friday sales week, and it was only on sale for a week.
---
Bethesda promised only non-cosmetics. This is a betrayal of trust.
---
Yup, I do realize the Fortune 500 and 1000 are a thing.  However, the majority of the companies on that list are public.
---
Yeah I had some back in Turkey and they made blueberry ice cream, it was pretty damn good. I forget pistachios exist so I’m gonna have to give thag a try 
---
You seem awfully flustered when we were having an actual discussion. If you cant discuss opposing points with another person without getting emotional and honesty borderline offensive then maybe you should stay off reddit and do some growing up. If I didn’t care about the game I would not have wasted my time taking back and forth with you. You’re being ridiculous have a great day 
---
Sorry, sweetheart, you sound a bit too young for me.
---
Come back when you've grown some pubes, mmmkay?
---
Mine too, been a problem since they released it
---
Photomode poses that utilise your equipped weapon. Like holding up your gun, putting baseball bat on shoulder, firing/swinging weapon (without consuming ammo or dealing damage). 
---
Finish it and the whole defense system will shut down.  
---
Considering that all 2-handed weapons are visually held with 1 hand in Power armor, I do think there is some confusion here that could easily be removed with some more info included with the weapon.
---
just to be clear, if they had flat out said "microtransactions will be p2w", it would not make it any better right?
---
Thankyou
---
Nope.  I know the company who manufactured the helmets and made the bags, and the details of it.  But hey, feel free to ignore the truth.
---
does Todd have anything to do with these things?
---
I stopped playing around the beginning of the year, but I've been following the impact of updates on YouTube. Overall people seem to think it's really improved 
---
to add to this point, some guns change to depending on what mods you have on the (laser pistol/rifle) displaying this info would really help.
---
Shush
---
So a different opinion. Gotcha.
---
Zenimax ***is*** Bethesda though. Bethesda formed Zenimax years ago as a publishing company, then Zenimax formed Zenimax Online Studios (ZOS) for ESO (and in the event it failed it'd be a self contained system). It's all one and the same. People like to act like it's Zenimax or ZOS pulling strings but it's all the same in the end.
---
I should also say, I only bought one item from the current sale that is now gone forever.  These new bundles suck.  Theres a reason why the vault tec items never sold at the start, people like myself don't want vault tec things(vault boy head was nice though), we ditched our under armor as soon as we could.
---
You're breaking my heart here 😭.  I can change, I swear.
---
For what it's worth, I've found 2 industrial water purifiers to be the sweet spot. Especially if you stay on top of the collection. I end up selling a ton of purified water.

---
Thanks. :)
---
There's bigger lists than this but here's _a_ way to get reliable legendaries:
---
If you want to drown yourself in a sea of mediocre 1\* legendaries hit up The Whitespring and Watoga. Guaranteed handful of level 50 legendary loot but almost all 1\* with the occasional 2\* and 3\*. (2\* are less common than the 3\*). Good place to get started.
---
If you want a better chance at 3\* loot but a bit underleveled (Level 35/40 stuff) hit up Uranium Fever. Guaranteed 3 x 3\* level 40 legendary mole miners. Keep in mind there's only about 1:3 chance of getting a 3\* drop from a 3\* mob so you improve your chances a bit by getting 3 at once.
---
If you want to get more 3\* legendaries you're going to want to do horde events in the Mire and the Bog. The horde boss is almost always a 3\* legendary but if you hit up the Forest, the Heap or the Valley they're only going to be level 10-30 max. Mire and Bog is where its at. There's other events that can spawn legendaries but they're less reliable.
---
Then there's locations with big bosses who are generally high level 3\* mobs _but_ that's not necassirily the case. Places like WesTek and RobCo Research will reliably spawn legendary bosses. Sometimes the Watoga EMS building.
---
PS4 I get that blue screen (CE-34787) error every time I play an extend amount of time also. I anticipate it the longer I play and really get nervous in a nuke zone when I have a bunch of good stuff on me
---
then please stop sending me your pics.
---
Pay to win is spending real money to earn an advantage or to alleviate a difficult process. Think of freemium mobile games and buying crystals to speed up construction. These games are tweaked to incentive spending real world money to overcome a minor annoyance (waiting). So in a game that has repair as a massive component, spending money to remove that annoyance means they are likely to want to make normal repairing worse, making people want to spend money. Which they literally did last patch by nerfing repair perks. 
---
Dang.  The level 52 gutsy needs to be deleted from the game. I have died over 10x now trying to navigate to the control room. 
---
I'm level 87 wearing power armor and out of stimpaks and almost out of every aid plus i only have 236 caps.
---
And just saw a legendary 3star assaultron who has invincibility but now can't find it although i see the caption that he has false alarm
---
Perks that were recently nerfed
---
I had Mac and Cheese ice cream a while ago and it was awesome. (I am not kidding)
---
Dang, and I've been wanting that. Thanks for helping me save Atoms, guys!
---
I never sent you anything psycho. No one knows who you are. Don’t tell me you’re one of those crazy gays
---
Their statement/your quote was that basic repair kits can be purchased with atoms - and you either purchase or earn atoms.
---
BUT! Improved repair kits are strictly earnable (at least via grinding baddies).
---
So you're still right, just wrong quote :) 
---
Wearing non-Weightless armor will deactivate Chameleon. Having armor be zero weight doesn't matter without Weightless.
---
They made all the repair perks match. That wasn't because of repair packs it was for consistency which makes sense
---
What platform are you on?
---
Le sigh.  I guess I'll have to find a piece with Chameleon on it.
---
I’m sorry... Mac n Cheese? How did it taste like and where did you acquire this?
---
Mint chocolate chip :)
---
Level 50 is the best time to do the Mayor quest. You'll get the top level All Rise (weight reduced super sledge). 
---
Even after I did that mission and still instinctively (and unknowingly) shot at the bots until my friend told me they wouldn't attack me unless I shot first.
---
Whoops.
---
Manipulative as usual. 
---
I purposely stock up on healing salves plus have the heal your friends card. From a lore standpoint, it's funny as hell to be a field medic and a zombie. 
---
I dont even find you attractive, so please stop.
---
Credit where credit is due!   
---
I didn't expect such a civil response after coming at ya so hard there - And I do apologize for being so heavy handed. But to get right down to it - I agree with pretty much every development there -   
---
1. Pretty much any BETA that happens these days is more of a 'marketable incentive' than something actually used to further the development of the game. See pretty much any of EA's work, the RDR2 Online BETA, etc, etc. 
---
2. I agree, it's illegal and it sucks. The only thing I don't agree with is the whole - "This makes them as bad as EA, they're dead to me, Bethesda is dead, etc, etc' thing that's going around the community. It's bad, it's a mistake, but a slip up like that... Which I mean... They're fixing, as I stated - Is definitely not grounds to Euthanize the company. 
---
3. I wouldn't really say it's Yong owning his mistake, he didn't even admit he was wrong. &gt;\_&lt;   
---
Literally, when responding to the article, which was entirely factual he used the phrase 'Those are Jason's opinions' to avoid admitting he'd flubbed with his videos on the creation engine.
---
4. Aye, I'm wrong to say the \*entire\* fallout community, it would be like saying the \*entirety\* of Bethesda are corporate leeches that don't care about making games. It's just that these people that want to start bonfires out of embers are the ones that're cited most often, they're the loudest and therefore the most popular - So typically others move to capitalize on that movement. Of course there are outliers, LegacyKillaHD in particular was pretty good with covering the news about 76, he obviously knew what the problems were and called them as such, but he didn't go out of his way to demonize the game and the company over it.
---
That's the thing though, bad news is good news for the people reporting it. I don't think I've seen a single video in support of 76 post launch, praising the true-intentioned roadmap or community. It's the negative news you'll see the big youtube names stand up for.
---
Considering it was released 5 months ago, and it's contemporaries are doubling it's player count - it's disappointing.
---
I play a lot of Warframe. You can buy anything in the game for real money. Nobody calls that game pay to win. Pay to win only applies in games that have PvP. They take away PvP, they can add anything they want to the atomic shop. I don’t want to see an item for sale that directly impacts my enjoyment of the game things like boosters and consumables. In Warframe boosters benefits all members of your squad. In FO76 it’s all solo giving you advantage over every one who doesn’t pay.  Which ruins the game for every one else. FO76 is also a full priced game. I don’t want to have to buy things that should already be in the game for free.  Although the repair kit is innocent and doesn’t directly give the player who pays an advantage, it is a stepping stone letting Bethesda slowly creep its way to full on pay to win. Soon boosters then legendary weapons and armor and before you know it they are selling cheat codes. 
---
I get what you mean but why shouldn't we be allowed to build what we want? Bethesda promotes it with the atomic shop...thats why I don't understand why they didn't allow it from the start. It doesn't feel right to me, but that's my own opinion of the situation.
---
Not sure, Bethesda won't give us accurate numbers, according to them they had 'millions' of players though I believe.
---
Each soldier has a unique helmet design.
---
Legendary enemies spawn in those locations. With a lot of friends. 
---
Fair point. Which means the hate's all aimed at the right spot anyway.
---
I started with 3, all its DLC's, NV and all it's DLC's, then 4 and it's DLC's except FH (I will still do that at some point). 
---
I've loved 76 since beta. Not a PVPer but I have thoroughly enjoyed FO76 solo and co-op.
---
Grabbed the free copies of 1, 2, and Tactics (given to 76 beta players) and intend to play them as well. 
---
Thanks for this. Im abour 2/3s done and was contemplating if i should risk bringing in the lvl120.
---
There are people running around in the game obviously and intentionally being hostile, ganging up on solo players, griefing, trading dishonestly, and being rude on their microphones; there are no shortage of people trying to be offensive, and it doesn't sound like you are one of them.
---
Building your CAMP anywhere you want and minding your own business are things that everyone should be able to do in peace, so if someone attacked because they didn't like your choice of decorations, then they are the problem.
---
The only exception as I know of is that people don't like it when players build a CAMP close to the Whitesprings golf course so they can have their turrets shooting into the building to kill ghouls.
---
I'm sure all you did was being found by jerks. 😃 Hopefully that won't happen again.
---
I will stop buying atom once they reverse this decision. 
---
&gt;They take absolutely no risk when they force their will upon the face of FO76. It infuriates me.
---
Zenimax doesn't force their will on anyone. [Zenimax was formed by Bethesda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeniMax_Media) in 1999. They're one in the same. The entire path they've taken since has been hand in hand. In fact, BGS as you know it was founded in 2001, and created by Zenimax. So Bethesda formed Zenimax, then Zenimax rebranded Bethesda's core brand as Bethesda Game Studios...

I quit playing over this, this was the final straw, I'm tired of defending this boring, broken, mess of a game... Hand to God I won't put this game back in my console until they snuff this shit out.

I don't think people are agreeing with you, chap.

I prefer to put all of my crops close together. It really speeds up the harvest. You don't want to put them too close, however, because running through them and spamming the pick button may cause you to miss some, usually 1 crop distance away is enough.
---
If you're planning on farming a lot you should build walls around it and lock the door. This won't stop griefers, but most people won't destroy a base just to get crops. Also, if you spend less on decorations and just do bare minimum workstations you can put a lot more crops down in the long run.
---
You don't need a link to progression of farming, just check back every 20 minutes or so.
---
I said that hours ago. That it’s a ghostbuster quote 
---
My problem is as well that thirst and hunger, at least when I play, increase much faster after the Wild Appalachia release. So food is much more important now and I’m tearing through drinks. The gum helps and so do the perks, but I’d rather not waste slots on those. I have a bad feeling about all of this and the rationale is going to be “you don’t NEED this to win”, but we will move to two tiers of players: ones who buy the upgrades and spend more time completing missions and such and the other tier that spends most of their time foraging for food and supplies. I’m waiting for certain components to become extremely rare such as ballistic fiber which will further force your hand on repair kits. We need to keep an eye out for all of this shadiness...
---
&gt; I cared and 2 months ago I wrote how about how it was a slippery slope.  Guess I was right after all

Yep. At this point it's all one big irradiated centaur of a game studio.
---
I was finishing it with what the mayor said :D
---
Playing on PC. All I can do is wish you good luck on future attempts. 
---
Why I disagree...
---
First: Bethseda said many times atom shop is cosmetic only. If even still on the FAQ page right now.
---
Second: Fallout 76 is not Fallout 4 or any other games. It was meant for more. In the advertising, servers to last forever! In my mind, I imagined wow of the fallout world. Just growing and growing. Building friends, exploring and finally enjoying the fallout lore with others.
---
Third: Its not going to stop with repair kits. Once the money starts coming in....and the new prestige system coming...we will have xp boosts, ammo packs, guns, prestige tokens, legendary vendor tokens to reroll. The possibilities are endless.
---
Forth: Whether u play adventure or survival beta, we are suppose to be out there rebuilding america. Looking and exploring. Gathering junk etc. No where in the wasteland were we suppose to get shortcuts.
---
Fifth: As much as folks like to play solo, this is a team game. Folks seem to forget that while something doesn’t affect you directly doesn’t mean it doesn’t other players.
---
Sixth: Survival beta. Lack of fast traveling, spawn traps,        workbenches are harder to access. Having to travel home to repair then running all the way back vs spending money.
---
Seventh: Camps. One of the major things missing from fallout 4 was u could build amazing settlements but no one to share it with. Fallout 76 gives us the ability to have a place with friends chill. Head back for some food after a hard fight. Repair regroup then head on back!
---
Eighth: Player vendors - folks make the coolest trading posts. I have seen many with “Armor” shops. This eliminates the possibility of us having folks be an armorer.
---
That is all for now. Bethseda can still make money. There is tons of things we actually want to buy that wont have them breaking a promise to us.
---
That's actually something and 4 and 76 I realised after playing the first 2 metro games, is that Bethesda SUCKS at adding the homey element to their worlds. The stations in metro are full to the brim with little details that show how people live their life,and the people are all doing something. Even in fallouts best cities, it's usually just people walking around aimlessly, maybe a few unique animations or poses, but they never feel like homes. It's also so quiet. You'd expect a lot of chatter and background murmuring in diamond city, but it's always just the person closest to you talking or the vendors yelling the same few lines. No heart.
---
In fallout 3, the layout had maps. I wish bethesda put it back in.

It's the scoreboard

What are your views on non-feral ghouls?

No actually let’s talk about the melee nerf..... no more one hits and more than half melee attacks don not register. I’m lvl 140 with bloodied Deathclaw and hit a level 26, 24 times I struck him in the pvp lobby and registered NOTHING. I have the clip and MANY MANY more clips of melee being just dog shot now. The whole point in melee is to one hit people!!! Not sit there and hit them over and over and over and over and over and over and over, I would keep going but I hope you get the point. Also found out anything melee over 700 damage has a HUGE percentage nerf, which means any thing over 700 means you are doing WAY less damage the higher damage you have... I worked my ASS off making one of the best melee builds and now I have to use a stupid ass rifle because melee is done now.... I’ve spent SO MANY hours in this game perfecting my melee build and to get on one day and see I’m not hurting anyone... yeah that’s complete bullshit, please fix melee... it was fine before, people just cry about them because they don’t know how to run away instead of letting me get close. No need to penalize a player who grinds the shit out of this game..... just know I’m still playing and I had to make a new character, start from scratch, and use a rifle like EVERYONE. Else. I don’t want that l, I don’t want to use a gun and if I have to for much longer I will stop playing.

Please do it is a Timeless classic

Alright, here we go. Unlike someone else claimed, these can all be done without major reworks of character meshes, and one player character could reasonably showcase all of them simultaneously. Enjoy.
---
* Adrenal Reaction: Increasing amounts of steam coming off your character as the mutation's effect increases.  
---
* Bird Bones: Character body reshaped to the ultra skinny setting, your face looks like Dee.  
---
* Carnivore: Your character wears a blood-stained bib at all times.  
---
* Chameleon: You got Mystique skin now, so congrats: you just blued yourself.  
---
* Eagle Eyes: Eye size increased by 300%. You anime now.  
---
* Egg Head: Skull is now shaped like an egg.  
---
* Electrically Charged: Periodic small arcs of lightning coming off your character.  
---
* Empath: Your character has little cartoon hearts emanating off of them. Gross.  
---
* Grounded: Your character is trailing little skin-colored appendages that drag on the floor.  
---
* Healing Factor: You got Wolverine hair and cannot change your hair style. Snikt.  
---
* Herbivore: Your teeth are stained green.  
---
* Herd Mentality: Your character now has horns like a bovine. Hope you're happy.  
---
* Marsupial: Your has prominent buck teeth, whiskers, and an idiotic expression frozen on their face.  
---
* Plague Walker: There's a green miasma spreading outward from your character.  
---
* Scaly Skin: Your skin is scaly. Shocking, I know.  
---
* Speed Demon: Your character moves faster, which is kind of the point of the mutation.  
---
* Talons: Your character has freakishly long fingers. Unarmed attack animation changed to clawing.  
---
* Twisted muscles: Add animation jitter and noise to character animation.  
---
* Unstoppable Isotope: Your character gives off a blueish glow, like Cherenkov radiation.

The best example of this kind of setup would be World of Warcraft after Patch 7.3. Activision/"Blizzard" released new races with this patch, but also made it so that leveling up to max level took 3 times longer. in the same patch they nerfed the stats on something called Heirlooms/BoAs (pieces of gear purchased at max level that can be transferred to low level characters and scales with their level). That coupled with the $60 Character boost makes leveling a new character feel like a waste of time because I could go work for 5 hours and get simply purchase what it would take me 100+ hours to grind out with objectively the same level of "Fun"
---
TL;DR the option to pay money to speed up or skip gameplay mechanics is not quality of life. It is a band-aid for bad game design. The need for these kind of transactions only highlight the shortcomings of the gameplay mechanics they're built around.
---
the game isnt free, sorry, i paid 60$ dollar for a half finish game

No, as i could see a lot of people quitting if it gets bad. If they straight up said that, me along with plenty others would have never bought it. I was interested by the fact it wouldn't be p2w
---
We it was nowhere near Whitesprings but you're right in saying they were jerks...it's happened e times but I may play again after the patch. I don't care for the way it's been very anti solo play as that is the core foundation of fallout games.
---
Zenimax and Bethesda are not one in the same anymore ZMC was created and became a parent company to softworks and game studios. The ZMX we know today is not the one that oversaw oblivion and FO3. They're the engine behind ES MMO and now FO MMO. You can't call them the same harmless entity they were 20 years ago. The power structure is not even remotely similar.

Merc armors from previous games - Charmer, Adventurer, Troublemaker, Grunt, etc, etc

Raider armors from previous games - Blastmaster, Sadist, Iconoclast, etc, etc

I just recently came back after a long break, was so broken last time I played, no decent stash or carry weights. Been playing daily for a few weeks, and have been enjoying it. Lots of improvements, still some glitches, but minimal. Looking forward to player vending and the roadmap, but disappointed in the microtransactions they're trying to add that feel like a slippery slope towards P2W. Especially given that they adamantly said cosmetic only.
---
it's spelled "whining"

you are clearly too young to understand what you're trying to defend, or you're trolling

" I'm done. I'll still play your games, but I'm done" lol

The 1st game (at least) was already a simulation, so it wouldn't be that far fetched

Right but you don't need to buy the repair kits or any atoms for that matter. You aren't being charged or forced to pay. You still have full access to the game and all of the actual content. You've already paid. It's free to keep playing it forever.

It's a lot better. I hardly ever find the "disconnected from server" message, and the glitches and bugs (like enemies not animated when loaded on your screen) are completely gone.  I rarely ever discover bugs myself anymore, and when I do, it's on this subreddit.  The weapon balancing is better too, most TSE wielders can't one tap you anymore.

The various Jetpack-plans for the different PAs are clocking in at a whooping 5880 caps for me. Thats with the hard-bargain-perk maxed and no other buffs in that regard.

It was in Munich (Germany) and was actually “Käsespätzle Eis” which is more or less the German version of Mac &amp; Cheese (Käse = Cheese and Spätzle = certain kind of noodle). It tasted really like the original dish but of course with a sweet note due to the vanilla ice cream. It really was a perfect fit! It even had some fried onions on top (we put that on our Käsespätzle here) It was in a small ice cream shop which is called „Der verrückte Eismacher“ or „Whicked Ice Cream Maker“ in english.

TAKE ALL MY ATOMS. 😆
---
It's annoying, but they deserve it. They deserve all the posts and many more. That's how you draw attention, and I'm sure it's not good for them to have a flooded reddit, so it's more probable they'd want to do something about it.
---
Don't take it our on the people who want a better fallout76. 
---
If you think they don't care about player numbers, you have no idea what you're talking about.

You might be able to pull off something similar with pieces from different sets along with existing paint jobs.

technically not, that why a item like the Repair kit is call P2W. 
---
You can grind forever to repair your stuff (that bethesda nerf not long ago) or buy the item and make your life easy more if you are part of a group doing stuff on timers. 
---
But i mean you guys keep preaching that the game is great and bethesda isnt doing anything bad. 
---
And you will see. Isnt the first time this happen on a game. 
---
Guess you missed the part where I'm getting them used. They (sometimes) make good games, but I'm not supporting them anymore.

Do you know what is Ritalin is for? How would my responses have changed if I had taken some?

Or you're just an idiot. 
---
It isn't my job to teach them how to make games in a non-scummy way.
---
I'm pretty sure this game ONLY appeals to Fallout fans. I highly doubt there's a ton of people out there that were like, huh, this online world-search game looks cool! It's intended pretty much solely for fallout fans, as that's its purpose. Your weird ass elitism is not needed  here. 
---
Awaits the ONE mother fucker telling it's their first Fallout game thinking it proves something...
---
BTW, in the wiki you linked, it says in the first paragraph  "Zenimax owns BGS"
---
You're confusing Softworks with BGS, which is an understandable error.
---
You seem like pretty cool dude. So I’m sure it’ll all pan out. 
---
Unlocking Darth Vader in BFII before they removed MTX wasn't pay to win, you got crates just by playing the game!
---
I'm all for keeping control of hyperbole here, but being able to pay for an in-game advantage of any kind *is* pay to win, even if just a little bit. "Pay to win" doesn't mean you *have* to pay in order to win, it means you can pay money in order to have an advantage over others.

This just in... For 10000atoms fallout can be enjoyable for 3 days

You should google the soda. I bet you’ll see some interesting reviews. There’s even a moxie festival nearby.

Not sure but I think so. At some point PA life was good, and the fusion rate consumption was acceptable. But obviously, that were the beginnings, people knew shit and complained that PA is a must. So, trying to limit the PA must-have'ism, they incoroporated some fusion core drain to AP. I shredded through 25 fusion cores in 5 minutes before I ralised I can't use the jetpack freerly anymore. I stopped using PA for purposes other than fast traveling when overencumbered that day.
---
I do believe the fusion core consumption for power armor, considering the ridiculous inferiority of PAs, is a nail to their coffin. A good way to fix that is to completely get rid of fusion core usage for AP drain, as well as related perks, because this is a shitty design decision, period. Then, implement 90% flat explosive damage reduction on power armors. Then buff their stat boosts triple. And then allow another craftable mod slots, like the guy who glitch-crafted them did. The guy was a genius, and his 'glitch' would gave PAs what they always needed. Years ahead of his times. Until the PAs are ridiculously buffed, they will remain noob gear.
---
I don’t think so, that’s like vats draining your fusion core, it only really drains from general movement, bashing, sprinting and I think jumping 
---
I am well known for being a dick. But I give props where it’s due. Real recognizes real 
---
Bye Felicity

Ok good. Just wanted to make sure I wasn’t gonna insane because I (up until now) thought I was the only person to do that because I always saw everyone moving all over the place while I was just playing Nuka Trapper.
---
Wow, that's a heavy hitter right there. I'm going to have to hit the CVS on my way home for some ointment to put on these intense burns you've given me. 
---
Is BOS adding DR to my armor?
---
That’s ridiculous! This is a RPG-PvP game, with different ways to play that should all have forms of viability. 
---
The fact that you’re saying this speaks to the issue of balance in survival. Melee is absolutely broken right now, nerfed (or glitched) into uselessness. 
---
Just reverse the last patch(this “one-shot” nerf destroyed melee, and many other previously viable ways to play) , and make rifles refill up vat-crits a little slower. Make it so it takes more than 1-2 shots to crit in vats. 
---
And make stealthboys reveal you if you attack or take damage. 
---
These changes wouldn’t fix everything, but it would help a lot with in-game balance.
---
You said you on Xbox, are you online right now?
---
I actually did a reasonable job copying my face into the game.  Then I gender swapped because the sniper outfit is female only. But spent a good hour or two initially sculpting the face to match. Fun toolset! Doubt they'd have an easy automated way to do so, but would be nice! 
---
Omg thank you for acknowledging this problem. I thought I was the only one because whenever I find a nearby building or cave, the acid just falls right through then I have no escape. 
---
Are you on PC?
---
I played the original Fallout back around 2000-ish, but never finished it. I've played Fallout 3, NV and 4 all the way through.
---
I just started trying to get mods for my T-51 on my second character. Everyone says Watoga/Phoenix/Harpers but I saw someone mention Welch and Lewisburg. I haven't had a chance to try server hopping yet but since Camden has a chance for the mods, I believe vendors in the Ash Heap might be the go to for T-51 mods. Might be worth a try. 
---
These items are intended to be more rare to facilitate an in game economy. If you could make everything, there’s no reason to do anything except farm for steel
---
I agree to this. I really want maps of the insides of building like in F3. 
---
you can find in the market reddit for 250 caps 
---
Can you earn a trophy by not playing the game? You can also not earn a trophy while playing the game, sure. I never said it was 100 percent accurate. It's an estimation. But when the estimation is that far off, there's something amiss. BTW, thanks for taking the time to research how the site calculates. Not many would do that.
---
Plans can be found at Watoga, mods for them are rng on vendors
---
Damn, I’ve also maxed out Hard Bargain and it’s still that high? I mean it would be a worthwhile investment seeing as it’s advantageous in and out of combat, but that’s still pretty steep.
---
Nah, there is definitely a issue with melee since the last patch. Half my hits do no damage. This “one-shot” nerf really screwed melee as a class
---
Banana hold the nut

i am not realyy a long time (only about 3 years and played fo3 NV 4 and soon the og) but i still play .. but mainly cus i wanna finish all(if not most) questline and quests... cus im a kind of achievement hunter guy...

If they're rolling around in piles of cash, then I'd have to be pretty stoked for them wouldn't I. Why would I be crying myself to sleep from that? Did you think about what you were gonna write, or you just so mad about repair kits that you can't think straight. I'll take my response off the air, thanks.

Yeah, it's clear that you're just here to piss people off...

As far as I know you cannot sell serums to vendors. I can craft marsupial and it sell for 414 caps in game. Vendors only have 200 max....... maybe next update when the vendors pool their caps to 1400???
---
There is clearly pvp in fallout 76.
---
Yes let me get back in game. Just died.
---
Dodgy user here, can confirm I do not get fusion core drain from it.
---
Seems like every day when im in a team, we get disconnected and kicked out of team and then we cant see each other on map or something.  Its tiring.   Also whenever someone launches a nuke, it seems something goes wrong with the server
---
No this is just wrong. Melee is broken and buggy, or it’s just been nerfed really hard. 
---
Half your hits do no damage. There was a “one-shot” nerf that ruined its competitive ability in PvP. 
---
If you give me 10 minutes, I'll join you and we can run it together 👍
---
I'd be a _giant_ hypocrite if I couldn't talk to someone who got emotionally invested in this shit and used some less than professional language. I got a week long ban for the language I used calling out some griefers a while back. Shit happens. We're all passionate about this game, that's why we're still _here_. 
---
1) The RDR2 beta, at least, was a _lot_ more time, though. The roll out schedule was...problematic... but once you were in, you were in. There was significant time for actual play testing. (though yeah, from everything I'm seeing, they didn't bother to _fix_ anything, gotta give you that). EA is...garbage in general. Personally, I don't care how they're used at present as a marketing gimmic...it's like "early access". I get that people _abuse_ the term, I still don't take their shit when they use it inappropriately. Don't let the assholes shift the definitions of the word. 
---
2) I'm 100% with you on this. Bethesda's lost a _lot_ of traction with me, and they've never been the shining angel on the hill they get painted as, but they still aren't half the evil company EA and others are.  
---
3) ...yeah, ok, I had heard he "apologized" but I'll admit I can't really make myself watch his shit so, I'm assuming you're right here. Again, one bad apple, for sure. 
---
4) My big issue with bethesda at this point is, quite likely, upper management and the marketing department. I've got some issues with the coders, and the help support team flat out not being up to the task they got handed, but again, that's more an upper management issue. 
---
I _love_ the art department. I _love_ the guys who ran around setting up blocks spelling out shit, and creating nifty monsters, and what little scripted quest content we got. There's a lot going for this game, and that's why I'm still here. 
---
And I HAVE seen those videos. Juicehead gets panned around here a lot, and every single update bethesda pushes out, he covers, and he's generally enthusiastic about. He does a fair bit of positive coverage, along side pointing out bugs that come out with the new releases, which is something I personally find to be quite useful. 
---
I think a lot of the issues I have with your stance on this is, legitimately, I see more positive videos by youtubers, or at the least _informative_ videos by youtubers, than flat out hate.  Videos that say "hey, a ban wave happened, here's what I know, here's what I think is happening" is legitimately useful for people, even though a lot of people get angry as fuck that people are "monetizing" this bad news. It's news, it's valuable.  Maybe the fact that I'm a self-employed individual who understands the hustle affects how angry it gets me when people self promote in that way. 
---
And I see a lot of videos by people playing the new content, going over events, going over drops for events, making walkthroughs on finding gear, rare items, awesome farming spots they've found, resource locations, camp building tips...
---
Are there gaming youtubers like Jim Sterling who only mention this game in passing as a negative? Yes, but that's what he _does_. Jim doesn't do positive news, he covers the shady shit. I still watch his content, and give him a downvote every time his wrestling schtic comes up. 
---
Are there people like Yong who cover only negative shit, and are _super_ fucking salty about this shit? Of course! I haven't been able to watch anything he's made in months because it's repetitive and (frankly, the worst part) usually out of date/late. 
---
But over-all, youtube is a _fantastic_ resource, and it's just so frustrating to see everyone who makes content for it get hit by the same broad brush. 
---
Bethesda is a singular company, and it has to be held accountable for it's actions, and that includes distancing itself form bad mistakes of individuals in it's employ. Youtubers, generally speaking, are _individuals_. You can't, (justly) paint them with the same brush, because they're not all doing the same shit. 
---
Are people actually paying a lot of money for atoms? I feel like I have plenty just from playing the game. The atomic shop doesn’t even have that much stuff that catches my eye so badly that I just have to have it, and I’ve got enough atoms from playing that I’ve been able to unlock the couple things I like. 
---
Yes which is why any p2w is not good for the player 
---
Send GT
---
This.
---
The game is so oddly unbalanced as it is. After the TSE nerf, there are a ton of melee weapons that do more damage than a legendary rifle that shoots explosive ammo.  That's insane. I have both a AAE handmade and a TSE handmade, and my friend with a melee build does a *ton* more damage than I do with power attacks.
---
Nerfing it further would be crazy.
---
I shouldn't have to buy atoms to get access to the full, playable content I paid for. I stopped playing because it was literally unplayable at times. Far more frequently than was even close to acceptable for a AAA title.
---
Things like that happened to lots of people who really wanted to love this game, just like I did. And if my experience with the game hadn't been so off-putting there's a very good chance I would have bought atoms at some point in the last 3 months. 
---
But if you make the game needlessly grindy and obnoxious on top of unstable and buggy af, and then you start selling items to overcome that when you stated in game purchases would only be cosmetic you're destroying any amount of consumer trust that's left. And chasing away customers who might have come back and spent money on cosmetic items in the process.
---
You can't sell things to people who don't turn on the game. They need to start doing things that will get people to turn on the game, but they aren't willing to invest in the game to make that happen. It's why we got an unfinished buggy game to begin with. 
---
And thank you for not being rude despite the fact that we see this differently. We both just wanted to play an awesome Fallout game. Don't let my grumpiness or anyone else's about all this sour you on the community or the game.

Have a great weekend

I’m having better luck at harpers ferry. At Camden I was getting them but they were all the common ones. I had no luck at all in Watoga. It was all t60.

---
Damn, I guess I did misread then. 
---
Not true. I did not purchase this game because of the unethical things Bethesda has done and I will not purchase their future games either. That's at least 1 customer they lost. 
---
As long as the atom prices aren’t insane (meaning it’s easy to get the atom for free) and they’re also obtainable in game I don’t mind if people can also buy them
---
Perverts.
---
I’ve played them all and have been a long time fan of the series, so I suppose I would qualify!
---
I feel that in the time that Fallout 1 (and later 2) came out, that games were a lot more creative when it came to taking risks than what we see today (you kind of had to be, technology was a real limiting factor!).  I’ve worked in the video game industry for a long time and understand why that has to be the case.  Between creative limitations and over saturation of the indie market, games just are made different nowadays.
---
That being said (and getting back on track), the lore of the series is quite divergent between the old series (post post-apocalyptic) and the Bethesda entries (post apocalyptic).  They each have their strengths, while I feel that the older entries have stronger “bite and despair”, Bethesda really does an excellent job with the environment and setting.
---
It’s hard to rank the major canon entries, as I feel that they go out of their way to remake the wheel, so to speak.  If you’re older, you’ll remember the schism between 1 and 2 (which still exists somewhat).
---
I feel that Fallout 4 was the weakest of the newest entries (I’d rank them 3 - NV - 76 - 4) personally, mainly because the factions in the world are fairly basic and the world feels less immersive as a result.    The DLC however, is excellent.
---
3 really opened the doors wide open for this franchise, taking some of the concepts and establishing a powerful brand identity.  It also got away from the California centrism that the previous entries had.  The US is a big place, let’s see some more of it.
---
I wish 76 had more dread (even though everyone is dead) and larger faction presence.  The brotherhood and responders are alright, but I would’ve like to seen more about the raiders and free states.  In fact, I feel that a ton could’ve been done with the free states and it’s quite bare (atleast so far).
---
My problem with NV is that it wasn’t completed.  I don’t see why the online community rallies around Caesers legion for example, that content was bare bones compared to the rest of the game!
---
2 was a bit silly in compared to 1, but is looked back upon as integral to the expanding lore of the series.  3 is safe (perhaps too safe), but the capital wasteland was cool to see.  
---
And 1...?  I suppose you gotta start somewhere.  :) 
---
This has been happening to me since the game went live,it's just way more frequent now.On PC.
---
Thanks bud. Do you use core assembly? Just wondering how bad the ap drain would be with it. 
---
No they won't. That's not how the fucking world works, you're all just autistic and entitled.
---
Cool. So you're going back to FONV, and we don't have to endure more whining? Right?
---
this sounds scary and strange at the same time..i lost a black diamond..but i think i might have dropped it without paying attention
---
They announced it to us and asked for feedback. How is this under the radar? 
---
What kind is it? I might buy it 
---
I love the game. Im on a crusade to bring my friends in. When I meet them and admit I play this game, I'm often hearing tons of jokes about it. I ask why they laugh, they explain. It usually takes me like fifteen minutes to debunk the bullshit that they digested as part of the shitstorm the game had. Its mostly fake news they share (like a friend who said he watched a movie where they said nuke codes are hardcoded, so if somebody shares it, anybody irrespective of level can launch a nuke in two minutes, srsly I've been told such shit).
---
The moment first non-cosmetic item enters the store? Crusade's lost, fake news won and became the reality, no way I'll ever manage to bring anybody in. Thats why I'm ultra fucking sore on this spot. Repair kits might kick me out of the game, week after they released a gamemode I loved so much I bought atoms as sign of gratitude. 
---
LOL ok, idk how you went through a bunch of fusion cores, I run double fusion core power, and have no issues burning through cores... so saying they are noob tier is an opinion not fact...
---
But, as in my case, it's possible to buy the game second hand, meaning 1 copy produces 2 results. So it's very inaccurate. I wanted to be sure, most people would indeed just look and comment. It's no secret 76 is under performing. That's just the sad reality. 
---
Ya I thought the second thing and made a post here about it and got mobbed,lol.I hear alot more other issues or features requested.
---
They openly announced it directly to us and asked for feedback. How is this under the radar? 
---
One of the mods already made a post about it, I think.
---
We'll see....
---
I think at best they might be able to give us insight in very, very general terms.  They can't tell us about upcoming discounted or free items that currently have normal prices because the whole point of selling atoms is to make money.  Showing their hand will encourage you to sit on your earned atoms (or buy less) to wait for the better deal.
---
Bivs a bastard and gives me old possum 9/10 times
---
I'd love to be able to modernize our homes
---
Easiest way to find Responder Vendor bot is the lady janet's soft serve location. Fast travel there and run down the road to the flipped over bus. You will have a random encounter spawn point that has greater chance to spawn this Vendor. Took me 5 minutes of server hopping opposed to over 2 hours of trying at Charleston and never saw him.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Am I the only one who read the Inside the Vault about repair kits and see the wording as Basic repair kits are "unlockable" via the atomic shop. As in the recipe is buyable not the actual kit? 
---
I was downvoted when I commented during the PAX conference that no one should believe a word out of Todd Howard’s mouth ever again considering he’s been lying through his teeth since fallout 76 was launched. This company and Todd Howard have absolutely no good will or benefit of the doubt left. They’re lucky fallout 76 is playable and decently fun now at the very least. 
---
I played fallout 4 maybe a month before the first 76 trailer/talk
---
I'm about to join you 
---
A repair kit won't.
---
A fridge might.
---
An increase to camp build limit probably will.
---
A subscription fee to infinite crafting material storage will.
---
Well, PAX East just ended and if they'd been working the whole time in addition to having to stand the whole time, then they're probably taking some time off.
---
That said, I noticed that they haven't been as active the past month as before that time.  I remember a time when we were seeing updates from all 5 of the CMs on an hourly basis.
---
Now it's once every couple days.
---
I don't use that mod, so I'm not sure.
---

I find it hard to believe that one player would shoot at, and kill another player. And in survival mode as well, unbelievable.......
---
yeah, it's totally not that I'm still kinda hoping Bethesda will get their shit together and salvage what could have been an absolutely amazing game.
---
I wrote all that out just so fan boys would make my almost nonexistent karma on Reddit even lower. It's all about you
---
[I would give my right boob for a sarcasm font right now]
---
Man idk if fridges are going to be in the atom store.
---
You sir just owe me a new bullshit metter because mine exploded after being exposed to a sentence where people complaining about unfairness put to game via item shop are called cheaters.
---
You are a shitty person.
---
BGS should hire you.
---
You think I'm whining? No wonder why this game keeps shitting on it's consumers. Nobody has the balls to call it out. And no, for person that leaves this sub, there will be three more to pop up. Deal with it.
---
I would buy that too
---
Lol. The issue isn't at all how you are communicating. Couldn't be that at all. . .
---
Limited time only products are a "cheesy" way to force a buy now or lose forever mentality, they aren't removing them so people can accumulate atoms from in game activities and get what they want for free.  They exist to force your hand at buying atoms for cash fomo.  P2win, p4convenience, p4utility are just labels which don't matter, the end result is the same.  All these labels result in a degraded game experience because new systems/expansions/dlc are added with monetization in mind, low quality unfun garbage which can be bypassed or made easier with the cash shop.    People will buy the utility items, not everyone has time to optimize their junk collecting routes, not everyone wants to bother with hunting junk for repairs and guess what?  Those limited time players are also the ones likely to spend money on things just like this.  Its pretty well documented that cash shops work because of the few big spenders, not the trickle amount from masses so we may see some more price adjustments while they find their sweet spot but its highly unlikely most people will be content with the final amount they set.  The truth is none of us know whether they are currently making money on the cash shop and what sells or doesn't or so speculating on adding this or that is pretty pointless.  There are no differences in cash shops based on f2p or p2p, only differences in how greedy the publishers are and how willing the players are to accept what is offered.
---
Your mother is a shitty person. Get fucked You sweaty nerd. /rant
---
Unfortunately the only way to make a difference is to Stop Buying the Games.  
---
And the morons in management and marketing won't suffer from it, either, it'll be the wonderful creatives––the artists and programmers and designers who gave us the parts of the game we \*do\* like––who will get laid off.
---
You’re still playing their games 
---
Thanks for that. It's good knowing they're still kicking around. 
---
I'm at work so I may have not read in enough detail but this seems to be talking about discussion about repair kits, not the implementation of them in the game. That's more what I'm talking about. Thanks again!
---
This is the doorway to the possibility of cobsumables that provide a team-wide or team-based item. Consumables, auras, skills that consume ap, rockets that shoot out of your pip boy and blow up as freaking pink and blue confetti. These are all avenues that can be closed by one single roadblock. I would just ask that people be more open-minded about in-game currency items. We already can't legitimately trade atom shop items, so they clearly recognize a certain level of shameful necessity. 
---
Good point, and sadly you can't account for those cases. It's not an exact science, not in the least. But it's a sad state and the only way it'll get better is if this sub took the reins and started taking action instead of being so damn polite all the time (not talking about you specifically)
---
If you are out there, killing ghouls, murdering mole miners, slaying scorchbeasts. And generally wandering the wasteland. You have already won.....
---
Or at least read thier subreddit
---
Nothing's gonna get rid of that gangrenous ghoul smell off but, wait for a new line of After Shave/Colognes /body sprays to arrive
---
Sorry that was toxic. Your entitled to your opinion.
---
I want some zany shit like the whiffle bat and candy cane type stuff.
---
Enclave science vendor for ~20k or rare queen drop. I would put it around .5-2% based on my small 400 sample size.
---
Cherry Garcia is pretty amazing
---
There’s a wall you can walk through in the mine thats in the secret hallway, did you find that? 
---
Drinking, cheers, drink held high, pouring one out for the homies...
---
exactly. exactly right which makes me sad.
---
They were requested quite frequently for a few weeks or so after launch, but the requests subsided after the bulk of the more hardcore players started hitting the point where they always had enough mats to repair they're gear, and got a better handle on the game mechanics. 
---
I find it hilariously ironic that it nerfed "white knight" considering how many exist in this sub.
---
The Nuka cola machine/secret door would be a great addition to the store.
---
Nice ideas only thing I would change is that I would say have sharp shark teeth for carnivore instead 
---
Pip-Pong Advanced would be a fun concept. Basically Pip-Pong, but much more polished.
---
And they get no money.
---
Not everyone.  I've seen posts about some people being a sucker for the camp cosmetics and others for skins, but they are far and few between.  But those are the people that Bethesda wants to keep coming back.  They don't mind the people grinding away for that "free" stuff, cause they help fascilitate a player base for whales to feel "accomplished" over.  But they aren't putting repair kits in AS for the non purchasers.  They are doing it for people that already spend money.
---
How much ya wanna bet that some griefer in Survival spawn camps with a shit ton of repairkits.  I guarantee it.  There is someone, somewhere, that has an expendable income that is frothing at the chance to spend some real life dollary-doos to just grief people with his/her wealth.
---
I guarantee it.  Every P2W game has this and some even stretch their model around the whales, forgoing the regular players.  Check out Archeage.  It was a great little MMO and boy did MTX kill it.  The entire game is equipment based, and you have to "gamble" to the top tiers.
---
Literally, you have to pay for a chance to transmute your gear into better gear.  Mostly just fails, occasionally transmutes and... sometimes it just breaks the equip.  Yeah.  For real.  Whales love it though.  And the game is a shit show 5-6 years later.
---
You should try yoga. Might help you unwind your panties. 
---
Zenimax hears you. Zenimax don't care.
---
That's great I don't mind starting off getting some nice one or two star legendaries for the time being but it's good to know when I'm geared up a bit I can go three star farming!
---
Thanks :) 
---
Bloody mess
---
Max it out and the bodies discombobulate pretty frequently
---
But then the rest of the world would know I play this game!  I'm a grown up and that time my friends saw a comment I made on a world of tanks Facebook post was awful.
---
I’m happy they’re introducing fridges now so I don’t have to use the ice cooler. Now if we could only get sinks to wash our grimy radioactive hands in. Come on, we have a toilet and a bathtub. Why no sink?
---
I've never actually seen the Nuke yet, I've got the quest but I'm waiting until my buddies get the story done to try and attempt to fire one
---
Your entire elaboration is encased in expectations. You're angry that the game isn't exactly what you, specifically, expected. That is precisely the problem here. 
---
I played 4 first and I liked it so much that I played 3 after that. It wasn't to long after getting about 20-30 hours into 3 that 76 came out so I never finished 3 but I will definitely finish it after I get bored with 76 lol 
---
Yeah. I server hopped Watoga and Harpers for a few hours last night and had no luck either. I'm gonna try the Ash Heap vendors tonight and see what comes up. 
---
Judging by the hours I spent researching the game, amount of builds I tested, I favor the opinion that my own opinions regarding balance in this game are more factual than most peoples facts are. The number of people agreeing with me on the quality of those opinions is steadily increasing. The more I discuss meta the more I favor this approach.
---
The rate was changed by then and is not as ridiculous as it was back then. Full charge fusion core allowed less than 20 seconds of flight total.
---
The Power Armor is infinitely noob tier by now. You might not be aware of this fact but there is no denying it. Replacing 15 legendary mods and 5 craftable mods that normal armor provides, for a 6 craftable mods that PA provide, from mathematical point of view is the worst possible deal. Infinitely bad.
---
I'm able to prove my words worth. If ya on PC gather four PA people team and fight me. I'll take you all out alone.
---
I'm actually really wanting to build a PA character that could be anyhow considered meta and so far I still failed.
---
I’m mixed on it.
---
On one end, it would be great perhaps of finding some sort of information about one of the subjects being different than the others, and we’re left to connect the dots between that and Grahm.
---
The other side tells me that while our characters find out much about the past of West Virginia, there’s no one around to record the present.  When you step out of the vaults for the first time, the world is at contrast to what came before it.  Grahm has been trading with robots and mutants presumably before we show up.  For how long and why?  That’s the mystery :)
---
Which thread do they reply to tho? The problem is everyone decided to post the same thing non stop so there’s not one post that seems worthy of a legitimate response. Maybe if the people that were outraged got together and upvoted a singular well thought out post then the visibility would be greater, just my 2 caps.
---
I suppose so
---
My guess is the game is costing them more than it's making them so they're going so low because if nobody's playing they can easily shut down the whole thing and if people keep playing and buy the sh\*t then they're golden.
---
It's a win win scenario for them
---
Ill stop playing I swear
---
Trade for it I have 2000+ for tse mg42 because everyone in the end game who doesn't use hunting rifles has loads of it 
---
Ik tg for that I just thought it was still excessive is all
---
After reading the OP in the megathread and the OP's replies, the megathread makes total sense. 
---
That's an addiction I'd leave in place. ;)
---
And you are entitled to be called a shitty person when you are throwing insults at thousands of people basing those insults from things you mined from your own ass.

I just wanted to make sure you read what kind of person you are before I blocked you.

---
Nah,maybe a couple of posts at the most but nothing like issues or features people really want like ,Respecs for example.
---
C'mon choads,this isn't a highly requested feature and you all know it.
---
Cross platform is actually a complicated challenge. On the other side, character transfer between the ecosystems would not be as complicated at all.
---
Also to quote you from another one of your posts
---
“Example of my playstyle is that when I learned about time-spent-alive leaderboards, I immidately built a glitched camp that cannot be penetrated by regular weapons. I haven't used it for anything besides learning how to penetrate impenetrable camps, then deconstructed it as soon as the lesson was learned.”
---
Your literally the type of person to exploit in game mechanics, for example XP, then turn around and cry foul if Bethesda was to sell something like a temporary XP bonus consumable.
---
You are a hippocrate sir.
---
They do have lighters as well
---
 A syringer, nice. And a support build for the melee and heavy gun users, awesome. Someone clearing mobs can make all the difference. Not enough people do that.
---
It really does take a combination of builds and tactics to make the fight a good one. 
---
Block me ...do me the favor 
---
I have played for 112 lvls. And I may be responsible for a few lost items. But way too many just go poof. Sunday I picked up both a Cultist Blade and Dagger. Examined both then fast traveled to camp. Went into weapons to repair the dagger so I could gift it to my brother and both were gone from inventory. I didn't sell anything. They just disappeared for no reason. What's sad is Bethesda's failure to address this issue. It's not a new problem. It's existed for months.
---
I played fo1 on release and later played wasteland when I got bored of fo3. It's such a great world and has so much potential for deeply intricate storytelling worldwide - I'd love a game or even just a dlc based in China to see the other side of the story. Fo76 was a bit of a disappointment on the lore/story side of things, but I'm really happy with how Beth has recovered from a bad launch. 
---
Wow, dude. Somebody needs a Snickers bar. 
---
I have sessions 3x a week. You should try a social life, might help with personal interactions.
---
As far as I can tell the A.I. prioritizes certain camp items to get all the aggro. Source, the A.I. always went after my crops and generators... Until I rug glitched my crops in doors on the second story of my camp. Now I occasionally get a super mutant that spawns inside the first story of my camp that just stands there staring at the ceiling that the crops are just above. I think it just totally screws with it's pathing and it doesn't even aggro me, just stares at the roof. Try putting your decon arc on the second floor.
---
I bought a car and now the glovebox light doesn't work,I WANT A REFUND!
---
Deal with it.
---
Whatever you want to say about my expectations. It was Bethseda who told us cosmetic only.
---
And you assume wrong. I am not angry. I am very sad actually because Fallout 76 is turning out like all the others. A game that folks will play for little while get bored by the lack of things to do and quit.
---
Friends made, friends that just go poof over night. Move on to the next game.
---
Logging off and back on seems to be the only fix for turning them in. 
---
Are the weapon skins the same forest camo that was in the store earlier? I got the bundle, and my t51b wasteland walker paint is a brown desert camo instead of the green one that was in the store
---
Ashers power Armour plz, I’ll deal with it only being t5-1 
---
I want those cat head wall trophies like in the crazy cat lady’s house to put in my camp.
---
Mint chocolate chip
---
Rant posts to strangers is a healthy social interaction?
---
Nah, people need to be called out for being bastards. Suggesting that being against the RL shop influencing game maths is a sign of being a cheater is a bitchy thing to do. The guy is piece of shit who proven that further in his response aimed at my mother. The world that accepts such behavior is world worth fighting against.
---
I want to piggyback on this comment because I respectfully disagree with you here. GTA Online is designed from the ground up to be as frustrating as possible in order to force you to buy shark cards. The fact that you cannot open a private lobby for you and your friends to do CEO missions really cements that design philosophy.
---
The reason they force you to grind money on public servers is so other players with the cool expensive toys destroy your stuff. That action causes you to earn less money in game, and it also acts as a "maybe not so subtle" advertisement of what you could use that money you're no longer earning on due to "griefers".
---
If your on ps4 can i have all your stuff?
---
I've been playing Fallout since FO1 on the PC and I've played everything except that weird non-canonical X-Box Brotherhood of Steel garbage game. 
---
Brought to you by Vault-Tec. Welcome to the Vault.
---
Why use a jetpack, it's not even useful, use reactive plates....
---
I’m likely one heck of an oddball here.  Played 1 and 2, 4, and obviously 76.  Never touched tactics, brotherhood, 3 or NV.  1 and 2 were so long ago I need a replay to refresh my memory on the games.
---
I enjoy the world, and really wish the game was more conducive to communicating with others since I don’t have a mic.  Just broke 600 hours, and I’m sure I put that much into FO4.  Am hoping this game stays alive for a few years.
---
Hahahaha that’s one of the worst analogies I’ve ever heard. 
---
My glovebox breaks I take it into the shop and get it repaired. 
---
I could shit out a million dollars and take FO76 to Bethesda and they’d just giggle in my face. Grow up. 
---
Long time fan... since Wasteland in 1989.
---
Hahahaha! Clearly you are living the dream...or the nightmare depending on your pov
---
Imagine you get one or two from a queen drop. Craft and sell the serum for a few hundred caps until you have enough caps to buy another recipe. 
---
Repeat. 
---
The desert Rangers existed outside of the ncr before the Great War until they merged into the ranks of the ncr so the desert ranger version of the armor we see in honest hearts could still exist in 76 but they hailed out in Texas so yeah I get not having the ncr version which isn't as cool looking as the desert ranger version.
---
           I would like to see a hazmat suit from dead money that the ghost people were wearing in the atomic shop, they gave me the creeps
---
Personally I would love this feature between Xbox and PC. Bethesda ?
---
I have many different people I play with on both systems and can be less fun having different stuff and adjusting play styles all the time. Not having marsupial on one character or jet pack or shock or a particular bread and butter weapon
---
That was good fun. Id do that too. I remember taking the heads of the damn regulators and putting them on a table at that train station by rivet city hoping theyd get scared but they just kept showing up and suffered the same fate.
---
So you utilize a cowardly exploit and then boast here about having the moral high ground? 
---
It's just that the same problems that plagued ESO are now affecting FO76. The one common thread is Zeni. The games themselves are fantastic, but once real world money (after the purchase price) are introduced, that's when consumers get rightfully angry. If the Atomic Shop didn't exist, after 5 months, 76 might be an above average - 6/10 - game. But the AS is dragging the product down and Zeni is the sole reason for that. 
---
I'm sure there was a time when Zeni never mentioned a thing about MTX, and Pete Hines operated on that premise when he stated those now infamous words. But then Zeni decided the game needed MTX for sustainability and it put Hines in an impossible situation. I can't imagine a scenario where Uncle Pete would flat out lie - he's a fan favorite and has clout for days. He wouldn't ruin that willingly.
---
Tbh, they kind of are. They went from 1800 atoms for a single power armor skin to 1500 atoms for a bundle of armor skins, weapon skins, power armor skin, and some outfits
---
I'm not entirely sure, I don't have it unlocked to try it. I've been searching for said plans though.
---
The games not free to play. Just because it was discounted multiple doesn't make it free to play.
---
Lmao. 
---
This guy called it. 
---
I find it difficult to blame the poster. Bethesda has worn my faith in Fallout about as thin as it can get. Mostly their failure to address serious issues. Disappearing inventory items, invisible players. Just to name a few. I wonder if they can be trusted to write a game anymore. Who wants to spend their hard earned cash on a bug infested game that won't be fixed?
---
What does rule 6 mean? I did not swear and did not say anything bad about the game just shared an experience that I found to be hilarious sequence of unfortunate events that I figured at least a few people could relate to and get a chuckle. Are we just not allowed to suggest or imply the game might have some issues? I don't get it. I was posting this for the chuckle but now I'm pissed. Good job turning that right around.
---
You should buy our game. Look we dug up Mcgyver!
---
And you just got outbid on your own post
---
Psn - Brm138
---
Rant? Where?
---
You know what a rant is, correct?
---
This is a conversation - and barely that. The comment you replied to was 4 sentences. 
---
I hope your friends don’t join the game and that you quit as a result of repair kits
---
There is no we'll see asshole. I am in full control of my actions and I am no longer a customer of Bethesda products.
---
source?
---
Bethesda is clueless about online games.
---
Remember how we had to beg for push-to-talk?
---
They should just make the Atomic stuff tradable. Instead of having the skin/whatever be craftable, just give you one copy of it. 
---
Instead of trying to get everyone to buy everything once, just get one % to buy everything 20 times and trade for it. That's how you get an in-game economy roaring. Just look at Warframe for guidance. 
---
To be completely honest, I really didn't mind the Unstoppables promotion. Temporary stuff like that is fine by me. Even though I didn't participate (none of the costumes appealed to me), one of my friends did and I could see the fun in it.
---
I draw the line at utility stuff that could easily add to the game in terms of side quests and in-game purchasable plans. 
---
To sum up, temporary promotions that have a little added bonus, I'm fine with, but not permanent items that change the game like utility. 
---
I’ve only been started playing fallout games since mid 2017 so I wouldn’t call myself a long time fallout player, however I have played through fallout 3, new vegas &amp; old worlds blues, fallout 4 and all its dlcs, and I love playing fallout 76.
---
I’ll ask the obvious question. Are you scrapping or “storing” items. If you store them it doesn’t change the budget. But lists them under the “stored” tab for later use. 
---
You can also find them in the trade subs for a lot cheaper. You're probably buying duped recipes then, but they still work. 
---
Haha 
---
Enclave bunker at Whitesprings. Science wing.
---
Nice. Nuke Zones are dope. 
---
I love helping lower level players while I'm there and taking the aggro from glowies.
---
Check your junk to make sure it's only scraps. The items themself weigh a ton.
---
You should slow down. Have you forgotten your OP already? 
---
I've played Fallout 3 and 4 + all the DLC .
---
new Vegas was highly buggy on PS3 and the story isn't important to me. It has no effect on the story in 3+4. I decided to get the GOTY edition of FO3 back in 2012.
---
I don't really care for the FO1+2 game play.
---
Out of my entire group. Only one other plays 76 with me, he hasn't played a single fallout game before. 
---
76 is fun. It has potential but 80% of the map seems underdeveloped and small. 
---
I felt like I had more things to do in Nuka world than the entire cranberry bog. 
---
I really hoped for something similar to downtown Boston.
---
I personally think they need to add more parts of Watoga later on.  The entirety of the top part of the map has absolutely 0 point.
---
Helmets need to have DR.
---
The guns could use some changes. As could making bullets. I think it's way too expensive resource wise to get ammo or make ammo. Albeit I did the cap glitch in fallout 4, I still ran out of 45 and 7.62 often. 
---
When it comes to gameplay ( lore+, customization, Story and content) fallout 76 is severely lacking. 
---
Ammo is the worst offender. Especially missiles, mini nukes and plasma cores. If you dont use it, lose it. Also Are you scrapping your junk before you store it? If you have PA parts you just need a frame to put them but you should sell them unless its x1 or excavator armor. Everything else youll find all the time or get as mission rewards.
---
You know there's pvp...right?
---
There's no pvp?
---
Fair enough but even the basic ones do provide an ingame benefit as 100% durability has better dmg/dr than sub 100% (iirc).
---
I agree it's a minor benefit and not exactly "pay to win" but personally I don't like the precedent set by allowing non cosmetics into the atom store. You are free to disagree but in doing so you are giving Bethesda a pass to continue down this road.
---
Yeah thank you for that we appreciate it! It was so much fun!
---
Also get the reduced weight perk and hold your aid. Throughiker I believe, no use in your stash
---
The PA station isn't a "stand", it's a workbench just like all the other ones. When you place a PA chassis to work on it it will be recalled to your inventory after a minute or two. If you're storing PA parts that aren't on a chassis that's absolutely taking up all your space! You need to put them on a chassis.
---
I agree. And the coding required should be pretty easy. (Comparatively)
---
You were talking about my OP? What does creating a reddit post have to do with healthy social interaction? Go eat dinner or something. Your blood sugar seems low.
---
Dunno, you brought it up?
---
I personally don't mind. It's only a repair kit. Don't be dramatic.
---
Yeah cross platform would not work in a game like this. Especially PVP. 
---
Render range is better on PC, Load times would be faster etc and then you have the possibility of running into hackers. Something PS4 and Xbox 1 are safe from at the current moment. I'd rather the community stays separate but give the ability to transfer between PC or Console whenever.
---
500 is still too high, I think. The maximum acceptable amount is 100, in my opinion.
---
Not to mention, you believe anyone who creates a reddit post has an unhealthy social life. Just, wow.
---
Throughiker and travelling pharmacy 
---
The guy who came to gunfight with a knife fails to take lessons from the results of such plan. So typical.
---
Be aware the weapons you demonize ain't remotely as good as you believe them to be.
---
Wait. Isn't that what you said?
---
With the whole scaling thing, with all the trenches in the cranberry bog, it could very well have looked like WW1 with the scorched conflict before the Boss were wiped out.
---
I'm not exactly sure but I think they disappear if they stealth like in adventure mode. Cause sometimes I can see them on the map, sometimes not.
---
This happens to me every time I load in. My second weapon is usually unequipped as well. 
---
P2W isnt really that you MUST but that you CAN.
---
It’s not that people don’t want them, it’s that Bethesda is making them an Atomic Shop item which directly contradicts their initial statements saying this game would not be pay to win. 
---
It's because one of them is in the atom shop some think its ok others its bad and sets a precedent. Many are also upset that it is in the shop because they said cosmetics only would be in the shop.
---
The bethesda community managers can see one highly upvoted post as well as 100 lesser upvoted posts. Just saying. I don't see the point of allowing this in the future.
---
I'd love for that to be the case especially considering Beth at least put some thought into this since Ultracite .308 crafts in sets of like 40-ish something.
---
[Though to be fair this is the result of over three or so days of farming Nuke-Zones.](https://i.imgur.com/h4cX5Rd.jpg)
---
My CAMP isn’t by water, so I have 5 small, holds 10 total, and it works well for my play style. 
---
I honestly think it’s silly to be upset about it. Who cares, I have literally never been in a fight where I didn’t have time to respec after a weapon failure and keep fighting. 
---
It’s a convenience item. Not an advantage. I’m level 188 and all my weapons are OP at this point. 
---
Needs to be the weightless legendary type.
---
They should have never made it so cooked food spoils  in the first place. It’s not fun. I think they forget the game is supposed to be fun. 
---
I also hate the weapons breaking but I’ve gotten used to it. That being said I think adding repair kits to the atom store is a huge mistake. It’s pay to win. The atom store should be cosmetic items only. 
---
Like the perk?
---
As a person who ignores melee, still oneshots most people, just finished leveling up a sneaker rifleman character to surf the meta wave, I kinda agree with some points. Not necessarily with melee, IMO the fact that melee people spotted before they get close simply die is how its supposed to be, but I do think my sneaky rifleman is kinda too strong now.
---
THIS HAS BEEN MY COMPLAINT SINCE DAY ONE.
---
they need to balance heavy weapons but as it stands 308 has been fucked.
---
I'm glad the damage got increased by almost 35 but it's still way toooo low for the round+ Barrel. Ammo crafting alone is fucked. They need to be made at the same rate of .50cal. 
---
Not have .50cal made at 21 rounds. 
---
Darn low levels lowering the levels of my mobs!
---
More like if you want people who only love the game and want no criticism anywhere in sight.
---
My goodness. This can't be real.
---
Bring back Blackbird Power Armor skin for a couple days or even a week.
---
You seem upset. You should try yoga.
---
Has Bethesda made any comments? Because it sounds like they might A.Only make it available to low level players &lt;10 or B. Make it to where the gun looks factory new
---
About 400 caps depending on your stats and perks. 
---
1.5-2k from players.  
---
The Fallout bible explains that a "black rain" containing just that sort of radioactive debris fell a week after the Great Wat.  It was responsible for wiping out the majority of plant and animal life and producing most of the actual wastelands in the earlier games.  It is definitely conceivable though that due to weather patterns, some areas would be much more affected by this than others, and West Virginia might certainly be spared.  
---
Agreed they should be made available but I'm for making them purchasable plans at vendors, event rewards (like advanced kits already are), and tradeable.
---
What would you charge to build me a power armour station?? I have all the resources.
---
Well this is what I’m proposing only cross character/ saves not pc vs Xbox per say
---
How is a repair kit p2W?
---
Are you really going to be engaging someone long enough  for your armor or weapon to break not once but twice? 
---
No probably not.
---
There's nothing p2w about this. 
---
This would be pay to win if it gave Ammo or hidden stat bonuses. But it doesn't. 
---
Oh I think the hit registration might be a separate topic. I seen that in action. Me, bounty on my head for shooting a rat in friends camp. I'm cavalier so I die easily when I'm not moving. I'm not moving because I want the bounty gone. Friend comes close and starts hitting me with melee. First four hits are ingored completely, we don't adjust positions anyhow, yet next two hits kill me. 
---
We'll see...
---
 *“All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76–all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff–is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand–look there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.”*

*" While you play Fallout 76, you’ll earn a currency called Atoms by completing various gameplay challenges and achievements. This currency can be used to acquire in-game cosmetic customization items for your character, earnable entirely by playing the game. "*

Hot
---
Tldr, people who realize this is a game and would prefer to have fun than troll. 
---
I was using 2 handmades and switched to 1 handmade and 1 10mm SMG because I was so sick of this. 
---
Bloody mess. But i wanna shoot arms off
---
i better not lose any of my favorite weapons
---
I always imagined it as napalm style attack. Sticks to what it hits. But im pretty sure the developers intend it to be more of a nerve gas type attack. 
---
Though having it hit then spread might have been too much so they just had it clip through roofs since most structures are not air tight.
---
Still not gunna lie first time the gas hit through the roof of a trailer i was hidding in turned the fight from 7 to 11.
---
Now though i can outrun it and its sonic attacks do almost no damage. Funny to think i use to be scared of em when i started out.
---
I actually have a screenshot from a whole when I went that way. I'm surprised they are still there
---
The one that was nerfed? Yeah that one!
---
Exactly,grow up.Sometimes you buy stuff that doesn't pan out like you expected.You can't just go get your money back after you've used it for 4months.Get over it and learn for next time.
---
IMO I'd run with deep pockets but because you have marine armor, deep pocket mod will make your armor heavier also. If the difference in weight isn't  a factor, extra carry is always good.
---
My response was more along the lines of GTA online being worse in terms of pay 2 win.  In that you can buy your way to the flying bike.  Currently, Fallout doesn't have anything like that. So it was more for comparison sake.
---
I don't like it when it happens in GTA online, I just fight them or server hop.  But it doesn't mean the game isn't fun to me.  RDO also has a much worse economy.  I get the concern for Fallout, I'm just not willing to throw them under the bus yet.  If I ever dislike the direction, I'll play something else.  Somehow that got lost in translation.
---
You're awful at trolling, and that's coming from a troll. You'll get there. Just keep practicing.
---
I don't really count limited time sale items. It's true, I'll grant, that individual items are going down a couple hundred caps from the _very_ beginning, but short term promotion, and steep discounts on _old items_ doesn't strike me as a trend. 
---
I hope they actually do this, I hope they introduce more new stuff at lower prices, and re-introduce old stuff at lower prices, but baring _the last couple days_ things haven't changed significantly. 
---
Wow finally a real argument. That’s fair 
---
RemindMe! 24 hours
---
Yo dude I pull it back out and shoot 13 shots and then I am down to 12 cores. WTH I'll make a video.
---
2020 my man.
---
I’m not sure about others but personally I haven’t really found anything In the shop I would want to spend money on. Maybe that’ll change idk but as of right now I don’t see anything cosmetic worth getting
---
December 15th 1967, the bridge collapses killing 43. The official ruling was a structural design flaw coupled with too much weight. However, The mothman was said to have appeared days before, a harbinger warning of disaster
---
It would be neat if Bethesda did a weekly poll on things players of the game would be willing to spend atom on. They won’t, but a wanderer can dream.
---
Even with the increased weight of having non ultra light I would still net extra carry weight with deep pocketed
---
They aren't too worried either about expenses because they had money in the bank and they're using the most minimally cheap-assed version of a game engine that supports the game and were working on it as a sideline during the development of FO4, minimal expense.  So, if they spend $1 on expense and get $100 back well, that's almost a 10,000 % gain, accountants everywhere just had an orgasm....
---
I don’t understand the finances at Bethesda. They sell $60 games and more merchandise than any other franchise I can think of yet they still feel the need to make money off of micro-transactions.  Totally optional cosmetic items is bad enough but pay to win items is too far. 
---
Let’s also remember that no one even wanted them to make an online only game. We all just bought it because we love Fallout. All I ever wanted was co-op added to Fallout and elder scrolls games. 
---
Played every Fallout starting in 1997 with Fallout 1. Have FO3, NV, FO4 on Xbox and the rest on PC.
---
Yes you would
---
You mean player enemies or monster enemies?
---
Because if players, then I observe such a visual glitch: lets say I do 200 damage and my enemy has 300 hp. When I hit him the bar jumps to 1/3, then jumps back to almost full. This is because your game client sent to server the information that it dealt 200 damage, but not received the information how much damage the enemy player in fact took. Its just a visual lag that has to do with connection delay.
---
If enemies, then I heard my friends complain their weapons tend to cease working, but that was mostly about tesla rifle (nonexplosive variant).
---
Wasn't even nerfed that hard
---
