Well technically it is a group of content being added of the course of weeks, that add new missions, items, events, etc. so in fact wild Appalachia could in fact be considered DLC. Regardless of the fact it was not dropped all at once.  
---

---
Now I may draw the line at calling EVERY week of wild Appalachia a new dlc. But jury’s out at the moment. 
---
---
---
Yea I'll give you the helmet then when you break it down you will be able to make your own I will be on shortly.
---
That's true.  I'm guessing there is a lot more thought that goes into non power armor. 
---
I've only ever gotten one at lvl 120. I think it's a 10mm with some shitty other perks, but i can't bring myself to get rid of it, haha
---
Can confirm, chairs
---
If they start sacking at me with a level 1 board or machete, I pick up my bag and say fuck it. But I agree a gift bag would be nice and might help prevent such events from happening. 
---
This game is fucked up and I glad i didn’t buy it 
---
Keep it offline until the game is finished
---
I will be on tonight
---
I'm excited for this i just recently hopped back in the game. It seems just in time too.
---
Same, man. Just make them disappear, it's driving me nuts.
---
Just happened to me earlier... Been attacked few times barely any damage and then today Bam 1 hit dead.... 
---
Then how to you report people?
---
I roll in party chat personally. The in game chat is really buggy for me and sometimes I want to talk to friends in other games. And I rarely see many people outside the normal places anyways. 
---
I don't have any quests that I am working on just walking about the wasteland.  Level 89 stealth sniper, maybe hunt up some scorch beasts for fun.   Hit me up, CoolArdvark
---
Coming soon to the Atomic shop for $10!
---
Thank you everyone for your comments, they really helped. I played the game today for a couple of hours and ao far I like it. I've had a pleasant experience with other players, they gave me armor and weapons which was really awesome to experience in an online game, for a change. I'm expecting to hit some major bugs and annoying gameplay loops as I get further into the game, but so far I'm just going with the flow.
---
See you in the wasteland. 
---
I shoot it. But most of the time the noobs come up and start whacking me, so I pick up the bag and go on my way. If you are going to start attacking me even if you can’t do damage, you ain’t gettin free stuff. 
---
Yeah I think power armor is too easy and without it forces you to have a more strategic build.
---
I have you tagged as getting suspended. Did Bethesda start lifting suspensions?
---
Thank y'all.
---
Please post spelling and punctuation corrections as a reply to this response.

---
BTW, I love what you've done!
---
Mine doesn't even have walls. Just a foundation with crafting tables. 
---
nicceeee im so jealous..i just want that off of the list..i bought two off the market subs but its not the same..i want my own to drop!!! i dont care if it is the worst gun ever..i dont care what it is i just want it off o f my checklist
---
Ive never once even suggested its okay for the game to be buggy because pvp wasnt an initial intention.
---
This is a multiplayer mod of Fallout 4, as Bethesda said themselves, this is the multiplayer build of Fallout 4, they "make one for every game just to see" or whatever they said in the documentary therefore nothing theyve done with is has been "intended" theyre new to PvP, balanceing shit around having people play together and against eachother. 
---
PvP isnt even remotely a main mechanic of the game though. Ive met literally 2 people whove bothered trying to attack me since Beta and one of those was during the Beta when everything was new. 
---
I do this to mess with people sometimes. Place a piano or another instrument behind a window in a locked camp and see if they warp inside. If they’re over encumbered they can’t fast travel out without getting wanted for breaking out. 
---
Same, it’s easier that way. Plus altogether it’s not that big of a deal.
---
Chairs.. I know the question has already been answered, I was feeling left out and wanted to join in. 
---
bummer, that's where I got mine.
---
Hmmmmm I don't believe so? I usually browse Reddit everyday and I haven't heard anything about it. 
---
Gary?
---
If brick works you should be able to replace it with another wall type.  You could also try placing a temporary floor underneath the stairs
---
berzerker? you mean bloodied right. a guy with berzerker build has no armor most likely. also if you engage in pvp your buddy on your team gets flagged for pvp, even with pacifist mode on.
---
They're delaying DLC. This is the best news we could have received. It's a valid step in the right direction concerning development and support of the game. This is great fucking news, really. Instead of shitting a half-baked DLC out and then polishing it while trying to repair it, it's delayed. Was there an indicated reason as to why it was delayed?
---
Username checks out.
---
I like use mine all the time. I figured I have it, it gives me an advantage, so why not use it.  Some folks say it’s too noisy but that hasn’t hampered me any. Plus it has some advantages that you can’t get on regular armor like a jet pack.
---
Bloodied! Right. Usually, I have a decent chance of killing someone with bloody gear. A well-timed shot works, but as I said, something made them unkillable.
---
Yup and get the charisma perk Inspirational
---
Are you moving faster?
---
Some players are really good at trading for duped gear online.
---
Is the a way to buy the plans?
---
You: "if I don't clear them...." translation: "I want to screw the next guy, not BE the next guy!" B*tch, stop complaining that people like you are doing what people like you are doing. 
---
Quit being a bitch and clean up my trash bitch boy.
---
Nono, i said you suggested that it was alright for there to be little attention given to pvp because it was an afterthought 
---
I'm really glad to hear that Weapon Artisan works well with LOTD. I really needed to know that, so thank you. Also, I didn't know tap fired weapons held an advantage over automatic in this regard, so my handmade and lever action should work well with this perk?
---
I don't understand your post.  Are you saying you got it in a drop, or are you asking about someone else getting it?
---
Possible YongYea review of Outer Worlds "If you recall during the complete failure that was Fallout 76, hopes were pinned that The Outer Worlds would bring back the immersive RPG experience that players all desired, where choices mattered and deep gameplay abounded.  Sadly to say, while the game visually harkens back to games like FO:NV, like most games that don't align with my rose tinted glasses, the game has a candy shell with very little beneath"
---
Doors are always the absolute last thing I place for this reason alone. 
---
I got it 
---
That's definitely good to know. Thanks for the info!
---
Which was Bully1279?
---
ive had this mutation for over a month so im not sure if i still got used to it..but do some of the effects disappear sometime? i have the serums so it wouldnt be that hard to get again..but i risk losing my marsupial mutation
---
Okay so bare with me here. First off, I recommend reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqtokr/fallout_76_pc_version_graphic_presets_explanation/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), the OP is an absolute hero, who has worked with this engine modding and ect. since skyrim, and fallout 4 as well.   
---
For a TDLR, delete your current preset files from config (under my games fallout 76 generally) with the game turned off. Then boot up the game, Select Full-screen, and the Medium graphics preset. Then from there you can change some settings like textures, however make sure shadow distance is set to low, and DO NOT TOUCH ANY FADE SLIDERS.  
---
Once you've done that, if your getting solid frame-rates and want a graphical improvement, go ahead and check out [this reshade](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/234) by the same guy.  I found that I actually got less stuttering in general with this, however my righ might slightly outclass yours, in which case just stick with the setting changes. If you're in game and your GPU still has around 30-40% usage left, that's when I'd recommend using this reshade.   
---
Basically, the presets for High and Ultra aren't meant for 60fps gaming, they're there for cinematography and ect. The OP of that post I linked explains how the medium preset for fallout 76 actually sets values higher than ultra fallout 4, to put it in perspective. So when you're using the medium preset, then for instance upping texture quality to ultra, you're getting the same visual experience as running it on the ultra preset, except ultra runs in general 15-30 fps slower ESPECIALLY in places like harper's ferry.   
---
Hope this helps man, I've dropped the same knowledge bomb like 5 times in 3 days, thinkin' this stuff needs to be in a sticky thread.
---
Create a new character real quick and run with them. You'll notice if its slower.
---
Due to the joys of time zones, I'll either be asleep or offline during this time, anyway. Huzzah!
---
Probably has quite a bit of damage mitigation to go with the low hp. Probably has an auto stim piece to be in back from death.
---
Yeah I think it is happening around 1 AM in my timezone... so I should wake up to a brand new world
---
Quad and AA can't co-exists. Also apparently quad black powder weapons don't drop either.
---
Not for me. I have a dupe plan and it says known but I can’t craft it. 
---
Hence why I don’t play MMOs. I played FO76 for the story only. 
---
Up vote for being fucking right!!!! 
---
No doubt!!  This is exactly when it would happen!  Lost weapons?!  I'd be pissed!  What did you lose? 
---
Well If I did I didnt mean to. They should pay attention to every aspect they put into the game. However I personally do consider it a mistake to waste time with PvP before they have the PvE world down pat. 
---
Are you gonna be doing a prestige on your character? 
---
What about suspended or "frozen" accounts? Communicate with us please!
---
 But my whole point was “fuck grinding in every form”, not “if only grinding weren’t *too* grindy”. 
---
We don’t need grinds. We need fun games that stand alone without requiring endless farming to get that next micro-improvement piece of gear. 
---
I ran the conduits in a grid around my roof and used the 4 port attachment where I connected two lengths together. Then on the two extra ports of the cross piece I would ether “T” off another conduit length or place a radiator attachment.  The radiator will glow yellow when it’s powered.  Once I laid out the grid all I had to do was make sure the radiators where spaced right to cover everything.  The hardest part was connecting the grid to the generator that’s inside the building. The device that extend thru the roof gives you a point to connect a wire but for some reason it doesn’t extend high enough to connect conduits to on top. I use floor pieces for the roof which is probably too thick but I like the look.  So to work around that I went thru a wall and then extended a conduit slightly over the edge and connected a wire to my grid that way.   If you have multiple levels there is an attachment that will extend up or down a wall, one with a power point and one without.  
---
We vant de money, Lebowski.
---
Just to clarify, I meant to use the Medium preset, then you can change things like texture quality. The important thing is to take the medium preset adjust it to suit your needs, so you may very well be able to have texture quality above medium on the medium preset. The youtube video really shows you what I'm trying to get at, its tough to explain through texts
---
yeah this is crazy..because i remember it would say +20 speed...it helps when im overencumbered..i will try it..both my characters already have it equipped
---
Didnt say you were the only one, I said the vast majority isnt having an issue.
---
And look at the common thread...another nuke zone..
---
***Or***, what we could do is leave the random loot unchanged and let people who like to farm farm, and then let people who *hate* farming have an option to obtain the loot they want *without* farming. 
---
Don't bring lore to a rushed-survival-multiplayer-cash-in-game fight. You're gonna lose every time.
---
Did you view in the pip boy view and the quick boy view? Maybe it changes the length of what can be displayed (hit first/3rd person view button while looking at pipboy). Sorry I'm at work right now and cannot test.
---
The game(INFINITE CRISIS) was going to die by the time I made that last post, at that point it was too late and all of my threads with suggestions and questions about the game were either deleted or just buried under crappy early access poster flaming.
---
Pointing out it was going to die soon was not some last "gotcha" moment, because i wanted the game NOT to die you understand?
---
It's funny you mention a story where a game you liked died for the exact same reasons, yet you claim seem to think it was more prudent to just leave and not turn back.
---
How is that better than staying on the ship till it sinks like I did trying to see things fixed?
---
And how do you not see how that exact same thing could easily happen to FO76 if the devs aren't given enough push back to fix their lies and mistakes?
---
As far your claims of being the one who is going to fix this game by being supportive AND offering criticism, where is that criticism exactly and how do you still not understand that silencing "Bad" criticism is not effective or productive?
---
Most people in this reddit and on twitter act like any criticism or suggestions about fo76 are attacks, much like OP has been doing.
---
"Its a tough pill to swallow but if enough people LIKE something and they spend their money on it, and the game does well then that developer is going to continue to do whatever it was that allowed them to make money on that product in their next product."
---
That's why people are outspoken and try and steer people away games like this, and it's weird that you don't seem to understand that as you even say it yourself.
---
I think the one who is confused about consumerism here is you, not me.
---
Part of consumerism is marketing, and this game has has some of the worst marketing and publicity of any game I've seen in a long time.
---
You're acting like I'm arguing at you, who likes the game, trying to change your mind, when you should be trying to change mine.
---
This is exactly what killed so many other games, including infinite crisis.
---
You're staunchly supporting bad practices and shielding the devs from consequences and proper criticism whilst being part of a shrinking demographic of people who still play this game, and when it shuts down or gets viciously overhauled to support a nill player base, you'll blame me and other people criticizing it instead of looking in a mirror at yourself.
---
You are doing the same thing the people who killed starforged did, and not seeing the irony in it as you whine and tell people with nothing nice to say to just leave and abandon the game, ignoring the ones who might be like you who still play but also criticize.
---
👀 I like your name let’s be friends
---
Ah, I must have misinterpreted your question about how to make an appeal during the 900+ hour player's thread.
---
If you don’t care about losing the money then spend the market value. You played yourself 
---
both should work pretty well from my handmade experience, id assume the lever would as well but i dont run a lever in my loadout to say for certian
---
I heard something about a chemical plant but don’t ask me. I don’t know anything about it. Just that it is involved in a quest that starts somewhere near Harper’s Ferry. 
---
Explosive adds 20% weapon damage. Demo expert at max rank adds 60% damage to that 20%. So you're only gonna see a 12% damage increase for a 5 pt investment.
---
So that you can tell your characters apart
---
So wait, that is a radiator? Thanks! It just said conduit, now it makes more sense!
---
Okie dokie, i'll definitely take a note of everything you said. Thanks for the information!
---
Hi guys. Any luck being able to make it on PS4? Really eager to get a Marine helmet!
---
It could of lived and thrived with a respectable population of players alongside other moba's by successfully capitalizing on it's IP.
---
But instead they locked game modes and really neglected their steam advertising which made it sort of fall into obscurity.
---
That was my biggest complaint on their main forums, that they needed to really ramp up the steam advertisement and make sure to put updates on their.
---
They had a free hero weekend where you could play all of the heroes, and they didn't put a peep about it on steam.
---
The few 100 people who played it from their website directly were just being snooty elitists and acted like the steam numbers didn't matter.
---
But the publisher saw the numbers go below 1.2k average players on steam a day and pulled the plug on it.
---
Someone else has mentioned that it was also because the expectations on it were high due to the Arkham games 
---
Half my FO4 are doorless since that's my approach.... But no build is never really done. 🤣
---
Yes! I would like to. I find it quite imbalanced that when I die I need to kill my opponent 2-3 times before I break even on caps lost, even though we are generally the same power level (a lot of the time I am weaker) (I am level 250)
---
Also, having an account name as a display name is a security risk. Many game companies have those separate because of hacking. By having an account and display name different, it adds another layer of protection to your account.
---
I think you missed the point. I state that according to my estimated math that as things stand the chances of getting a legendary 3\* mob to drop any ranged TSE weapon is probably close to 1/1600. Congratulations you were the lucky guy out of 1600 kills to get that specific drop. 
---
My point is that getting a good drop is too rare. I say that 60% of the time I kill a 3\* mob I get a 1\* item. So for a simple exercise take the number of 3\* mobs you think you kill in a day and multiply that by 7 to get your weekly total. Now take 60% of that and just throw it in the trash, what you have left is the number if items that will be 2\* and 3\*. Now take that number and divide it in half because those are your armor pieces and then divide it in half again because those are your melee weapons. Now we have the number that represents our 2\* and 3\* ranged weapons you earn in a week. 
---
Personally I kill about twenty 3\* mobs a day because I am not actively hunting them anymore. So that is 140 a week so 56 of items dropped with be 2\* or better, with 28 being armor rolls, 14 being melee, and 14 being ranged. If I am guaranteed fourteen 2\* or better ranged items a week and there is a 1/161 chance of rolling TSE because the prefix TS is 1/23 and a 1/7 chance of rolling explosive then it will mathematically take me 11.5 weeks or about 80 days to find a TSE weapon the way I am currently playing the game. 
---
I am not a casual but I am not HC although I do play almost every day and the prospect of getting a weapon like the TSE lvl 50 AR I have a second time taking another 80 days if I am not luck is absurd.    
---
It would be nice but then then you wanted to have some build diversity or wanted to change you build because the meta shifted you would be screwed. 
---
I recommend a musket pistol. Big thick stock, nice knob on the grip. Once you fire your load, its the safest tool to whip out and beat your victim across the face with too. 
---
Had one of those newer fangled things fire in my hand while I was wacking off a horde of ghouls with it. Real nasty mess it made of my hand. 
---
Now ive got me an artificial appendage. This sucker gets me out any situation than can be handled.
---
 Its a real wizzbanger.
---
Ok I think I'm all out. 
---
Nope here comea another.
---
Ok I'm finished.
---
How do you know your not dropping? Have you ran a sniffer or even a trace route to BGS servers?
---
The bug I was referencing was fixed in patch 2 or 3, and had to deal with the server not registering huge amount of damage, and hasnt been an issue since.
---
And the speed test report is moot, I can bump up my package and get the exact save report you did. A speed test done to the actual BGS server would give you a better idea of what is going on. If I can connect and do nuke zones with a lesser connection, something else on your side must be messed up is alls im saying salty boy.
---
You get it, now if only we could make BSG acknowledge the problem the game has. 
---
Because then we might get a server full of Gary. Would you really want to unleash that on the world?!
---
[removed]
---
I dont PvP :P 
---
Im like 109
---
Oh, my apologies. My memory is a bit foggy since I haven't been on that thread in a hot minute, so I'm unsure what question you're referring to. 
---
I have noticed that if you use stranger in numbers it bugs out and will not display the positive mutation effects, can not comment on if they are actually removed or if this is just a visual glitch. 
---
I ask that myself that. What was the point if naming your character? 
---
Shoot me a message when you are. 
---
Alucardx666 is my ign
---
Thanks again for the help 
---
I have posted about this before, I have seen this posted so many times after and most likely i was posted tons before. Now it gets traction?
---
I've seen some double stacked mannequin there. If you pump into one and it doesn't fall, it's one, the other supports the other. They need to be shot to make them fall.
---
I was put off buying this game due to YT, specifically Yong Yea and SkillUp/Laymen Gaming. They totally made it sound like it was the worst game ever (until Anthem).
---
I got this game last week after a friend from work recommended it and I’m enjoying it. A lot. 
---
Really need to stick with word of mouth from people you know. YTers just in it for the clicks. 
---
Lol
---
It is very interesting, and surprisingly many counters to many meta choices which leads to a somewhat balanced gameplay.  Just there isn’t much publicity on these counters so many people don’t knwo about them
---
He might be running sentinel armor. was he trying to stand still while you were shooting? theres a visual bug in game where it looks like you are doing damage but on the other persons screen you really arent. if he is running sentinel armor or sentinel+assasin armor it might explain why you barely are scratching him.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*

Or we should finally get chat in the game? &lt;3

I chuckled
---
With my stealth I have deep pocketed stuff and pa gives me less carry weight I only have one for nukes to lol
---
To each there own have a good one ;P
---
Please make this change!
---
Legacykillerhd is the same.
---
"Total disaster dlc delayed 1 day" could honestly be the video title.
---
All Garys, all the time. 
---
PLEASE I have a damn tree in my camp but it’s an amazing camp spot right in between a junk and concrete extractor 
---
Hey /u/ladydevann, glad you are here and getting our feedback to the devs, really appreciate your work.  
---
As of this, do you know if they are working on some kind of ingame chat ? thanks again.
---
Yeah but why when you can just get mutations and wear full power armor with high jump and +20% running speed. Any more movement buff would be ridiculous. 
---
If you add your psn to each others playstations it will feature everyone’s photos during loading screens. I have my 3 friends psn’s on mine and I see their pics all the time which is pretty cool. 
---
I’m not sure if anyone answered yet.
---
But possibly chairs?
---
Oh whoops yes it’s Lady Rot Roh (with spaces)
---
No, D2 showed us having fixed rolls when you only have a loot pool of 10 items in a dungeon or raid was a bad thing. Apples and oranges my friend, but if you wanted to draw a parallel then you could call purples in D2 our 2\* items and 3\* items their legendary items. The problem with that is the mobs that should drop 3\* items drop 1\* at least 60% of the time and how many max level players you you see in D2 running around in blues? 
---
You bring up D2 but that is a really unfair comparison because the game has changed so much since launch. Now that D2 has random rolls it is a close comparison but because the item dropps are fixed even if the rolls are not you can still farm. In FO76 there is no single location to go to to get the type of item or items you want to drop. You have the same bullshit chance of getting a handmade from the SBQ as you do from a random 3\* at West Tek and that makes grinding gear infinitesimally more difficult. 
---
Just wants other folks to join him in the unemployment queue ~
---
If that was on PS4 I think that was me! I had a bounty left over from a night of mayhem one morning and could not for the life of me get anyone to collect the bounty, I was literally standing in front of people with my shotgun holstered and no one would touch me. Went to the resort and got on area chat to ask if someone there would please kill me, and that it wasn't a trap.
---
It did briefly cross my mind to equip Last Laugh but nah, I genuinely just wanted someone to do me a favor and kill me. So if that was y'all, thank you for putting me out of my misery!
---
Prob rare cuz I’ve never heard or seen of it
---
I think the weight you’re seeing is probably being affected by perk cards but stuff in your stash ignores perk cards. 
---
I'd say always keep a suit around in your camps stoarge. The Dr and rad resist are worth it aswell as no fall damage and carry weight, but apart from when you need it, just leave it at your camp and roam around without it, that's what i do. 
---
This should never have been a discussion. Either Fallout 76 is an RPG where you level up and get great gear to become uber powerful, or it's a PvP shooter where you are always equal to everyone else do one one has an unfair advantage no matter how much they have played. You can not have both without destroying the fun of either. People who play Fallout 76 enjoy Fallout games, thus they want to level up and become super powerful and get super powerful gear. It's been three weeks since I've played and I'm waiting for the updates to see if it feels fun again but honestly it's not been fun since I lost my God like power with my TSE shotgun. I never PvP'd because I don't like Battle games I like RPG's that's why I've always used pacifist mode. I want fallout 76 to be an RPG like all of the other Fallout games. So in point, two shot weapons should do double damage per single bullet. Like they always have.
---
Exactly raiders had leather armor and pipe pistols like you said. No matter which direction they came from they would have at least 4 to 6 turrets (if not more) shooting at them plus the people in the settlement and you mean to tell me that 4 or 5 raiders destroyed....and then fixed the turrets so they could steal 6 tatos and 3 mut fruit and a few purified water....get out of here lol
---
Thank you so much for changing the colours!!!
---
I like the traps idea, like you could place a few in your camp and attract animals. Would be a good way to get leather too.
---
The problem being that now that duping is gone the price of duped items is going up to the point were god rolls are actually worth more than the total caps you can have on a single character. If you can easily earn 1400 caps a day and the total number you can collect is 25k then you reach cap in about 17-18 days of played time, but the value of a rare drop that happens for one guy out of thousands once a week should command a price tag that matches its rarity. If it would take someone three months of grinding to have a chance of getting a drop don't you think the guy that gets it should be able to sell it for three months worth of caps or 125k+ caps? 
---
I haven’t personally seen them but I’ve read where some people have, thigh I’m sure it spawns randomly 
---
DLC? DLC and patches are very different things...
---
I love Dogmeat &amp; I know how you feel when you have to leave him behind. I also loved that they gave him his own quest helping you find your son. I only kept the other companions around long enough to get the perk, dropped them off at a settlement &amp; would go back &amp; get Dogmeat. I know your dog is happy to be with you again, even if it is virtual. 
---
I like the fact that I can travel to nuked areas without traveling to a stash first. I am interested in the choices that goes into non power armor. It gives you more motivation to keep getting better armor. With my X-01 modded suit, it is what it is.
---
My tag is irgramps., I have 2 characters, Gramps and Grammy. When people see me online they shout out, "Hey Gramps". Imagine their shock when I show up as Grammy. 
---
you do find out about a small community of ghouls that were killed off by hatred and grief. But I figure that any that wasn't in the community either fled wv, was killed for being a ghoul, or died like every other person.
---
Yeah Cryo Mines work the same as Cryo Grenades although the mines from what ive seen are a bit glitchy (mine falling through the ground or picking up the mine only for it to disappear from your inventory). The Cryo effect doesnt do anything to you if you throw it so you could drop a Cryo Mine on the floor, shoot it and it wont effect you.
---
&gt; I wonder what will be April's hate train.
---
Probably fallout76 survival mode because everyone once again made promises to themselves about what it will be and if bethesda doesn't live up to those promises there'll be hell to pay.
---
Extra salty.
---
I do like the drive to always get better armor. With my X-01 modded power armor what I see is what I get.

AngryJoe's review on Anthem was actually really constructive, and he even did an hour long video as an extension to his original review. Fallout 76 definitely has its faults and shouldn't have been released in the state is was in, but Anthem takes a good step further and is genuinely broken in numerous ways.
---
That happened to me earlier. Once I reloaded it corrected. I used it as an opportunity to take some fun pictures. 
---
No. The frame sets your strength to 11. If you are already 11+, nothing is gained.
---
How long are the servers usually down during these patches?
---
Definitely do not craft. I think Bethesda messed up the numbers and never bothered to change it. Go to the Pleasant valley ski resort (right of top of the world) and disable flame traps. Then server hop and do again. Not the best way, but free and sure beats crafting it.
---
Thanks for the tip. I did see it about 2 times after you told me. Then they fixed the bug and i see it often even at lvl 100!
---
That's a great point, my reason is I like the idea of the challenge of not tanking damage, having to use a hazmat in nuke zones and hide run and dodge scorch beasts and be more tactical against normal foes
---
Nah stealthboys will make the player immune until the effect runs out. As for the crouch, ive never really tested the time on how long. I only tested crouch VATS before and after the first hit.
---
I still haven't spent a single atom. How do they expect to monetize the game if there isn't anything good to buy?
---
I can help u but won't be on til midnight lemme kno
---
Sadly no 
---
Good to hear it man
---
How about we wait until tomorrow's update when the stock will actually be updated rather than their "spring cleaning" sales they've been doing for the past week, shall we.
---
And just because the 4 horseman armors were datamined and leaked doesn't mean they all of a sudden have to surrender them over, they clearly have a planned time for release of those and are going to stick to it.
---
**CHAIRS!!!!!!!111!!!!**
---
Yes. Please, yes! u/Ladydevann
---
so that's how you do it!
---
Both of these are affected by perks and armor buffs so they’re better on you then on the stash if you have any cards with weight reductions active at all times 
---
Yea its something i worked out in like the first week of release. Posted about it a few times and i think some other ppl have too. Super useful for making nice bases
---
To my recollection, the power armor frame has never given +10 STR in FO76 or FO4.  It has always set your stat to 11.
---
Do y’all know where to farm X-01 mod plans
---
This is what Marine Armor should be but isn't currently unless buffed past Level 45.
---
Maybe this will be seen in future.
---
No idea what's going on but I'm suspecting a nerf is in the near future and the guys who did to you will be on here spewing rage about it.  Could be wrong but the gear making this possible sounds like the new TSE. 
---
Meaning that it's powerful gear that is supposed to be ultra rare, but everybody and their brother now has it thanks to duping. 
---
Hahaha you get karma but at this point the game seems set on being a finished game I think 
---
Chairs?
---
I could see it. Recon scout. Favors snipers. higher mobility at the cost of armor and faster core depletion. Though I could see it getting outta hand with mutations, servos etc.
---
At this point if you really like the game just create a new profile and enjoy it from level 1 it trully shines with all the work it has been done 
---
Had this happen the other day. Guy launches a nuke, we get her health down, she regens, and we drop her down to 75%... and all of a sudden she stops taking damage completely. Worse, the adds during the fight spawn so fast it starts wiping people off the map. 2-3 deathclaws, multiple mireluk queens, wendigos, yaoguai... there were so many adds spawning it was wiping people left and right.
---
Whatever mechanic Bethesda has to scale the queen up is broken.
---
To encourage players to fight enemies of higher difficulty, an incentive is required, otherwise the player will simply avoid the enemy in question like the plague. Since enemies in videogames are created with the sole purpose of being killed by players, it stands to basic reason that Bethesda would want players engaging with the enemy, otherwise that part of the game isn't being used.
---
Higher risk for higher reward is a standard practice, otherwise there is no reason to fight an enemy. It simply becomes a waste of ammunition and effort and leads to dissent in the community.
---
As such, high difficulty enemies _do_ need to give valuable rewards upon death, otherwise they fail to fulfill their purpose for existing in the first place and should simply be removed from the game entirely to save everyone a lot of frustration.
---
Maybe next time the demigod will err on the side of benevolence and kill everything there like myself and the other peons do, which will perhaps make a small contribution to solving the issue you proposed, as opposed to further compounding the problem. 
---
I gave away an executioners dragon to a lvl 3 player tonight along with an anti armor spiked ski sword.  Happy hunting! 
---
I put welcome mats on the dirt.   It makes smaller trees, bushes and rocks disappear.   (it's an old ARK:Survival trick to block resource spawns) 
---
As I posted, even with the right group sometimes she just stops taking damage, or seems to spawn with insanely high resistances. Her health is supposed to scale up to the group but it seems like sometimes she's got so little health the fight is over in mere minutes... and other times where I'm dropping damage into her non-stop and she's shrugging it off.
---
That or the adds start over-spawning and nobody can keep up because the moment you kill an add it instantly respawns. Having to stop every 30 seconds to focus down the mirelurk queens becomes tedious. Like, why are there dozens of them in some fights?
---
Not sure if this will work but here's an attempt to show some pics of grid.  I put the conduit thru the half wall by placing the conduit first then the half wall on top of it.

Oof
---
There's also the returning bug where damage you do ends up being instantly healed. It doesn't happen all the time it's definitely come back. Sometimes I can't tell if the SBQ has insanely high resistances or the health bug is causing all my damage to heal her. Or hell, a mix of both.
---
You cant get plans for xo1 only the mods for the enclave 
---
ideal: Auction house with two factor authentication. Can be managed outside of beth laucher (eg from beth website) doesn't require you to be logged in to game client while the trade occurs. Platform wide (not locked to a specific server)
---
Set xyz as "for sale" for a specific price or as an auction (with/out reserve) when sale happens you get a notification and a two factor key. Login and complete trade from client or web.
---
So how do you get it? I'm interested, but I bought my fully modded set
---
Idk we never had a patch like this before. 
---
But how do I get stuff for my X-01
---
I'm jelly
---
You do realize that they're gonna mention this again right "Die hard bethesda fans still mad at youtubers for bringing news to their viewers"
---
I can understand bringing some news to viewers but geez
---
dont be a monotone dick about it lmao
---
You buy it from the enclave military vendor 
---
Anecdotally, I notice it procs midway through a sustained salvo from my .50. Might just be the delay between the proc and the notification popping up.
---
Too bad it's not has seemless with the barn walls. My hall has a big red barn wall and it looks great ,but the living room behind it has either brown wood or the wood frames.
---
1. Get rid of the toilet. 2. Replace with a bucket. 3. Add in phosphate. 4. Use a wooden spoon and stir. 5. Problem solved.
---
Darker nights again too!  Nighttime used to be it's own challenge, now I often forget it's night unless I check the sky for stars.  Heck, there's hardly any call to even use personal lights anymore aside from a few indoor areas.  I miss the challenge, and think they really hurt the game's aesthetic by boosting things.
---
Ha! You're welcome! Yes, it was indeed on PS4. We were in the crafting room. I had actually noticed you on the map with that bounty for a while. I figured it was either a trap or it wasn't. Worst that would happen is we'd get killed. Wouldn't be the first time! But it was all good. He killed you and you were gone.
---
You could have barn on the outside and brick on the inside, that might look good?
---
That's amazing wow
---
Build a concrete pad raised. build a staircase up. Attach floor. build rest of base.
---
put concrete wall blocking stairs. Even if the wall is broken, they wont cross it (usually. A few bugs/mole rats can)
---
Hey Matt,
---
I'm on PC so don't get your hopes up. I just got a 3 star instigating rolling pin drop. Level 50.
---
Other stars are +1 Agility and 40% more power attack damage.
---
I was so sad. But then I thought about this post and came to find you. You're on PS4.
---
Sad again. Hopefully there are people who want this for the memes on PC.
---
Apparently scrapping flamers gives 50 fuel with each scraped one. Though I havent tested it personally
---
Lol it's fine. Pretty good drop though
---
System?
---
PC
---
X01 is limited to the enclave.  If you bought it from a player and you haven't done the enclave quests then you won't be able to do much with it unless you also buy the mods from someone.  Do the enclave quests and it will unlock the X01 plans.  After that you can buy the mods for the armor from the Enclave vendor but I will say they are stingy on whats available.
---
PvP in Fallout 76 is one of the worst I have ever seen; on the same level as BDO, which was absolutely terrible, but at least the different skills and fluid movements made it slightly interesting.
---
They better be working miracles, because otherwise the Survival mode is going to be a big failure.
---
You are coming off as condescending and I dont know if that is your intention, but IMO the masses will stop playing a game far sooner because it limits them from playing the way they want. 
---
You are worried about people having everything and that is valid but the root of the point I am trying to make is that the middle tier of gear the 2\* items are too hard to get and 3\* items are impossible. Even if you are having fun I guarantee this game has lost a lost more lvl 100+ players because they got tired of the grind then it would because people have everything. 
---
The game needs more polish in the loot mechanics and I would rather see better rng and more frequent drops than a vendor that might allow people to custom make legendary items exactly the way they want on the same day it is released.

You should probably head back to the Commonwealth. Sanctuary is probably a mess by now.
---
I hate scum like him too, but we should probably stop giving these people visibility by complaining about them. 
---
Had the idea that it might be better to promote the good youtubers instead lately. It's best to spread awareness of which channels actually make fun 76 content. 
---
Just hit level 126, and out of stuff to do, hoping to buddy up and farm legendaries with someone at West Tek.
---
It might be an unpopular opinion but duping might actually have been good for the game at least with god roll gear. 
---
I’ve completed all the missions. 
---
I’ve explored all the map. 
---
What is left? The grind. No thanks. 
---
I agree with this idea. When i did play runescape,it had a global auction house. You could place items. Set a minimum sell price. And then check in later 
---
 You could also set an item to buy and what you will pay. 
---
Still looking for 10...
---
Well, I'm glad that you found a shotgun that you like.
---
The cranberry bog should be a place for high- level legendary farming.    Plenty of tough enemies are there already, scorch beasts, high level mutants, mirelurk kings, etc. 
---
It should be white springs for high level players, IMO. 
---
Instead, White Springs is an early to mid-level  area  where EVERYONE of all levels farms legendary gear.  I really don't get it.
---
If people call themselves demon/shadow/dark/frank followed by their birth date,year,university code,postal,code, you can bet they don't have much fantasy left for a f76 code.
---
very rare, still one of the plans i have never been able to get.
---
Just picked a bloodied explosive black powder pistol last night. 
---
So yes, they even roll together still.
---
Yeah, kinda.
---
*reads popular reddit posts* "This is just one man's opinions."
---
I have to switch to BT audio before launching the game. If I switch while its open, I lose all game sound.
---
So you're mad that I'm trying to make a suggestion to benefit 'peons' like you?
---
This is the nature of the beast in grindy games. Why do you think people set up turret bases behind the golf club?
---
Players are going to look to maximize the efficiency of their time spent grinding. I may be the only one doing this right now (I highly doubtful that) but in time more and more players will realize that it isn't worth it to clear the whole area if all you want is legendaries. 
---
If you think West Tek is fun I've got bad news for you......the enemies spawn in the exact same spot every time and it becomes repetitive.
---
Blow up the door aha. Happened to me the first week of the game....it didn't end well for my camp.
---
I tend to only watch Oxhorn (love his FO4 settlement builds) and maybe Juicehead if it's a video about a topic  that I want to know more about.
---
Thanks! 
---
Tasty
---
I know a better one lol
---
I've been able to do queen of the hunt once on each character, pretty sure that quest is bugged. If it hasn't reset after 600 hours I don't think it ever will unless they patch it. 
---
I've been looking for people who are interested in the same thing. I just started a new character for this very purpose, of rebuilding Appalachia. Most groups are on console that I've seen. I'd be game for starting one or just working together till we found one. I'm only playing very casually right now though.
---
Lucky Hole mine
---
A couple hours, maybe three.
---
I grew up on grindy games, amigo. I grinded 227 levels of this game, and have no issue whatsoever  putting the time and work in to get quality items. The repetition is actually enjoyable when doing it with friends or a good audiobook. 
---
Another option is to have a friend place one in your camp. 
---
I normally build a fusion generator, power armor stand and whatever crafting stations they are missing. 
---
So long as you don’t scrap them, they are yours to keep.  
---
And yes, it’s ok to buy them early. Sometimes the cost of convenience out weighs the time sink of free. 
---
I think you can get the plan to make them over at Sutton Station if I'm not mistaken.
---
I still see reviews out there rating 76 1 out of five, terrible, broken game, etc. I'm like okay man, I've played real one star games before and this ain't it.
---
People will do whatever it takes for clicks.
---
I know, I know mind blown.
---
I thought it was still like this not long after the change, and I did one only to get to the spot and have a high level guy start attacking me.. I'm in pacifist so I just ignored him and CDC continued to the drop with him continuing to annoyingly buzzsaw me.. I get there and am surprised it's locked... so I'm unlocking it while being buzzed by this annoying bee asshole.. and then as soon as I get it open he's snatching my shit! I was completely shocked, I thought everyone got their own loot! Grrr. I haven't bothered to do one since, despite having quite a few holotapes I would like to be able to use without any bullshit happening. 
---
Good to know 
---
Thanks for the reply. Just checked it without weight reducing perk cards or armor. Still saying 0.8 pounds, still actually weighing 2 pounds in stash or carrying. It may not be everyone, but for our console, it's not right. It was good to check though. 
---
I mostly forego Power Armor, but I do collect and keep the different sets just because it's something to do.
---
Is that close by Flatwoods? I just finished up a "fertile soil" event and currently lv 5.
---
^^^ definitely Lucky Hole Mine if you're thorough enough, especially if you have an excavator power armor, cause that nets you around 400+ iron one, which with the perk Super Duper rank 3 when you smelt it, easily can net you well over 1200 lead scraps
---
Worth noting that once you make them disappear, they won't come back until you re-place your CAMP, so you're free to move that mat somewhere else.
---
Good man right here +karma lol
---
Pretty sure you cannot pick up a power armor chassis with gear above your level. 
---
The game most likely ate it. 
---
Well kemosabi that's because it's easy because you and your friends are doing something that most people do solo.
---
Enjoy your audiobook......the rest of us have other things to do besides playing the same thing over and over. Efficient farming is what people who have jobs and families will be doing.....or just people who realize how pointless it is to waste your time killing all of the non legendaries for 3 caps 
---
I am off to bed soon, but friend me tomorrow I will be playing about 8ish eastern time tomorrow.  I can do west tek.
---
They 100% need to be accurately named. They are in plan mode, but in workshop mode they all have general titles instead of specific ones and it's slightly odd.
---
Exactly.  The "there's no story" players are obviously rushing everything and don't have the patience to read a note.  I've said this is the best written Bethesda Fallout yet, and I stand by that.  Game refinement is another topic.
---
They usually activate when travelling from an area to another,if you don't have any daily active. I managed to start the camden park ones multiple times by server hopping,starting from the forest.
---
It's not a multi tested bulletproof truth tho. Also,as others pointed, mire dailies are rarer or bugged.
---
Yup, it's pretty close by! You wanna head east of Flatwoods over the hill and you'll see Sutton Station and Sutton there. 
---
How much do you have in terms of caps right now?
---
Only, no video game has ever really guaranteed certain loot, just the chance for good loot. 
---
Also, value is subjective. What you consider valuable, others will see different. 
---
Also, the standard practice you talk about leads to video games that are always a case of chasing after something that's just out of reach. Better weapons, better armor, better abilities. 
---
There's also no such thing as waste in video games, especially like ammo. I literally made over 1,000 rounds of ammo in less then a minute, today. With stuff I had in my stash box. I didn't have to go loot anything. I had it all as a matter of course. 
---
The only thing video games have ever done as a standard practice, was to give you a random chance to get good loot for killing creatures. 
---
I post stuff like this for a few reasons.
---
1. Who knows, Bethesda may actually read this stuff and think, "yeah that's a cool idea and it would be simple to implement" Then it's a feather in my cap knowing that I helped improve the game
---
2. To spark ideas in other folks.  It never hurts to throw out ideas no matter how far fetched because it may trigger someone else's great idea. 
---
3. To try to be positive about things to counter all the "for the love of god and all that is holy Bethesda fix (pick your peeve of the day)!" posts.
---
Yep the game has some issues and I'm sure they're working on those but the dev team is a team.  I'm sure they have folks on that team that are working problems and those that are working new ideas.  I don't need to feed the problem side since it seams we have plenty of posts for that.  So why not throw out some ideas to  improve the game for the whole group.  Who knows, one of these ideas may be the "thought nugget" that sparks the next big thing in the game.
---
That sounds good to me 
---
Dave Chappelle has a joke about high heel gangster. 
---
I really don't see what's so impossible about just displaying the character name above the player model. You could still log in with your username. 
---
I have it on 2 characters. Learned through scrapping. Saw it a few patches ago regularly at Harper's Ferry. Just keep collecting them from high level scorched and scrapping.
---
Got a two shot handmade last night.
---
Level 35 fml
---
Those wood frames are thick as nicky minaj. I haven't tried that combo yet. Gonna report tomorrow.
---
Has anyone said Chairs yet? Cause it's Chairs.... (LOL)
---
Phew! I'm glad I learned this before buying FO76, going to create a new account for it.
---
Heeeeeey, how is it going
---
My bad assumed this was wave one of the update. Thanks for letting me know this isn't what we're getting.
---
I ll give it to you. Shielded
---
my psn y00521
---
join my world
---
Loot system is a trash system right now. 
---
Yep, my friend kept getting in my house via a couch by a window.
---
Further PSA, bunker wall mesh windows stop this nonsense in its tracks.
---
Thanks, well i will continue to scrap that rifle and hope one day my luck will be here ! 
---
I think it's been around hundred Combat rifle that i scrapped with no plan unlocked will keep roll those dice !
---
My buddy made me a suppressed hardened shotgun.  It's been my go to for like 20 levels.  Crouched and sneaking gives the 2x damage with chameleon and an Enforcer perk.  Thing is lethal.  
---
Well since no one seems to wanna answer for you ...it chairs
---
Yeah - it does get a bit crazy sometimes. My comment was mainly about the above video. Bit of a half assed attempt.
---
Yep, I'm one of them. I've found all my gear legit. It just annoys me to be 1-shotted by assholes who've bought their way in. 
---
nice, they get in but can't get out.  Like a roach motel...
---
I totally understand this feeling and the motivation behind how you've described your play experience dude. I've always been less interested in usually flimsy story lines than in the minutiae of world building. Appreciate your reply! Even with me on PS, I think this is worth jumping in to. 
---
Also might be level locked if you're below 50.
---
I'm level 70... Maybe to high to get it?
---
It's certainly a frustrating bug that adds to the tedium of Inventory Management 76
---
The amount of times I've run to a vendor to sell my bulked junk and have accidentally scrapped all at the work bench inside from habit is alarming.
---
About 50 I think.
---
Awesome, I'll be there in 10 mins 😎
---
Yeah depends on the build but a dragon or black powder is good. I have a couple for sale if your on PS4
---
That's what happens when you have a bounty on your head. I don't know if it's intended, but that's what other people report as well. So I would say it's "normal" for someone who is wanted. Once someone kills him for the bounty, it will return to aggro enemies.
---
Ahh you probably are gonna need a bit more to buy the plan from there vendor there but I would take rf00521's offer to get one with shielded lining.
---
Weapons and armor should drop at your highest equip able level. Not above or below. A level 22 would get a kevel 20 not 25 item. And  when your past the item level cap, they should all be 50.
---
Or just normalize the items and remove item levels. 
---
Will do, thanks for the assistance.
---
Good idea, I'll give it a shot. Don't quite understand where you'd place a temporary floor though.
---
I feel Yongyea only produces negative content. I can’t recall a single video he’s ever made where he actually praises something, and not for two seconds before immediately going back to harvesting hate clicks. 
---
I can make Black Powder Pistols and I have sold many Dragons. A Black powder Pistol does better DPS. Still I take your point. I'm gonna see how the  AGL works. Its very entertaining to just clear the area ... literally. ;)
---
Actually you can tag groups of enemies and kite them over to all the bots in the courtyard, they'll usually shred them and so long as you do some damage to each one they'll give you the xp.
---
FO4 workshop framework mod, no collision while building, you can fly while building, multiple layers....FO76 multiplayer, it could all be abused even no door collision so...
---
Yongyea is pathetic excuse for a youtuber, hes basically grasping at hate boners at this point. He finds fo76 stuff to rip on but doesnt seem to actually play the game because theres real problems he could be bitching about.
---
The reload isn't too terrible if you have the speed demon mutation. 🤷‍♂️ 
---
Not necessarily true as occasionally my house renders with two smallish trees inside of it - one that I matted and then placed stairs on and one that was "bulldozed" when I placed a foundation. It's just weird. 
---
Probably a mutation or disease that is damaging things around you.  
---
I maxed out my repair perks. Guns last longer but still need repairs occasionally. It takes a lot to break one. Armor is practically indestructible at 200%. Rarely needs repaired. I personally find better use for those slots. I have 8 different perk loadouts presently. Some for crafting, battle and selling. A special one for nuke zones.
---
Dude your are a lvl 400, no way you need that. Make a new character. Also; there’s a thing called sun, and you need some of it.
---
Have you tried submitting a ticket on Bethesda's site? 
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/home
---
This all seems really scummy on Bethesda's part. You paid for a game, played it it in a way that was unintended by the developers by exploiting a design flaw. Bethesda then addresses the problem and fixes it (as they should), but then bans you anyway for their mistake even after they removed the items from your inventory?
---
No problems with 60+ on PC, I'd rather see more toggleable effects.  FO76 firefights are bland even compared to FO4.
---
What event? Uranium Fever?
---
Congrats! My first 3 star weapon was a quad, explosive, 250 res while reloading Single Action Revolver. Since the explosive nerf, it's been in sitting in my stash box but I still do love it including its long taking reloading animation lol

I like some grind and I put like 64 days played time in The Division working through the grind multiple times, but in the FO and Skyrim world people put in hours because they like playing in the sandbox, build diversity, mods, and story. Well FO76 does not have mods or real story so we are left with making builds and enjoying the sandbox, but over level 50 the enemy scaling makes you feel to under powered without good gear so even basic exploring is less fun and build diversity does not work when builds require gear that is super hard to get. It is a lose lose. 
---
That is one option
---
The turn around pisses me off so much. Every damn asam this happens to me with. 
---
People that lock camps suck anyways. There is zero benefit. Why would you not want to show off what you've built?
---
Do you want them to name a location after you while their at it? 
---
Thanks for the reply. I have BT connected before launching the game and can hear everything just fine until the world loads. I had this issue a few weeks ago and thought it was fixed with an update. I don't always play with BT.
---
TL/DR
---
No I don’t think you can. I per server session
---
I have 2 T-60 legs with calibrated shocks installed I am selling.
---
I mostly try to avoid using power armor, because I don't like the interface and it feels like cheating. 
---
I admire your positivity. I don't think they're bad ideas. It's just....priorities man. I may have misread your post bc of the wording in the title. I thought it implied weather was broken and the list was your reasons as to why it was broken. 
---
I've been running a bloodied combat shotgun and SMG in power armor with emergency protocols, it's crazy to be that fast in PA, I feel like I'm playing Doom :D
---
I just wish I had a bloodied assaultron blade to replace my anti-armor +40% attack one. I like the assaultron blade with PA, it just looks right.
---
I have done this, currently lvl 70 and having an awesome time, I just miss playing on my original gt is all
---
Too long didn't read?
---
Well, I really did enjoy the game the first time through - but like I mentioned - I think I would have been slightly disappointed if I just beat FO4 and went to FO76. 
---
It's not a fault of FO76 - this is just a personal feeling. I still believe the game is worth a purchase - me in particular I'm looking forward to the new quests down the pipe.
---
Iron ore does not give lead. 😋
---
you mean this one lol [https://imgur.com/EPbZHpD](https://imgur.com/EPbZHpD)
---
Omg now i want one
---
Oops my bad  😂, thanks for spotting that.
---
Son just told me that once he fast traveled the enemies went back to their murderous selves.
---
So now he just has to get killed to be rid of the wanted status.  I gotta admit I laughed at that. Someone went near his camp so he fired on him. The guy apparently was already at very low health because he dropped after a single shot. My son said damn, ran up to the guy, revived him and gave him a stimpack to get health and the guy just left but my son still got the bounty on his head anyway.
---
Even in the apocalypse there’s dealing with bureaucracy.  
---
Serves you right for buying it off someone lol
---
fast travel reverted everything back to normal.
---
You should take better care of your Brahmin, man! 
---
This hurts me the most.  The tall brick window frame isn't even solid.  You can just hop through the cosmetic window frames.  Was it really that hard to add some glass, Bethesda? Damn.
---
Do you have plague walker by chance? 
---
I had my first disconnection last night. It is indeed frustrating!
---
I don't know *anything* about the process, but could the update have any affect on server instability? I'm sorry if that's beyond unhelpful just a thought.
---
Cans of paint have 5 lead each so I grab them whenever I see them, roof of West Tek has a bunch but generally sheds/workshop areas will have a decent amount 
---
maybe new dlc
---
to lock out the waves of enemies that try to get into your camp otherwise.
---
I made sure people would still be able to enter my house if they know how but don't have turrets inside to fight off the molerats that somehow manage to sneak in anyway
---
Had to Google that one :-)
---
take some rad-x to suppress the mutation and youll probably notice a difference. 
---
I'm on.
---
You realize if you go in the challenges list it tells you the 5 spots you're supposed to go to, right?
---
I have, and i am in trouble for having illegally obtaining 144k nuka colas..that had been removed when they did that sweep, and that's fine I rarely  used them and after the 1500 pound weight limit I  didn't use them! I have created a new account with a killer shotgun build since, I would just like to play on my original gt is all. Thanks for the reply sorry for all the down votes..to many one track minded people on this toxic forum.
---
EST TIME?
---
Uh, you can get it. It litterally became free months ago.
---
I don't know much about programming, but I would guess that the current method is just more simple to use and probably why they don't change it.  If they want to check out a person's account, they just go to that account and then read from their saves.  If they allowed us to display and use character names, they would end up with the messy issue of many same names, and they would probably have to create a backend way to linking those same names to their unique accounts for ease of access.  Right now such a system isn't necessary.  Remember, this game is not build up from the ground as an mmorpg.  It is a rewritten FO4 codebase, so some systems that are natural to mmorpgs, might actually require more workarounds/rewrites than one might think.  I think they went with this less robust, albeit simple route with a simple hierarchy for them to use as programmers which comes across as just an online/cloud version of regular fallout 4 saves with different characters.
---
How do I get it? I tried the Bethesda website but couldn't find anything about it.
---
Jumping on then
---
Bethesda.net launcher 
---
Ok thanks
---
I would definitely go with 16gb memory. That may not be your issue but would still run 16gb.
---
Added!
---
I've been playing a few hours every day on my PS4 and haven't noticed it getting worse.  Actually haven't gotten any random disconnects or lag since the last big update.
---
excellent tip thx
---
Might try uninstalling the bluetooth devices in dev manager reinstalling.
---
Maybe it's a PS4 thing? I'm on PC
---
\+karma
---
Camden Park. There are 4 - 6 can alarms of 9 each. Each tin can has 1 lead. ;)
---
Not sure about the SBQ but some legendaries will heal one time. 
---
Criticism BAD. Corporate product GOOD. And they say propaganda doesn't work!
---
Lol this has been a question since release.
---
I’m actually shocked to see it hasn’t been changed by now. GG 76
---
I ran into a level 177 earlier and he gave me a bunch of free items then told me to enjoy my new toys, this game is probably the most friendly online game I've actually played, most of the people I run into I either help out or they help me out, and I've even set my camp out near the vault to attract new people
---
On so you can send invite
---
Oh, no! The evil Youtubers are criticising my favourite game! 
---
What about mouse?
---
No, if anything the community is REALLY nice. Best gaming community I've ever seen.
---
Dunno.  Just spent 6 hours on a server, 2 of them in a Nuked WS.  No issues (other than crappy 1* loot).
---
There is no helping them
---
Server disconnected three times for me in the last 2 days.    I’m on PS4.
---
Before that, it went many days with only a few blue screen of death incidents.  No server problems 
---
Like sex...  😀
---
Xb1 myself. And for the past two days it’s been buggy as hell. Dc’s, freezes, and the bug that says  you can’t fast travel because an enemy is close by even when there isn’t.
---
I love sitting outside the vault with cooked food and a fewer lower level weapons I crafted to give a new player ahead start. I think actions like that move the game in an a positive direction. 
---
Go to each Silo and steal all the weights. It's like 50 lead each. 
---
AA. The only advantage the TS will have would potentially be the stagger chance against A/S or A/C armor sets, and that's only if you're running One Gun Army. 
---
Server hop with armor equipped and you will get that 100 extra carry weight back.
---
This! I launched my first nuke the other day, alone. Even deciphered the code organically. Ft to the zone, killed 1 critter, then got disconnected with zero chance of reloading into that server again.  Ruined my session. 
---
I'm not familiar with the Sun. What kind of in-game item is that?
---
Yes, once you exit your armor, simply server hop to enable the max weight again. Good point!
---
Mine kept getting murdered by mutants and rats and i never had the stupid grain on hand to repair it so it had to go. 
---
Yes I do.
---
Glowing mass is a food item and is affected by Through Hiker. They're 0.8 each because you have it at rank 2 (60% reduction). Alternatively you have 3 pieces of armor that reduce food/drink/chem weight. 
---
As for why it's not updating, can't say. Probably a bug with the perks. 
---
I think its pretty fair to spend 3x the ammount and get 3 times the performance, not to rip on consoles, but its like complaing 100grand car doesnt go as fast as a 30 grand car.
---
I feel you. Plastic is so hard to find.
---
The logistics of implementing this would be, well, impossible. "Make a program that keeps track of every 3D pixel of every object and if any intersect a player-built structure at any point, even while blowing in the wind, make that object invisible." It's a nice thought but couldn't really work in the game.
---
Though I will note I have zero interest in 'scorchbeast hunting'.  It's a waste of my time and resources.  Shitload of ammo and annoyance for what??  Some bones and meat?  Nah, I'm good.  I don't bother fighting those flying cancer fucks anymore, unless I'm forced to defend my fucking camp from one Johnny Fuckhead McKiteass decided to aggro and kite to my house.  :)
---
Depends. It’s basically like playing Fallout 4, but after you finish the main story.
---
You have passive mode turned on?
---
Welcome PC brother!
---
Are you console or pc?
---
I have pacifist on, yeah
---
The workshops now force you into pvp. The 1 shorting is just people who spent a lot of time into their build and are only strong in 1 class (I know this because I’m a straight stealth melee with the base damage and multipliers I’m doing over 4K damage per hit... I did this so I could protect myself from griefers abusing classes such as this) there’s nothing you can really do about it till the pvp server comes 
---
Try a support ticket and include the sellers mail address in the complaint. Your probably won't get your game back. Just some sweet revenge.
---
They pushed wave one back a day  to throw.  The past week has been them basically clearing the oldest items out of the shop
---
Never tried.
---
Shit, I forgot about nuke zones being an issue too. Idk what future update it’s gonna be in but it needs to be soon
---
Hey man, if you're on PC can I get that plan from you? 
---
I used to be a stealth sniper before I switched to stealth melee. Just couldn’t get good weapons to drop for me. I actually didn’t know this. It woulda helped a shit ton a month ago lmao
---
I do my absolute best to be kind, generous and pay it forward. I jump at the opportunity to help other Players and most players extend the same courtesy my way. I've only had a handful of bad experiences with griefers and desperate PvP players that wouldn't take no for an answer. I used to get my ass handed to me a lot but I joined a community that looks out for each other and I don't really have a lot of bad experiences anymore and if I do -- they're short lived. I think toxicity draws more attention than positivity and my positive experiences in the Game vastly outweigh the negative 
---
This. It appears as if you're doing damage, but it's just lag in the visual effect vs what's actually being done because they're wearing 5 pieces of armor that each have 2 damage reduction effects. 
---
Assassin's Cavalier will have the same.
---
Could possibly be alt accounts from other players. 
---
Kill one supermutant or scorched then loot it searching for legendarys before it disappears, overencumbered minigun and ammo resulting in zero ap. Quick, try to drop both so you can finish the event. X01 power armor is horrible
---
Not an answer just piggy backing to find out if they changed the way server hopping works, because I used to do this at the high school too and it stopped working.
---
There is news coming now. I spoke with Ladydevann and she said news is coming soon 
---
&gt;And depending on how many people are at the scorched earth event, her DR/ER can scale so high you barely do any noticeable damage to her too!
---
Watch the bloody video. The damage resistance shouldn't be scaled up that high so they can't deal damage. AND in regular SBQ fights my crits will always visibly shrink the hp bar. Talking about 10+ppl raids so the queen it's pretty buffed.
---
[facepalm] EDT stands for Eastern Daylight Time.   Daylight Saving Time is in effect so EST is now EDT. 
---
Vendors caps respawn 24 hours from when you first sell an item after reset. I do know that.
---
Rad X suppresses mutations. If you pop a rad x, you can test the difference of speed.  I quit using rad x after getting my mutations once I figured this out. 
---
Cool. I found a bayonet mod for a missile launcher once.
---
Venders are 24hr.
---
Do you actually know what you are taking about? The game doesn't need to track 3d pixels.
---
That's what I wondered, but they both had the same names. We're on Xbox, and it uses your gamer tag, so duplicate names wouldn't work. 
---
Still stumped. 
---
If the only change made was that 2 and 3 \* enemies *always* dropped 2 and 3 star loot, respectively, I would be totally fine with the legendary system.
---
Because then they would have to have a system that checked to see if that name was available, and you would still end up with names like "jrox0213" or "noobs_suk09" or "enseminator". This way if you want to name your character Preston Garvey, you and everyone else who wants to roleplay him can lol.
---
PS4, sorry.
---
An update will be coming soon. Keep an eye on your inbox and try not to make any new accounts to get around the ban. 
---
what does the power armor have to do with the bloodied weapon though?
---
"broken" how?
---
Well the best use of bloodied is unarmed with unyeilding armour to boost your strength to 30+ which also massively boosts your melee damage
---
thanks for the info. When you say "til the pvp server comes", what will that change exactly? will the current game mode be pve only, or do you just think it won't happen as frequently because of the splitting into seperate servers? 
---
It's generally a combination of either  assassin's/cavalier or assassin's/sentinel that reduces damage to minimal amounts.
---
Honestly, finding gear with those two combinations, a good 3rd star, and isn't light leather armor is a nightmare for anyone who isn't power-trading on multiple subs/sites.  I'm sure people have duped it and people do have entire 5 piece sets from it.  But unlike the TSE, where you only needed one item, with these sets you need all x5 slots for best results.  But I don't imagine the amount of people that have full sets of God rolled armor is all that common.
---
Ah yes the unyeilding armor. cheers
---
I'm torn.  It's really cool that players can trust and work out getting bounties removed, but on the other hand having the player feel compelled to negotiate to get a bounty removed feels like it's an incomplete concept.  
---
Platform? 
---
I have 100 fusion cores and several gatling lasers and a laser rifle all ready for the enegry weapons buff tomorrow.... It had better be substantial buff or I wasted a lot of time and space for this patch! 
---
 Oh well. ;) I have had many Chameleon bits flow through my hands but I only will use my Heavy Combat Armor ... which I do things to. ;) Got my first Heavy Combat one today or I would have discovered this long ago. ;)
---
 I live in the Mire and its dark. I need my NV scopes just to kill the trash attacking me. 
---
It has a wedding ring on it.
---
I just always put the doors in last when rebuilding my camp, or open them all first when I put in some new decor.
---
I think it may just be a bug. I fast travelled back to my camp about a week ago and all my turrets were called "Watoga Vendor Bot".
---
WoW has it automated. They have better servers and better server stability. They have the experience with mmos to implement something and not have it fall apart on day one. Bethesda should have consulted them.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel is recruiting Initiates. One of our tasks is recapturing and rebuilding Appalachia. We have a few Forward Operating Bases in close proximity to each other. 
---
Add Looch_P (ign) if you're interested. 
---
Stingy yeah lol that’s one way to put it. I would just not server hop and buy them here on Reddit market. Search for “X-01 mod” usually returns good mods being offered. Ex: I’ve done 550+ jumps and never seen the targeting HUD or Tesla coils. Best of luck 
---
It's funny to see you picked it up from a liberator.
---
People have been saying this since day 1.
---
If pc, I start @ 300 caps to as low as 225 (if buying 19 or more)
---
Made a spreadsheet to calc the discount for ya.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_tg8JZoxBuzqJCZoCNLthmtFBIHSZO8wpBxIqKOTimQ/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
fun to use but the ammo is terrible to craft it’s a heavy weapon it should be 100 per craft like 5mm and .50cal. 
---
what characters does xbox allow for GT? Id guess they were just similarly named. I've uaed accounts with almost the same (diff of a period of space, which is easy to overlook.
---
Maybe, and this is just a longshot, it's because they're 100 lvls higher than you
---
20h*
---
It could be possible I missed a space or two, absolutely! 
---
&gt;If the vast majority isnt having issues
---
That's not how bugs work. Bugs are something uncommon. Uncommon means that not everyone encounters them. 
---
&gt;and hasnt been an issue since.
---
Because you said so? How come you're so sure about it? 
---
&gt;A speed test done to the actual BGS server would give you a better idea of what is going on. 
---
Fine, here it is. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/wPzr6tl.png
---
&gt;If I can connect and do nuke zones with a lesser connection, something else on your side must be messed up
---
In 4 months i encountered the bug 2 times. It's obviously not something common so get off your high horse. If some shit isn't happening for you or for the vast majority of ppl it doesn't mean that it's not happening at all. If nobody wants to have sex with you it doesn't mean nobody has sex. 
---
&gt;salty boy.
---
Not salty just annoyed at how dense you are and for the sake of my sanity i'll just block you. Out of sight out of mind. 
---
 Watoga High in the cafeteria. Plastic galore. ;)
---
yeah tried to give a level 6 a bunch of  stimpacks, purified water and ammo (.308) as that's about all I had they could use (all my weapons are 45+ level).  The poor player did a double take and when he saw me and high tailed it while I was dropping stuff for him/her.  Had to pick up my doggie bag of stuff since it wasn't going to be taken by this player.  Some kind of emote to give stuff away would make things easier...
---
I personally use the "come here" or "trade" emotes.  Not perfect, but prefacing it with a wave usually gets people curious.
---
I'll have previously dropped items in a blue suitcase at a train station, or the cash register right in front of Bob if I'm giving away stuff in Flatwoods.  Sometimes I point at the suitcase with my gun to get them to notice it, or shoot at it repeatedly.  
---
I recently started jumping on top of the suitcase and leaving a loot bag with 1-2 items, just to get players curious and hopefully notice the suitcase undearneath is where the real goldmine is.
---
I don't leave bags, because they tend to disappear or become unlootable with an endless loading loop if the benefactor quits the server or disconnects.  Cash registers and suitcases persist, keep the loot after you leave the server, and can hold a very large amount of weight.
---
Using the overseer's caches is not a good idea, because a lower level's required quest loot will over-ride and delete whatever is left in there, and they can only hold about 25lb.
---
I guess the pay it forward initative helped a lot of people out, because at the B.E.T.A. people were friendly, nobody was toxic, we helped each other. Now we are higher level, we decide to help other people since that is what helped us up.
---
Likely Xbox. He said gamertag. Just a guess however.
---
As mentioned above, workshops are auto pvp zones. No need to engage first. 
---
Also, at current, pacifist doesn't affect other players. It prevents you from damaging them/their stuff. that's all
---
I would like to see full height half walls too.
---
because it apparently need to he said again.
---
Pacifist doesnt affect incoming damage. Only prevents you from damaging them/their stuff. 
---
Yea that shitty road vague roadmap that was delayed really shut people up LOL
---
What? The root cause isn't fixed? Will there be another wave of cheater suspensions?
---
At least isolate them on separate servers.
---
Are you still banned? That’s some bullshit bro, ban the dedicated guy who has left a journal to help everyone else in the future. 
---
Yea it was delayed a whole day. The horror. 
---
Lever action for me, mainly for the fire rate, and most enemies die in 1 shot.  I keep a dragon with a few rounds if I really need to hit something hard.  
---
West Tek roof top has some 10 or so buckets of paint and that's 5 lead each. Or you could just do Breach and Clear and get some 40 Lead Ores an event.
---
I leave items at train stations in the blue luggage bags.
---
Okay. Im going to get downvoted and i accept that but..
---
While i admit most of his news is now surrounding hate trains, i have yet to find anything thats an outright lie. I have watched multiple of his videos and they all seem really well fleshed out minus the fact that he does seem to only report on bad games or games with alot bad press.
---
His review of DmC was actually really well done. There is nothing ive seen really worth calling this guy "cancer" or "scum". 
---
I think you guys are overreacting just a bit and this post is entirely witch hunting. The mods should enforce rules accordingly. Don't claim the mods hate you cause you knowingly broke rules. 
---
Whitesprings, aggro the ghouls and run to the cars. Use explosives to blow up both the ghouls and cars. You will likely die often, but so do the ghouls. Demo expert perk is a must, dense mod for chest armor and fireproof perk can negate explosive damage if you can get them. Grenadier is explosive radius available at level 35. Any explosives work, but MIRV and nuka grenades seem the most efficient.
---
Lmao it happens twice in 2 months and your on reddit crying about how bad fo76 is, and how it crashes 3 times in 3 hours!
---
It might be an uncommon bug if it related to something people dont do every day, multiple times, unlike the scorched earth event which happens often... were you on this sub when there actually was a damage bug? Every 4th post was people posting the issue. I've been on this sub since launch and seen many of the rise and falls of the shitstorms.
---
Grow some thicker skin salty boy, or the world will chew you up before you get teh sex.
---
If the game doesn't know where the tree limb is, how is it going to know when to make it invisible? Acting like I'm the dumbass...
---
The game tracks the "base" or 2D foundation of objects placed in the world. Play around with placing objects over a bush, making objects overlap, or in the Creation Kit and it's pretty apparent. Or do you think they're just going to nuke the entire 5m radius and remove all foliage when you put down a foundation? Honestly not a bad idea but, again, the logistics would be a nightmare knowing this game.
---
Thanks for doing the math. I would love to see a drop rate increase and/or a crafting method which helps to alleviate the RNG.
---
The odd thing is why are you trolling the subreddit? If you hate the game why don’t you just piss off? If I had to guess you’re a pc gamer. 
---
As a doctor who produces a lot of stimpacks and chems for you ~~degenerates~~ good people. 
---
I'd love to have a few medical based utility 'farming' items as well. Let me grow brain fungus, glow fungus, and pitcher plants (digestive goo). As well as having a tick farm/bait. I'd even take a blood donation station even if it had a limit of one blood bag per hour.
---
If I'm not mistaken, some other online games I played had little to no weather but eventually added some. I agree with OP and would love to eventually see this added.
---
I'm currently using a quad exploding hunting rifle - but I'd really love a bloodied (and pref exploding) lever action. Unfortunately haven't found one and can't afford the prices being asked for them on the markets. Took me 120 levels to find the hunting rifle 😱😁
---
There is a hit on PC. I think it's server side though. The Gatling gun DPS seems to be tied to the server FPS for the area, as my ROF for the gun goes down by about 50% when fighting the queen. 
---
It’s not our fault you spent thousands of dollars on a dying platform. Video streaming ftw. It’s going to be awesome when my cell phone looks as good as your PC.
---
The important bit is to just keep doing damage... Help with adds if the sbq is too tough, don't worry too much. 
---
What really sucks is when people join and won't contribute at all, they'll just tag the mobs and they'll just sit there letting others do all the work.
---
Health and resistances will scale up depending on how many players are in the area, which is why it's so important for everyone to contribute. Even if it's just a tiny bit it will all add up in the end. 
---
I used to worry a lot about this too, "what if i'm not pulling my own weight?" so i only ended up joining a SBQ fight when i was almost lvl 90 or so. Now i realize that i'm doing just fine, it's the afk-ers that won't pull their own weight. 
---
I don't know my maximum damage/shot, but i do know my minimum is about 245-250 and crits will double that. I'm heavily invested in vats, crits, rifles, a critical hit to its head will always cause visible damage on the hp bar (I think anti-armor plays a pretty important role too).
---
Haven't failed any SBQ events yet, but i always get frustrated. You get better loot doing whitesprings runs, and you waste way fewer resources. 
---
Can we expect to see this in the reddit forums when it is released? Thank you for the reply.
---
Have an upvote and rest assured, you are not alone. I've done the same damn thing so many times.
---
Lever action from distance while in X-01 stealth boy.
---
So looks like giving the finger.
---
I use a bloodied explosive lever. Started with the hunting rifle, but the lever's better fire rate helps if you get swarmed by mobs
---
More so when ive beat wholesale legendary ass to make it evolve through two prior forms and then survive his buddies and still get a one star junkies meat hook or a nocturnal rolling pin. 
---
Doesnt matter where i go its still junk
---
Handmade.
---
Why would you do this to me. I live close to there for another resource (and the blood leaf as I make a lot of medicine) and it's awful how often I have to spend my first 10-15 minutes of playing fallout a day trying to find a server in my region where someone's camp isn't overlapping mine. :/
---
You still there?
---
I say any positive help is good.  Even if all you do is attack other targets you’re freeing up those who can do large amounts of damage the ability to stay focused on the queen.  Get a tag shot on her then go around and keep the battle area clear of the random beasties is still help.  I’m a sniper with a pretty good Gauss rifle so I try to stay up high on something and target as much as I can on the ground and throw as much at the queen as possible.  She’s tough though, so it takes everyone chipping in to get her.
---
Yes
---
The wide spread duping methods you could look up on youtube have largely been fixed. But duping is still a thing, its just fewer people who know how it works than before.
---
Yeah now that I think about it a Bloodied would prob be better than Instigating since you'll be in stealth with no real danger mostly. Only prob is I only have 11 agility. Would that be enough with all chameleon armor and sneak perks to not get spotted? Haven't ran a sneak build before is why I'm  asking
---
on my way :)
---
Just on a reset they do like 3 hours. But id be willing to bet 5-8 hours. 3-5pm eastern if it goes quicker thatd be great.
---
Agreed. At a minimum it needs to tell you *very* clearly that your actions will lead to a bounty. Right now it just flags it as "steal", which you also get from other, non-Bounty-inducing sources.
---
I have a be vats lever and it's better than you can imagine
---
Rocket gaming made a pretty good video on it on youtube
---
Vault 112 strikes again! 
---
For sneak you need full ranks of Sneak and Covert Operative. And Escape Artist as well.
---
👍🏻I shall continue putting my metaphorical face to the grind wheel 😁
---
Power Armor cons:
---
* Fusion Core duration, especially when used with VATS or jetpack, requiring a perk or carrying multiple cores.
---
* Slower base movement speed

* Can't use crafting stations
---
* Certain Perks don't work (Marathoner for example) in PA, without stating so
---
* No Dense Mod available for chest. Fireproof is not enough in most scenarios
---
* Can't use legendary armor affixes, most noticeably AP refresh or cavalier/sentinel
---
Pros:
---
* Don't need to carry any armor, saving weight
---
* Jet Pack and other unique chest mods
---
* Excavator armor grants 4x ore harvest
---
* Good early game defences until legendary armor
---
* Calibrated shocks offer comparable carry weight compared to weight reduction legendary affix 
---
I treat my PA like a car. I use it if i need the specific function. Excavator set is only for mining and if i need a bonus 200 pounds to fast travel. X-01 set is for the jet pack. Maybe in PvP I'll try Emergency Protocols, but seemingly Unyielding is much better.
---
Pretty smooth on the xbox most of the time for me.
---
Dude, it's your fault for not buying the santa outfit!
---
I would get everyone I know to create alts named Slim Shady and Spartacus and watch chaos ensue. :P
---
Also, let us change our characters names, I accidentally hit \ on my 2nd Character when I hit enter now so now it's at the end of his name, its particularly annoying
---
It wouldn't really HAVE to be, I guess... but a lot of larger scale RPGS with online elements do it that way.
---
Honestly, the servers aren't big enough to justify that as a need, with only 24 people.
---
Its known but i don't thing its a priority.  Cross your fingers that it accidentally gets fixed in the next patch.
---
I use locks on my resource extractors and that’s it
---
Lever Action all the way. I have an Instigating one and my Alt has a Quad one. Just a fine rifle. ;)
---
I've was only ever once begriefed by a trio of dinguses who kilt me dead in less than 10 seconds with their dumb deathclaw gloves. Other than that everyone is pretty nice.
---
This. If the event pops up and no one comes to fix it within a certain time frame, it melts down.
---
Have the rads be significantly higher (as there's far more fissile material in a reactor than a bomb) as a balance to it being a free nuked zone. 
---
Thanks bud!
---
Any place that has a bunch of toys 
---
It still isn't spawning it seems
---
Thanks everyone for the suggestions!
---
You got the top hat?
---
It’s a lie to ever say anything mean about fo76.
---
Can I post this topic tomorrow or is it still not my turn?
---
Fallout 4 is like The Lego Movie, Fallout 76 is like playing with Legos, except every now and then your little brother will come in and steal pieces when you aren't looking. 
---
Ok. But do I still need 15 agility and all chameleon armor too?
---
Wow, this is amazing! How you make the wind generators float?
---
After refining I had 200+ lead, and I was only mining every other lead vein
---
He pointed out some of the dlc is pay to win and people really freaked out someone would mention paid items giving hp is bad
---
Yeah! Living on easy street now haha
---
After the patch?
---
If the patched version of pacifist allows you to accrue a bounty without manually disabling pacifist then they fucked up.
---
Aw I hope.  If not now hopefully before pvp servers.  I have a concrete walled off base and spent so much time making a working air lock door.  Also if Bethesda sees this please tell me there’s gonna be some sort of raiding system.
---
I want to see legendary loot from Supply drops... actually just make it so a Scorchbeast Queen pops out 1% of the time.
---
What is this all about?
---
I saw a player named Vendor Bot last night. Thought it odd but now it really seems strange! 
---
I would eat anything to survive.
---
But I won't eat that.
---
Just got one today. Reasonably priced. Just need to mod for a silencer. Been scrapping all day
---
"Every curse word is already in the game."
---
That doesn't stop Rockstar Games from keeping people from using any swear word whatsoever in GTA Online.
---
It's not terrific on PC, either.  I have a very reliable, very fast internet connection (the station is at the end of my street and my neighbor works as a technician for my provider) so I rarely have problems, but I often play with a friend that lives in rural New Hampshire, and she DC's constantly because there's too much going on for her 20mbs connection to handle.
---
For me, the SBQ is almost always immediately lootable on my melee character, probably because I'm right in front of her when she dies.  I have to follow her and do it quickly, or she follows the same fate as enemies below.
---
Even with my 100mbs connection and reasonably high end gaming PC, I often have to wander around for a good 10 minutes waiting for meat piles to populate.  Maybe 5 minutes after the queen dies, I'll get Scorched Earth event completion and start to receive my quest loot.  I can walk around, eat food, drink juice, look at my inventory, swap perks, etc.  The 100 or so meat piles in the area slowly become lootable one by one, and populate faster as more players leave and I loot-all to create less and less lag.  I understand why this occurs.  It even happens in the Whitesprings Clubhouse with more that 3-4 players sharing loot.
---
The worst part about this is missing out on the 2 guaranteed three star enemies that pop during Scorched Earth.  By the time their meat pile is lootable, the legendary item seems to disappear.  Missing out on two potential 3 star items is a real bummer.
---
I would suggest cutting the mob spawns during SBQ by at least 50% to de-stress the server and players' local connections.  To maintain the current difficulty, maybe limit the spawn table to a curated selection of difficult enemies.  There is no reason for radroaches, mongrel dogs, mutant hounds, mirelurk spawn, molerats and bloatflies to clog up valuable bandwidth.  The amount of lvl 68 scorched alone is unreal.  I participated in SBQ today and I must have killed 3-4 dozen scorched just on my own.  They're annoying, not dangerous at all, and just take up valuable bandwidth.  
---
At the risk of putting my foot in my mouth, replace maybe 20-30 scorched with 3 extra deathclaws, 3 yao-guai and 3 radscorpions.  I got killed twice (lvl 150+ with max level T-51b and rank 3 blocker) by a 3star and unstarred scorched radscorp duo.  The stacked poison damage was taking my health out faster than I could spam stimpaks.  I burned through 40+ through the whole event, probably 90% of those used while being attacked by the scorpion twins.  Those things are brutal.  I could easily smash 50+ lvl 68 scorched and certainly never be in real danger of death.  Two top level scorps were way more than I could handle.  And yes, the 3star dropped no legendary loot.
---
I walked away with some flux, a lvl 45 nocturnal/FF cryolator, two ultracite armor plans that I already had a half dozen of, and a prime gatling laser plan.  I guess the flux and xp was cool, but I'd rather have my 40 stimpaks back.  I threw away the 6 supers I got for event completion because they weigh far too much.
---
I'm sure the gray or brown lacquered cases were the giveaway. 
---
I've been using a 1* bloody hunting rifle. I can get the damage over 300. Always one shots any gouls (not glowing). Some super mutants take two shots. 
---
I love you now 
---
Yeah, and this isn’t just a regular patch, it releases the new Wild Appalachia storyline, new content so many people care calling it DLC.
---
There is a mod for fallout 4 that makes the doors auto open every time you walk near them in build mode. I suppose it's possible for them to do that in this game. The underlying functionality is there.
---
Yeah, but fo76 is a MMO.  Grinding is part of the appeal for their games
---
Awesome, is this NE of Watoga?
---
You've gotten good answers, but I'll just say this- for me, 20-30 was the only time the combat was tough, so don't feel discouraged! Just stick to the Forest and toxic valley, avoiding the snallygasters(sp)!
---
To me at least, grinding is part of the work that makes getting that piece of gear feel so worthwhile to get.  Grinding is fun if you enjoy the game.  Online games will always offer some form of grind, since without them, they are dead.  Fo76 is a MMO, not a single player game.
---
People are still often sure it’s 24 hours, but I have tested this and can tell you with my own utter certainty that vendors reset their caps 20 hours (to the server second) after you sell to them the first time after they have reset. 
---
So, you’re away for a few days and all vendors are at 200 caps. You sell at Watoga station at noon. It doesn’t matter if you clean out all 200 caps or buy an item for five caps. The reset clock has started. 20 hours later, 8am the next day, that vendor will reset to 200 caps. 
---
You may not see it! If you visit a vendor close to the 20 hour time it may still show 0 caps, or whatever amount you left it with. But if you try to sell an item after that 20 hours it will work with the vendor now having a full 200 caps. 
---
Im going to try [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmQZ4pKayrI) tomorrow if it doesn't get fixed.  Looks like it will do the trick tho
---
The civil war reeanactor has plans on him. They are super cheap to craft. The best one is the civil war top hat. It costs one cloth to make, and can sell for around 25 to 35 caps depending on your stats. Basically an easy way to make caps for vendor runs.
---
The level two make as me think it was a player lvl twos are common for alt accounts because no one can attack them.
---
Server hopping doesn't seem to work anymore. I just quit hopping now trying to farm weapons to scrap. 
---
Holy sh...that’s amazing.  Here I am bulking junk to sell to vendors.  Does he wander randomly like Graham?  I’ve never seen him.
---
I have 9 points in agility, and I wear one piece of chameleon, the rest Unyeilding. 
---
Its with a sentinel build. Currently if you have all pieces thats 75% damage, pair that with assassins sentinel 8%, you pretty much dont take damage in pvp
---
Whenever I see this it sure feels like the people saying it just don't want to out the glitch so if doesn't get fixed.
---
Hes dead
---
There's holes everywhere. I usually fast travel or server hop to get out. I just had a thought. Maybe existing armor and collecting it would get you out.
---
You’re absolutely right, they can’t defend against larger groups. That’s why it might not be a great idea to take workshops. If we were allowed to booby trap our stuff, would the explosives be targetable in vats like mines are? If not, what would stop griefers from taking and holding all the workshops on the map for hours at a time? And if they are targetable, then you could just shoot them while the owner is around and kill them outright. 
---
I’ve been that solo player trying to defend against groups of 3 and 4. And now, like I said, I only take workshops during slow play times. I don’t particularly care for the PVP in this game, but I need fusion cores, so I take the risk. If people don’t want to be openly attacked, you can easily farm anything you get from a workshop; it just takes more time. 
---
Im not sure if i like the implications. If i wanted to stay low key about anything, i would have just not written about it at all.
---
Have you tried (1) unequipping then re-equipping, (2) dropping it then picking it back up, or (3) restarting game?
---
tried all 3 :(
---
Im 240hrs in and I can quit playing. Especially now I can play with my builds more as I learn more about the different styles. At one point I got really bored but now, I can't quit playing. My wife hates it lol
---
He is a random encounter. Kind of rare. Not a vendor, just a dead body. If you are on ps4 add me and come roll the dice.
---
Idk then. Report to Bethesda I guess
---
Sorry
---
That’s not at all what you’re suggesting though. You said the problem with legendaries is bullet sponges, and I’m simply saying that’s not the problem.
---
 My Instigating Lever Action does about 130 with a Hardened Receiver. So that's 260 on a full health enemy and 520 with my Stealth Bonus. It will do that all day as I repair it to 200%. ;)  
---
Been playing since release and only come across one asshat who was passive/aggressive. He wouldnt attack but instead damage vehicles nearby so they exploded. 
---
In saying that, its online and MP, there is always an asshat around every corner.
---
Rest of the community is great.  
---
I'm using a lvl35 Bloodied Gauss and a lvl20 AA hunting rifle (w/faster fire) until I can find similar max level weapons. The Gauss is absolute overkill with the sneak damage multiplier.  Damage is 1k+ before adding in the sneak attack multiplier of 2.5x or 3.5x.
---
That's awesome! Could we get a map marker pic for those of us also looking for nice place to set up base camp? Either way again, that's awesome. 
---
Chernobyl was a steam explosion.  I think the issue is people are picturing the reactor going critical like Halo.  I'm picturing a 5 minuet ramp up time where it goes from normal to nuke zone. Just slow enough that you would really notice until you're taking 50 rads/sec or so.  
---
Hey man, I found a mod in Huntersville for that.  (Reactive plates) is that what they're for? Excavator Power Armor?  What do they do?
---
The one that looks the coolest. "Marksman" Hunting Rifle looks fancy and nice but the Lever Action Rifle has a very New Vegas-ish feel to it, if you ask me.  
---
I'm personally using the Lever Action Rifle but just because I've got a bloodied one and I've got a glass build.   
---
If I find a Bloodied Hunting Rifle, I'll switch to that back and forth from time to time. :)  
---
So in short: both.  
---
I don't think the difference in stats makes such a huge difference. If you manage with whichever, I think that's what matters most.
---
Sneaky Handmade. That's a cool idea.
---
I know exactly what I suggested in my post!!!
---
Your reading comprehension sucks.
---
i shut down my ps4 and brought it back up. it's working now :) thanks horr the help
---
You can get a decent condition buff if you use a Forceful Stock instead of Stabilized. Might not be necessary after Patch 7.
---
Glad to be of service. Now go murder some sh*t
---
09696878
---
Heyo, this is not a reply to your question but check the cigarette machines at train stations. Cigarette packs give you plastic. Flagging any junk items you want is really handy.   
---
Another great thing is scrapping Laser Guns, plus you'll get the mods for them.  
---
Super mutants carry those many times. It's how I get all my plastic. :)
---
Yep workshops are pvp flagged can't use them without opening up to pvp. Also if you plan your points right a lvl 50 or 55 is no different than a lvl 400.
---
A 5 minute video where he reads out a few reddit posts is "fleshed out"?
---
Also the witch-hunting rule applies to people who are part of the sub. Also nowhere have I said "go dislike Yongyea's videos". It's ok to say Fallout 76 is a shit game 500 times a day on this sub, and saying YouTubers are making bad videos on 76 is witch hunting? Why is my right to speech less important than theirs?
---
He has one civil war outfit plan on him at a time. You just gotta hope it's the top hat, but the other ones can sell at a decent price too.
---
Seems like this isn't something that Bethesda needs to do so much as it's something that some bounty hunter role players need to do. Open a shop charging people 100 caps on top of their bounty to clear them.
---
And just like the last guy.......
---
I check your post history and you clowns are all on the trading Reddit trying to acquire duped gear to make the game easier......gtfoh with your duped gear bruh!
---
Downvotes for no fugging reason. Good job, Reddit.  
---
But yes, I've had the same. Was in a party with a lv.30, lv. 100, lv. 50 player including me (lv. 80 at the time) and a lv. 250 and a lv. 100 stacked Stealth Boys and kept wrecking us, one-shooting us with explosive shotguns.  
---
Sucks but those people are griefers. Change the server. What I do at this point is I only claim a workshop if there is absolutely no player in the area of whatever workshop or if the server is almost empty.  
---
"Tip:" Join a friend who has been playing for a couple of hours. Usually servers become quite empty after a bit for some reason.
---
Isn't the flamer considered an energy weapon because of the type of damage it does? They're buffing energy weapons soon so maybe it will be included.
---
I recommend if you're unsure that some other player is hostile that you turn off pacifist mode.  
---
Also, maybe kindly ask them if they want to pvp or just claim the workshop. Remind them they can just server hop instead of griefing.
---
Well I tried to make sense of it all but the truth is my math might be off because I dont know if any of the drops are weighted. I have seen posts where guys listed all the drops they got and out of the hundreds listed it did seem like the drop tables were weighted. So unfortunately the odds might be worse than I even calculated. Lets hope we get a comment on this post from Bethesda, but considering it has been a full day i doubt we will.  
---
Yep that’s primarily how mine works but with 2😂  it got complicated running the wires through. I’ll take a video of it tomorrow if you’re interested.
---
I think they did say they were going to mark certain areas (like whitesprings) as no build zones. Hopefully they got the message about the charleston responder vendor bot spawn too.
---
I've been picking up some pretty good loot lately. Nothing major but the bloody weapons I got really helped me transition. Now I need some good armor. Just not willing to pay 15k caps. But maybe if I save up lol
---
This SO much, I'm actually paranoid when I scrap all junk now, I check junk for any bulk items and then I'm still gunshy about losing valuable mods too that I still dont trust it yet.
---
I don't do PVP because it's boring. 
---
I got the bounty from the "Get the Loot drop" miscellaneous quest that pops up now and then. When you open the loot drop you get a bounty for stealing. It's broken.
---
Well, they did have really good stuff! And fairly priced too. 
---
Hey, sounds to me like you did a good job and participated. Keep in mind: You're not alone there.  
---
If the others all of a sudden give up and you notice it's not going anywhere after 10 minutes, I'd recommend you pack your things and leave. Don't waste ammo for nothing.  
---
A couple of times ago, this happened and I ended up wasting 4k 5mm bullets for nothing. Plenty of Lv. 200+ players around but nope.
---
If you find a world with another player taking your spot just join it and block them. Then server hop. It makes you that much less likely to end up on the server with them again. The only time I don't block them is if their base consists of a stash box and a workbench or something really basic like that because they probably don't keep their base there full time.
---
Even if they were in a separate card stack, you still couldn't have them all active at any time, so you would still be swapping them out, no?
---
To clarify, I don't do PVP. The misc quest "Get the loot drop" is what gave me the bounty this time. Open the loot drop, get a 10 caps bounty. Great quest, even the loot is shit.
---
Xbox seems to have more bugs than PC. She's been tough to kill for a little while now. She often seems to scale to full hp and resistance no matter the group size. I'd recommend getting more people. I've had that bug happen before but stop about midway through the fight. I had to dump about 7k rounds of 50 cal most of which was ultracite to kill her with 3 other people earlier.

Well, you've got the edgy traders, griefers and then you have the guys who ignore you. Additionally, you have the people who have fun and drop stuff for you and help you, are nice to you, emote and even solmetimes accompany you a bit.  
---
I'd highly recommend you perhaps use your mic if you have one; I've met a couple of nice people like that and started a Discord "guild" if you could call it that. We are playing quite often now. We are on PC if you want to join. Don't be concerned about your level, we've got 1 or 2 starters as well.
---
Got one thanks and didn’t pay 6k for it lol 
---
So. Two 3 stars tonight. I let them both regen full. Got a 3 star cultist blade and 2 star unyielding leg. 
---
You sir may be on to something. More tests are needed! 👍
---
You need help man.
---
Try it out with a teammate. If you run faster, you're fine. It says the same for me (I'm on PC) but it works just fine. Sometimes it glitches out for some reason but oh well.  
---
Also, for some reason, my mutations aren't suppressed by RadAway or Rad-X.
---
I can make you grounded for free add me pc: Majistek
---
that is in about 9 hours and 30 minutes from now for those not timezone savvy.
---
You’re right lol, just tried playing again today, and I’d say it’s a 2.
---
Every time, drives me crazy
---
You'd still have to choose between which combat perks you have active for sure, as that would be game breaking otherwise, and you couldn't have all the weight reduction perks active certainly. 
---
But the botton line is when I'm in the field I don't want to have to switch out combat perks just to pick a lock and then switch back before that super mutant I can hear reaches me for example.
---
I would like to see a way to save builds. something like the blueprint system but for perks. this way we could potentially swap builds out between scavenging combat, camp, or workshop.
---
While I haven’t farmed legendaries that much, I have 260+ hours into this game and I can count on my two hands the number of times I’ve seen a legendary weapon more than 1*.
---
I like the Lever rifle over the hunting rile. Much faster rate of fire with the clip. also like to partially reload at a fast pace when I need that 1 extra shot I just pop in 1 bullet.
---
i prefer the Lever, actually i have almost all good variations, my fav is Instigating, if im in low heath i use bloodied, i also have the Anti armor explosive and the two shot explosive.
---
For hunting rifle, you can mod it to refined .50 the you can craft a lot more amo 100X against 12x from .308
---
Experiences may vary. 
---
Tip: Get the Calibrated Shocks mod/plans. They'll give you +50 Carry Weight per leg.
---
Some other users already answered some other things, I see.
---
Heyo, quick reminder: Pacifist mode doesn't prevent YOU from being shot. You can only not damage other players with it turned on. That could explain why you didn't do any damage?
---
LMAO I thought I'm the only one. Sucks but I guess we will have to deal with it somehow. I recommend you always build only the floor foundation first, blueprint it and then see what's up. Better check twice. Not that you build everything and there's still something clipping through. \*Like in my case at the moment.\*
---
Hey, unfortunately there's no way to turn that off. It's actually turned on through script in the game itself. Got no Creation Kit to do anything about it, so there's that.
---
I agree.  The SB Queen fights are the worst for me.  XB1
---
Just this past weekend, had one of the toughest fights because I was losing frames constantly.  
---
Then, to top it off I got disconnected just has the Queen was about to be killed.  Lost all the loot.  I rejoined off my friend but none of the loot spawned for me since I wasn't present for her death.  I nearly flipped my lid.  My friend calmed me down and said "you have to understand that this is just part of the game."  It would be nice if we didn't have to rationalize poor performance and bugs.  
---
I want to love this game, but it's difficult sometimes.  
---
Is that when the dlc comes out?
---
Really hammers home that explosive just isn't worth it anymore. Much rather have 25% fire rate or 10% while aiming
---
That is when the servers go down for the new DLC
---
Hopefully forever.
---
So true!!!!
---
Haha, funny how \*the guy\* has found this.  
---
If you've got any issues, let me know. Check out the linked reddit post. There's a video in it I made as well if you want that. It has a bit of explaining but I show you how to set it all up (minus Reshade).
---
I would like a "passive ability" card section. Like maybe throw crafting, hacking, lock picking and repairing in a separate section where you can equip 4 to 5 cards and not have to swap em out at all. For lock picking have X amount of perception required to equip a 3 level card into a passive slot. X amount of intelligence to equip weapon artisan as a passive card. Etc etc. not sure if I'm relating what's in my head properly. 
---
Ah sounds like a plan man 
---
You ever find out what the cooldown time is?
---
At the very least let us combine the 3 lockpick cards.
---
I go back and forth depending how I feel and try to keep it so my build can benefit from both sets. 
---
Yet the only salty ones are those who constantly go to Bethesda's posts and cry about Fallout 76 whike mentioning 5variius sweet lies Papa Yong has fed them.
---
Longer than 5 minutes. Possibly more than 10. I never found a definitive answer
---
I've been to plenty of SBQ fails and successes, and the obvious thing to me is that you can only win if you have multiple min-max players present. I say this because sometimes the SBQ goes down in only a minute or two, showing how powerful the min-maxers are. Other times there will be plenty of high-level players without min-max builds (like me), and after 30 minutes the SBQ is only 50% hurt. When the SBQ is in the air I use a legendary two-shot prime gatling gun with max heavy weapons perks, and when the SBQ is on the ground I use a legendary super sledge with max slugger perks (plus incisor &amp; martial artist). I also use the syringer to make the SBQ take extra damage, and sometimes use a two-shot cryolater to keep the SBQ on the ground. But that's not enough to kill the SBQ -- min-max players are required.
---
Yup, no walls at my camp means nothing for griefers to destroy.  Use my workbenches, admire my bearskin rug, take some water and move on.  Lvl 115 and have only had my camp messed with once by a guy who wouldn't take no for an answer for PVP.  Big elaborate builds just make you a target.
---
Set from 0 to 1; iPresentInterval=0 in your Fallout76Prefs.ini in your Documents folder. 
---
It's been addressed and the game runs fine uncapped, however there will probably be crappy performance in some areas, so I don't personally recommend you uncap it from 60.  
---
Btw, play fullscreen. Borderless/(Windowed) caps my framerate at 34 fps.  
---
Also, Tip: Cap the framerate at 59 if you've got a 60 fps cap. Prevents the VSync input lag. I use Afterburner's Riva Statistics Tuner for that.
---
While they're at make the healing perk work with plasma flamers
---
There's a note by a ghoul advertising a safe-haven for the afflicted. The note says it's in D.C., so it's most likely the Underworld from Fallout 3.
---
Even with melee not ranged?
---
Where does he randomly spawn at? I may need to try and find him tomorrow.
---
Prob not, the email said theyd finish taking orders by december and wouldnt take late ones, but you can most likely buy one when people sell them online atleast and it wont be for a lot
---
Should be Caps Lock. As Code Monkey said, in the bindings menu, press T and it should reset it all.
---
exactly this
---
This î.
---
I saw this guy lol
---
The PvP crowd is extremely toxic. It seems like every time I have a troll on these boards being toxic their post history always leads back to them being a PvP player.
---
A safe full of garbage items, most the safes and boxes I pick end up being empty. 😑
---
Man. I spent the better part of the day trying to get these plans server hopping with no luck. I should have been reading this sub while I was playing! 
---
Hmm didn't think of the .50 receiver. What's the diff in dmg vs hardened .308?
---
Oh yeah cause it all must be duped right, no possible other way to get these drops obviously /s
---
I figured. But thanks. Thats all i needed to know. 
---
What we need is a selection of interior walls. Plaster! Wallpaper! Different color smooth walls! A nice interior staircase with a cubbard space beneath it!   
---
Interior waaaaalllls...
---
Never noticed that thanks for the info
---
My friend was on pacifist, not me. I was under the impression Pacifist also caused your damage taken to be reduced.
---
I once had a rad rat horde send me to the reactor room of a nuke silo before. It didn't even drop a legendary item, and I couldn't get out of the silo after because of the security shit, and couldn't fast travel due to being in combat with robots, so I died in order to get out lol
---
There is I had one once. Can't remember what it's called though. Shoots green flames, was pretty cool. Sorry I am no help though

He randomly spawns in many locations throughout the map. I know he spawns near flatwoods, and by new gad also. I found him on the road about halfway between sunshine Meadows and point pleasant. He is one of many random encounters that can load and he doesn't seem to spawn as much as the others. If you search it on YouTube you can find some of the specific different spots. Then just cross your fingers and do a lot of server hopping.
---
Ooh, that’s rough buddy
---
DemonShadowDarkFrank420 agrees.
---
Currently, without certain number of TSE weapons, SBQ is still very hard to kill.
---
LMAO Mate, the only one who’s salty here is you. I wasn’t the one who made a whole post complaining about other people criticising the game. Stop taking criticism as a personal attack.  
---
Thanks a lot! I’ll have to look it up and hunt him down.
---
I would say yes. It is buggy though.
---
GTFOH
---
You've been trolling me all day on this post because I suggest Bethesda should soften bullet sponges a little bit........
---
Yet you're on bazaar trading for bloodied explosive handmade's and full sets of Unyielding Sentinel armor..... gear that nobody would have without duping.
---
Seriously......kick rocks bruh!!!!!!!

My man Fappy McFapperson agrees 100%

Since you only need to use the World Generator and meshes. Right.
---
Yes its a Barrel mod on the Plasma gun. Its how I have my AA Plasma Rifle setup. 
---
The floating foundations are the key. Google foundation stacking, and then you can float anything off them. 
---
If you’re ok with tethering to the ground, you can place the generators using either the rug or campfire trick (once again, google).

No, sorry on Xbox

Especially with melee. The amount of damage those highly melee spec'd builds can do is absurd. They easy can get in the thousands for damage. 
---
I think this comes from duplicating things in the Creation Kit and forgetting to change the actor name. lol
---
haha that's good
---
The current game mode will stay the same so means that griefers will still be able to do what they are doing now. 
---
The new PvP servers will mean that most PvP players will move into them, although griefers will remain because they will want to pick on people who aren't suspecting PvP. 
---
Pretty much, owning workshops opens you up to PvP. 
---
This is so true I’m level 80 on the same level as a 200. 
---
Also, don't worry. Seems to be more of an interface bug. However, as SteelerSwins said, it's Strange In Numbers.
---
Rather than uselessly commenting "this", you should try adding something to the thread.  If you agree with someone's comment, simply upvote them.
---
This post epitomizes my theory that most people in this sub are children
---
I thought of doing this but I wanted a resource, how is it against monsters?
---
Where did you get the barrel mod?
---
Please, don't reapply mutations. I had the same and it turned out to be Strange In Numbers being completely buggy.  
---
Gives me a dramatic damage nerf and it sucks.  
---
The mutation not showing the effect correctly in the Pip Boy is an interface bug.
---
I think the same. Nevermind the stuff he puts out.
---
I asked a stranger to kill me naked.
---
Yeah, and when doing "news" especially in a niche, you have to get content out fast to stay relevant at all. When you have to be on the hottest topics, you're already going to be a little behind, and doing extra research, or fact checking, can slow everything down a whole lot. Especially if you're solo.
---
I'm really just wishing there was a way to destroy what I've built rather than allowing griefers to steal it. If griefers want to take and hold workshops but then detonate them when contested, they are still destroying what they have built. A self destruct button would mean:
---
"you can have the workshop, but FU!"
---
I’ve seen his videos and he doesn’t seem that bad at all. Everyone says he is sensationalist but I haven’t really seen that.. all I can say is he obviously dislikes certain companies like EA.
---
I didn't know I needed one until now.
---
Let's upvote the bot. :)
---
The video he made saying that Bethesda went back on its promise to not have pay to win loot boxes because the game has random nearly insignificant perks for outfits 1 week at a time was waaay too much for me. I unsubbed right then. He’s just petty and jumping on the hate Fallout 76 train... I don’t think anybody listens to it anymore. FO 76 is great, if you don’t like it then shut up and don’t play it, I don’t need to hear about it. 
---
Im pretty sure you can get it from just breaking down enough plasma guns
---
This happens to me IRL when I am grocery shopping and go into V.A.T.S to look at my list, but whenever an attractive female is on screen it just zooms straight to them.

i've only had that happen with scortchedbeast

That's nuts! That shouldn't happen.
---
That cave is actually learned about the excavator suits mining bonus. I’m loaded with lead and crystal

Haha, no. Don't worry. I thought the same until I realized it doesn't. lol

It only prevents you from accidentally hurting other players or their workshop objects.

I want a X-01 Arm mod that gives your unarmed attacks an open palm blaster that is actually a flamer, see Iron Man.

I always thought it was either bugged or based on which region like a zone quest.

The gatling plasma has this mod too. I have it on mine and it just melts enemies. Cant wait for the energy weapons buff. Going to use it constantly
---
Lmao look just because you say it’s duped doesn’t mean it is, and just because it’s a good piece doesn’t mean it’s duped either. I’ve never duped but I’m sure as hell not gonna buy a really good item just because it’s ‘suspiciously good’ , especially when everyone else is buying them.
---
Just copy &amp; paste "10:00 a.m. EDT" into google, it will show you what time it will be in your timezone as long as it's able to determine it.
---
Yeah that's true, I dont think it should increase the chances too much, could also account for only the weapon types you recently used.  Like if you had just been trying out the new heavy rail gun for 2 days in a row the chance goes up a bit on heavy.

Ghoul officers haunt me... They get me everywhere and don't drop there code.. Until the next server and they spawn at my feet.

The community doesn't need the guy with God roll weapons and armor telling us how easy the game is.

Piss off.

Nah.. OP is more original 
---
I’ve got 1k in game hours, but yeah of course I shouldn’t have what I have, makes sense. How about just git gud, because I’m betting no amount of god rolls would make you worth a damn. Can’t even 1 shot a fucking super mutant, that’s pathetic. Anyone with decent dmg and a sneak headshot can 1 shot a super mutant, your build is likely garbage.
---
How'd you get that mod? I've had a gatling plasma for over a month and haven't found any mods for it. I've even scrapped 4 or 5 gatling plasmas but no mods popped up. Even the Vault doesn't list any mods for the gun.
---
My experience says yes
---
No "have a day?"
---
lov u manz #nohomo
---
220 hours in, all good experiences.
---
I have only been shot once &amp; that was because I was wrongly convicted of a crime and became wanted.
---
Just keep scrapping. Theres not a whole lot of mods for it, so learning mods is very rare. I actually didnt even put it on mine because i havnt learned it. Had a buddy put it on there for me. Im sure if you searched reddit, summon could hook you up.
---
Cool
---
Nice, that means by time I get home from work it should be done. Unless it takes more than 10 and a half hrs, but i highly doubt it will take anywhere near that time.
---
Same, haven't found one either, but it's also hard to find lots to scrap without buying them... Should really get the plans!
---
Where's the body Wrackoon? WHERE DID YOU HIDE THE BODY! 
---
After 700 hours played, I started a new character  yesterday.  Murdered  8 times so far.  Which makes zero sense.  I’m  lvl 5-10.  They’re gaining absolutely nothing in caps or junk.
---
At least my team on their mains (lvl 160+) are making some caps ;)
---
Try the enclave shop, you can sometimes find the true flamer mod there for plasma weapons, or do enclave events and sometimes you'll get one.
---
I thought this is what that bulldoze feature was supposed to allow :/ just another disappointment as a builder.
---
Exactly. I have the plans, just havnt made it that far on my list of guns to scrap. Been working on .50 cal machine gun. Still havnt got the barrel mod for it, driving me insane. Probably have scrapped 50 or more.
---
I've got a lowly 2* bloodied black powder rifle with 50% VATS critical damage. I can sneak + VATS critical more than 50% of the health power of a level 80 scorch beast.
---
Just because I can one shot a super mutant doesn't mean it's not a waste of my time to sneak around 1 shot killing 20 non legendary super mutants.
---
All of my gear is legit drops bro.
---
The fact that you have 1,000 hours in 4 months says all we need to know about you. You're not gud......you fucking suck..... that's why you're playing Fallout 76 and not a real PvP game and that is why you need to trade for duped gear to crutch on.

I only lock away 5 things total.  I have behind one door my generator, a personal purified water supply, my decon arch, and a laser turret.  Behind the other is the access to my missile turret.  The rest of my camp is open and there is a public supply of purified water as well.  I've encountered a few griefers and this way they get a nasty surprise if they try to mess with my things.
---
I'm going to remove the locks to everything but my personal water supply once pacifist mode applies to camps.  
---
I don't have a problem opening up the arch when I'm around but I don't want to give anyone who thinks it's funny to damage or destroy someone's hard work an easy target.  I'll probably redesign part of my camp so it's more open after pacifist mode applies to it.

How do people get this much stuff.

I was beginning to wonder if I was the only one experiencing this. They had fixed it so that bulk didn't auto scrap and auto unbundled to use for building, but 1 or 2 updates ago when they broke everything they fixed previously this was one of the issues that cropped back up. They fixed all the other issues 2 days later in a hotfix, but didn't fix the auto scrapping bulk. I was going to say something, but I haven't seen anyone else mention it and to me it is a pretty major issue. I've wasted so much plastic accidentally scrapping all while holding bulk to sell.
---
I certainly hope so
---
lol  
---
I remember the first time I encountered a wanted player. When I got there (only ever got rid of a wanted player once for the atoms cus of the challenge) and once I got there, after doing my thing, I heard little kids yell into the mic. I was level 20 at the time and the wanted kid was level 10 or so.
---
It's a possibility. lmao  
---
What I do now is I actually approach wanted players who are below my level (I'm lv. 106 now) and I ask them in the voicechat what they did. Most of the time I'm told they tried lockpicking a container that was still somehow within range of an owned workshop. I end up dropping them stuff like legendaries in case someone comes for them and grabs their junk so they can make up for it with some caps.
---
App 350 hours played and never got explosive on any weapon drop... a lot of 1* bloodied though... including the epic bloodied rolling pin
---
What games? I honestly can’t think of anything else I’ve paid for that was worse.
---
I don’t play a whole lot of games though.
---
They should be in your inventory you have to use them to learn them
---
Except that sometimes during the event Bots on Parade the spawning mobs will show up as friendly. It doesn't happen all the time, but it happens frequently enough that I'm thankful that we can actually target friendlies (even though they shouldn't show up as such).
---
That's a welcome feature for combat (sneak build, heavy build, gun slinger, etc.) but doesn't address this issue at all. 
---
Having to swap loadouts to pick, hack, loot, and sell would be just as annoying. 
---
I think I get it, and I dig it. 
---
Like every five points in PER unlocks one passive slot. So at 15 PER you can fuck with three passives. Same for every other special. You still have to pick which to use, but you don't have them competing with combat perks
---
i think i did that but will have to check.  Where does it go after that? is it in blue prints?
---
\-2 in dmg only, of course is the refined .50

Juicehead has largely lost me as a viewer. 
---
"Reported" on speculation one time too many for me.
---
Now even his titles make me scoff. He can't title them reasonably. It's like he can't help himself, he needs to sensationalize every single one. 
---
"76 has new content dropping? It's been delayed? Juicehead probably has a video on the situation, I'll check that out....."
---
"Oh. Here it is. 'IS IT TIME TO REINSTALL 76.....(for the DLC)"
---
I like how the mention of the DLC I'm looking for info on, was so important in a video about that DLC, that it's mention in the title was relegated to brackets like an after thought. 
---
I look forward to his future titles like:
---
"BETHESDA TAKES MONEY FROM LOCAL MAN......... (He was purchasing Fallout 76)"
---
AND
---
BETHESDA ANNOUNCES THE SHUTDOWN OF ALL FALLOUT 76 SERVERS............. (.............).............(...[temporarily to implement new patch]...)
---
Furious, instigating or bloodied handmade do the job amazing, 2 shot most mobs.
---
I love this suggestion. I always support it when it's posted by whomever. 
---
I call it the "Let my character be godly at everything at anytime with no penalty"
---
Who needs multiple save slots when your build can do everything, all the time. 
---
if u are on xbox i can sell a bloodied hunting to you
---
Isolate them on separate servers and don't activate the DLC on those servers for a week. 
---
Honestly I think luck plays a part. Been farming weapons for days and decided to go bloodied over the weekend. Now I'm crafting with super duper maxed and adding a mod or two. Seems to unlock mods faster when upgraded. But I'm doing weapons but I would imagine the same goes for armor. Keep scrapper on to help 
---
That’s a good way for griefers to get away with anything the account name means if you be a dick it will come back to you but if you have just character name you can get away with anything because it’s not hard to change a name or start a new character 
---
Gotta agree with you. Sometimes you go through hell and you get nothing. 
---
The reason why this is good is because it forces you to reflect on your experience for its worth, not the reward. That way, next time something amazing happens. It feels even more worth it. A grand step on the path.

Welcome back.  Most of us really are cool people and don't mean any harm.  As has been mentioned there are a few clowns\jerks around but they are a pretty small minority. 
---
I'm pretty sure PA negates all other armor, same with the hazmat.  It seems dumb as UA should apply because why couldn't you wear it UNDERNEATH your clothing?  I could be wrong, but the few points UA gives you won't usually matter when choosing between power or normal armor.  For unarmored builds it could be big, but I only roll a hazmat in nuke zones; won't let me equip UA.  
---
I don't think they are gone forever, but are being vaulted. Every character in this game was once in a vaulted, and are now not, pretty sure they will roll them back out during slow times or special events.
---
Ya I enjoy this game, but it feels that you completely skipped massive shit parts of this game, and Bethesda is to be criticized for this game, because it was a glitchy mess for months in end, and still is for the most part. I know you'll probably just say I'm a "toxic hater", but you can't ignore the state of this game.
---
Lmao a lowly rifle, if you knew anything you would know those 2 effects together are farrr from lowly. 
---
So you don’t want to farm? That’s not Bethesda’s problem lol. 
---
And no one is crutching just because of good gear in PvP unless they are fighting people who also don’t know what they are doing. Any build in PvP has several weaknesses, you name it and I’ll tell you. Just because you’re an idiot and can’t read and learn enough to git gud doesn’t mean you complain and whine that other people are so much better just because they must have duped gear. No it’s because you suck. 
---
And if you want to talk job or gym let’s do it, but if we’re talking job we’re talking six figures and if we’re talking gym we’re taking 4 45lb plates each side for squats. Come at me.
---
I think scrapping gives the mod for the helmet?
---
The negative reviews are about the downright unplayable state of the game. I don't think you should ignore constant crashes, and glitches.
---
I wonder when the critics will come around. Something tells me 2 major patches in we will start hearing, "Good Job, guys. Thanks to our constant criticism of Bethesda we have made Fallout 76 an enjoyable game." I don't think I have heard a single constructive comment out of any of them now that I think about it. It's generally just glitchy mess, boring, rip off, or something something canvas bag. It's funny, they always go on about how boring and uninspired it is, but that's so fucking hypocritical coming from people that post the same fucking videos, with same fucking themes, and same fucking thumbnails. 
---
Or drop a paper bag
---
Ohhh only the helmet?
---
I actually dont  use snipers in any fallout game.
---
But hunting rifle always will be used, or atleast always one in my inventory.
---
Really like my legendary quad lever action rifle, and probably will put a long range scope on.
---
Go into notes and read the plan.   Go into build mode and you will see the warehouse materials appear under the same tabs as your other building materials. 
---
Happens on xbox constantly. 
---
So the DLC will not be something we have to pay extra for? Cause that'd be great. 
---
Make it a pvp free zone lol
---
Okay, what is the file size expected to be for the update. This is my first update
---
I check when I can get on next. Thanks 
---
Which serums?
---
I kissed a girl.
---
YOUTUBERS BAD! BETHESDA GOOD! 
---
Just heard about yongyea and subbed. Seems like an interesting news channel 
---
You play Fallout 10 hours a day bro. I wouldn't be surprised if you could squat 405....... that's probably not even 1.5x your body weight..... LOL
---
If you want to be a professional gamer go play a balanced game that is skill based. Nobody wants to watch you dominate level 50 players with mix n match armor with your duped gear.
---
I agree100%. I only build/craft stuff to help me along. Was never in to camp building or complaining about someone trashing my stuff. Learned early on a nice camp costs too much. 
---
Once you use the plan, the item itself is gone. The warehouse walls should be unlocked, sometimes the game is a little weird about it, try fast travelling away and back or jumping servers. 
---
If you're in build mode and you don't see the warehouse walls at all, you might have hit a button and hidden any plans you can't build (either bc lack of materials or you didn't learn the plans.) On Xbox you click the right stick, I'd guess PS4 is the same, you're on your own if you're on PC.
---
But really when its coming out?
---
How much for the weightless marine peices?
---
That may be it. i have been looking for an actual warehouse not the walls etc. Thanks. I'm on ps4  so i'll check.
---
My question while scrapping everything manually for weeks...Is bulk scrap in s.t.a.s.h also scrapped to parts again?
---
Or is it only effecting bulked scrap i carry in my inventory?
---
I keep trying. They never reply 
---
Healing
---
I would shit my pants if that happened. What platform?
---
I was going to suggest this until i read your comment.
---
I have an extra, I'm donezo for tonight but after the update tomorrow I'll be on. Message me on here anytime past noon to remind me!
---
That might be because duping has made a return (at least on xbox). I ran into two people with multiple sets of very rare gear sets in stacks today. When confronted one of them asked if I was there for their duping services. Disgusting
---
I agree. It’s redundant and very annoying to have to switch back and forth between rifleman and three lockpick cards every minute, I skip over a lot of locked boxes and doors because it breaks up the flow of the game too much. Maybe they could just cost zero special points? Then they could stay in the stack without eating up space.
---
Oh yeah no it's just another set of walls. And it should tell you what button to hit when you pull up build mode, I'm actually not sure it was the right stick. I know it's also the sprint button because I'm constantly hitting it in build mode and wondering why I'm not actually sprinting.
---
That's great. Thing is; I'm on PC but I'm good. Thank you very much! Gonna keep using my Bloodied Lever Action Rifle until I get the drop. Let's hope for the best. :)
---
Tired of wood legs. lol
---
More experience I think. 
---
For events, it can sometimes be a rare item drop. The Nailer only drops from One Violent Night if you complete the optional objective (beat the Wendigo to death with your bare hands). 
---
You’re still godly if all you have to do is switch cards around to perform any task. It’s just pointlessly time consuming. 
---
It's a game sub not a place for tired cheap karma whoring YT jokes
---
Do what makes you happy. 
---
Will do.
---
I'm starting to suspect that maybe some Raiders got a little fresh with the local Radscorpions and that all our problems are being caused by some sort of hybrid abomination that still counts as a Raider but can burrow under the ground. 
---
You had leechers. If everyone pulls their weight 30 minutes is plenty, but some lowbie bring like 100 ammo with no melee weapon to the fight then they run out and stand there hoping no one notices. Melee is incredibly important to fight her imo, not just for ammo efficiency but it out damages ranged weapons by a lot. 
---
Was on a server that killed her in under two minutes the other day, as soon as she landed there were about 10 people in power armor sitting on her ass spamming power attacking her, literally died in about 30 seconds after she landed. A good bloodied adrenal reaction melee build is devastating with all the armor pen that Incisor grants.
---
You are my favorite vendor btw all my friends love me and want me to get more serums from you. We are all old guys who don't partake in social media except for me. You have made their playing much more exciting. We thank you and they want more serums lol
---
1. Tag Plastic so that every item which contains Plastic has an hourglass.
---
2. Change worlds by going to Social menu, select your name, pick Leave World.  This changes what items the Vendors have, but it does not change current cap amount.  Good way of finding cheap plastic items or even ultracite.
---
i do not agree.
---
all i want is to see the perk system streamlined because it is currently tough to use with the bloat of everyyyyyyyy card sitting in the field, especially as you are level 200 or 300. 
---
let us store cards out of the fiield, just like storing things we have constructed into camp. 
---
let upgrading not result in the extra combining prompt. instead just skip one of the level ups required and give level 2 without losing level 1, one click, done. now i can store whchever level i dont regularly use (i use marathoner 1 or 3 but the 2 is just in my way, for example
---
finally i want a separate perk panel for selecting bobble or magazine boosts, with a usable system perhaps customized by how much i have in luck (where we currently have most of the bobble/mag relevant utility) and no more eating them, this is another form of bloat that could be streamlined to make this gameplay element as strong as it could be with the way the core design vision is, i have fun doing it, i just want some streamlines and improvements
---
Nothing in the AAA space that guy must have a taste for mobile games...
---
Eww, cooties.
---
Even if they were to just separate the stack of cards would be better. All the combat cards are at the top and than have a space that's maybe 1/4 or less of the height of the cards and than have the passive, and crafting perk cards below that. I think it would make the perk swapping a little easier.
---
lol thanks! appreciate it
---
I've never seen this and I wish I had. I've lost multiple chances to loot legendary robots in Watoga because the corpse does that exploding thing and then flies randomly off somewhere like into tall grass or a crevasse and it can be impossible to find. 
---
Only people who bring him up are krama whores and scapegoaters. Grow the fuck up and stop wasting space your your fucking spam.
---
Only bulk scrap in your inventory
---
no, it rewards muscle memory, and the human experience of routine.
---
it literally fits the EXACT gameplay tactile element needed for a game to stimulate the part of our minds that has made every classic game classic.
---
Leechers are the scourge of this game friend. My rule of thumb is I got to a SBQ and give it my all for aroun 5-10 mins. If it hasnt regenerated health by the 20 mark, then its probably going to be not worth it.
---
On another note, atleast wait a week. A major update comes out in like 10 hours give or take. Its first content addition. The game started bad, but I gotta give them credit. They are trying and trying hard. We are now at the point the game should've been released at and getting new stuff.
---
It could be worse. Look at how activision is absolutely fucking Black Ops 4 players for every dollar. Their "seasonal content" costs 20 bucks. But I digress.
---
Top 10 gltich there for sure. 
---
So you exclusively play shit games.

Man you sure showed him!

2.Bathesda.net account - IHBM
---
3. Maybe i can upload later if necessary
---
4.I here to report another bugs and problems that are very anoying and interfere with my game. Obviously this game is full with bugs and problems.
---
 4.1.For some reason the game does not allow us to play in a team, after i accept my friend inventation to join in team he not show up and we cant play in team.
---
 4.2.Another bug we have found when we played with my friend is that I was invisible to my friend and he could not see me even though I was in front of him. Then he became invisible to me and I could not see him.it happens quite often and the only way to fix it if I get out of the game and come back again.
---
 4.3.When I pick up a weapon similar to my favorite weapon, the game also marks it as a favorite and it appears instead of my favorite weapon when I press the corresponding key for that weapon. For example one of my favorite weapons is TSE hanmade , when i  pick up new handmade even if it is not legendary, this gun becomes automatically favorite and it appears instead of my favorite weapon.
---
 4.4.After i finish  scorchbeast queen event no loot from the queen's corpse. Sometimes corpse is emty,sometimes i waited for the loot to load(constant loading screen)  and the body eventually disappeared after few minutes. This happens very often too.This is very annoying because it was one of the best events in the 
---
game and now it is useless to do it (I just waste my munitions and time).
---
If that's 350 with a high RoF ranged weapon, then you're good to go. It'll take a ton of ammo, but you'll be contributing. If that's melee, perhaps just stick to the adds and keep the battlefield clear for the heavy hitters. 
---
Both my characters are blooded. My main uses melee against the queen and swings a super sledge for 2k+ damage per hit. Even with it, it's slow going if I'm the only min-max there. I have two others I've done it with though and we can kill her in about 3-5 minutes together. 
---
My alt is a bloodied rifleman.  With 10% health and a sneak multiplier, his damage per shot is over 3k (more if Mr Sandman is active) but he's quite fragile and needs to stay hidden. 
---
2pm GMT.
---
PS4
---
Lol what!! 
---
Everyone keeps asking for perk-modifying features to get around the fact that what we really are asking for is permanent perks. You know, just like every other Fallout game had?
---
The FO76 system feels like they took the FO4 system and fucked with it long enough to make it different, but not long enough to make it *better*. Honestly a permanent perk system like FO4 would just be more enjoyable overall.
---
If you can swap out any time, then there's no benefit to multi-build swapping system compared to a permanent system that lets you unlock everything like FO4 had.
---
And allow us to separate other perks to make changing your build quicker
---
Sorry I've got no idea if you're still active in this thread.
---
I'm using an ancient Mecer 32" with 1360x768 native resolution as my Windows 10 designated primary monitor. My secondary is a small 18". 
---
When I choose full screen the game displays FO76 off screen to the right. It has about 1/5th of the window off screen.
---
Most other games work well with the primary screen, only one or two have the off screen issue, but can be fixed by going through settings until they recenter. FO76 just doesn't. Ever. Unless windowed.
---
Do you happen to know of a solution? 
---
So I basically have to hope I find an empty server since I can’t play offline? When does the queen decide how much of a bullet sponge she wants to be? Why can she even scale to the point where you’ve wasted an hour launching a nuke and fighting?
---
Is the update going to add any endgame content?
---
Servers will  be down around 10 a.m EDT
---
(Just google and it will show the correct time frame)
---
Thats around 15:00 pm at the Netherlands/Holland.
---
Sadly not in the morning, but not complaining either.
---
Just crossing fingers the dlc will drop, without to much bugs and/or errors
---
Yep. My lvl 60 alt is more viable in PvP (and ranged combat in general) than my 270 main.  
---
Heyo, yes. I'm still around.
---
Can you go to your Fallout76Prefs.ini and paste whats written in there? I think I might already know what's up.
---
Mods can unlock on any armor pieces regardless of what piece you salvage. Also, mods are specific to armor weight when unlocked. 
---
Yes. Cavalier and sentinel are both tertiary effects. Chameleon is a primary effect. They can drop on the same piece. 
---
From my experience, weapon is almost 1:1. Armor is like 1 mod per 20 salvage or more. 
---
Correct - you are not expected to pay for the upcoming content expansions.
---
Yea I thought so but I haven’t seen one personally 
---
There was someone on PS4 named fukyourban
---
Honestly at this point only 3 you-tubers are worth watching Angry Joe, Jim Sterling and It'sagundam they pretty much tell it how it is and all 3 actually \*do\* research     
---
If you get the "Cant place because floating" when you try to move your base, no option but to start again.
---
That's cus drop chances being set to ridiculous low amounts. It's not like a legendary has a 100% of dropping an item. I checked a couple of weeks ago and it was definitely not 100%. It's bad luck. Happens sometimes but can't do anything about it. Nothing on your end that's wrong though; I assure you.  
---
Bear with it until we get the Creation Kit released and those things can be fixed. One of the first things I'll do. lol
---
Not sure if it’s this update, but Vault Raids are coming and so is a continuation of the main quest. 
---
Tomorrow? 0.0
---
Here’s my issue with this. Fallout isn’t about the endgame, it never has been and never will be. Even if this game is formatted as an “MMO” type game. You need to not play it as an mmo because it doesn’t have a great endgame, fallout has always been about the journey and adventure getting to the end. 
---
I like to farm them in my 4 hour play and leave all of them in at least every popular train station. Mailbox, luggage, cooler, etc... So if you are on PS4 From 8p-12a PDT. Check there maybe I was on your server who knows? I Leave all my used ones in Grafton.
---
Number of players should not matter, yes she scales with them but if it's anything like monster scaling in other games she probably doesn't scale exactly in proportion to player numbers. Most games add like 90% HP per player so if each player pulls their weight she should be easier to kill.
---
The problem is when you get more players you get more leeches, it's just the nature of playing on a open server with any levels. Yes if that lvl 30 sees the nuke drop he's going to want in on the loot, and you can't blame him for it you'd likely do the same.
---
TL;DR it's basically random since random people with random items and random builds are on each server.
---
I've heard some people say they check the map for player levels before launching but that seems like it would only help so much to me, plus you can't see crouching players on the map. 
---
It's like Jim Sterling, but actually bad at his job.
---
Today I got 1 shot by someone 20 lvls higher than me, he was also wearing a winter festival mask (Not available in the game yet) and immediately after that him and his lvl 250 friend were attacking my workshop, and spawnkilling me before I could even load in to the game after dying (they found out where my fast travel target/respawn point was) 
---
So yeah, I know the frustration
---
You need the plans for the prime receiver for you type of weapons to use ultracite ammo
---
You need the prime receiver mod for your gun.
---
Thanks man... Any ideas how or where to get it? I've never even seen on at ANY vendor...
---
I honestly have stopped watching him entirely. I just couldn’t stand that his channel is dedicated to Bethesda games and he can’t even pronounce it, as if there was a shortageof sources on the pronunciation (including official). His constant bitching also doesn’t help.
---
“Beatheasdha” smh
---
All \*I\* can say is that I'm pretty sure it's not based on your Luck attribute. I'm very sure the way they set this up is that it's from a list of items and it just gives you whatever items and it's probably a 0-25% chance of getting anything from it.
---
Killing the scorchbeast/scorch beast queen are the only way for prime plans.
---
  Thank you... Any advice on how to go aboot this? I havent even seen one for any gun, at any time, anyhwere in the world.
---
They are rare. May be only scorch beast drops.
---
&gt; That's drop chances being set to ridiculous low amounts. 
---
There is only so long that gamers will flog a dead horse. Bethesda want to nerf all these different things maybe they should nerf the incentive to continue playing.
---
Thats depressing, Ive killed several schorchbeats, never the Queen, though, and in actuality get junk in return considering the amount of resources spent on those bullet sponges.
---
If you crafted that ammo yourself, you must have unlocked one of the prime receivers for one of the .44 guns. You may want to check if you can mod a prime receiver on a .44 or a Western Revolver. 
---
Thanks for the help...
---
Who'd have thought that this post would have brought a metric assload of people onto you for purposefully missing the point of a game
---
the problem is deleting one of them.
---
„please enter the name of the character you want to delete“ is one of the many crazy design choices who should not have made it to an official release
---
It's say 3 pm Paris time on main menu for me. If i remove 6 hours for for New York time I get 9 am.
---
  Yeah he's a drama Queen... Anyone ever notice how he himself is even bored of his content?  Hes not commited in any way to the pessimism he preaches...
---
Just join a group of people.
---
As long as you hit the beast and it dies. You will still get the loot, even if someone else kills it.
---
What system are you on? I’m on PS4 and I have the plans for .44 prime receiver and can mod your gun for you if you have some materials. I’m missing 2 pure violet flux. 
---
IDK but I have several friends who used their real names setting up the accounts lol. They sure wish it would display the character names instead. 
---
  Ah shit bud, I'm on XBOX...
---
Ah drats hopefully someone can help you out!
---
WOW. It was so toxic here just a couple of weeks back. lol. It was just like night and day. Bethesda finally patched the toxic out LOL. .
---
 I did the event once but there were only 6 of us and she didn't die in time... I guess she got bored and took off for taco bell drive thru...
---
I'll do 50 each.
---
I assume you're on console?
---
This doesn't bother me whatsoever. I don't really care if what I am killing is legendary or not nor what it drops.
---
PLEASE
---
There was a mod called Perk Loadout Manager that did this but apparently Bethesda broke it.
---
Had one drop. Sold it awhile back [https://imgur.com/a/5mi2hZZ](https://imgur.com/a/5mi2hZZ)
---
Lol. Nah it will happen, but 6 ppl is way way way to small of group to take down the S.B.Q. 
---
You need a good hand full of high levels to do the heavy lifting.
---
A group of 4 or 6 ppl are better for taking down a reg scorched beast.
---
And the drop rate for good stuff isnt high. Your gonna have grind though a couple SBQ to find what you are looking if you dont wanna pay someone for it.
---
To that point, I did all the main quests and most of the events before I quit for 2 months. The ‘adventure’ for me has been a constant lack of screws, and a full stash making me throw things out.
---
I came back because the only major thing I hadn’t done was kill the queen, and instead was left standing amongst a pile of scorched mirelurks and stuff as she flew away with my weapon durability.
---
For armor it seems like effects are in tiers and you can’t have 2 from the same tier. Cav and Sent are both in the same tier. I don’t think you’ll get one with both of these effects on 1 item. 
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_legendary_armor_effects
---
Sacrifice a set of d20s to please the gods of the RNG.
---
Quad handmade , people tend to freak out when you're pumping out 80 5.56 rounds non stop, add anti armor, a pinch of stagger and  you got yourself a Rifle masters stew going.
---
Where do you find the plan with the camp plans...like furniture, floor, etc...I have plan but can't find how to make
---
Because i want bethesda to learn their lesson 
---
The entire perk card system smells like it was created for lootbox style microtransactions, which were later pulled and turned into the perk card packs you get every five levels. They also probably didn't think people would gain levels this quickly (which has been visible in other parts of the game as well). Combined, these two effects create the perk card system issues we're having today.
---
In the probable planned scenario you wouldn't have as many perk cards, so there'd be little to no management as you'd pretty much only have the cards for your specific build unless you had paid for perk card packs or reached very high levels.
---
I'm sure swapping configurations as needed sounded good, but allowing it anywhere, anytime funnily enough makes it more laborious. Imagine if you could (and had ever could) only change your perks in your camp. Yes, suggested now that everyone is used to being everything everywhere just a few clicks away it may sound horrible, but gamewise it would give you more meaningful choices. Do you take picklock and hacker perks with you? Or would you rather have that extra damage for your rifle? Are you going to sell things this run? Are you expecting radiation enough that you should take starched genes to protect your mutations in case you need to use radaway? This small change would give the player more meaningful choices and pretty much eliminate the card swapping, as few would go to the trouble to fast travel to and from/reposition their camp all the time. No, you couldn't be your optimal character all the time, but isn't that the point of choice?
---
I asked that weird, let me rephrase. How far into the fight do I have to get before the queen is locked in at the scaling she is going to be? I’m giving it another go tomorrow, but if she scales every time someone else joins the event for the whole fight there won’t be a point.
---
  You sir are the saving grace, thats exactly it, I have to fit a western revolver with the prime receiver.  Even though the .44 pistol is the same I dont have the plan or mod for the corresponding prime reciever for it.  Thank you so much.  This really is a helpful community
---
They work if you favorite them and launch them from the quick bar.
---
I'll have to try that then. Never could get them to work from the pipboy. This is good to know. 
---
Probably so you can tell the difference between your characters
---
Thx
---
Hmm, ok good points.  Thanks.   I can see there could be a faction system where the members could build a guild-hall then.
---
And there you have the root of a lot of the "issues" paving Fallout 76. People have their own ideas on what makes a fallout game a fallout game, and have been bitching since day one of announcement. Never mind the fact that a multiplayer fallout has been wanted since Van Buren was in development and then cancelled, no, everyone has to bitch because the game launched with no NPCs IN A STORY THAT IS CLEARLY GOING TO PROGRESS TO HAVING THEM BUT IT MAKES SENSE TO NOT YET. These morons are the prime example of "tell, don't show" storytelling, where they need everything IV dripped into them in a blurry confusing mess like Fallout 3, to the point where you can't even remember why you're doing in that game, you just are. In 76, the rare times you get a quest in comparison (which, granted, is a slight problem, they didn't find their sweet spot between low amount of quests to actually give immersion and enough quests to stay varied) you actually remember why you're doing things. And for the story itself, it's literally everywhere if you're willing to actually take a second to look. The holotapes have character, tell story, and paint a picture of a world that had hope but was ruined by a force beyond the player's compression. 
---
So you're mad that people are still playing a game they like because you want them to stop playing the game to make you happy?
---
As far as I understand, there are only a handful of games that are mouse/keyboard compatible. Any other title, you're going to need a third party device to play with m/k.
---
Glad the mystery is solved. 
---
Good points. But the risk is much greater reduced if you drop off junk before going into Nuke zone.  Players will always loot your stuff there and have more incentive to kill you (for hardened mass).  Plus there is a stash inside the whitesprings hotel.
---
Ignorant YouTubers who sensationalise bad. Actually doing your own research on a game and finding the positives and negatives by asking genuine players (such as the posts on this subreddit that've done the same) good.
---
FTFY.
---
^this. You probably unlocked the mod for light armor and are trying to mod a heavy piece. The DR and ER will be different on the 2 pieces.
---
Wait... what? 
---
You are in the minority then. Although, I’m jealous I guess, because all I do is farm three places and hope against astronomical odds I’ll find what I’m looking for in a drop—game has become less fun and very repetitive / disappointing... you don’t seem to have that problem.
---
She scales actively depending how many people show up. People that show up but don’t pull any weight but tag her and wait around hoping you kill her is only going to make it harder for you. Don’t launch a nuke solo and expect a full server of properly geared people to show up. If you want real end game fun with the right folks join some groups of active queen hunters on discord 
---
Not really punishing?  Just starting off everyone on equal terms?
---
A new mode is being introduced specifically for Player VS Player.  Shouldn't you give everyone an equal opportunity to play in it?
---
Either you guys are more unoriginal than I thought, or there's way less of you than it seems and you just have multiple accounts. Someone already said that exact same dumb rhetoric.
---
Yeah what I meant was for there to be native m/k support for fo76. I've always had an easier time in first person if I can use a mouse.
---
Close enough
---
This looks amazing! Could u provide where that place is on the map? I'd like to make my own little camp there \^\^
---
It seems to work by rolling against each scrap mod that you don't already have, so when you have few mods remaining the chances are much lower. Weapon chances allegedly vary from 5% to 20%, except the Radium Rifle which is much lower.
---
Armor seems more like 1% to 0.5% per mod. Expect to scrap 100-200 pieces for a decent chance at the last mod.
---
BoS material can't be unlocked by scrapping, except for the helmet. Some of the plasma flamer barrels are unlockable though. Ref: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ZhGrawX03LlZtS9smKLqcC2LT875f5V\_qPFefn79OM/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ZhGrawX03LlZtS9smKLqcC2LT875f5V_qPFefn79OM/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#)
---
No. I want to block every griefers out there in its entirety - accounts and all.
---
Probably his alt character.. I swap my duplicate plans and armour to my other character. Mutations too. Makes being a level 25 a lot more fun 👍👍
---
Not the case. I have bos arms/legs/torso and I can mod any version of combat armor into bos
---
Likely his mule toon.
---
He talks a lit about Bethesda all while being a fanboy of CD Projekt Red. He reminds me of those people that are indie wrestling fanboys that always crap on wwe.
---
Also possible he farms public workshops.
---
This would make a lot of sense. I’ll just roll with this explanation thanks
---
I had the same problem till I saw a post suggesting to go to an area with low level mole miners or scorched. They usually have 4-5 shotgun shells and you can use a melee or off weapon to build ammo reserves quick. Just gotta server hop for a while. Save that plastic for repairs and bulking! 
---
If we were ever going to have npcs, these would be the guys.
---
It is still running, check out the page again. It's a little more laborious putting a build together on nukedragons, and would be tedious when you're burning through the first 50 levels, but it does make switching between combat, craft/hack/pick  and MULE ^(TM) mode much easier.
---
  
---
What ever you say
---
Fkn excellent. Well done mate!
---
Thank you. Fallout 76 is a spinoff I wish more people realized that.
---
The free utility "paint.net" is your friend.
---
You speak as if any YTers actually say anything good about FO76.  They are a bunch of money-grubbing view horders exactly like paparazzi trying to get the elusive celebrity photo.
---
Man that is sad to hear, I didn't think there were people out there with worse luck than me. If my numbers are off and the chance of getting a 1\* items from a 3\* mob is greater than 60% then that is extremely discouraging. 
---
Ultra-rare legendary drop.
---
How do I know it’s ultra-rare? Because all those high-level Whitesprings farmers have logged hundreds of hours without ever seeing it. 
---
You got some explaining to do lucy
---
That’s the worst scaling system they could possibly have thought of. There is zero way to control that. :(
---
it's allways like that for me is it any diffrent for anyone else?
---
Seriously? I've never seen that, and this spreadsheet doesnt say anything about it https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ZhGrawX03LlZtS9smKLqcC2LT875f5V_qPFefn79OM/edit?usp=sharing
---
Can you find out what the mod is specifically called and under which category it is?
---
I read this in his voice beat for beat. Thanks, I hate it. 
---
I suppose you have a leprechan in your basement too?   Not sure there are any "good" youtubers left.
---
Yo if anyone could paint my power armor to the BOS paint I'll pay you, I'm on Xbox. Please if anyone cam let me know. 
---
What's coming in the patch tomorrow?
---
Don't think legendary monsters should always drop legendaries since they are a joke to fight. They are like any other non-legendary creatures out there except they take more hits. Why should their loot be any different
---
Nice, I had a camp there once when I was lower level and a scorchbeast leveled it lo
---
I get that, but an hour spent farming molemen vs an hour farming plastic is still the same thing, I don't think you're going to get more than 200 shells in that hour.
---
I compare it to something like the Harpoon Gun, which is single shot in its base form and does roughly the same damage as a shotgun with max perks, yet the harpoon ammo is just wood and steel plus you can retrieve a small percent of that ammo from the corpse.
---
I just think the shotgun is out of line with most other guns when it comes to ammo collection.
---
I do actually.. It's a pretty epic undertaking making games like this only to be shot down by unappreciative little toerags who spend 5 seconds on a keyboard trying to destroy things.
---
man I completely forgot and shelved fallout 76 for now, I even forgot I posted this thread. Ive nto play the game since the last 4 major updates. I plan on picking the game back up again when wild Appalachia hits
---
No. Then everyone's gonna destroy their items and then hoard them in thousands then crash the server. Trust me, people do that in this game
---
What is his deal with this game anyways? Anytime I’m on YouTube there’s always a hit in my suggestions with a video of his trashing the game. Does he cover anything else? Just curious. I get the sentiment from launch but cmon, it’s not like someone is literally stabbing you in the back. 
---
No
---
3 star lockboxes/safes need better loot.. Astonishingly bad rewards for all that effort.. Level 1 and two not even worth opening.. Some level 3 boxes are empty AFTER unlocking so why not just save us the trouble of opening them beforehand...ok rant over !
---
Um... No? No one would ever fix them?
---
If you did others would get mad at you.
---
Found a TS Single Action Revolver and an Explosive LMG (which has since become useless due to the massive explosive weapon nerf) and that's it, never a legit TSE weapon; this is why I considered the TSE nerf a *tad* excessive: if you crunched numbers I'd be willing to place a bet that the majority of the playerbase has yet to use a TSE weapon.
---
I like this idea. I often have had new players run away from me when all I want to do is give them gifts. An emote for “I have a gift” would be nice. The emote for “trade” doesn’t really work because new players may be confused why a high level player would want to trade or they will ignore it because they figure have nothing to offer. 
---
I've done the repair event for the charleston one all alone a few times, i never unlocked the big power unit for my camp. I bought the plan somewhere, now they added them to shop. So, there's no reason to do that event again.
---
Also, i was capturing the workshop there while doing the event and half the time a big level in big amor came and oneshot me. So turning thoses area into a PvP event area, why not? There's other ways to get power cores.
---
Not sure if you could use the closed dressers plans (The one that are stupidly rare to find) to just completely hide it. 
---
Thanks for the heads-up.  I'm way past level 50 so it will be worth it to be able to switch between melee, heavy guns, and crafting loadouts again.
---
Maybe try throwing on adrenaline, nerd rage, enforcer, bloody mess. If you don't have an explosive one that will help a good bit after buffed by Demo. Expert. 
---
I have ammo problems with 5.56, .45, and 10mm but never with shotgun shells on my sneak shotty build. It takes down most  non giant enemies in 1 hit. That's with covert ops boosting sneak damage though. 
---
You might hate the range with the silencer. It definitely annoys me sometime. In tight quarters though it cripples everything. 
---
If you're looking for a replacement, checkout the Laymen Gaming channel! More memes, less filler I think!
---
I hope not
---
I’m excited too! I wish everything was coming out at once instead of over the next two months 😭 I’m impatient and needy, okay, Bethesda?! 
---

This is based on an assumption: the global variable Learn\_Pickup\_Chance\_Guaranteed\_ECON \[GLOB:004E618E\] has a value of 100.000000, so if 100 is guaranteed then the values on the following are percentiles:
---
Weapons:
---
Learn\_Scrap\_Weapon\_Mod\_Chance\_High\_ECON \[GLOB:0051856E\] - 25.000000
---
Learn\_Scrap\_Weapon\_Mod\_Chance\_Medium\_ECON \[GLOB:0051856A\] - 20.000000

Some people say that luck is a factor, others that the relevant perk cards (Armorer etc) play a part, personally because not everything has been decoded yet and creating those spreadsheets - and the endless ledgers for my mules - ate my joye de vivre for quite some time I just don't know.
---
I have unlocked 99.9% of the stuff and I no longer look into it.
---
Please bear in mind that there is a factor I haven't computed: the more mods left to unlock the higher the chances of getting an unlock. This is based on observation after unlocking 99.9% on two different accounts - never put all the eggs in one basket.
---
There isn’t a lot of end-game content, so I personally like helping new players out with gifts like legendaries and assisting with quests. Glad you had a good experience. 
---
Agreed! 
---
I’m with that guy. For me there is still so much to do in the game. You are running out of things to do, and you are asking for the game to give you your legendary items you want quicker so you run out of stuff to do even quicker again? If you are bored now what do you expect to do when you finally get that gun you want? IMO that’s not where the games enjoyment is. 
---
Yep.  Do not go near workshops.  
---
Do you not have it already? Usually you unlock the prime receiver and ammo together? 
---
To be honest, Fallout 76 is still a garbage game. Quests/story is still horrible and the enemy spawns are still buggy.
---
I just don't think anything is going to save your farceout 76. It will be garbage till it's end.
---
Yes, once someone starts to contest your workshop, you become PVP regardless of where you are in the world.
---
Thus, a pair of people can grief you really easy.  1 look on map and travel to your location and hide.  Another claim the workshop, first person shoots you in the head.  Game over.
---
Or a single person can do it by looking on map first then claiming your workshop and traveling to you.
---
Its not running how it was intended.  The workshops were meant to be contested for their resource.  But they are being used as a tool to 1 shot other players.  Not the same thing.
---
Smart girl. Want a snack?

The bulldoze feature removes objects that would prevent you from placing a camp object (ie cause the object to be red), such as rocks and large branches.
---
It also removes some larger bushes that you can build over already but it doesn’t strip the entire plot of land of everything if that’s what you were expecting.
---
You’re a builder—I would’ve thought that you knew this by now?  The feature came out ages ago.

Don’t forget to hit up the cat house with all the food bowls and I do fort Defiance as well. All the enamel buckets give plastic.

Ya takin about shot gun shells here being expensive my heavy Gunners has a 3* flamer he wishes he could use. Lol! 5 at a time what the actual fuck?
---
I feel your pain, I don't ever think those guns will be viable.
---
So it does sound like a bug then. Good to know.
---
Yeah, often it takes some time for someone to come along and take the bounty. He could go to somewhere and ask someone to do it if no one comes along.

I've got a 19th hole establishment built at the whitesprings by the excavation, just waiting to start slinging libations.

I kept a badass level 50 cryolator in my stash for 30 levels thinking I could eventually be a monster with it, in those 30 levels I got about enough ammo to last about 10mins.
---
I really hope not.
---
Hunting rifle, because it does better single shot damage and all the .45 I can make gets used up by my combat rifle.

I don't see the issue. The quest now o feel is a joke. Fix up poseidon so I can have free 100 power at Lakeside Cabins workshop? Man, 2 fusion generators and you're all set at most any workshop.

Anyone wanna open a bar? 
---
As I understand it, they advised in a future patch (after they have fixed all known exploits), not necessarily the very next patch. As there's nothing in the notes about this, I would hazard to say probably not. Given the issues and past patch history, your timeout may be a while.
---
Yongyea
---
I'd say most people playing assume that most are. My alt has been bloodied since level 20. Until he got much higher, I was astounded by how many people would run up and offer stimpaks thinking I had none and was on death's door. 
---
I think. Emphasis on *think* you can put a crystalizer barrel on it it will shoot lil ice nuggets. Ammo on it is a lil easier to come by than flamer fuel. 
---
I try to get the bot for the first time just now. I server hop one time.Cross the bridge. Come back, see a camp there. As i get closer to check player name on turret, the camp vanished. I cross the bridge again and when i come back, the bot is here :

As far as I am aware from my experience you can only unlock the Bos combat helmet mod from scrapping. The actual bos that you can apply to legs. Chest. And arms. Have to be plans. Although at the moment they are a very rare drop if I remember correctly. But they are plans u have to get and learn
---
There's a mrbossman or verlisify for every game.
---
Well, at the very least they should then show on the event the level cap, so I know not to move.
---
If I pay 50 caps to cross the map to do an event, then I meet a level 15 *** mutant, I won't just say "hooo sorry, you're meant for another player".
---
If i'm the first there, maybe adjusting the mutant level to mine would be sensible, otherwise it's disappointing for every one.
---
Yeah I never saw one drop until after lv 100ish somewhere I got 2 in about 5 levels. It started speeding up because I build my camp in between multiple fissures I guess. It was close to Watoga so people wandering by would spawn some sorchbeasts plus my spawns added up. Wasn't unusual to come home to 4 or more of them -_-
---
Nope.  You can scrap light armor and the mods work for heavy armor.
---
no cause i doubt they have patched the recent vendor selling dupe that has sprung up
---
I got the BOS Chest plan from a quest, I do know that.  It might have been from one of the final quests where you go into that cave to kill the SB.
---
The exact thing the OP described has happened to me a lot when killing Deathclaws, so it might just depend on the mob.
---
That is quite possible. I remember I bought the legs and arms but I had no idea where I got the chest from 
---
I mean why post this if you dislike him or his content? I have never heard of the guy. Probably because I avoid most yt content that seems low effort or uses buzzwords etc. Imagine me now looking him up more publicity.. Seriously yt is all about drama and baiting don't be surprised.
---
I have a collection of Instigating Radium, Hunting, Combat, Handmade, Lever-Action, Crossbow, and Pipe Bolt-Action sniper rifles. They're all special to me in some way but the best one is probably the Handmade because of the combination of base damage and Rate of Fire. When mobs get too close or for close quarters combat I usually use one of my TSE rifles (Combat, Radium, Handmade, Assault, or Pipe) but the best TSE is the Handmade again because of the base damage and Rate of Fire. I don't really mess with Bloodied or Anti-Armor weapons because of the atrocious prices they have for being the flavor of the week. I get by with my rifles just fine.
---
You can find tons of plastic in Watoga High School. This farming spot is the secret source of my shotgun build's power.

These are my favourite but there's loads more.

The game remembers your recent looting locations so if you loot a lockbox, log out and loot it again later on login it will be empty.

There were weather changing tapes/disk in the Dev cell so it might be something they want to implement. You never know though.

I still have to complete "I am become death", but maybe Wild Appalachia will help me...

isn't the point of the game to collect junk?  Then it worked!

Great post. Diablo 3 taught us about the value of regular loot long before anthem, especially with its connection to the dopamine hit

I’m going to focus on clothing, both common and rare. Find me on PS4, next to the river in Morgantown between the Airport and Mama Dolce’s.

heh, I am having the opposite problem, I don't know where to buy the legs/arms!
---
😔 It was an eat-o-tronic. Too many late nights! 
---
In a word. . . No.
---
While this is probably not the answer you were looking for, I don’t believe Bethesda is capable of resolving the bugs or issues in their code that would meet the conditions stipulated in their suspension email.
---
In a way that was a pretty sick/savage byrn they ran on suspended players.  
---
It could have only been a 2nd degree burn if they had said suspended players will be allowed back on March 13th of NEVER EVER.

Just play the game using quests.  They will grant you tons of xp.

how much u paying?
---
I have a mule that has 85% of the available plans, the most common ones in sizeable quantities, leftover from hundreds of hours or doing events, digging for treasure, doing endless server hopping loops of places that can spawn plans etc.
---
This was before beth, out of the blue, went ahead and put most of the plans on vendors causing my levels of salt to spike.
---
This mule is lvl 2 - there are no weight reducing perks that affect plans so I didn't bother.
---
These days I don't bother with trading either so they just sit there until the day may come that they might become useful somehow.
---
Ahh good to know. Makes it all the stranger why the OP can’t mod their armor then
---
Run blackwater for a little for steel and shells. (maybe sell the dropped weapons instead of scrapping easy caps). After that you fast travel and farm various super mutant locations. Above lv 30 iirc mutants will use laser rifles. You can scrap these for plastic. 
---
Not only is it a good income of plastic, supermutants are also in the best areas to farm legendary weapons. 2 birds 1 stone.
---
Hi, I want to thank you as I tried the solution in the post.
---
Performance has slightly improved. A lot of less stuttering and freezes.
---
However still crashes at random, but hey its an improvement :)
---
Quite strange.. I feel somethings working in the background. Try holding one. Then dropping one. See how ur carry weight shifts. Then ull know if ur carrying the 2lbs or the 0.8lbs
---
How would you stock up since crafting isnt an option? Buying/ selling?
---
I’m always scavving. Picking up clothes as I find them. Then craft those I have plans for like the wetsuit and stuff like that.
---
I have seen the BOS Mod learned message while trying to get the mod for Arms/legs.  All other mods are fine, but the BOS is unique, the chest is locked behind a quest completion.  I think the final quest in the BOS quest line... The legs/arms plans must be bought.
---
But, I went through about 400-600 light leather armor scrapping to get all the studded mods for heavy leather.   Those are by far the best physical/energy resist armors in game (Non-legendary) and fantastic weight.   I think the 200% level 50 ones are 45/75 resists per piece and require no ballistic fibers, just keep scrapping old ones and making new ones.  The Studded Heavy leather chest is lower than the BOS Heavy Combat Chest though, that's 81/81.
---
I have 7,282 caps on me right now, but I have some decent weapons I could trade
---
Its the beam splitter for the gattling plasma, for normal plasma its just called the flamer barrel.
---
Bethesda make these bans permanent please. 
---
I  don't believe that about the naielr to be true. I gotten it dozens of times by just shooting her.
---
I killed 23 legendaries in my play session tonight.  21 were 1 star, and two were 2 star.  Zero 3 stars.  That just isn't fun.
---
It's in the game, lately Bethesda confirmed it's not illegal and you can ask on any subreddit and someone made it for you (when you scrap it you'll learn the plan 100% and from now on you can craft it for yourself). With High INT you can get 18+ DR one...
---
best weapon to offer?
---
No, it doesn’t. I’ve got a shielded brotherhood officer suit, which gives 2 strength and 3 endurance if I recall. Stepping into power armour, only the bonuses from the power armour apply. 
---
Literally anything you’re wearing other than the power armour, may as well be in your stash box or sold, if you play a PA build. 
---
That's really helpful, thanks.
---
It is rare. And people will pay a lot, like a lot of caps for it. If you find the right buyer

SBQ health and damage resists all scale upwards with each player in zone.

Not sure how you are able to pull 350 per hit?  Unless you got TSE, melee or bloodied build???
---
Highest modded gause rifle with all the perks only get to about 200.   
---
Primed weapons? -- Could not be those, you would know all this stuff already.
---
Black Powder rifles are so very slow and not worth using against queen, better off going with handmade.
---
Uh I didn't know I looked everywhere and couldn't find it. Thank you!
---
Great idea, I play the same as you. My son and Nephew tease me about being a hoarder, but I always have the materials needed when I go to build!
---
Glad to see the circle jerk is still strong on this subreddit. Bethesda created a patchwork survival game held together with duct tape and lies and then when it burst into flames and most of the player base left. The small community that remained. Went into denial and shit on anything that is critical of this junk.
---
The game was launched in a unacceptable state. Numerous bugs to the point of after 5 days of play I rolled my eyes at it and uninstalled.
---
People need to understand that you can have fun with a flaming bag of shit, but it doesn't change the fact that it's a bag of flaming shit and it's not worth 60 dollars.

No problem, my route is a bit lazy but I run around steakhouse, Harpers ferry, Westek mainly for mutants. There are probably more you can weave in there but I am not too familiar with the quality of mutant camps in the divide. glhf
---
3* Assasins is mole miner gauntlet
---
They are expensive, even just lowering the plastic cost to 6 or 7 wood make a huge difference, seeing as it's 21 per craft with ammosmith(without super duper) and assuming 100 plastic you'd get 126 more shells if the cost was 6, or 84 more if the cost was 7.
---
With the way things are though, even spending an hour hitting up all the major locations of plastic on the west side of the map, all of which have low level scorched which can have shotguns/shells on them, and using Skeet Shooter so I can get more out of each shot without having to me in melee range, still resulted in me being out of ammo so often and running out of Stims on a medic build that I had to scrap the build.
---
Gamer tag is tigertemper, looking forward to that deposit :)

Unless you could have then saved to a hot key, then just swap perk sets instantly. Make a class and name it so it displays so you don't forget to change back.

3* assasins mole miner gauntlet or a 1* instigating handmade
---
Oh thank you so much, you moron who has never actually touched the game. Your views are so fucking valuable. Now go cry to mommy for her credit card to buy the Apex seadon pass.
---
Some other dude said it, but just for confirmation/clarity-
---
If you have 11 strength or over, you gain nothing from a frame. 
---
This! Also being able to hide/discard perk cards. I have several max level card duplicates I got from perk packs. 
---
yeah no thanks 
---
Just write down ad on /Market76 that you want it and for 500 caps you should get it no problem.
---
Well, apart from these secret locations I can think of a scenario where I want to share a few locations with someone else to show them where I tend to build my camps, or where the responder bot spawn, a few places where I met Grahm, etc. This would all be more convenient with a single link rather than multiple links to separate places.
---
You're welcome ;) 
---
Yes!! We can put it on the "social hub" area
---
I also have lots of flux
---
Ahh ok, thought the splitter was something else.
---
YESSSSSSS YESS YESSSSSS
---
I think the problem came with all the TSE and it doing absurd damage.  They adjusted the hardest mob in the entire game so it would not die in 10 seconds.
---
Now that they lowered the damage of the TSE (which is still OP), it definitely is a job to take her down.   I just run a normal handmade (non-legendary Handmade because I cannot find one and refuse to buy from any player as they are 99% chance of duped).   I am fully specced with sneak build (level 140) and do some good damage with it but not a min-max.  I should be contributing quite a bit of damage but have no way to figure out the % total on her.   But in my opinion, the queen should be tough but doable by a group of people like my character (without min-max).   Not sure if they can adjust her down to that point because of all the exploited items still in the economy.   
---
How much do they usually go for?

So you are another one of those people who have never played the game. Do you guys come over here to watch the drama? Also, bold of you to claim those things, since you play Anthem and Sea of Thieves, both considered to be pretty bad games. Or do you just go to those forums to troll as well?
---
tyvm
---
Yeah it's a zero sum game a lot of the time. You can farm shells at the expense of other critical materials like Stims/repair cost of armor etc etc.
---
Most big youtubers jump on the hate band wagon for clicks with some exceptions so i suggest going to small youtubers where they are more honest 
---
cool but no thanks

for a full set 25k
---
Amen !
---
No mobs will spawn 100.  The highest is 91 and thats SB or Deathclaw.
---
Even when a level 500 player is nearby the highest that normal mobs spawn is around 62-68.
---
High levels are not going to stay in level 15 areas.  If that happened, just relog and you will find server with the mobs are right levels.
---
If your in places like Whitespring, then your in wrong place.
---
Heavily agree with all of this. It’s sad that all the attention seems to go to people who all want new things and no actual improvements of the game system. I wish we could level up, not only from killing, but from using the skills we’re given. Maybe even if we had a ranking system of particular SPECIAL attributes, like if we lockpick often, discover locations often, and find harder to find loot as well as disassemble found loot we would be rewarded with EXP towards it. Strength for Melee, carrying equipment and crafting melee weapons. Just all of the stats, could easily be made this way. And Luck would be determined by being lucky, such as getting a preserved pie out of the food machine, or finding a lot of caps or mutated enemies.
---
That’s rochie my dude
---
I am also feeling the plastic farming pain.
---
I’ve invested a lot of perk cards etc into my shotgun build but am considering scrapping it for the same reason.
---
Jim Sterling does his research? Did you watch his video on 900 hour guy? It's just a 10 minute shotshow where he makes inappropriate jokes about why anyone would play 76 for 900 hours, and then goes on to claim boldly that he was banned for picking up ordinary ammo. He literally just makes a summary of the whole thing from a cursory reading of the post, which was utterly false. The entire point of the video was also not to address the ban issue but to simply make fun of the fact that anyone could play 76 for so long. It was a disgusting video.
---
Harley Quinn is like the best sidekick of all time!

I've played Fallout 1 and Diablo like crazy in those times.

The stalker games are gems, those games were ahead of their time if you could fox the bugs on your own.

Fallout 76 got a lot of unjustified hate. It is true that on a technical level the game was a disaster when it came out.
---
Now  months later I can already see some progress.
---
To be honest I didn't like the story in FO76 when it started, but the more you progress with it the more it make sense why there are no human npc's (yet). Im level 23 (yeah i take my sweet time), i still hoard like crazy. I hope Bethesda will increase the stash limit once again.

Anyway great post, I share your love for the series :)

Word of advice, careful with these as you may attract the creeps too...
---
All boils down to Luck/RNG. Enjoying your 1 Diamond Assassin's Wooden Leg from a 3 \* enemy? Take the enemies down slow, let the slot machine spin a little, then kill. I found better weapon rolls and armor by leaving the enemies at low health for a minute or so or killing them with multiple weapon types.
---
Yeah I did think that. Might remove my GT, it’s already given me some unwanted attention! Thanks for the advice 
---
There's a reason you have negative karma. Info coming soon ;-)
---
I got a full set of unyielding bos 3*, is that a decent trade?

But you did initiate PVP.   Anytime you take over a PVP Workshop, expect to get flagged.  
---
All anyone has to do is just begin the contest of your workshop and you are flagged.  Does not matter where you are in the world either.
---
Remember, Workshops = PVP.
---
Makes me think that Trading between players should have advantages.
---
Those vending robots have a limited amount of caps (300 or 400) if there would be a reason to trade with players because of better items of stuff i would be glad to buy.
---
Most PVP Players will move yes.
---
Griefers will not move as they will get decimated by true PVP Players.
---
If the buyer dosnt let you change anything then its a scam ... you could try getting your money back from ebay and the guy banned. i mean everything is your fault for being so naiv.
---
Nope, it's just YT algorithms that force Ytubers to make more and more videos to generate more and more ad revenues for YT. YTubers are also "victims " in this vicious circle.... In the end, it's just YT trying to make more money, just look at how the recommendations panel changed : now you don't have similar videos anymore but you have less similar videos but more profitable for YT.
---
And expect it to take a few hours
---
Do not claim ANY Workshops unless you want to PVP.

That sounds like some superstitious bs to me, but if you want to spend some time like a week or so and see if your number turn out better than my average then go for it. Like I said in the post I am seeing a 60% chance of getting a 1\* from a 3\* mob. I kill the mobs as fast as possible but I dont 1 shot because I use a Vampires SS 1h so maybe your numbers are close to mine, but if it turns out you are getting a lower chance of 1\* items like 40-50% then I would be willing to take a look at multiple weapons or maiming before killing. 
---
Sea of Thieves released in a low content state without much to do. However, it worked. It had bugs but they were few, and I won't lie. At the start I didn't care for the game. It was fun in short bursts when the PvP got crazy. However, between the Devs being incredibly open with players and making it painfully obvious they were listening and even expanding the pioneer program to get more testing done. I'm honestly impressed and play the game a lot more than I would had they not done this.
---
Also claiming that I'm "One of those" who hasn't played the game, furthers my point about the circle jerk and how ready you guys are to attack. I had three friends who hyped it up for themselves while I approached it with a more skeptical view seeing as Bethesda had never done this before. I was interested, but when it launched and right off the bat I had several bugs happen to me. I just kind of sighed. I forced myself to play for about 5 days roughly before giving it a break. I later returned after a patch. Went to fix my power armor after farming parts for it. Lost all the parts without the repairs taking effect. After that, I uninstalled and never went back.
---
I like Bethesda's games for the most part. I'm looking forward to Elder Scrolls 6 and Starfield. But they screwed the pooch with this game, and people on here bashing youtubers when they're right just goes to show how petty and vile this subreddit is.
---
If you enjoy this game and can get past the bugs. That's great. Good for you. But it's not acceptable to launch a game in this condition and then drag your ass fixing it.
---
Honestly I feel like survival shouldn’t reward caps on kill at all.
---
Maybe the player drops whatever caps they haven’t stored in their stash?

It's not an ebay - Allegro (polish auction website) doesn't care about that kind of "sales", they only care about fees, so they won't ban him, there are thousands like him in that service.

If I had built my views about Anthem watching people critique it, I'd say the same. But I refuse to be an ass about games, I still believe Anthem is good. But nevertheless, you are throwing stones from a glass house, pal. Also, please stop making up bugs about the game just to look relevant. You tried to repair the armor and the pieces just disappeared? As if.

No.  Even just Sneak 3 and 5 AGI are enough, if using a silenced weapon and not staying in the same place too long, that only Scorchbeast will be able to find you, eventually(but even with 22 AGI from maxed base + gear and shadowed armor, those damn scorchbeast will still find you.

Watoga Highschool and Fort Defiance will give you plenty of plastic. Put on ammosmith and super duper and you get a decent amount. I gave away shells quite often while using shotguns. Most guns require farming to keep a decent supply of ammo. Try running heavy guns for a while doing scorched beast queen runs and then tell me about how farming ammo materials sucks. I dumped over 12k rounds today doing silos and 2 sbqs. Shotguns for the most part are lackluster imo but the ammo is easy to find.
---
Try my method, may be Placebo or superstition, but... last 3 star I kill dropped a 3 Diamond Executioner's The Dragon (50% Damage when Target is Below 40% HP, Bullets Explode, V.A.T.S Crits Cost Reduced by 25%). Everyone has their methods, but killing them as fast as possible doesn't seem to be working for you...Doing the same thing and expecting different results is the definition of insanity.
---
Alaska? :D
---
Multiple characters? Don't think they can have the same name

I just did a couple of runs on Westek, I'm suprised that their laser guns give 6 plastic per scrap, that's a pretty decent amount.

Exactly. Griefers gonna grief.

Well hopefully the patch makes heavy guns worth it, that sounds like a nightmare.

I haven’t spoken to many players since I started, I’ve been playing since launch and besides a few random times where I help others, I never had to rely on anyone. I 100% recommend going through a website like nukesanddragons to look through all the perk cards in the game &amp; figure out a good build from square 1. I cannot tell you how much I wish someone told me that when I first started. My first character didn’t focus on any one weapon, so it ended up being a totally useless jack of all trades. Besides that, I also recommend turning on pacifist mode AS SOON you turn lvl 5. Also If a high level player comes running after you, go see what they want! Sometimes people drop useful things like; stims, weapons, radaways, etc., so never be too shy! Finally, ALWAYS break down all of your junk and throw it into your stash for safekeeping, it’s terribly shitty to lose all of your junk when you’re fighting a tough boss. Have fun in Appalachia friend! Oh and good luck with bugs, they happen sometimes but you learn to live with them :-)
---
AND it’s bering farmed 24/7 !!! do your Research 
---
I’d consider picking up .556 and .45 ammo and then finding someone to trade with. I always pick up shotgun shells with my rifle build to trade for the ammo I need. 
---
I wanted to but the high probability of Scorchbeast attacks deterred me. Well done for taking the leap!
---
Just let us save different setups atleast so we just need to press a button to change the loadout or wte.
---
I honestly grab ammo for every weapon type and have been stockpiling it. Would be happy to trade for some shells. I'm on PS4.
---
I just want to take a minute to appreciate that you typed out the way he spoke. Immersion bonus.
---
If you're seriously saying you've not run into bugs since playing Fallout 76. I'm going to flat out call you a liar. I ran into so many during my first few hours of play it was silly. I also ran into a bug getting the big earth mover up and running. You would craft the first core, then the other cores you crafted after that would take the resources and not craft. So you got around this by dropping the core on the ground. Making a new one. Drop and repeat till you have all the cores you needed. Then pick them all up at once.
---
Also while repairing my Power Armor before that bug happened. The stand you repair it in caused me to animation lock without any UI coming up. So I had to close the game. Open it and try again. After 3 attempts it finally opened. I repaired and finalized and it took my resources. On the UI it showed the armor repaired and when I closed and brought up the inventory. They were all still broken. I even logged out and back in. Still broken. So yeah. As for Anthem. No, I've not played that one. I've mostly been watching the salt rain cause I do have a sick fascination with watching people come up with stupid excuses to defend broken games having. Anthem is not nearly as bad as Fallout 76 was at launch from what I've seen. But no, I've not bought it. I knew that was going to come up though when I only mentioned Sea of Thieves. Anyways, off to work. Enjoy. lol

#RIFLE GAMING HERE!
---
Now that you have admitted you are sick, all it remains is to go get help.
---
Wow how pathetic, I truly regret I came to this subreddit.
---
Eh...could be worse he could be like DSP........
---
Just server hop, 1/3 time you have it. But it's highly incorrect to say that Flatwoods is the best place to farm lead.
---
Thanks. It is a some kind of bugginess. I unequipped everything and looked at the weights - still funky. But, when I closed the app and relogged and then redid my perks with thru hiker I got the 0.8 pounds when carrying glowing and hardened mass on me (though technically I don't think hardened mass is a foodstuff because it goes in junk but that's neither here nor there), 2 pounds in the stash. I do wish it said its base weight when in the stash, but whatever. My brother used to run thru hiker but doesn't anymore, so I don't know what's going on with him. It is the right weight in actuality (2) but it still shows the lighter (0.8).
---
Your camp would be repeatedly destroyed by players.   You would be the offender in that case because they view your camp as a blocker for the spawn of the rare vender.
---
He stole one of my videos and never credited me. Fuck him
---
I used to live there...
---
It’s a nice spot but you covered up the seat on the left side on the left as you walk in at the back end, that’s a heavy weapon plan spawn. Just giving a heads up!
---
Copystrike him.
---
Bit of an exaggeration, I apologize.
---
Wouldnt that be the problem though? You'll have a server full of Preston Garveys and Jerichos etc.
---
Incorrect indeed. Lucky Hole Mine with Excavator PA easily beats Flatwoods, West Tek roof, and all gyms.
---
Juicehead sucks. One of the biggest offender.
---
I like the fire rate of the lever action because I use Gun fu, once you kill the first enemy you can quickly headshot 4 more enemies no matter the hit%. I highly recommend. 
---
Juicehead forms his opinion based on what the top posts on this subreddit are.
---
I literally read two posts just today where people called it a DLC. I’m flattered you think I’m a leader inventing this terminology by myself, but I have to break your bubble and declare that I am merely a follower, repeating what other people have said before me.
---
So, new content and quests are now merely a “patch,” nothing more? I wonder when that changed.
---
if your just gonna copy paste this until the 26th, stop, just stop. you already posted this word for word 7 hours ago
---
Exactly what I do. I actually end up with too much lead and not enough steel to craft ammo :-)
---
From the number estimates I've seen the "buff" seems to be a nerf. I broke 4 weapons with gunsmith 5 on between the queen and silo. I really wish they would implement a test server so people can be spared a lot of the bs from bethesda's lackluster programming. After dealing with support and the patch changes there really seems to be a huge disconnect between what players want and what bethesda does. Right now it feels like shotguns need to be placed in an enemies orifice to do any damage worth using them. 
---
Haha \*soon\*
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
Crafting/ lock picking/ hacking skills should be passive, having to switch them out is an incredibly stupid and adds nothing but annoyance. The gameplay would be more streamlined and less screwing around swapping perks if they just made those sorts of perks passive. 
---
But hey, I honestly don't see much change happening to the perk system, especially in the foreseeable future.
---
Wow, FO76 still has Morrowind code in it.
---
90% of Windows Server 2019 (or whatever they call it these days) is still the same as Windows NT 3.5
---
That's the way software works.
---
Yeah I’m on Xbox, make a post in the market subreddits and you’ll definitely get someone to trade with!
---
When will people that got banned be able to play again ?
---
You don't use one of the parts of the game the way it is supposed to be used? Go you.
---
Canteens in general are good for plastic but the highschool is brilliant.
---
Sure, this is easy to implement badly, but nigh impossible to implement right. Lots of real names around the world happen to be some kind of slurs somewhere in the English speaking diaspora, things like 88 are both a cryptic neonazi greeting while also being the birth year of a lot of gamers, etc. There are dozens of articles talking about people that were banned from various sites/services based entirely off of their name, because their name/nick contains something that by some would be considered a bad word.
---
Haha i had this same thing. Glad that people figured it out how to ”fix” this. Havent played in few days because i thought this was some bigger glitch
---
Because the same flag is used to say "don't scrap when I scrap all" and "don't auto-scrap when I'm crafting".
---
So there was a choice -- either people would complain that they had to manually scrap when they were crafting or they complain that auto-scrap scraps bulk.
---
This all came about from a quick and dirty fix for the people who complained about auto-scrap (when crafting) destroying mods and scrap-all destroying hardened mass.
---
They say they'll fix it eventually.
---
Many fo76 gameplay quest walkthroughs on youtube, some are painfully annoying. The story is good but everyone is long gone. The events are better than the blast zone. Slugger mele and shotgunner seem to be best perk builds.
---
I love the idea of making loot somewhat specific to the area, but I thought instead of what kind. As an example: If you get a drop in Watoga, if it's armor there's a 50% chance of it being Robot armor, in Whitesprings it would be Enclave, in the nothern part of the Forest it would be Wooden, and so on for Raider, Metal, Leather, Combat and so on. Connect the type to what is there. It would be fantastic to have the loot tables be weigthed to where you are and what you can expect.  
---
Yes this does nothing for the legendary problem, but it would be good for immersion and perhaps for some sort of grinding.  
---
They do work properly -- they're not supposed to weigh less.
---
&gt;the context is clear
---
[So you're a neonazi?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/88_(number)#In_white_nationalism)
---
Hopefully!
---
I see these concerns are similar to those who have suggested perk card decks/loadouts in the past, though you're recommending a slightly different system. I'll raise this with the dev team so they can get a good range of community feedback &amp; opinion on it.
---
Thank you for taking the time to post this mate
---
Sell junk at Grafton Station and Watoga.  Problem fixed.
---
Meximum 
---
by that logic, the already implemented "large object bulldozer" would be impossible while it actually exists.
---
It would be nice to be able to make multiple builds and switch from my favorites bar.  Whenever you switch builds it would take 1 click and swap all my perks to my other saved build.  Then going from crafting/repair build back to combat would take just a couple clicks.
---
I became a first-time father on July 31st of last year when my twins were born, and I'll always associate the past eight months with their infanthood and Appalachia.
---
So here I sat at 4am after some Dad duty, with a morning coffee and some breakfast, and I read your entire wall of text haha. This is what I hoped to find in a multiplayer Fallout community; a more thoughtful, cooperative people than the Call of Duty, etc. crowd, with real lives and a love for storytelling--both Bethesda's and their own.
---
Have fun! My IGN is my Reddit name BTW.
---
I'll let Cartman explain

Could be over powered.
---
I have the Kill-10-golfers-quest unfinished on my main character and apparently the ghoul golfers only spawn to low level players. I took my new character to Whitesprings in an effort to do this quest while low level, being 16. Turns out you can never spawn low levels there. You only encounter lvl 62 charred ghouls and die horribly. I guess there could be a chance if I found a time when no one else played, but I doubt it.
---
This is a rant to say that Whitesprings is for lvl 40 and up. I don't know what you call mid level but to me Whitespring is quite high level as everything over 60 is basically the same.
---
It will give you a couple of hours of unending fun and....much more...
---
Don't forget and "much more" !
---
How specifically does that solve the issue? They both have work benches last time I checked. 
---
Have you sent in your essay ? Get to it !
---
Just like your Reddit account name shouldn't be shown to others? Your account name is already shown to others and can be found via the [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) platform (forum, mods), so it was never secret.
---
I find it odd when I hear these stories. Me and my one friend took on the SBQ for the first time with like 10 minutes to spare. A few other people from the server joined in but it didn’t seem like a struggle.
---
What level is the T-60 armour please.
---
Same with the Pay to win crap they tried to pull. Yong acted like you cant get any of these costumes. Or that the buff you get is super tiny. Or that its a limited event. Or that the whole sub exploded over it. At this point i think those kind of youtubers just try to keep the drama alive
---
Just don't use ALL that perks. Stop min-maxing all and you will not lose time changing perk cards.
---
Is this actually a thing? This isn't the first time I've been running around with an accidential bounty and I don't recall that it ever went away on its own. What's considered a safe zone in this context? 
---
It's level 40
---
You failed one queen event. So what try again if it still bugs you do what makes you happy. The queen doesn't always get killed it's part of the game I think every player has went through this. Build a bridge and get over it because you can't change it.
---
i am, i moved my character to the quest start location last night.  now i just gotta home my xbox will start the auto download and finish before i get home.
---
also been looking for about a week now, its not among the regular spawns atleast. might it be hidden with the aliens somewhere?
---
Out of curiosity what did Bethesda accuse you of doing when they banned you.
---
Maybe rn I don't know where to search it anymore
---
What's up with this gallowboob guy? The name seems vaguely familiar to ne for some reason, too. I saw his profike and it's just full of pretentious stuff and karma begging normie shit but otherwise don't see anything particularly objectionable. Anyone care to illuminate me on this guy?
---
Have definitely raised concerns of VATS targeting friendlies with the devs previously, but will do so again. Thank you anonoman
---
Good point. Fun fact: the very first Mr Handy that you meet in the vault still responds with your character name if you picked a certain one (see codsworth in fo4). He greeted my latest char with "Mr Julian" . And we all know that "Mr Fuckface" and "Ms Titties" is in the realm of possible 'acceptable' names. 
---
I..I have no words

It's not super effective but it gives me a giggle when people try to figure out where nukes-from-nowhere are coming from. Bonus points when I do it in pacifist mode.
---
As a fellow shotgunner I agree. Finding a stack of plastic Halloween plates is very satisfying. 
---
Also golf balls are a good source.
---
Great work!
---
How can I download the picture in full resolution?
---
The Reddit mobile app direct me to imgur and I only can download it in 600x600...

Except, everything it remove respawn.

Going to share this suggestion with the team now! Thank you tisbeckyy :)
---
"Player vending lands"?
---
did i miss something?
---
Perfect dark zero
---
Oh, thanks. I'm happy now. Lol.
---
Yes, they need to fix the crafting for the flamer, definitely needed a buff
---
Your comment is kind of a waste. Give tips on how to make this boss possible or gtfo lol.
---
yes, im definatly excited and little worried, but lets hope everything works out for the better
---
I have a combat shotty with the 1\* effect Quad, which give me no extra damage and that is my standard weapon to use in a Whitesprings nuke farming run. I shoot the legs off the ghouls and leave them for the melee characters. Works well.
---
same here, i will be at work when it starts. I hope its back omline when I get back home
---
The sodium content is high in this one. I'm sorry your a dick
---
BFV:F
---
Watch it
---
I think it would be perfect to have like 3 sets that you can switch while not in combat or detected by enemies (it would be broken with too many sets or imagine if people switched it during pvps to do more damage or get less)
---
Let’s not talk about the fact that I can’t use an automatic and semiautomatic rifle at the same time because they would require 18 points in perception alone to have them dealing max damage, which is still shit compared to melee. 
---
it would also be great if it stop showing rain when im inside a building
---
Somewhere between a gigabyte and a hundred gigabytes.
---
This is a GREAT find!
---
How much would u want for ur bloodied lever action if u still have it 
---
Why has time fucked my brain
---
As Bethesda have repeatedly said since the initial announcement of FO76.
---
It just works
---
Soooo muuuuuch thiiiiiis!
---
A hoarder perk sounds awesome! Lol I have to keep myself from picking up every little thing :( when it’s one of my favorite parts. I love crafting and building. Drives my husband crazy when we play together. 
---
great to know im not the only one that does that, i have been doing the same for a few weeks, drop everything I do not need at the overseers camp or I actually would fast travel to them as well. usually the noobies get super happy and ussually I would as well stick around to help them do a few quest. its a great time over all. 
---
I am on xbox if anyone want to play the new dlc later today
---
&gt; 15:00 am EDT (Some of Europe)
---
None of Europe is on US Eastern Daylight time.  In fact nowhere in the world is.
---
And what the hell is "15:00 AM"???
---
Passive perks i agree! Hacking, lock picking, crafting should all be passive.
---
haha thank you, it felt like an important detail because sometimes it took him 2 or 3 minutes to complete a sentence but you could definitely understand what he meant. We ended up becoming friends that play regularly, but I still feel bad about greeting his murderer with open arms haha.
---
Yes! Staircase! I would love to have the atom shop floors to be available on the staircase and not just the see through mesh thing.
---
&gt;1. Please fix the vendor system so that vendor bots aren't constantly picked clean. I'd be happy to be able to offload my junk, use that to buy plans, then use those plans to build stuff. That makes sense as a path. But with the vendors constantly empty it doesn't work. OR....
---
I'm not following you on this? Are you refering to them being oit of caps? Because the vendor cap pool is locked to the player not the map. Vendors work in factions and share a cap pool. If you mean raise the caps per faction I'm with you on that.
---
Also hell yeah
---
Watoga High School + Ammo Smith + Super Duper=  A bunch of dead ghouls
---
Very much this!
---
are you going to be on later today, i would gladly buy some stuff from you, jetpack. calibrated socks, and mutations. I will hit you up later via xbox one
---
Griefing is not pvp, it’s a pathetic waste of time from people with sad lifes.
---
dude im down, what system do you play in?
---
Yeah, that is an excellent point and true. What benefit is there to not being able to have lockpick / gunsmith equipped all the time? Though I suppose it does add to the difficulty a bit, if you forget to switch perk cards and go into combat. 
---
Still, think you are correct, would be good if this could be changed.
---
What kind of GPU do you have? And how much system RAM? 
---
I have a 1080 (8GB) and 32 GB of RAM. I do not have these issues, in fact, last time I checked the game only used half of what I actually have.
---
Also, it might not even have anything to do with VRAM, if the game is not on a SSD you can encounter short "freezes" when new assets are streamed in and a normal HD can't provide them fast enough although 10 seconds seems a tid bit excessive.
---
I would gladly help you, are you on xbox?
---
We start a group like AA... Lol.
---
Supermutants are the gift that keep on giving.
---
OK exp, gunpowder and wazer wifles, profit! They occasionally drop screws too which is nice.
---
Mildly amusing when they say 'Appalachia belongs to the Super Mutants' and here we are treating them like a crop.
---
Bleurgh.
---
14:00 UTC.
---
I’m just excited that I’ll actually be able to enjoy my heavy energy weapons, instead of baby sitting their durability. The added content is just bonus for me. I’m actually more interested in them balancing and fixing the game in its current state before they go ahead and add in new bugs I mean content. 
---
EDT.  America started daylight time  on Sunday, March 10.
---
Q. What came first the chicken or the egg?
---
A. Nobody really knows 
---
Does this mean you have a metal plan for trade? 
---
I've had that happen once and I looted the corpse. It was my first SB kill it dropped on my porch. Lol I actually thought it was some sort of reward for killing a SB
---
The filthy casual sub seems like a good place too.
---
Lol I found it, wanted to see how it fired, boom 700+ gone. I was absolutely dumbfounded
---
&gt;  I've enjoyed my time in DC, the Mojave, and the Commonwealth.  … How do I set myself up for success before leaving the vault?
---
FO76 is like all FO games. At the beginning it can be super-easy or super-hard depending on where you go and what you do.
---
In FO76 "easy areas" can be altered by the presence of other players, causing high level enemies to spawn. This is the most relevant difference imo.
---
For any decent gamer, at level 50-60, you get virtual god mode with perks, special points, max gear, ... and then everything becomes affordable.
---
Every single time I go to a vendor I have to back out because I forgot to change my perk cards.
---
Really? How does this work? When you say that vendors work in factions, do is there some sort of infographic that shows which vendors are which factions? I've always wondered why I can fast travel to 4 different vendors and 3 will have 2 caps and the last will have 200.
---
If my brother or cousin do not have them yet I'll be selling them. I'll check tonight after work. I'm on PS4
---
This is so true!
---
Don't pick lock on supply crate or you'll be wanted. Wait for the owner to unlock them, then loot after he goes. Loot in container is per player. Loot in the world is shared.
---
I'll buy it ☺👋🤩
---
Darn I'm Xbox 😅
---
My reddit is my xbox gamertag 
---
1060 (6Gb)  / 16Gb of RAM / SSD
---
RAM is not an issue, as the game utilizes under 6Gb at any time. Furthermore it should not max out VRAM when running at absolute minimum settings, even in 720p. After lots of testing, I'm amost 100% sure VRAM utilisation is the cause of my issues.
---
It seems sometimes the mysterious stranger want to be killed.
---
There are 7 vendor factions with 200 caps each. I do a loop whitespring station, whitespring bunker, Welch Station (I kill moleminers then sell weapons), r &amp;g station, Watoga Station, BOS vendor bot in Watoga, and finally Harpers Ferry vendor bot
---
If you do this you'll get 1400 caps minus fast travel cost vendor cap pools refresh every 20 hours
---
Want a dancing one.
---
Brilliant, I'll be on soon 😊
---
doing the grind off the game, i do not have them all no were close I think, I would suggest find out what you want to do first and start from there. it is not hard to rack them up, as well as doing events and workshops gives you plans.
---
I also thought like that at one poin but the more you roam around and do the events the more you will find and the easier they become to get. 
---
I already got used to place doors last when rebuilding my camp.
---
👍
---
That sucks I'd have given you first dibs and I'll be selling them cheap
---
Ummmm.....what? I don't min/max but every time I go to repair my power armor or weapons I have to swap perk cards. Then I have to swap them back. I'd love to see how much game time I've spent swapping perk cards just to repair and craft.
---
Because the RNG is more powerful than any so-called *legendary* creature.
---
They have tinkers work benches.  Don't bulk your mats and go there, go there and bulk your mats.

Looks like this was raised before when the challenge came around then. Not had chance to test the locations out myself yet though but they look right.

Pipe bolt action rifle -- same damage as a hunting rifle but lighter weight.
---
May change if I get a legendary (so far all I've found is a quad, and if you're having problems reloading your sniper rifle you're doing it wrong).
---
Yea. Basically. This way you still have to make choices with your special points and which perk cards your using but allows you to have some basics set up to alleviate the mind numbing task of swapping cards all around just to repair and craft etc etc. have the passive slot for each special able to hold a 3 level card, and each level unlocks with X  amount of points. For example: I have 1 perception so I would have zero passive slots in perception. I have 15 intelligence, so I'll be able to put weapon artisan in my 3 level passive slot.
---
It sucks when you start getting to high levels and the perk packs you get every 5 levels have completely cluttered your perk card inventory making all the swapping even harder cuz of all the cards to rig through. 
---
The Penitentiary has at least seven can alarms around the perimeter and in A block.
---
ROTFLMAO!
---
Funniest thing i've read on this sub.
---
Is it recommended this quest be completed before the new content?
---
Then don't unequip that perks. We need loadouts, but we all need that perks are options.
---
I’m on Xbox, I think I have an extra metal plans I can give you, if your interested DM me.
---
Yip, and why do I only get 21x45 per batch but 36x5.56???
---
I always forget to put on my weapon artistian or my ammosmith perk before creating ammo and fixing guns and it gets me every time 
---
"most of Europe"? Not to be picky or anything but technically Europe has -1 to +9 hours. That's 10 time zones.
---
From Iceland to Russia (since Russia is in both Europe and Asia). Sorry im an ass sometimes \*haha\*
---
15:00 for Sweden atleast! Expecting the servers to be down for atleast 5 hours.
---
I had this happened to me before, i had literally to store everything that touched the wall from me to remove it. 
---
Oh man. PS4!
---
I saw many people raised their concerns on the topic of expensive shotgun ammo. This and flamer ammo cost should definitely be rebalanced.
---
Also, it happens so that shotgun builds never appealed to me, so I accumulate shells for no purpose and can easily spare several hundreds if you want (and if you're on PC). Pm me your ign, I'll be in game for the next couple hours or even 'till the maintenance starts.
---
Thats the best part!
---
Well I don't think so. But before Wastelanders, yes
---
1) Well, I';m sorry you think a game stripped of all content is interesting. For the overwhelming majority of sensible people, it isn;'t./
---
2) Opinion? I'ver laid out that Bethesda \*did not\* 
---
4) It is an observation of reality. For all the reasons I have laid out. 76 is a fucking awful fps. You've just ignored those reasons then went "but opizionz." It's a complete piss-take tbh
---
5) 
---
5) No, I never said that choice was bad design. Games like D:OS2 give you practically unnlimited choices. So idk where you get off implying that I said that chouces are bad design.
---
6) If you want Bethesda to keep on insulting you with their approaches to how they design games, that's yourr own prerogative. You can have an opinion, just so happens that you have a shit opinion
---
7) Then stop using that phrase to defend shit games.
---
8)  
---
Yeah, Appalachia is diverse. The people who created the world are seemingly the only people who actually gave a shit when making this game. That's completely irrelevant as well, because I told ytou that Bethesda releasing a mostly bug-freed game is an impossibility. Bethesda have run up a fair amount of infamy for buggy as fuck releases. That hasn't changed. Ever. You're in your own little fantasy world where Bethesda apparently has the competence to pull of a release that isn't mostly buggy. For Bethesda titles, you need to mod them to make them excellent. That's even true for something as popular as Skyrim.
---
Thanks for the offer, unfortunately I'm on PS4.
---
So you want me to run around with power patcher, weapon artisan, and fix it good in my intelligence all the time? 🤦‍♂️ nah. I'm ok. 
---
Because we believe everything needs to be buffed and complain when something gets nerfed.
---
Yes! I do.
---
I've only seen this on SB. So many 3* kills that I can't find the body or it vanishes. Kill 3* level 91 Deathclaw, see weapon, and poof.
---
Much more hats and avatars in the atomic store 
---
Legal mumbojumo I think.
---
Same. I need people to play with but I don't want my real info on Reddit or other platforms so I can't ever share it. I saw someone up in the comments say you can create a ticket to have it changed. I'm going to try that route today but I don't have high expectations. 
---
Lol. No thanks. I get where you coming from with the saved loadouts. But I already have that option with mods on pc but I'm scared of mods. I want to be forced to make choices not swap perk cards or select a saved loadout. After all, it is a survival game. 
---
Оh, ok... We'll wait and see, maybe someone else would add me to get some freebies then -))

So your gonna think why did this guy give me a link to a mod manager, but it also does common ini tweaks. Just don't load mods with it if you don't want.

You're not too late.  All the details are here:  https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44432/~/why-did-i-receive-a-different-bag-than-expected-with-the-fallout-76-power-armor
---
Time and commodities are a resource. And a valid gameplay resource. You have the choice of use time to change perk cards or play the game with a build (obviously, that build is not optimized for everything).

I’ve never had much issue with people pvp, I have pacifist mode on and normally give them a thumbs down. Only two occasions have annoyed me, once yesterday when I was playing with two low levels (6 and 13) and a level 43 came along and killed them both then server hopped before I had a chance to get to them. 
---
Then the second time I was in white springs and this level 30 was trying to hit me, baring in mind I’m level 82. He tried this for a good 5 minutes doing minimal damage, so I hit him back, killed him and his level 93 friend came out of nowhere tried to kill me. Little did he know my boyfriend was round the corner who is also level 82 and we killed them both. Bad tricks. 
---
more than 91LVL glowing deathclaw and Sentry Bot? LOL
---
That is actually a good point and kind of what I've been doing, at watoga anyway. 
---
you point number 3. would be a great addition to the game and something that i think it will help the multiplayer experience in the game
---
Odd. I'm assuming you have the latest GPU drivers installed so I have really no idea why this happens for you. The 1060 is not exactly underpowered.
---
Aclose to 200 plastic in 20-30 min at Watoga HS dependably
---
Crikey... I guess it pays off to be a douche to those bots.
---
I may or not perhaps taken advantage of the fact that you can 'farm' the Watoga robots with impunity possibly but I definitely didn't and it wasn't me.
---
It would make my Johnny Guitar RP character make more sense

Not really hyped for any new content before i see how much they break and stealth nerf today. Otherwice waiting for new content 
---
🤷🏻‍♂️ agree to disagree? We just spinning our wheels here. 
---
not at all, in fact 99.9 % of the time I find someone its always been a nice interaction and more often than none we end up teaming up
---
Isn’t shear terror, which contains the new cryptid content, not out until April 9 th?
---
well that sucks, lets hope crossplay comes down the line and we can play together
---
Thank you for sharing your insights.
---
Yeah it's something i'm looking and hoping for, but, you know, when it's crossplay time, well, Sony sucks
---
How are people able to get 1k with the gauss rifle?  I’ve got all the rifleman perks and tank killer butI get around 280 with my 2shot...maybe 350 if I pope some cems. Is it just the bloodied legendary and adrenal reaction or am I missing some obvious perks?
---
I’m running more of a vats crit build but  im really curious. 
---
Is it me, or would 100% only be double the typical damage? I might be wrong?
---
Whoa, thanks for those amazing spreadsheets! They definitely will help.
---
One chameleon armor piece is enough. Just go for ultralight armor across the board. What you really want is three star armor that has the "harder to detect while sneaking" effect (different from chameleon). Most people seem to ignore it, but it makes a huge difference.
---
Rofl you might just be on to something or maybe a mole rat lol
---
oh pso2 does this
---
not how its calculated.

Sorry but in no way has Europe up to UTC+9, as nothing beyond the Ural is by any means considered Europe. Europe is UTC+0 to UTC+3 (+4, technically) [https://c.tadst.com/gfx/750w/tzmap-europe-2014.png?2](https://c.tadst.com/gfx/750w/tzmap-europe-2014.png?2) Iceland is UTC+0, not -1.

It’s a “live service” game which is the industry’s way of saying here’s a broken ass game we are going to be adding new content to over time. Therefore a patch.
---
DLC implies payment for content

Yes, drivers are alyways up to date.

I never used a sight just vats

Is this for real?

I hate seeing people’s shitty account names. Nothing rips you out of immersion faster than seeing kushboy420lolol yell at the wall in an attempt to get into mysteries hideout without the veil.

Yeah. Not true at all. 
---
I mean I was fighting dude with a build where if he stood still he couldn’t die he took no damage 
---
I think a good idea would be to have a favourites wheel for the perk loadouts. A set of cards for one build and a set of cards for another all on one quick switch between favourites. To make the swapping less arduous.
---
Hilary didnt win the election.
---
He would have had sentinel (-15%) and assassins (-8% from players)
---
Yup lol painful battle lol 
---
Try to switch to borderless instead of full screen? i get way better performance in borderless mode.

Just to the north of the exploding scarecrow shrine is an unmarked moonshiners shack too. Thanks for doing this in having heaps of fun looking for the locations I haven't yet discovered!
---
Lame. Stop with the spam. 
---
Nobody cares about your opinion/idea enough for it to keep being reposted over and over. 
---
I think perk loadouts are obviously what needs to happen but, I think a perk card wheel you can open and select without going to the perk menu may be a nice feature. Similar to [warframes new endless equipment wheel](https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https://apptrigger.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/333/files/2018/09/gear-wheel-warframe.jpg&amp;c=sc&amp;w=1272&amp;h=702) This is the old wheel I think.

Sorry. I often see them west of big town too.

I built my first house up at #5. So pretty.

I think you have to consider the cap cost to take workshops. The min is 25 caps to claim, the max is 100. If you scale the caps below 100 it's hard to profit from. 
---
I run a couple sets, one of which without assassin gear. Assassin gear is powerful, but even with damage reduction armor players do enough damage that it becomes a non-issue.
---
Sentinel/cavalier is destroyed by staggers. Throw on one gun army and a high rate of fire weapon. You'll shred them in a second. Or just use a crit, since crits stagger and ignore sentinel.
---
Ohh wow. 
---
It depends on the range you want to be shooting at. Reflex is good for close to medium engagements. Functionally, it's no different then other reflex sights though.
---
Ok thank you

Indeed it is - which is why I never bother with those.   Avoid those like the plague!

You're still here?

I've only had things respawning 1 time in my camp since the bulldoze function came out. I've stayed in the same place the whole time.
---
When I kill a 3* legendary, and get a 1* armor every time, this is an issue.
---
Hacking and lock picking are Godly, right... If only they had some sort of SPECIAL system limit this god mode you speak of. 
---
Yep lately I'm lucky if I get a 1 star item from them. I got a drill from a 3* mirelurk queen, i wasn't too happy lol.
---
Fucking lol. Nice response. 7.8 / 10 - IGN
---
Pleasure, glad that you find them useful. 
---
crafting the civil war top hat now requires 1 cloth and 1 X-01 jetpack

Too much water.
---
High perception = you get to equip lots of perks extremely useful for rifle/VATS builds.
---
You need 9 points just to equip the 3 basic damage increase perks for rifles or automatic rifles.
---
Add to that 3 more for Anti-tank and 3 for Concentrated fire and you're already capped.
---
But yeah it will increase your success chance in vats too
---
Bugs?  He’s visited through DC and the Mojave. WV has nothing on them.

Whats does vats mean I am a scrub I do not know?

Sorry this comment is loosely related but you reminded me to ask this: has anyone else found that most of the vendors in the enclave bunker are ‘busy’ and can’t be used except for one out of each set? So if more than one person wants to use the science vendors they have to queue like at the train stations.
---
Hope I can get my 250 Caps back

PVP isn't much more broken than the rest of the game is, which is still quite a bit. That said, I've PvPed plenty of people that have accused me of hacking. I wouldn't confuse losing with cheating unless I was sure. I don't see rampant lag switching or anything during PvP
---
Would not surprice me 😂

Yes I've had that experience too. I just try another screen and it works

No survival game is about end game. Anytime I see somone say the end game is lacking in a survival game obviously they are playing it all wrong.

I have one. The plasma flame thrower. There is also a barrel that will make it a plasma shotgun but I don't  want to try it yet because I am afraid I won't get the flamer mod again if I don't like it. It does melt enemies but the ammo is expensive to make  so I use it sparingly .
---
&gt; Those are by far the best physical/energy resist armors in game (Non-legendary) and fantastic weight.

Apparently there was an item duplication exploit involving those MODUS terminals; only the middle one remains active, the other two were disabled as means to counter the exploit. 
---
An explosive shotgun kills an enemy with 1 shot at appropriate range. With the ability to kill multiple targets at once with 1 shot. The cost is fine, the issue is non-explosive shotguns are just plain horrible unless you're face to face with an enemy.
---
Bricks is nice if you use Clean Walls mod...
---
Duping hasn't been fixed. That's probably why they want caps. One of the open duping methods costs a lot of caps.
---
I don't lock anything. Leave a sign up for people to help themselves. I live on top of an acid extractor and have two water purifiers so people can stock up.
---
Also have extra beds and an extra power armor frame in case 2 people come by in a group and want to do some power armor repairs while they are there.
---
There really is no point in locking stuff. oh no, I might only get 6 acid instead of 10 when I go back to my camp!
---
Nobody:

PC elitists: YoU sHoUlD gEt a PC XD
---
Does it get attacked often? Do you fast travel on top?
---
you know, reflex sights are amazing for vats. scopes and sights give an accuracy bonus and an AP cost penalty, but reflex sights are at a nice spot where they give you a noticeable accuracy buff and at hardly any cost.
---
I just helped power level another player who was lvl 8 yesterday. We did a Whitespring pass twice, and one run of Uranium Fever. He gained 7 levels, myself 2 (I'm 62), it's absolutely INSANE. I really hope nothing comes to my sanctuary of XP.
---
Don't you get notified if someone starts destroying your stuff? I have never had it happen but if I ever got the notification I would just leave the server.
---
The Warehouse plan gives you the dilapidated metal shack walls. 
---
The brick plan gives you the walls that are brick outside and white plaster inside. 
---
The Barn plan gives you red barn walls. 
---
The Metal plan gives you the blue, high tech metal walls. 
---
Is there a difference in this game?
---
I would love a glass style to make a Greenhouse too.

At lvl 100 I unlocked a bipod for my knife

I’m sure there are plenty of atomic shop additions like this coming eventually...we can’t have everything right away!

Morgantown high school, cat house, and Watoga high school. Super duper, and ammoamith. Lots of shotgun shells. One farm only takes about 15 minutes.

Last weekend we had her down to a quarter health and she just flew away for no reason. We were just standing there like wtf. Wasted so much ammo. 
---
Cranberry relish plus a sleep buff plus the enlightened event plus a leader bobblehead is xp madness. Lol. With those stacked you can almost gain a level per west tek run. 
---
**Perk Loadouts and passive perk cards are not solutions to the same problem!**  
---
While perk loadouts would make switching perk cards faster, we would still need to switch perk cards and that would still be boring considering we have perk cards for everything we do, from bartering to repairing, crafting etc.  
---
Perk loadout is useful for lots of stuff like:  
---
\- You have a PA+Heavy Weapons build and all your heavy weapons broke. So you grab a Golf Club from a dead Scorched body and switch to your melee perk cards.  
---
\- You're fighting the SBQ and need to get the most of all the weapons you're carrying because they're surely breaking mid-fight.  
---
\-Etc.  
---
Passive Perk Cards are useful for not having to switch cards every time we will   
---
* barter
---
* lockpick
---
* hacking (which is already boring by itself. we've been hacking that way since FO3)
---
* repair armor
---
* repair weapons
---
* craft armor
---
* craft weapons
---
* cook food
---
* craft ammo
---
* build random stuff in CAMP/workshop
---
* build turrents in CAMP/workshop
---
And no, having separate slots for non-combat cards is not a solution because unless you can put ALL your non-combat perk cards in those lots, you would still have to swap. Can it just like work like in Fallout 3, New Vegas and Fallout 4?  
---
Some of those items on that list are still there 
---
If you don't let an starred legendary enemy mutate (regen health) it sometimes doesn't drop a legendary item. 
---
It used to give twice as much xp. 
---
You're always going to be able to stash a similar amount of stuff.  If a perk card like this existed Betheada would balance the weights of everything around that and ultimately nothing would change.
---
Blackbird power armor paint.
---
i actually quit playing lol
---
The games bad and beyond help
---
Waiting for their first "free expansion" before i even think of jumping in again
---
Overall a very meh product and Bethesda support isnt as fast or as prompt as they led everyone to believe they would be
---
Be on tomorrow night from 10pm ish - 5am PST.
---
I guess this list isn't all just limited time only. But many of the floors, doors, paintings, rugs...I'm so jealous of the players who have them. 
---
Also some explosive weapons perks for grenades are in there
---
Naturally no one wants to being it up, but how about non-legendary enemies dropping legendary loot? Happens all the freaking time. They're mislabeled. There's a huge difference in how my weapons hit a legendary and non-legendary healthbar, and the second im striking a faux-legendary I know it. If you weren't one shotting everything you'd probably notice the difference as well. Legendary enemies that don't Regen health are usually lootless, normal enemies with abnormally high health tend to drop loot.
---
That grenade perk is great for precision 'nading npcs from stealth.

Grahm doesn't wander around the map on his own, he is just a random encounter, so someone has to spawn him. Other than the traveling vendor bot, though, he doesn't stay where he spawned but starts walking around as long as he finds something to do.

It's not a laser rifle. Its a weird exploding thing that destroys itself faster than it destroys enemies.

Explosion =/= zap-zap

I waited for it to go on sale and it did at gamestop for 40 bucks went to grav it and they told me the deal was gone even though it still said it online. I left and bought it from Bethesda for full price. Gamestop is ran by a bunch of imbeciles.
---
i havent seen or got one from looting. 
---
wait until your lvl 45 and craft it. 
---
You ever heard of “rockets”?
---
I don't really use my SG much, so I always seem to have plenty, unfortunately the melee Players think Shotguns are OP'd so it's not likely that we will see any sort of Buff to SG Power or Ammo Production.
---
Try Adding Grafton High School, Morgantown High School, &amp; Fort Defiance to your Material runs, and you should be fine.
---
I'm betting they'll just go the disney route and "open the vault" in the future,  get that hype train back up and make us spend those atoms.
---
If it makes you feel better I feel as though ALOT of these items haven't even been released yet. Just datamined stuff.
---
Thank you.
---
Interesting! I just figured I didn't see many of these items. 
---
Who picks locks? The loot inside is garbage anyways...
---
I mean... no. There are already perks that boost experience when in a team. You could literally max that out, have your buddy do a nuked whitesprings, and power level to 50 without firing a shot or putting yourself in harms way. 
---
How hard is it to just tag an enemy once and let your higher level friend tank/finish him?  This sounds lazy to me. 
---
its all in your charater build, and you have to remeber melee build are super powerful. 
---
Lolz like anyone’s gonna go hand to hand w/missile launcher.
---
Please, YES!
---
I'm afraid I'm gonna be asleep by that time already -)) my timezone is GMT +4
---
Right.  I meant when I level up, I get to choose from say...15 cards on any given category.
---
  Once I've made a selection and applied a card - when I go back to the picklist, those 15 odd card choices in each category are no longer there.    
---
  If the big list are cards is derived from the card packs you  "earn" when you each the "divisible by 5" levels, then why dont I see them any time I open the perk list?
---
yes Sony is been a little bratt about it. soon they will have no choice to jump in, I read a few days ago that even nintendo are doing some stuff with microsoft.
---
Yes please, bring thiis back!! Oh and make sure this is implimented in the next patch :-D
---
I have a job that keeps me workong some 10 to 12 hours a day, and a wife as well. I dont get to sink hours into gaming like I used to xD. My friends are all mostly the same way.
---
And we do do that! But the point I am making is everytime we play and someone wants to try a new character we end up playing Whitesprings Zombie simulator for a week vice actually enjoying the game.
---
There should have been perk cards and perk stickers.
---
 stickers for things like barter, repair, crafting, picking and hacking, looting.
---
 cards for things like carry weight enhancement, combat egg.
---
Cards you pick when you level up, stickers you would unlock naturally  from related activities. The More you craft, barter, repair  the better rank sticker you unlock and add to your book.
---
Stickers are permanent to your character and can't be shared in groups, cards can be swapped out and can be shared in groups.
---
How's that?
---
I couldn't have said it better myself.
---
This needs to happen. I use the stats from fallout 4 as a guide to work out if an item for sale is the weight I want.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Combat_armor_(Fallout_4)

I agree with the sentiment of the post but this game will never be a MMO. At least in a way comparable to most other MMOs.
---
Very constructive answer :)
---
More than twice, every Ghoul was awarding legendary level XP.

I hit that a few days before it was fixed, and picked up 7 levels in one Nuked WS run (40 minutes +/-)

Like your complaining about plastic when a mininuke takes that plus Nuclear Material and screws, my 40mm rounds take springs, aluminum, adhesive. My missles  take screws as well and only make like 3 a batch. 
---
I mean I have sights but don’t use them
---
A concrete set would look good too.
---
I like to think its an SMO lol
---
Oh yeah that will be awesome.Or build shellter with fire to heat-up your character so you wont get sick.
---
My metal walls would like to have a word.....
---
But I do agree, it would be cool to have new sets, maybe ones with windows that AREN’T broken!  I mean, we can craft state of the art iron man armour, but making glass is too far? Lol. Some day. Some day. 
---
But they're adding so little... And there is still so much wrong... Tell me why I should get back on? For an hour's worth of quests? There's nothing to do still
---
No, we shouldn't
---
Today is only brewing. That first panel just means that the wild appalachia updates begin on the 12th and gives a snippet of the content coming.
---
Sheepsquatch is not coming until April 9
---
Yeah reporting the fuckery is crying.
---
And please make it the first word of the item description, so we can sort our armors so much better!
---
I'm against this idea because it eliminates all sacrifice for choosing a build. You would now become a master of all trades with the the only sacrifice being make is regarding what level you are. If that the case then what's the point of leveling at all?
---
I hate seeing this, though.  Loadouts are a must, but instant swap feels flat.  Should at least have to open pipboy imo.  There should be a risk of death if you're mid fight an want to say "Oh, I'm melee now."
---
People in this sub want to be every class at once.  That kills so much thematically in the game.  Much better to rock up, sneak/sniper, thin out.  Then melee/shotgun after coast is clear.  Then loot/craft after you've cleared/claimed the area.  
---
TL;DR Easy faster loadout swaps, but not instant.
---
it would be illegal for them to do this. 
---
&gt; Maybe is time to totally not farm the Whitesprings one too but definitely not and if I do it wasn't me either.
---
*knock knock knock* **FBI OPEN UP**
---
&gt; I've been making sure to take my time with them and letting the health regen as long as I've been doing that I notice I mostly get 2 or 3* from them
---
This is a weird myth I've been seen getting perpetuated around here a lot.
---
Can confrm, are correct
---
I go there once every 2 weeks and leave with 1500 lead scrap. Excavator + every bit of Lead Ore and Super Duper 3 when smelting = lodda lead
---
Dammit! (((The Man))) realised that I was once again exceeding the fun/hour limit!
---
You might be in a no build zone after today's patch
---
I heard vat crits go through that
---
Yea, you're absolutely right. I didnt realize the stock mod impacted condition that much. They'd also go up some (less than what the stock gives) if I removed the scopes, but the scopes help with VATs accuracy. 
---
I just picked up an extended legendary flamer from a drop at WS and it’s badass.  Too bad it sucks down duel like nobody’s business. 
---
My modded explosive shotgun pushes 300dmg with all the perks.  I farm constantly for shells but also buy from other players as often as I can.  I’m usually running about 2k in inventory at any given point.  
---
Cryolator ammo. All I'm gonna say
---
yeah, turned my PC on before leaving for work so it's ready to go at 5
---
It's entirely possible.
---
Psst… 
---
you get 50 fuel for scrapping a flamer
---
Glass walls would be amazing. 
---
Do different walls have different strength?  I use metal myself because I assume they are more durable.
---
Upvote for ironic use of deepstate/the_donald parenthesis
---
Really? Then I could destroyed him lmao 
---
&gt; are west tek and watoga doable solo? Also, are these places regularly overtaken by the super elite solo players with the best weapons who can kill them all in one spray?
---
WestTek can be a pain flying solo, too many supermutants in one room at a time, I just don't like the place. Watoga is a quiet place to farm solo after you have done Mayor for a Day, but do yourself a favor and don't do that quest before you're level 50 (you will be rewarded the All Rise super sledge, and it is leveled loot, so you'll want the lvl 50 version of it).
---
As for the 'super elite solo players' and Watoga: no, we'll just rush through town and move on (to come back later), I never see people crouch camping there, unlike Whitesprings where everyone tries to steal the mobs you've spawned... 
---
And if high level players are present, you can just tag all the mobs (shoot them once with a low damage rifle or submachine gun) to get all the XP and loot for free, plus the Dropped Connection event might be active as well, and you'll reap all the benefits from that even if you are just in the area, doing nothing. ;-)
---
The pool area next to WS golf club has a fair amount of plastic with life preservers and stacks of cups in the kitchen.  
---
I ended up just walking away cuz then he couldn’t reach me lol
---
As a level 120 I helped power level a friend, he got a crazy amount of levels in just 4 hours. 
---
Yep hope it's true I based a build off off it
---
Probably April 9th, player vending and a new questline. As well as brewing, and checking out the PVP server. That's if you like the game, but ran out of content. 
---
I might too, I'm built at the end location of the mistress of mysteries quest.
---
At first I thought perk cards would be a way to make your role in a team more specialized, and it sort of is. When in a team it is much easier to have a guy dedicated to certain tasks and combat style so he has to change his cards less, in effect it’s him running his build at its most efficient form.  For example if you have a shotgunner with lockpick your rifleman doesn’t have to keep swapping our his perks to pick locks. 
---
However, the fact that we can have perks vastly outside of our builds parameters, and swap them on the fly also makes this one of the easiest games to handle by yourself, all you need is a minimum of 3-5 perk points in any given slot and you can handle literally everything without a team, save for some tougher boss fights. The perk cards don’t serve to limit your build at all when you can carry all of them at once, in fact it means your 5 intelligence guy can be a master craftsman of both energy and ballistic weapons of all forms, he just has to take a second to shuffle cards. 
---
I still think we should be able to adjust builds to fit a team or situation better, but I think some cards like Lockpick and Hacker should become passive abilities, and cards that directly effect combat like healing and damage cards should be the ones we need to swap, but we have to store any cards not equipped in our stash. 
---
Or you can just not use lock pick and hack. I haven't taken any of those cards on my second play through and honestly I can't tell the difference it literally doesn't have an impact on the game. 
---
Coulda fooled me. Someone reports on the fuckery in gaming and fanboys complaining "stop saying what's bad with games I like".
---
You’re exactly right about the crystallizing barrel. Plus it adds ballistic damage to it too, which benefits from stabilized. 
---
Gotta craft your own ammo though. Can’t rely on finding it. Lucky hole mine or the giant tree town (forget the name) are good for this.
---
I actually really enjoy playing my new low level character, because I don't have all utility perks yet so there's no swapping. It honestly does get *so* tedious, to the point where I ended up just not bothering to pick locks or hack terminals. 
---
True dat  Love my exposive shotgun 
---
Ok, Bye
---
Would love to make a greenhouse for my garden.
---
What can I say? I like to be concise. 
---
I thought using apparently was starting to get a bit lowery to the point of superfluous. 
---
Ha!
---
Yeah and double explosion radius is pretty nice
---
Nice build! Are those lower steps from the environemt? 
---
I was running through the Wendigo cave for the key fragment quest from Rose last night and got stuck a few times.  I had 5 cores showing and the current one was at 30%.  Is there any thing that changes when the cores get low? or do they just work till they are dead?  
---
I had to exit the armor at one point and put it back down to get out.  I did notice one time where I thought I was stuck but I was just hitting the wall.  It didn't look like I was close enough to the wall to hit it, but I think that's what that was.  
---
I had a similar experience where I fell into a hole when not in PA and I couldn't move, so it might just be that it's falling into a small hole in the ground.  But you would think that a suit that was designed for working in mines would be able to step out of a small hole in the ground.  
---
Yeah it was ridiculous. With XP buff items you'd be getting 600+ per ghoul. Took them so long to fix it that many people already grinded out hundreds of levels off the exploit by the time it got patched
---
I enjoyed it tremendously as well.  The quests bright me in and kept me, I stopped as to not burn me out, but am excited 
---
Lol downvoted by people with a thin grasp on human language 
---
Thanks! There is a stair from the environment, but you cant use it cause my build is in the way.
---
Yeah, they drop plans for that and for an electrified chinese officer sword
---
I mean, it's pretty strong. Nice to have when you're using a missile launcher for something big and a mole rat or something comes out of nowhere. Of course, it was much more useful in F4 back when you couldn't just hop up with marsupial and bird bones to rain fire from above
---
Yes. Which is why I think you should only be able to switch cards at your camp or a party members camp.
---
But do you have the 4x scope on it?
---
You need serums, its impossible otherwise! I tried it more than once, its random what mutation goes away with Rad Away and if you manage to get a fair amount it is just annoying to get rid of the unwanted. After probably 100 serverhops i quit and just get everything.
---
This is amazing. Thank you for taking the time to do this. I will be visiting all in order in the near future. 
---
I’ve not seen anyone mention this, but just slightly south west of #11 - Behemoth Pond is an abandoned campsite. It’s nothing crazy special, but it has some hanging radstags, and off the dock in the dried out “lake” are some toys. There are other items there too but I can’t remember atm. 
---
Not sure if it is big enough to warrant being added, but thought I would share anyways.
---
Again, fantastic job on this
---
Just a heads up, Europe hasn’t moved to summer time yet, so New York is only 4 hours behind London, and 5 hours behind for Paris 
---
Yes, the "Unlocked BoS" you get by scrapping is only for the combat helmet, you can't unlock the arms / legs / torso by scrapping, and after patch 6 you can't find the at any vendor.
---
I have on both PC and Xbox tried every treasure maps i had and all events i could go to, nothing, something was done / bugged after patch 6, if we are lucky it will be fixed today...
---
If your on Xb1 i can sell you shotgun shells. Make me an offer. GT - WyldZ3ro74
---
Just have different perk card builds you can switch easily between. 
---
Why thank you kind human person!
---
Your share is much appreciated. 
---
Hopefully never, we don't want cheaters in the game.
---
I'd really prefer Survival to be a harder difficulty setting basically with open PvP and new characters required, I was just saying that what u/lumpensolker described sounded cool too.
---
I want to love my black powder weapons but without a scope they're so situational it's not worth the extra weight (in the gun and the ammo). 
---
Passive habilities could work in a special-dependent way. Example:  
---
You have lvl 3 Super Duper perk card, but only have 1 Luck. Then you have a passive hability of Super Duper lvl 1.
---
I’m not going to lie, but I have no idea. Like you I just assume so. Makes me feel more secure in this Wild Appalachia......lol, sorry I had to.
---
Than you should still have it. I crashed at least 8 times with my PA standing around...
---
Be the change you want to see.
---
\# Wow. Didn't expect the platinum. Thanks!
---
Non-combat perks shouldn't be perks, they should be permanent abilities.
---
They could also let us have actual perks. Reducing hunger and thirst isn't a bonus, it's necessary. Giving us cards that let's us role play as a first responder or the BOS would be nice.
---
Never gonna happen though, gotta update that Atom shop and request more QOL suggestions from the BETA testers, er I mean, paying customers.
---
You buy ammo and explosives too.
---
To be a proper MMO, there needs to be a persistent chat window filled with trade/auction spam and heated political debates by 12-yr-old ignoramuses
---
Every time a fo76 post makes it to the main page, it's so dramatic.
---
Woo games finally breaking out of its beta testing phase 
---
Same here, I've been playing AC origins and Odyssey so much the past month, I think I'm starting to experience the bleeding effect...
---
Is the game good yet? I slapped 200 hours and the final 50 of those bored me to death with the bugs and repetitiveness 
---
I personally would love a green house building set, but agree we need more.
---
Again, no. Not trying to be a dick here... I also work 50+ hours a week and have a wife with a baby on the way. I understand the time constraints that we have as we get older. But doing what you’re suggesting would unbalance the game. 
---
If you’re bored with whitesprings, there are other areas to farm. West Tek comes to mind right away. Charleston or vault tec university for nuke zones... lots of mobs there (admittedly not as many legendaries). 
---
what is a set of d20s
---
For what it’s worth... Harpoons cost 3 adhesive to craft too 
---
Though using a flechette one basically generates ammo for you as there’s usually 3-7 on dead enemies 
---
I think an easy and relatively simple solution to a few perk related problems would be to have two sets of perks that you can toggle between with a hot key. Basically switch between combat and non combat. 
---
Or rather tank perks or stealth, team doc or gunkata warrior. It doesn’t over complicate things and should be relatively easy to manage and alter. 
---
Been playing around 500 hours and must have killed quite a number of them but never see those plans. Seems extremely rare.
---
I saw someone post a study once.  Their conclusion was 1:4:5 durability ratio for wood:brick:steel.  
---
How much for the Violet Flux and how much have you got?
---
The closest thing we may get is pvp events that span multiple servers. They hinted at something like that but it seems like something that is far away. 
---
I’m just playing the game like a single player game. I sometimes run into other people. Sometimes we talk or trade or quest together. I do wish all interactions were made a bit more intuitive though. 
---
This happens a lot with legendary enemies that are fleeing, it seems they are trying to get back to where they were supposed to be in the first place, and the body usually shows up where ever that is, which can be a long way off.
---
I killed a Super Mutant in Pleasant Valley, right behind the Lodge, and is disappeared right when I started to loot it, then I found it 10 minutes later at Skull Bone Vantage.
---
The nature of the perk card system really negates any dissent over playstyles/specific builds because you can change your whole character whenever you want by changing cards. It's only really the player that has to have the discipline to not change them when needed.
---
Like OP says, after a long time of playing the picklock card changing is just tedious, and having 9 points (picklock, hacker, the barter one) of special points allocated to perks you don't always use is just silly, never mind the barely used Science, ammosmith etc perks. 
---
It just needs to be permanent. Hot swapping skills makes having more than 1 character pointless.
---
Got it
---
I lock for the screws mainly
---
Most modifiers are multiplicative, not additive. For example, lone wanderer 3 (-30%) +  one piece of sentinel armor (-15%) = 70% (LW3) * 85% (sentinel) = 60%, a 40% total damage reduction. Were it additive you'd have a 45% DR. This means that there are diminishing returns on stacking modifiers and that a 100% DR is not possible. This also applies to things like anti-armor. 
---
Additionally, there is a minimum damge of 1 that always gets through unless some form of damage avoidance like serendipty procs. Someone correct me if I'm wrong with any of this. 
---
If you had to stack it up to what is out or coming out it's a pass. Maybe after they release all of the content, but that's a hard maybe.
---
&gt; so I should wake up to a brand new world
---
Na, just Alcohol for this week
---
This right here!
---
what about metal? i’m guessing 2 or 3?
---
Fast travels to the bottom of the stairs and a few mole rats or dogs spawn but they can't get past the defenses.
---
Each layer of the stairs has a heavy turret and 5 punji boards so they have to sit there attacking the boards whilst the turret has a clear line of sight and they end up dying.
---
I follow "Video Game Pope" on YouTube and he always posts about deals and new items in the atom shop! I recommend it if you wanna make sure you don't miss out on some things! 
---
I've found a way to deal with this perk system. It may not work for everyone but hopefully for some. What I've done is that I started playing FO4 again and after I have a lot of fun with that I play 76 with friends and since I've done everything we run around and blow stuff up for a bit and then go back to 4. It's been pretty fun and I forget about how frustrating this perk system can become. Maybe it will help others.
---
We need more walls that look more post-apoc, imo the barn and brick sets look really out of place and stick out like a sore thumb. 
---
PC does have controller support
---
Source: Use Controller for Fallout and TES games
---
Steel = metal. 
---
No one likes the perk system, you could argue it can be used to prioritize certain builds over others, but you nerf everything that's not melee.
---
Just make the perks everyone uses like lockpick permanent, get rid of your twelve levels of a single perk card bull and give us actual cards to build a character with.
---
I want to be a cowboy and have perks that make it viable, or I can play as BOS and have cards to buff that. Maybe a bare knuckle brawler or first responder build.
---
But first make sure you update that Atom shop and get feedback from your paying customers you are using for free beta testing. Wait, that's not free, you are actually making money from the players whether y'all do your jobs or not.
---
I used to have a base by Solomon's Pond that was regularly attacked by scorchbeasts (why pick on me?). I had a base that was built out of wood, metal and brick. The wood always used to break first - a couple of blasts from a scorchbeast and the wood would go flying. The metal and brick seemed to be more resilient, but this could also be a factor of the building design. Most of my brick walls were on the lower floor; the upper floor was mostly wood.
---
Bugged. Supposed to be fixed in today’s patch. 
---
Because it breaks integration with the friends and party system, and switching characters and changing names constantly means you don't know who's who anymore.
---
There's already controller support on PC. As for m/kb support on PS4/XboxOne... there's only some third party devices that allow for it.
---
Please just stop talking about Youtubers - all tuyere doing is promoting them.  Controversy will just drive more people to check them out instead.
---
ah, i must be getting the two mixed up. i use the sheet metal crappy looking one, not the fortress style looking one.
---
are they equal in this regard?
---
I'm unlucky with that then.
---
Well, the warehouse set, which is the same as the one from FO4, had enough options to allow you to make a greenhouse. I'm hoping that eventually, they will add in those parts.
---
Not gonna 
---
Or I keep both no strats just whatever helps B)
---
I have a Bloodied Lever Action that's Hardened and Suppressed that doesn't leave my side - I really like the bullet detail on the stock!
---
This baby with Gun-fu and Adrenaline makes me so very happy and the sound effects and gun animations are very satisfying. :)
---
I don’t know. His study used metal buildings versus brick buildings versus wood.  
---
Don't worry, soon you can buy a few of the Fallout 4 building sets. Again!
---
I suggest visiting this amazing place called "The Outside".
---
Scaffolding set from FO4 would be nice...
---
Thanks for this, I look forward to playing around with it. I've been working on something similar for AP regen but I can't figure out how modifiers actually stack based on timing AP regen in game. 
---
Well, there's me...
---
'Norespawns' does good build videos.
---
I've actually unsubbed from a lot of YouTubers on account of their lazy, inaccurate treatment of the game.
---
Grognak axe fixed to 200% condition yes? 
---
ah ok, thank you!
---
That is almost certainly the intention. It's part of a classic model for this type of MTX which creates artificial scarcity and thus drives demand
---
Ha indeed! I will see you in Appalachia then...eventually...selling...player stuff
---
Fix is to remove it with radaway, drink serum or get it from rads and then relogg. Today is supposed to fix it though
---
Oh no... 
---
This sounds like you're way over-hyping the changes coming to the game.
---
Don't get me wrong, it's fine to be excited about the upcoming DLC. However, I think it's a little much to expect there to be much of a change to the base game. Otherwise your about 7 patches too late for saying bye to base game, back when there were many active events available at any given moment, resources were plentiful and the XP climb was less of a grind.
---
&gt; isolate them on separate servers.
---
Umm, no. Leave them banned. You cheat, you get banned, too bad so sad.
---
Hopefully it gets fixed today. But thank you! 😁
---
I would take anything blue.
---
I have broken adrenaline reaction twice: first was last patch and second when I crafted adrenaline serum for a friend. I tilted so hard the second time...
---
My Bloodied dragon went from 2700 dmg to 600
---
Please don't use "MMO" and "Fallout 76" or "this game" in the same sentence. Unless it is "This game, Fallout 76, is not an MMO".
---
It's not an MMO. It never was an MMO. The next patch will not make it an MMO. There's also been literally zero indication that any future changes are going to turn this game into an MMO.
---
Yes, this is a pet peeve of mine, but people have been playing fast and loose with MMO for far too long. I've heard people refer to Destiny or Division as an MMO. They're not. Even Guild Wars (1) wasn't an MMO, and even the developers themselves specifically pointed out that it is not. 
---
If you're red you're dead. I kill every bounty I come across no matter what the caps. If that player is surrounded by a bunch of white dots, it's definitely a trap and I bring friends. PVP is the only thing left that's satisfying.
---
they come back if things get moved at all and not not put back. it seemed the functionality would allow removal of objects from a spot like a bulldozer without having to put items down and use budget. and further more would have been nice to be able to cut stuff do it doesn't clip through the floor or walls....
---
No worries.  
---
You can pretty much tell right away with the resist numbers...

The best place for plastic, I've found, is the Whitespring. There's balls everywhere on the golf lawns.

Welcome to reddit
---
I use bladed melee weapons on radrats molerats
---
If there are passive perk cards, the requirement should be a certain SPECIAL stat requirement. For example:
---
Lockpicking: +1 lockpicking skill for every 3 points in Perception.
---
This way, you'd have to commit at least 9 points to perception to unlock level 3 locks, meaning you'd still have to invest in perception to be a good lock picker.
---
Your not toxic. Toxic people don't think, they just hate.  I think playing since December 12 is pretty close to launch, how badly could it have been for only a few weeks?
---
I have gone back to playing Fo4 a little again. The first thing I noticed going back is that Fo76 characters are such weak noobs... The low level of stat points are lame in Fo76. Higher stats, in my opinion, could actually be attained every fifth level up to level 140 (all stats to 10). Getting a new stat point with every perk pack. I'm at lvl 111 right now, and I have 32 levels of unopened perk cards. I don't see the point of getting more cards that I cant't use. And lvl grinding is not my thing.
---
The PC gamers can use mods to have card decks, and they can even be renamed... I don't really think that we are getting more stat points, so that mod is what I want for PS4.
---
Then they wont be limited time anymore would they?
---
Will add you when I get out of bed. Of I forget please add me. IGN same as here
---
I'm happy to hear about your positive view
---
I just picked up a drop at Whitesprings and it’s a legendary extended flamer.  I tested it out farming ghouls and it was incredible.  The problem is you burn through fuel/ammo like nothing I’ve seen and combine that with the weight and it’s really not that useful. 
---
“Hello there Madam, mind if you leave the bathroom while I do my business? There are light refreshments in the living room.”

---
This has happened to me many times from the piece of crap people who do it. I still havent found a decent weappon to return the favir to them and yes they got me on passive setting too so thats definitely broke at the least. As far as im concerned this whole game is the biggest piece of crap ive ever played and im a hard core fallout fan. It has almost turned me against playing video games at all til they get rid of all the basically mmo games and go back to single player games. I dont want me playing parts of a game depending on this new breed of assholes in the world.
---
Lolz I have both and the handmade. I level all 3 and they all are silenced.
---
Yeah. Sturdy is heavier and higher protection than light, and then heavy is heavier and higher protection than sturdy. 
---
3 Perks to equip the basic damage perks for rifles or auto rifles you mean.  Spending 6 perks for 10% in each not worth it.   If you want to do that just get bloody mess instead, applies to all weapons.  But there are still better ones.  Tormentor for example, Gun Gu is another, Grim Reaper, ect, list goes on and on.
---
Genuine player = denier of reality
---
Indeed.  Happy cake day.
---
Thank you i have just seen that :)
---
Sounds like the sort of mod youd get banned for using
---
If Bethesda had a single person test the game for longer than 15 minutes this, as well as all the other inexcusable design failures, wouldn't have made it to release.  
---
It's incredible that such a profitable company could create such a terrible product.  
---
Remember to buy your atom points to support the devs!
---
Solid advice. Explosive doesn't do much damage as everyone runs with Fireproof 3. Get yourself a bunch of berry mentats as well, there are a lot of stealth boy users out there. 
---
I tried the enlightened event two days ago, there were no toads, and the game wouldn’t let me dump the bio fluid into the lantern.
---
just wanted to say that your response was the most incredibly wholesome response to the ascii emoticons ever
---
I believe Heavy armor also lowers your sneak score
---
When patch 5 was going you could get the bos plans at the vendor i grafton, and also sometime in on og the watoga vendors...

That's fine with me. I would even be fine with  "kill me pls" emote. :)

It's usually once the servers go down that they release them.

What is this "The Outside" you speak of? You use funny words.

This happens to my friend while we're playing. He'll DC and drop xb1 party but I'm unaffected. If it were a server issue I'd imagine I'd be impacted too as we're in the same zone on the same server

Fool. Burnt things are worth 1 cap to vendors.

would this also cause the nearby power facilities to explode as well?

There are many of those deposits in the Forrest region. Not in mines. You can find coal in gualeys mine. Check the workshops too as they have deposits.

i agree 1000%, i cant wait for the new content, and I do like what is instore for us in the future.

A solid emote suggestion so people can die with dignity lol. I rarely loot in PVP. It's not because I'm a raider with a heart of gold, I just don't want to be overburdened. ;)
---
bruh i have 95% vats and miss 95% of the time haha
---
It's hard to really classify it. Consider Phantasy Star Online. It was billed as the first MMO on consoles. It had a 4 player online but had a lobby. What really defines an MMO?
---
&gt;it even follows you across servers
---
No it absolutely doesn't. Please stop spreading misinformation. This is technically impossible without a large and taxing database change.
---
I rebuilt mine because the tippy tops of some long grass were clipping through my floor in the corner of a room.
---
found all my data for damage resistance on fallout.fandom.  
---
Its apparently the same as FO4, according to gamepedia (but they had no actual numbers/formulas). Havent done any real testing in game yet. 
---
You got downvotes but you are absolutely right. This is how this sub is looking at it.
---
Im seriously about to unsub and just not interact with the community when the game is a in a better state. This is disgusting.
---
I have quite a lot of 45s and some 556. Also. 38 if anyone is looking. Willing to trade. GT Benadri
---
I think there is a level threshold, like they need to be 35+ or 40+ to have a chance of dropping them. I remember finding the bladed whacker plan out in the mire when a random group of them spawned in the mountains. I think I found the electrified sword mod plans in that lab near Helvetia though, where you have a guaranteed mirelurk v liberator fight
---
And then change it back!
---
They will. In around 9 months or so. 
---
This is true, but why doesn't it also remember it's unlocked?
---
Wash your mouth, kid
---
Thx mate 
---
I think you raise an interesting idea, but if you get ambushed by PVP while crafting, isn't that the perfect time for the system to allow you to hot-swap into your default combat perks? 
---
Hot swapping during PVE might encourage mixed melee/ranged builds. Non-meta to be sure, but it would be fun, and yet blocked by your system (depending whether they fix "caution"). 
---
I worry that strength-builds benefit too much from hot swapping during combat since they have melee, shotguns and heavy weapons, but I don't think the other specials would be a big deal. I'm not worried about players switching between semi-auto and automatic rifle perks. 
---
That sucks. I've never had that happen there. Always plenty of fire flies if no toads. And never had it not accept muh fluids (phrasing intentional). Hopefully it works for you next time. 
---
second time i read about this... what is the Whitespring pass? any guide?
---
We don't want no scrubs. Thanks for getting that damn song in my head. :)
---
Pretty much, I can't speak for AMD cards but you should use the Nvidia control panel to change your "preferred frame rate" to "highest possible"
---
Seems like a bug. Happens to me too. 
---
I just want inside walls. It's rough making rooms in a house, they end up ugly on one side. 
---
MM"nOt"
---
First hand foremost I feel bad.
---
Seconhandy sorry.
---
Hand I also want to add note the mr handy blade best weapon in the game. Regular one modded electric 200% repair can clear all of white spring (nuked if  specced tanky PA)
---
to be honest, i dont pay attention to that lol i just throw on whatever has the best statsfor me 😂
---
I know there are many deposits around but I was wondering if there were any in one of the caves around the map. I wanted to see if I could make a cave Camp while having a resource extractor.
---
Hope it is fixed the only way I can fix it is to leave and rejoin
---
Just remember that if you use an automatic receiver, you need commando perks, not rifleman perks
---
It's actually not really annoying at all. It's quick and easy.
---
huh? What I'm saying is that calling in supply drops is trivially easy. It's not at all comparable to GTAO business sales which can take hours and 10's of thousands of GTA$ to acquire. Most GTA sales items you can't even steal, only destroy for a paltry $5k or so. So destroying someone's business sale is a dick move because you get virtually nothing out of it, and the time/effort required to create that sale is significantly higher than what the attacker gets for destroying it.
---
Supply drops in 76 are stupid simple though. There is very little time and resources lost when someone steals one because it takes virtually no investment to call one in.
---
I had heard they had either a 1 in 1000 or 1 in 10000 chance to even be there.
---
Ah ok. There is a tunnel system in watoga. Maybe try Hopewell cave. Not sure if you can build a camp there, but I know you can in the watoga tunnels. Just not sure if there are deposits. Sorry I couldn’t be more of help.
---
They're really rare. Along with targeting hud, jet pack, reactive plates, etc. I've seen them since six
---
Saw it several times, only bought it once though so others have a chance to get them. Jetpack on the other side i only saw once. 
---
That makes a total sense. Many of the liberators I've been killing were at low levels. Those cute commie robots, zaijian...
---
Yeah that's why I said rifles or automatic rifles
---
I don't know how to link it here cuz Ima Reddit nub but someone made a resource deposit map that shows the locations of almost all the resource deposits on the map. Super awesome for camp placement decisions. 
---
Okay, so your feelings being hurt or upset by YongYea's videos dont justify a witch hunt or make it not a witch hunt. Its still a witch hunt. You may feel that its not, but you are entirely incorrect. 
---
They are bashing a game on their platform, their channel, where they own control and where their fanbase comes to them. 
---
You dont own this sub, you dont have fans that come here for you. If you really all dislike YongYea just because (as much as i like f076 myself) the game isnt good and he says it without remorse. Its nothing more than that. 
---
There are no lies on his channel. You all just suddenly think this man is human cancer cause he doesn't like the game you play. If you REALLY don't like him then just dont watch his videos and block his channel so they dont pop up in your feed. This is childish behavior.
---
This is absoutley disgusting and toxic behavior, this community for this game is fucked and i honestly dont think i want to be a part of it. And i dont see why and returning players would want to be either.
---
This sub needs to get its shit together and stop worrying about what everyone else thinks. Just play what you like.
---
Around 5 is the minimum, imo. Hacking/lock picking, one or two for crafting, two or three for combat styles.
---
Innit! Pretty sure that’s how downvoting works. I don’t like your opinion (or GT) in this case so I’m going to downvote you! You’ve got to laugh!
---
Exactly. I mean I get it, the loot in these drops isn't great but that can be tweaked. Improving the loot in these things won't require some grand redesign of the game, it's probably not high on Bethesda's priority list but it's not exactly complicated either.
---
Ah, I see you've played WoW ;-)
---
(or probably any other MMO, but I've only got experience with 4-5, and none will ever match WoW trade chat.  But don't even talk about the old Barrens general chat...)

Player vending comes on the 9th next month.

There's pretty much nothing else known about it though. Pribably going to be like those machines you see for ammo and such all over the place.

Personally, I've been collecting bobbleheads and other Vault Tec related gear to sell. Gotta prey on that nostalgia. 
---
Oh wow, nice! 
---
Nah you are wrong there fella
---
Thank you for explaining that, I've never understood the  multiplicative / additive thing on here before.
---
So that means in PvP the sentinel/assanian players are taking 30% damage when stood still?
---
70% (LW3) \* 85% (sentinel) \* 60% (assassin) = 30%, a 70% total damage reduction.
---
The only one I've seen has been after 6. I bought it, but I've yet to find another for the set.
---
I wonder..  is it a mere coincidence that the release of WA was pushed back one day to the exact same date when World of Warcraft would be getting a big update with new content and two new playable races...? 🤔 
---
Maybe it was a tactical decision to keep people from switching over to WoW? Or - maybe it doesn't matter at all...
---
I haven't done it (I don't usually PvP) but I helped a friend do it. That's the whole reason the Warden comes after you, is after you get a wanted on you. You can go back to the Penitentiary and reset the turrets quest and it will clear your name. 
---
You act like the game is going to radically change. That's overly optimistic. I think your post might be misleading to people who are expecting tectonic shifts in Fallout 76's gameplay.
---
Wtf is "Wild Appalachia"?
---
Extremely Rare.
---
I found both of my sets after patch 6.  First set I server hopped a dozen times about the week after patch 6.  Finally got one.
---
Then I ignored it, only checking once per server, never hopping specifically for checking.
---
Then, Monday (two days ago) I happened to join a friend's server, and just before logging out I thought "Hey, I haven't checked the bunker yet".  To my astonishment there was my 2nd X01 shock sitting there waiting for me.
---
I have found 3x X01 Jet Packs since the patch too.  But I just gave those to my friends in need.
---
You actually gave me an idea with the Watoga Tunnel system. Thanks
---
The tone of your post was negative, therefore you are downvoted. No wrongbad thoughts about Fallout 76 will be tolerated lol.
---
Can it be my turn to post this idea tomorrow? Thnx 
---
But seriously yea, it’s a good idea and I’m sure they know by now! 
---
I bought it on PC from enclave vendor like week ago. But some players reported that they appear to be more rare than before.
---
Already have it I was just seeing if any were in caves rather then visit the locations and check them out to see. 
---
Central gang rise up
---
Or you could just let them continue to be happy
---
Yeah people are always quick to say "this game isn't an MMO!" ok that's fair so what **IS** it then?
---
We have a game where multiple players can play simultaneously on the same map, and interact with each other therefore it's absolutely a Multiplayer Online game. MO doesn't seem to be a descriptor that gets thrown around much though. 
---
What was it? It’s deleted now and I’m curious... 
---
Lol. I see. 
---
As the only person in the world who uses basher 2, I resent that!
---
I'm almost certain that's an error and it's supposed to be 50. Otherwise it makes no damn sense. The Acid requirement alone is ridiculous, to the point where it would make more sense to sell for caps and buy fuel with the proceeds... assuming anything sold it.
---
I agree, the costs are not really balanced.
---
I've played as a shotgunner until about level 50. Then i've got annoyed. Always low on ammo
---
I've switched to 45 and 556 and have always more than enough ammo.
---
I'm not disagreeing with your comment, but I suspect that adding some kind of loadout system on top of the current perk card system is "simpler" in terms of development work than creating a significant rework of the perk card system itself. That means that a loadout system is more likely to be built. 
---
Your comment has a lot of interesting information though, thanks :-) 
---
Central is superior 
---
Yes, or fighting in a nuke zone and pick a plant, oops no green thumb equipped you only get one of those. No, you need to bathe in radiation longer while you switch cards.
---
This spot is on my list to place a camp at. Very cool
---
We're still in alpha mate. Beta implies that all the core features have been added and are being tested.
---
i don't think what you buy or don't buy affects anyone in at all.  You should buy them whenever you see them and help someone out
---
No thanks, its already pretty trivial to level up, just play quests.
---
I also work 10+ hours a day (with commutes) and have two kids/wife and yet I find 30-40 mins a day to play.  Not a long time but it is what it is.
---
I have made a character than I only play when friends play.  I have maybe 4 hours played on that character and 240+ hours on my single character.  
---
Perhaps limit your time playing to only the times your friends are available to play the quests like you want rather than farming whitesprings then.
---
Seems like more of a social problem that you have rather than a game problem.
---
I'm also in 6 hour different time zone as friends as well.
---
I think it will (please) come out today but with no quest, just a random encounter. The quest won’t come until April 9
---
Some guy found 3 other killing one of the robots (Maria) in Whitespring shopping area. It giving unusual amount of exp upon killing.
---
I've read and personally seen that the 'diseased' prefix to a creatures name will over write 'legendary' So a diseased mutant hound could also be a legendary mutant hound. I've never seen a diseased with a star so he would not regenerate. I have read that  and only personally seen \* legendary creatures regenerate. I have had 3 or 4 diseased creatures drop a legendary item.  I have also seen super mutants loot a mini gun off the fallen mini gunner and start using it. So this might happen with legendary items too if you are fighting a crowd?
---
Yeah i threw a system that might work, just need some more refining with some atypical scenes that might happen on the game (like the one about the ambush as you said)
---
My vote is to make lock picking and computer hacking similar to the way charisma card sharing functions, but make it more rewarding.  
---
Level 1 Lock Picking/Hacking requires 3 points in PER/INT  
---
Level 2 Lock Picking/Hacking requires 6 points in PER/INT
---
Level 3 Lock Picking/Hacking requires 9 points in PER/INT  
---
Or make the cards entirely passive once learned. The system in place now for these functions is terrible and needs to be reworked.
---
Captainoob for weapon showcase and perks to go with each weapon. 
---
Oxhorn is only for the lore and exploration, his fighting skills aren't that good.
---
I've actually never seen them (shocks or jetpack) in 240+ hours of playing but I don't server hop.  I have visited the enclave bunker well over 200 times though; at least once per play session.
---
I looked everywhere but the cave it spawned it. I saw ghoul slayer which is meh except for White Springs but 3* chance.
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
Just the bloodied and adrenal I would guess. 1k does seem a bit high though, I have a TSE max level on my bloodied character and not sure it goes that high. Rifles are just trash these days though unless automatic
---
Really? I didn’t even Know you could kill the Vendors? 
---
Well, I don't pay for 50 mighty caps to fast travel to low level areas to do horde events. You play how you want to play. I certainly don't see any major problems with them.
---
Thanks!
---
Obviously 
---
Don't know - didn't tried that either.
---
Just checked in the .esm
---
The 'health' values are as follows:
---
Barn - 1000
---
Brick - 3000
---
Metal - 4000
---
Shack - 1000
---
Warehouse - 2000
---
I staggered them a lot lol but they stopped before I could swing again
---
Have you considered that maybe a survival game isn't for you id you hate having to farm for items and material? Why not play a game you like then instead of asking for drastic changes to dumb down this one?
---
Plan your build with nukes and dragons website
---
Ahem. Yes that't true enough, but I typically won't downvote unless its self-promoting, putting out false info, trolling or harassing.   I just cannot bring myself to downvote based on opinions even though I dont like them.
---
In eso, it used to be that only your friends or guildmates can see your account name.  Hopefully they haven't changed that.
---
Sorry kid, but i do own the game on my PS4. And the Fallout 76 sucks ass. You got that? Go drink more energy drinks you edgy internet tough guy.
---
"Your views are so fucking valuable"
---
"Now go cry to mommy for her credit card to buy the Apex seadon pass."
---
You are the best man. Got any more of them insults?
---
I hope they do away completely with the "per item" price.
---
If I want to sell 1,000 rounds of ammo for 300 caps, just let me...
---
And sad! The next best thing is angry then people think I'm mad at them
---
Or do a little math?
---
I'd like it if the brick walls were brick on both sides, instead of some sort of concrete on the other side
---
I was kind of disappointed how dirty they make the inside feel
---
Sounds about right. I stopped trying to get them a while ago. Nowadays if I see something I'll grab it and sit on it until someone asks. As I have several fully modded PA suits. I sold a jet pack and 1 shock last night for 1.5k each. I recommend buying them off another player as well
---
I'm still hoping we might see a barrel mod that turns the Flamer into the Incenerator/Heavy Incenerator from Fallout 3 and New Vegas.
---
Let me sacrifice my 'AoE' conal attack for throwing out arching balls of fire for more range. 
---
PSA Rad-X Diluted does NOT suppress your mutations
---
Is "wtf" like Google? ... Cause I'm guessing your on the internet already.... Maybe look it up.
---
i agree!!!
---
What? Yes we do, the egg did.
---
The egg did by a HELLUVA LONG TIME!
---
Never heard of fish moving onto land? The egg is how they can still "give birth in water".
---
HELL SOME FISH EVEN ALREADY USED EGGS THE EGGS JUST GOT STRONGER SHELLS WHEN THEY MOVED ONTO WATER!
---
Asking that question is like asking "what came first, oil or the car"...
---
Agreed (sorry that was sarcasm, but it didn’t come across in text haha) I’m sure that’s how downvoting is supposed to work but people have other ideas! 
---
I love fighting molemen because of how much ammo they drop for me. At lvl 30 right now and they usually drop enough to last me the next encounter. 
---
I've also gone through ~2k shells getting to this level and fighting so far.
---
Neener, neener, neener, I got mine!.  Seriously though, there was a post just recently about this with a lot of players voicing their desire to have discontinued Atomic Shop items restocked for those who missed out. The Blackbird skin seems to be the number one request.  I didn't realize how fortunate I was to have gotten one at the time.  There were many suggestions about how to have it available, from making it an "earned" quest reward to flat out giving it away to everyone.  I sincerely hope they at least bring it back for a limited engagement so others who missed it or have come into the game recently can have a chance at it.  For now, I'll just have to live with the guilt of having something others can't get (at least for awhile).  
---
Yes, safe zones are CAMPs or anyplace there are vendors.
---
I had one disappear but had to be staying in one of the mines in Ash place doing quests for over an hour.  I did not notice exact time but read online it was 45 mins in non-safe area.  Going to CAMP or any vendor locations will reset the timer.  I assume anyplace that has stashes as well.
---
Oh God, the Barrens...
---
But yeah, did WoW til I got banned (pro tip: don't pay for power leveling when you're sent off on a business trip) and tried Elder Scrolls until the glitches became intolerable.
---
Honestly, the multi-Scorchbeast battle is one of the most fun things in the game now... although I wouldn't want to come home to one every time. 😂
---
Besides the obvious stealth aspect what is the point of a silencer on the shotgun? To me it seems like that kills the whole weapon!
---
I know of cave C.A.M.P. locations and locations with resource nodes but the only one I know with both is that Lead/Acid combo that you mention, which also happens to be right beside a fissure :/
---
This is really cool, I admire the amount of time it probably took aligning the stairs perfectly to the monorail car ×_×
---
I wouldn’t go as far as to call the game an MMO,  but a fun open world multiplayer RPG it still is
---
As others have said, the game already has controller support on PC. But what I’d love to have is instantly swapping controls. 
---
For example in the recent Id games, the assassin’s creed games, and others (don’t know which do and which don’t) you can just put down the controller and start using the keyboard/mouse with no issues. 
---
In Fallout 4/76 if you start the game with a controller connected, the keyboard/mouse controls are disabled until you go in and unselect controller support. 
---
Sometimes I just like to lean back in my chair and enjoy things casually, but then when a big fight is upon me, I’m going to want that mouse. 
---
The warden questline launched for me when I wasn't wanted, but it has been a long time.  I also don't PvP and very, very, very rarely have a wanted status.  Usually its an annoying 5 cap bounty from something stupid I did.  Not enough for other high levels to come looking for me, but low enough that low levels think it's some sort of trap when I ask them to kill me. I can be standing naked and unarmed in Whitesprings, waiting for death, and people just wave as they pass.  fml.  
---
Funny thing, there is a - as far as I know not yet implemented but I do not PvP and not everything has been decoded yet so i cannot be sure - 'bankruptcy penalty' SPELL record that penalises players that cannot 'pay their bounty' with - 50% damage to other players coded in the esm. 
---
Central is behind the times :-p
---
I really hope you stay banned. We don’t need your type.
---
He was good before now he’s full of himself pass on this guy 
---
Tomorrow? Doesn’t it roll out today the 13th?
---
What's going on? I've been away for a couple months and I have clearly missed a lot.
---
The bug is that wearing your Excavator Power Armor upon login in is giving players an extra 100 carrying capacity beyond the 100 pound carry weight bonus the set already has. You are not supposed to get a 200 carry weight bonus from Excavator Power Armor. When you exit your Excavator set you lose the the glitched extra 100 pound carry weight bonus. 
---
You aren’t the first person to make this mistake. Now if you do actually want 200 pounds of carry weight from the Excavator set you need to install Calibrated Shocks on each leg. Calibrated Shocks give 50 pounds of carry weight each. 
---
It's a good point, and I'm pretty sure Bots on Parade always does that for me... just like how it always ends on 7/8 enemies killed...
---
But still, I'd like to think that VATS could detect a player versus an NPC.  In general, the thing that annoys me most about VATS is when it comes to Scorchbeasts.  If I'm looking directly at the Scorchbeast - have my reticle on it and everything - don't VATS me onto the freakin' Scorched Conquerer over to the left.
---
There's a bug with excavator power armor that adds 100 carry weight when you first log on. The carry weight reverts to normal if you exit it then re-enter. If you server hop while in the armor you'll get the 100 carry weight back.
---
Oxhorn seems to just kiss Beth’s ass tbh, so he wouldn’t be an option either
---
That part I'm unclear on and I have no insights on how the game actually calculates multiple pieces of armor (e.g. if a full set of assassins is -40% or (-8%)^5 as it does make a difference (albiet small). I'm not sure about players taking no damage in PVP as there are so many factors that could account for that on top of numerous bugs and/or exploits. I use VATs a lot and occassionally have weapons that bug out and do no damage until I leave the server. 
---
I'm currently trying to figure out how the game cals AP regen based on testing in game refresh times. I haven't found a definitive value for AP refresh armor and my results are wildly inconsistent when using multiple pieces and different combos of the relevant perks. I may make a post later today to see if anyone can shed some insight. 
---
i wish all legendaries would stay glowing like this. and have their corpse or meat pile glow like that. would be alot easier to separate them from normal mobs.
---
I’m pretty happy with my non automatic rifles. I spend a lot of time at white springs so I have a 1* ghoulish handmade that I use a lot. With concentrated fire it’s usually one headshot on the charred ghouls. 
---
I am complete trash with the SBQ. i feel guilty even heading down there because I don’t feel like I make an impact. 
---
If you read the road map it says we will be getting a mythical creature today but whether that’s the actual thing or just some lore quests
---
It would be cool to see this as an additional page on the pip boy perhaps?
---
No thanks giving the brothers from battlefront 2 views would be a sin , this guy doesn’t even play the game give you that 
---
The excavator gives you a +100 bonus. If you log in wearing it, there’s a bug where that bonus counts twice, giving you +200. 
---
What’s probably happening is that you’re using the bugged total, and when you get out and back in, it resets to the correct total. 
---
If you mod it with calibrated shocks you can get a natural +200
---
It's just going through the location The Whitesprings and passing(clearing out) the entirety of it. Due to it being such a large location there is usually several legendaries and dozens of normal enemies. Drop a nuke there and now it's even better.
---
Dont have to be a dick about it lmao. I haven't played since like January and I kinda forgot it even existed 
---
I don’t know, there’s 24 people per server. Taking down a scorchbeast with 23 other people should definitely count as an MMO experience in my opinion.
---
If you have the perk that damages limbs, then just shooting her wings to cripple her (she drops to the ground so the melee can run in) really helps the group
---
Lol, I am lvl 119 and have never visited Whispering Caverns.
---
F no he’s among the worst click bait pass block see his name and just avoid avoid avoid lol 
---
The Meat Hook is classified as an unarmed weapon, but it is affected by both one-handed (Gladiator) and unarmed (Iron Fist) perks, which allow it to do 90% of its normal damage.  105% with Bloody Mess.
---
That ain’t even close to my definition of Massive 
---
Sign my petition to have Bethesda host vanilla servers! The new additions have ruined the game!
---
but burned books and burned magazines are worth a cap each....
---
Put on your gasmask in the cat lady's house. It reeks.
---
Ohh good to know, thought the inventory was shared
---
B. Nice.
---
I found 2 x01 calibrated shocks and 1 jetpack within 2-3 hours of hopping (xbox). It may help that many of the servers are empty, or that Whitesprings only seems populated 2-3 times out of every 10 hops for me. 
---
Taking down a boss with two dozen people isn’t massive? How many people need to be attacking a scorchbeast for it to be massive? 200 people?
---
Sorry man. What you are looking at is the general summary of Wild Appalachia. Which spans March and April. If you look to the right of that you will see the section for “March 13 - Brewing and Distilling”. Which is all we are getting today. 
---
This is my first Fallout game, can someone explain to me how this entire perks system work? If I have 15 points in certain category, but don’t equip any cards, do I get any benefits? Say if I have 15 points for luck, but don’t put in any cards and leave the slots empty, am I still ‘luckier’ than the person who has 5 points for luck but has certain cards equipped? Many of the legendary items I came across have ‘+1 perception’ or ‘+1 luck’, are those really worthwhile features? They don’t let me add more perk cards to the stack so how am I supposed to get luckier? 🤔
---
Ever play RuneScape? That many 
---
Y’ALL GOT SOME MORE OF DEM BLACKBIRD PAINTS? (Dave Chappelle homeless guy wiping nose covered in crack)
---
Yes, you are probably right about buying them off another player.
---
I just don't want to support anyone doing the duping.  So I just deal with not having them.
---
Wait, there was a DEATHCLAW STATUETTE?? Fuck, i would have bought the shit out of that.
---
I take those away for no charge , explosive disposal over here 
---
Ever play runescape? That many 
---
I think it's illegal in most countries to call people my age "kids".
---
How many people take on a raid boss in that? No I never played it
---
Clearly you haven't left yet.
---
the stairs are already there lol
---
https://www.gamesradar.com/yes-fallout-76-is-an-mmo-but-heres-why-it-could-be-the-one-for-you/
---
Do you think any any thought was put into your comment?
---
It's almost like they didn't finish the game and are using paying customers as BETA testers. Never have I played a game that requires people who own the game to product test it.
---
Seriously, the more I think about it the more I want my money back or a lawsuit because if this catches on with the industry I will be pissed. I shouldn't have to tell the manager of a restaurant to turn on the stove because I got served raw beef instead of a hamburger, why am I telling beth what needs to be fixed so it can be addressed on a monthly basis?
---
I think Shotguns need durability buffs. It feels like they are made of paper even with perks to reduce wear.
---
nice placement of the chem station, didn't think of that.
---
Might try moving mine around
---
It's pretty easy to classify, the key is already in the name. MMO. Massively multiplayer online. If 4 a massive number? No. Ergo, not an MMO. Example: Guild Wars had a town with many players, but you could only venture forth and actually *play the game* with only your party of 4. Developers specifically said it's not an MMO, but a CORPG (Competitive/Cooperative Online Role Playing Game).
---
So, look a the numbers. In FO76, server limit is what, 20-30 people? That's the max you could potentially interact with, ever. Is that a massive number? Again, no. Example: Battlefield 2, 14 years ago, had 64 player max. Nobody called it an MMO. It was a multiplayer game, not an MMO. However, EVE Online, 16 years ago, was indeed an MMO, because you could have literally thousands of people in the same place, at the same time, playing the game, together. 
---
Now, I'll admit, the number is somewhat arbitrary. For example, Battlefield 3, with 128 player max, was still not seen as an MMO. But MAG on PS3, with 256 players, was referred to as an MMO, because the number of players was definitely getting up there. It even won an award for most players in a console FPS, but people were still reluctant to call it an MMO, because the persistence of the world wasn't there.
---
That's the second part of the equation - the world. In EVE, a true MMO, the world is persistent. If I build a yurt, and drop some drones, and log off, I can log in a day later, and both will still be there, unless found and destroyed/looted by another player. Most of these things have timers, but many player built structures last for a very long time. By contrast, in MAG, it was still match specific. You join a match, you play it, match ends, world resets.
---
Some games are a grey area, but generally it's fairly obvious. Planetside 2, for example. The server holds something like 6,000 players, with 2,000 per continent, and less per individual battle. And the world is persistent-ish, because it's about global territory control, not individual battles. However, For Honor, which also has territory control, lacks the player count, so that one isn't an MMO.
---
It can be sorta kinda argued that, by that metric, WoW isn't really an MMO. Because even though the server holds thousands of players, only a few hundred (if that) can see each other before phasing kicks in, to keep the FPS stable. And, also, when you log off in WoW, you leave nothing behind. And it's an interesting argument. But it's still hundreds of players in each phase, and if you group/guild, the phasing will be consistent. And even though player logging off leaves nothing behind, the world is persistent in the sense that any changes the player made (such as territory control in zones that allow it) will remain. Plus, because servers are "worlds", you log in where you logged off, and any changes you or your mates made to the world persist until changed. So numbers are still there, and world persistence is sort of there. But I personally do accept a distinction between a "true MMO" (EVE, UO, etc.) and a "pseudo-MMO", that sort of meets the number requirements, but doesn't really have strong persistence, as long as it doesn't reset often.
---
There's even more smaller and debatable distinctions, between MMO and non-MMO. But those are finer details not needed here.
---
As far as FO76 goes, servers hold 20-30 max. It's not an MMO, based on that alone. The world also isn't persistent. You log off, your camp logs off with you. You also don't return to the same world, but a random one. Without a constant player anchor, it's always random. And even with a constant player anchor, servers still frequently reset, resetting everything on them. So, lack of player numbers AND lack of world persistence. Double whammy. Not an MMO.
---
For this game to be even a contender, we need hundreds of player characters on the same server, at the same time, interacting with one another in the game world. Not sitting in the hub, hub is just an instanced in-game lobby. And changes to the world we make need to be persistent - FO76 is almost there in some respects, nuke sites are somewhat persistent, albeit short-lived, even if player that launched the nuke is gone. But needs more cowbell. And without player numbers, even with persistent elements, it still wouldn't be an MMO.
---
My main objection though is that too many people these days toss "MMO" around very frivolously. And I'm not pointing any fingers, just in general. Many wannabe browser-based games that are barely multiplayer are calling themselves an MMO because they have tens of thousands of players. But you are limited to 2-5 when you play. And then some people started calling multiplayer games, with hundreds or even thousands per server, but only 4 able to play together, an MMO. Like Destiny and Division. Division being called an MMO drove me BONKERS. Yes, in chat you can talk to a lot of players. Can you see those players, when you run around the city though? No. Because they're not there. Max you will ever see in the city is 3 other people. Max you will ever see in DZ is 23 other people. And 24 players being able to see each other is not a massive number. So it's no MMO, and even developers/publishers didn't call it an MMO. But people would still call it an MMO. But not Diablo, which was weird to me. 
---
Um.. Crops are some of the only things you do \*not\* need flat places for.
---
You can stagger them up/down hillsides and works just fine.
---
Building houses is what requires the flat places.
---
As I tell everyone, I think it's illegal in most countries to call people my age, kids.
---
if only bethesda let us delete things like bodies in places we want to camp :(
---
Is it valid space?  I thought Berkeley Springs was basically a giant Workshop.
---
I’ve noticed this too, if I see a diseased ghoul I’m fairly confident I’m getting a legendary 
---
It's weird and sad to see him devolve over time.  I really enjoyed his reporting.
---
I ran out of acid my first run lol.
---
Lol, I never use them and have over 5K in my stash. I would trade 1:1 for flamer fuel.
---
Brilliant thanks, good to know!!
---
I’m sure it will. I’m gonna go back and do it a few times. I’ve never completed it, that was my first time. Definitely a lot of fireflies, which was actually kind of fun. I felt like it would be really cool if somebody was watching me run around chopping in the air like a mad idiot. It was just weird that I could run up to the lantern, but there was no way to activate it so I can dump the fluid. Maybe it’ll just work next time.
---
In a social game - you need a unique ID per player, not per character to enable the social interactions.  But they should have been clearer about this cause I might have picked out a different name when I first signed up.
---
You can use an XB1 controller wired on Win10 and 360 controller for Win7. Not sure if I have ever seen anything for console.
---
Do you want to buy some off me? I have 2000 shells
---
You know, that's a pretty good idea! And a good spot for it too. 
---
What kind of advice are you looking for?  are you having trouble with anything?
---
One thing I wish I had done from the start. Keep mental or physical notes of locations that have either a lot of the same items/junk or rare items/junk you don't see very often. 
---
Ah thank you
---
Don't run away from every high level player.  Some of us enjoy helping others and will give items. 
---
So it's ok to lie as much as he wants for views? Ever heard of ethical journalism?
---
Nothing specific just general advice, you know?
---
Perhaps you feel that I skipped the bad parts because I didn't experience them? Now interestingly is that the parts which many complained about are exactly the features people wanted in a mmo Fallout, which being a father in his 30s I don't really have friends I game with per se. I'm not arguing that issues didn't exist, my whole point was that I have enjoyed my first 90 days.
---
No; everything I don’t understand or don’t like is a bug! Hah. Just kidding. 
---
It's pretty easy to craft. You can get crystal and lead in quantity from Lucky Hole Mine.
---
Want some stuff for free, or help when you need to take down a high lvl mob, add me

This Penalty has been brought up before:

https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=Bankruptcy+Penalty
---
Users have reported receiving it for dying with a bounty they cannot pay.  Only being removed by 4 hours of play time (not just 4 hours logged out).  Some providing screenshots.
---
Seems it may be active?
---
Why is a half cap unit necessary?
---
Add on to this note, I keep certain levels of junk.  Usually 6 bulk stacks of common and 10 for higher use junk.  Plastic and ballistic fiber are the worst, keep all of it.
---
Im happy to see the game start getting content, after the rocky launch im sure it was a pretty stressful time for the devs there. Now they can try and show us what their plans are going forward.
---
Get into the lore and environmental story telling as you can. One of the best features of the game is piecing together a puzzle of what happened. Also I’d suggest looking up character builds so you can at least get an idea of the top play styles and perk builds. And explore, I am level 55 and I just saw 3 creatures and 2 new guns for the first time in the last 10 hours of game play.  So there is almost always new things to see. 
---
lol those people just do it for views nowadays don't trust what they say 
---
Don't skip daily quests or events! Some give you decent plans and recipes. Also it's a good way to get supplies such as stimpaks and purified water. 
---
I'm just waiting for the patch notes!
---
I'm happy I wasn't able to read this last night. Great way to start today. 
---
Damn thx
---
the first version of the game doesn't make it the base game. it is still the base game because no additional content has been added. it is still the same vanilla title, just more stable and optimized. OP is actually a few patches too *early.* though, you are correct, the next few updates will hardly change the base game. at it's core, it'll still be exactly the same, with a couple extra things to do. it's the summer and late 2019 updates that will truly be "game-changing" (hopefully).
---
Or.....you should still get the 155 caps from his bounty calculated as below:
---
* 5 from him because that is all he had
---
* 150 from server (so you don't miss out)
---
* As he cant afford the full price, he should go into cap debt to -150 caps and also get marked for -50% PVP damage reduction.
---
A couple questions I'm looking to get answered  :)
---
1. So If I have a work shop,  do they need to try claiming it from me in order to start the Pvp? Or can they just walk on the work shop property and deal full damage?
---
2.  Does this mean anyone who wanders on the property can be dealt full damage even if they arnt doing anything wrong?   
---
3. Does either player get any sort of bounty for either of my above questions?
---
Don’t kill me. Just asking. But is it normal for developers to make such major changes (i.e. the suggestions ubiquitous to this sub) in a game?
---
I get the requests for better balancing or increased stash space. But some of the suggestions I’ve seen are wholesale revamps. Is that a thing? 
---
I feel like we’re still in beta.
---
I've been server hopping for weeks and still haven't come across them, but I did get the jetpack mod in my travels.
---
Out of caps at the moment, but I'm tired searching so I'm just going to save up and trade for them instead.
---
I could really get behind that! My thoughts were maybe a board or scrolling marquee on the map screen. I like the pip boy idea as well. 
---
Yeah I found out how good it was when you drop a nuke on it, but not through my choice. Loaded into a server with the voice saying please leave the area and the clock at 00:03. 
---
Nah - just make them drop a random weapon/armor if they don't have enough caps to pay their bounty!  Abuse the system, lose your beloved stuffs!
---
i mean, you could just explain why it isn't an MMO real quick instead of being a dramatic neckbeard diva.
---
Don't toss away your Blade of Basket or Voice of Set. You'll see... oh and have fun
---
I'm happy you enjoyed the game, I'm just saying you shouldn't discredit critics by calling them toxic haters, because they have just reason, the glitchy state of the game.
---
No problem :). I do the same thing. I never used a bobble head or a magazine.
---
I have a bunch of them in my stash.
---
I am out of the loop, what's going on?
---
The MGEF record does not seem to be referenced anywhere but again because:
---
\- It could have been implemented differently and these records are just 'vestiges' of an earlier attempt to implement this mechanic.
---
\- Not everything has been decoded so it could be that is referenced in a manner that xEdit cannot yet 'understand'.
---
Is why I mentioned that I cannot be sure whether such thing in 'live' or not. It would take someone with more knowledge and expertise than yours truly to get a definitive answer.
---
It would be funny if they were penalized 1 minute per cap bounty in-game (Not outside) to sit in the prison with a no fast travel and unpickable locks.  If they got a bounty and did not have the caps.  So in this case the guy would have to wait 2.5 hours in game in the jail cell.   Of course he can just AFK the whole time... but still!
---
Haven’t seen either but I will remember that. Thanks
---
How does anti-armor weapons work? They’re supposed to ignore 50% of the armors, does that mean -15% is now -7.5% and -8% is now -4%? 
---
Yes, please don't run!  I gift Legendaries all the time!
---
Honestly why I tend to favor the default wood and warehouse sets.  They "fit" the motif better.
---
I would say, though, that you are free to mix-and-match them.  If you picture your house in sections, you can use warehouse metal to make it look like cobbled together an extension onto an existing building.
---
Central is ahead of the times.... east coast
---
How wonderful mr.cucamber man. God bless.
---
Truth 
---
To that note, don’t ignore us either. 
---
A thumbs up is always nice. Otherwise we might “MURDER” you. Just saying... ;-)
---
The issue is they need to fix the servers so that people can't troll others by using slap damage. They also need to change the area damage so that when you are fighting inside a workshop because of an event and you don't own the workshop you can't get flagged. There is such a mix of issues with PVP. The easy fix is take it to the new story mode and remove it from the day to day (not sure what to call it). That way people can't enter survival mode if they don't have a certain amount of caps.
---
I will add you :).
---
However no free stuff, thanks. I want a felling of proud and accomplishment ;).
---
Bulk Ammo :)
---
Insufficient ~~Vespian Gas~~ Plastic.
---
Wait until you run into the giant hermit crab
---
Collect everything, scrap everything. Find a location for your camp that's close to water and food. Do a "Powering up" mission ASAP so you can get the fusion generator. Go to Camden Park, there are two power cores there and sometimes power armor, but most importantly on the roller coaster, in the front car of the second line of cars you will find a key to the west end door of New River Gorge Bridge where you will find a level 25 raider armor.
---
I'd definitely say greenhouse, along with real indoor planters, would be on my short list of CAMP items I want.
---
Problem with the marquee is it removes the 'immersion' from the game. Pip-boy idea still keeps it in the FO universe.
---
My major concern is a problem for console....... writing text is a bitch without a keyboard!!
---
See exactly, I haven’t done this yet and I have a ton of hours in the game. 
---
LOL
---
Lol! Dude whiffed n the RPG reference.
---
How do you get a “Powering up” Mission?
---
Check containers at train stations, myself and many other players will leave goodies in suitcases  / the vendor's cash register, etc.  I play on PS4 and have started leaving legendary items in the overseer's caches in the overseer's camp and also in the responder church in Flatwoods.
---
start at the whitespring, walk around back to the service area, clear all the ghouls. walk down to the clubhouse, clear all the ghouls. walk left over towards the rows of villas, clear all the ghouls. make sure to stop at guard houses at entrances for random spawns. end up back at the whitespring front door. whitespring run done! now into the shops downstairs to unload.
---
Isn't it obvious!? /s
---
Isn’t easier 2 for 1 ?
---
I’ve got way too many perk cards I’m always flipping around based on Combat vs crafting. Hoarder cards like you’re envisioning would be a complete waste of valuable perk points. 
---
I bought the Leg BOS plans for 2500 Caps about two weeks ago.  I still don't see them widely available on the PS4 at least.
---
Could be that people are just finally finding them from Map/Events in the Bog area?
---
Honestly I just want it not to be so abusable, like -50% damage is not even close to punishing these guys. The people that do it are usually the high tier pvp players (exluding this guy who was unable to kill me) that know what they are doing if they hit you for 2k they still hitting you for 1k. they should be literally useless for pvp.
---
Launched a nuke last night and as soon as I entered the nuke zone, my PS4 Pro froze on me. This happens like 50% of the times. The game is so unstable it’s just not worth the efforts unless there’s a ‘rejoin last server’ option. 
---
Pay really close attention to your SPECIAL stats, as once you reach 50 you have to spend level points in rearranging them. Think about what kind of build you want to play (melee, rifles, heavy guns, explosives, pistols, etc), and try and attune perk cards and SPECIAL stats accordingly.. you can always change them later, but it's a big pain in the arse. 
---
Also, if you follow just the main story line, don't expect yourself to complete it all the way to the end, eventually you'll be fighting enemies twice your level who will kill you in three hits. Just take your time to explore the game, enjoy yourself, and take in everything that's happening around you. 
---
And have fun. That's the best advice I can give.
---
Or you could combine the two like I did in ESO by constantly trying to sell covfefe stacks.
---
It's a daily mission that pops up. The easiest one for low levels is the Power Station south of Charleston.
---
I know it's minor, but this is honestly one of the major reasons I don't play more. When I see Xxx_DickSniper_xxX running around the wasteland, it really takes me out of the game.
---
Add the platform you play on! It'll make it easier to find people on here
---
I think the Metal walls are kind of ugly, myself, mostly because you get those weird shadows along the seams that none of the other tiles have.
---
Ok! Thank you!
---
Only reason im against that is bethesda will be implementing that and I don't want them messing with that code, with my luck I'll just start having my items drop on death randomly.
---
Yes, I will be posting later today after further testing. Looking good so far.
---
Given they want to string out content, I would assume this sort of thing is on the roadmap for the future.
---
That would be amusing as fuck especially if I could pay the cell a visit
---
F2P wouldn't be a bad thing for f76.... It's practically being given away now...F2P would mean more players maybe more poeple buying atoms to support further development right now it would be hard to sell any type of expansion and the current dwindling player base will not be enough to support the game for long.
---
Yea I’ve tested on others and it has unlocked for all weights
---
Lol. Yeah I've been there. I've gotten lucky and had people kill me, but I've also seen it work with my friends when they do the Warden quest. It's an easy enough quest and doesn't take very long, and at the end the Warden is supposed to clear your wanted bounty.
---
Do you know if marsupial cancels out that bug? The weight glitch seems to have stopped happening for me after acquiring marsupial.
---
daylight savings time is still as annoying as it always been.
---
Heavy is specified though is it not? I'm using a mix of normal and heavy leather limbs atm and my heavy looks different and has it first in the title
---
Weirdly enough even though DSP is awful when he does actual reviews and stuff like that he's usually on point. 
---
I never keep the gauntlets regardless of the stats, the 20 lb weight is just too much!
---
I agree with that. I could see a partner app resolving this issue. You could access your pip boy in FO4 so why noy develop an in game partner app. Makes posting and accessing easier. Use your pip boy in game to check your posts progress. 
---
That I don't know. I've been told that anti-armor is factored against DR/ER in the initial damage dealt and then modifiers like lone wanderer, sentinel, etc., are applied to any damage that makes it through but I really don't have any definitive proof of the formula. 
---
the game is significantly more stable overall, even since January. as for repetitiveness, there will always be a finite amount of content, and after a certain point, you will have completed everything once and the only thing to do is farm via repetitive activities. this isn't exclusive to 76 though, it's just the nature of this type of online multiplayer game. if you're not prepared to grind xp and resources, then maybe you've gotten everything you can out of the game for the time being. starting tomorrow, we are supposed to be seeing weekly content updates. if side quests and special events interest you, it may be a good time to jump back in. if you want to have some more meat that you can dive into, rather than a small quest or two per week and new dailies, you're probably better off waiting until the major summer update, which seems to introduce a new game mode, in addition to the quests and locations added during the Wild Appalachia period.
---
if you are actually interested in getting back into the game at some point, I recommend [checking this blog post out](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps) where they detail the intended content roadmap for the year.
---
According to a video I saw recently, apparently metal walls do have higher durability. Haven't tested myself though so take it for what you will.
---
Yes, very well actually. Combine it with Lead Belly rank three and say cheerio to your hunger and thirst problems as you can eat your humanoid kills, eat the raw meat from animal kills and drink from rivers, fountains and toxic piss puddles if that takes your fancy.  
---
Occasionally contract diseases, but not as often as you might think, as long as you're "Well Fed" - which you almost always are :D
---
Yea im aware of that debuff I can confirm its in the game as my friend as had it. What im saying is its not punishing enough. 50% of 2k damage (bloodied build) is 1k
---
It does specify, unless it’s legendary. Then you have to look at damage resistance or weight. That’s what the OP was referring to :) 
---
When i  tarted i went with lockpicking/hacking. Aside from speech those are my favorite abilities in fallout. They give you access to unreachable areas of the game and alternate routes.Hell it even gave  a decent amount of exp. This game made me loathe it so much I quit lockpicking entirely. 76  feels like it has 4x the locks you would find in the others. I can't actually remember anything notable other than more lockpicks and chems.
---
Hahaha - yeah I don't blame you!
---
Thank you for doing this
---
Yes, because the writer is a cretin. By the same token I can point you to a subreddit where people say Earth is flat.
---
The biggest hint is that neither this game's developers nor its publishers call this game an MMO. 
---
Thanks for the tip, I’ll have to check to see if I can fit it in somewhere. I know I don’t have it on my normal build. 
---
I have a couple of dozen, but I wouldnt sell them all. Dunno a price point. How many do you need? 
---
Most of which are worthless.  Gaining levels past 100 (for maybe the trophy/achievement) is mostly a negative.
---
7 pacific 
---
So you basically played the game on someone elses account since you did not have access to his account?
---
You need better plastic farms. Like wotoga highschool(plastic cutlery), the golfing areas(goldballs), and the middle school(plastic pumpkins in gymnasium) 
---
Sorry, I've never had marsupial which is a shame because it looks like fun..... also maybe it does as I've always had the weight glitch.
---
Yes! I don't like the look of the inside with brick walls
---
Yeah, maybe several configurations saved, but you can only switch to one pre-selected default under caution, assuming they fix the perpetual caution issues? 
---
I had to keep building up until I could build over the top of a non-destructible tree. 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/1Wz0bCm
---
Good news is that there are no branches up there. 
---
They've always been that way - some people just get lucky.  I went for months without finding one, then got 2 in a short span, got another 2 in a short span, and haven't seen them again since then.
---
Pretty much that way with Jet Packs too.
---
Appalachia belongs to the Nords!!
---
problem here is that the OP basically did not have an account.     he had access to someone elses account and choose to make characters on that account.
---
well, your doing something wrong. my be gatling puts out about 400 damage without adrenalreaction working and not a single perkcard for heavys
---
If that’s the case then anti-armor is not that useful then, since all the little extra damage made it through will be negated by the ridiculous legendary effects at full strength. 
---
I had a two floor basecamp before.
---
Thanks  to the marsupail mutation (or whatever it's called).
---
Way too much time wasted with placing foundation on a pillar.
---
And noticed that I could plant crops on the side of my floors, and water purifier on the corner of my own placed stairs.
---
Really a nice spot, but the scorchbeast roaming in the sky, made me move my c.a.m.p 
---
&gt; and the clock at 00:03. 
---
I have done that. No where to run in time. you just sigh and get blown away. Kind of a cool effect to see, though.
---
Not exactly - when I was buying the account seller informed me that only I will use that account, the only con was I couldn't change any data on that account. Since December there wasn't any problems, no one used that account except me. Suddenly, yesterday someone else logged in and done what I wrote above - deleted all characters and used all atoms I've collected (5k+).
---
Does it affect movement or sneak?
---
Appreciate the input.
---
See? This is what happens when you watch too much of YongYea videos. 
---
Bethesda themselves had stated that 76 will not go f2p.
---
There's no point in making the game f2p, given the rate at which Atoms are given out. If they stop giving atoms after making it free, it would have the opposite effect on the "dwindling player base" as you call it.
---
"Dwindling player base" is also a rumour made up by these foul YTers, and you'd know that if you actually played the game or read posts on this sub.
---
Wow! Good job pointing that out on a post that's not only four months old, but also has other comments that were relevant at the time cleaning up that error! Thank you!
---
There's certainly fast, shoot-from-hip definitions. For MMOs, it's massive numbers at the core, followed by persistence of the world. 
---
A game with 20-30 players max is not an MMO, in context that other games, with 64-128 players have NEVER been referred to as MMOs. How often have you heard someone say Battlefield games are MMOs? Bam. Not an MMO. Nice and fast.
---
Now, when you hit 256+ players, or heck, even 128+ players, you can *attempt* to argue a game is an MMO, especially if the world is persistent. I'll give you that. But this game is SO FAR REMOVED from even POTENTIALLY being an MMO that no argument can possibly be made here. 
---
See, if he took the Earth, and said Earth is round, and then I came in and said "Well, aktchually it's not *exactly* round..." you could absolutely call me out on it and say I'm being pedantic. But what happened here, he said the Earth is flat. To call him out on it isn't pedantic, because it's not a small distinction, like round vs spherical. 
---
As far as downvotes, I really don't care, do U?
---
“I got my bloodied melee build and beat the SBQ and now I’m bored.”
---
Probably because you copied the same boring build as everyone else.
---
Massive multiplayer online. The massive part is clearly not there.
---
There is nothing wrong with slap damage, you can't be trolled very easy to fast travel away or log off and block people you don't like. As for workshops pretty sure you can only be killed if you own the workshop, I've never seen or heard an instance where you can be killed simply for being in a workshop zone. But I could be wrong never tested it personally
---
I do apologise, as someone that avoids PvP like the plague I wasn't aware. Is just something I came across while looking into something completely else.
---
For the aforementioned reason I am not the best qualified to comment on what would be the best approach to the matter so I will see myself out.
---
&gt;Plastic is not as easy to farm as other materials
---
im sorry, but you are wrong and just not doing it right.
---
I am a heavy shotgun user, and used to claim the ammo factory before every session to build up my ammo. this was until i started crafting my own ammo using the agility perk (forget what it is called) and super duper. when i first started, i said the same thing. "plastic is way too hard to find!!" it really isn't at all though. there is plastic in a *ton* of things i had no idea it was in. tag it on your resources, and you should be able to find plastic very quickly. toys, cigarette packs, cigarette cartons, enamel buckets, antique globes, broom, baby rattle, cafeteria tray, animal bowls, plasticwear, billiard balls, cleaner bottles, pens, scissors, hairbrushes, etc. there are SO MANY things that have plastic. on top of that, there are multiple locations where plastic plates and plasticwear are abundant. just about any cafeteria on the map has a crazy amount of forks, spoons, knives and plates. fort defiance has a whole bunch on the top floor, and even has another room where you can find several dog bowls worth 2 plastic a piece.
---
there are definitely things in this game that need balancing, but the great majority of these resource complaints are stemmed from people that aren't actually looking for them.
---
The "I'm uninstalling because I hate this game" posts get old real fast.
---
Makes sense, I feel like it is definitely gonna be lore then encounter or vice versa 
---
Either the “Will I get unbanned” post or the “I’m leaving this game”/“I will be coming back to the game.” Like seriously, nobody cares if you are quitting he game or just coming back. I find this subreddit as a place to get information on bugs, updates, patches, and a place for people to talk about locations for items or for requesting for some help with something. 
---
Yes but whereas the shape of the Earth matters, we're talking about a fucking video game.  That's the difference.  It's not a serious or even interesting distinction and noone gives a shit.  
---
Please don't be an NGE.
---
Eh what’s the damage on a missile launcher bayonet  Per hit?
---
EST is used during Autumn/Winter while EDT is Spring/Summer.
---
There's really no difference besides the daylight savings rule.
---
In order for it to be an MMO it would need to be finished first. Maybe once they've finished using paying customers as BETA testers and fixing it with updates once a month it'll resemble a game ready for release.
---
Be patient, be ready for anything, and just have fun. 
---
100% agree
---
Shame you can attack me for my username, which clearly shows you don't have a valid point of argument, but also can't spell cucumber right, and it isn't even a typo.
---
Anti-armor has always been situationally useful. It's less important for high damage, low DPS weapons that overwhelm DR and more important for low damage, high DPS weapons. 
---
You often don't need a ton of damage to get through with so many bloodied builds and you can stagger people in full sentinels with explosives so there are ways around most builds. 
---
It's still not the base game, it's the BETA and we are all paying money to help them do their job and finish actually making the game.
---
That’s not really relevant to what genre it is. But you are bound to at least get some upvotes for calling the game unfinished yet again. Brave. 
---
There are question marks at the end of half of those as if they are possibilities not facts.
---
At the most he has made a couple wrong assumptions based on how the game was recieved and how badly the atom store is handled. 
---
None of this qualifies him as human cancer or deserves a witch hunt still. Like i said.
---
Your feelings being hurt doesn't justify toxic ass behavior.
---
After having played Anthem, I've come to realize how decent FO76 actually is. Sure, I'm still salty my CAMP was removed months ago, but I'm having a blast getting back into this game. 
---
Anything virtue-signaling.
---
Extra nauseating points if is passive-aggressive. 
---
oo that's right now
---
When you're below like level 30-40ish you get more xp from completing events and quests than just farming kills somewhere. Not to sound like a turd but maybe try some friends that are more like minded? If all they wanna do is level alts at whitesprings tell em to have fun you got better stuff to do. Lol. 
---
This is just pedantic.
---
Well, my post just makes a joke about him and now I am toxic? Fragile, much?
---
pretty sure it’s entirely random. i received 3 of a perk i never intended to use before i hit lvl 30.
---
THANKS!
---
I need those nifty tile floors I have seen around
---
Jumped for 12 hours last couple of days. 3 Jet packs no calibrated shocks and no targeting HUD. Crazy.
---
The yellowish bathroom tile like ones?
---
Is everything still there from the base game if I haven’t finished?
---
Thanks was getting tired of scrapping everything manually
---
So, if I called Fallout 76 a turn-based strategy game, which only supports Japanese language, with cel-shaded graphics, based on a true story of a WW2 dog prostitute, that would be OK too? Because it's just a video game, and who fucking cares? And tea is coffee, and apple is an orange, because they're just fruit? Is poop ice cream? Because I have ice cream for you, and it's free. Care for a scoop? 
---
So I tried that, but since I wanted to be able to see out and possibly uphill, I did the following: I added a half wall above the wall and hung the slanted sections from that (okay it looked like they were hanging). I extended a single floor section out above the main floor, added a triangle piece, attached a slanted roof to that and then attached slanted roof and slanted corners to that one piece. The half walls were added to cover the gap when viewed from below. 
---
The result?  Looked okay, but maxed out my budget before placing a single workbench or water purifier. 
---
So I scrapped that idea and went back to the rooftop observation deck approach. 
---
Here is my first attempt. It’s 4x4 plus the deck. I have about 20% budget left and it’s cramped, so I’m going to try expanding it to 5x5
---
I don't buy.
---
If you are on PC and have a mic to speak in game talk to FnordBear or if I am not on speak to CommanderBass and tell him Bear sent you for an interview.
---
We are a pretty laid back group of mostly adults in the 20s-40s age range that engage in a little bit of everything the game offers. Our biggest rule is dont be an obnoxious jerk in or out of game and show solidarity with your guildmates.
---
Find people to play with. It will enhance the game from the moment you start teaming up with people. 
---
I've never had much luck finding Explosive weapons - less than a handful in many hours of playing and hundreds of levels.  Bloodied I do find though.
---
Thank you kind reddit user I'll check it out when I get out of work I'm always looking for new outfits to keep my wastelander looking dapper. And I must admit there's something highly alluring about a bookcase full of booze.
---
The people who claim to have been killed from slap damage, even though they took over a workshop and initiated pvp first
---
Did you look in agility?
---
I've got my camp setup east of Top of the World (where the wee flower is on the map). There's a small cave with a boat and an acid node in the water. Great location! Can build in/around the cave, and above on the rocks. There's also a junk node next to the pond, across the road from Pleasant Valley Station too.
---
Not today
---
I mean, you can call it whatever.  I'm not gonna write you a 3 paragraph screed about it, like people do. :-)
---
They sell between 2.5 and 4 on PS4.   The mods ceased to exist after the February update but the plans still drop from events.   Not rare, but uncommon and desired.   
---
Got me :D
---
I make my own beer, so I'm excited 
---
Try to have fun with your first character. Experiment, do quests, explore, whatever you want, try different weapons and crafting etc. You can always make a serious character later. That being said, there are 5 slots for characters just to keep in mind.
---
We should have a world chat, with options for /talk for close encounters instead of flooding the server-wide messaging. 
---
Right up until they realise the update doesn't fulfill their wildly optimistic ideas. Then they come back here all salty and mad. 
---
Better to keep the expectations lower, and be pleasantly surprised when those modest expectations are exceeded. 
---
crippling power of shotguns is what makes them useful for me. you can kill an assaultron with 4 accurate shotguns shells.
---
I like the I’m at 200 hours and this game is trash. How many games do you play that give you that much time but are unplayable. I’ve payed for several games that I put in played for two or three hours and realized they were not for me and shelved. I’ve even gone back and given them a second shot and just said nope. If you’ve played 209 hours and are saying it’s trash you have something wrong with you not the game. 
---
Keep punching f5
---
Happy drink day to everyone 🍶🍷🍸🍹🍾🍸🍷🍷🍷🍷
---
So you are happy to play a game that requires you to identify how to fix it to the devs in the hope they'll get around to it?
---
Would you be mad getting raw meat on a bun and the manager telling you it's your responsibility to tell the kitchen to turn on the stove?
---
Yeah I'm brave for wanting to play a game I paid for, not paying to help finish a game that's incomplete at it's best and a buggy unplayable mess at it's worst.
---
Farm leader of the pack. Three guaranteed low level legendary items, xp and wolf ribs. I play solo so i max lone wanderer ASAP and carry a couple of serrated machete. Event spawns near tyler fairgrounds and opening the northwest corner of the forest is suggested as fash traveling can help you intercept the wolf packs.
---
I tried to change my acc name because i have only one Charakter in use but u need to contact the Bethesda support and that is ugly.
---
Even BuGiSoFt (ubisoft) is 101% better lol.
---
Oh, I’m sure you’ll have the chance. They’ll be more expensive than ever, but you’ll have the chance.
---
Coming from the traditional mmo world, equipment macros were always useful in removing time wasting chores. With perk cards acting in similar fashion, I'd find a macro system to be the best solution, but adding in passive perks would be bad either. But a loadout system would still require players to setup and interact with cards, just not in inconvenient situations.
---
I agree the system in it's currently state is tedious, annoying, and pointless.
---
It would be much simpler to make Lock picking &amp; Hacking learned skills and eliminate the perk Cards completely, Pick 76 level 0 locks to unlock level 1, 76 more unlocks level 2, etc.., Same for hacking.
---
Hard bargain could be eliminated as well by simply using Charisma with limits; minimum sell = 30% of Base Price (with 5 or less Charisma), Maximum sell = 70% (with 15 Charisma), This would make everyone have to move points, or seek other means of raising Charisma without the tedium of Card Shuffling.
---
Some of the other perks for resource gathering and weight reduction I'm very happy with in their current state, most are in the Strength, Perception or Luck trees which seems very appropriate (IMO), and allows for character builds to a particular play style.
---
I see a lot of players asking for more SPECIAL points, but I believe There is currently a good balance with available Perk Cards, and the ability to move points, if we had more players could easily switch from Stealth/Sniper, to Tank/Melee, which would ruin Character building.
---
So, have my up vote, with hopes that at least some of this is implemented soon.
---
Make a build on nukes and dragons ahead of time 
---
It sounds familiar, but for the life of me, I couldn't tell you why.
---
Stealth is very broken in this game. I have stealthboy modded PA so even the player standing next to me didn’t know where I am, yet when a scorchbeast flies over me it would start attacking right away, it’s like WTF do those SBs have thermal visions or what. 
---
How early game do you mean? I should be getting the game today and am excited to take on Appalachia
---
Can't fix stoopid 🤷🏻‍♂️ lol
---
Over time, all chat channels become Barrens chat.
---
Fucking awesome. Thank you so much. 
---
Just subscribed thank you
---
Literally unplayable 
---
the ones i mean are the ones that look like a Mediterranean villa patio floors, almost mosiac like, 
---
oh i found this vid! they are called simply mosaic tiles
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGQkIIQUk8Y
---
I’m here because, yeah I do enjoy the game. No one here thinks the game is perfect. Why are you here? 
---
So I’ve noticed two things: first, I still have my view of Lake Eloise, Watoga, Robco,Westek and Seneca Rocks, but now I clear the hill and can also see Top of the World and Spruce Knob. I can watch Fissure site prime getting nuked, but I should also be able to see the blast from Whitespring being nuked. 
---
Second, three Vertibirds and a cargobot came by yesterday, but they were at my level or below me. The vertibirds kept clipping through the building. 
---
That was my favorite building set from FO4. 
---
That would make them umlimited.
---
IDK...situational, perhaps?  I'm lvl 39.
---
Last night I was trekking across the ash heap.  Also heard someone delivering a massive amount of fire to something.  About the time I made hornwright estates, I hear the wings.
---
I ducked behind a truck, saw another player in the vicinity, but the SB sniffed me out, and here come the sonic blasts.  My high damage weapons are melee, but I managed to emptiy a couple assualt rifle mag on her....then I was dead :)
---
Respawned, SB is still there, so is the other player.  
---
SB blasted me a few more times, I took a few more potshots, then SB flew off toward whitesprings.  THe other player pursued or otherwise left the area.
---
While I may not be able to do massive per shot damage, I did what damage my character/weapons were capable of doing in a fight I did not instigate; the fight  found me.   
---
Which would be worse, participating and dealing what damage my character could,
---
or running away/not helping at all?
---
Given a few hundred damage is still damage, (and had the SB landed, could have done more, as my melee weposn are 100+ per hit), would it have been wrong to take part of the spoils?  I dont think so.
---
Word thanks. Suppose ill just learn and craft them then. Any idea what aae and be shottys are selling for now? I see some for 15k some for 5k. Quite confused. Guess it could all change post patch. 
---
That option is also acceptable. The chat board gives people with out headsets a chance to reach out. Also i have interacted with people who perfer not to speak on chat but prefer messaging. They were very nice and had good things to trade. Having options for all pov's is key for this 
---
Meet the level requirement and buy the perk under the agility stat 
---
My objection is, why call it "whatever" when there's a perfectly good and *accurate* descriptor for what it is? "Fallout 76 is an online multiplayer action role-playing game". No objection from me. Why take this, and turn it into "whatever" like "Fallout 76 is a turn-based, single-player tactical puzzle solver"? It's not. So why call it that, just because "whatever"? If it's "whatever", why call it *anything at all*? 
---
Words have meaning. If you choose to use words, pick the right ones. Because otherwise orange banana swing rocket ampersand square blob.
---
Paid 1750 for chest mod plans on Xbox. Bet you could sell a whole set for 4000 caps. 
---
Is this game worth buying/coming back to posts.
---
Thanks, I’ll check it out!
---
I like the perk system. 
---
Not in the same sense. MMOs have thousands of players per server in most cases, so it's not even close.
---
Just because raids in mmos require 18 people doesn't make this game one.
---
You feeling like FO76 counts as an MMO (based on numbers in a boss fight) doesn't make it one.
---
You do know that things can share similar traits and not be the same things, right?
---
Interior walls, please!
---
I would love to see the junk walls from FO4 return. The ones that are free floating and dont require a foundation to place. 
---
Snarky? 
---
If I misunderstood, then explain it to me. But it's not snark.
---
You recommend getting more people? That's strange. I've observed the opposite. The smaller the group, the more likely you are to beat the queen. Large groups usually trigger the insane scaling or the no-damage bug and fail. 
---
Yeah, just some sort of system.  I'm guessing when we get dungeons we will probably start to see more and more narrowed loot tables
---
Don't carry another power armor chassis with you either. I had one to try and make a full t60. After dropping and picking up a few times to add new pieces I dropped it once and it somehow duped my excavator armor on to my t60 armor. Lost all my t60 stuff I spent hours finding and had 2 excavator armors. Still salty over it.
---
Sweet! I’ll check it out for sure. Thanks a ton
---
As much as a communal area would be nice, I just hope that CAMPs marked with player vending allow random folks to freely fast travel to them. If people can't freely fast travel to my CAMP to look at my vendor, I have low hopes of anything actually selling.
---
How is leveling up considered a negative?
---
Loadout options would be amazing. Even as little as 3 slot options. I don't need 3 points of hard bargain in a Nuke zone. Same with crafting. 
---
Lock picking and hacking perks should carry 0 points. You still have to upgrade thru leveling so there's no real loss of gameplay. 
---
Does it affect AP as well?
---
I'll be honest, I think it's more desperation than anything. YouTube has come down hard on creators in the last two years, the algorithms have changed. In order to stay in the good graces of YouTube, they have to punk out quantity, instead of quality. I've seen a bunch of good channels crash and burn because they went quality over quantity... then sunk when YouTube demonitized them for it. 
---
At this point, he's clearly made his commitment to being a full time YTer, and he's throwing everything he has at the wall to keep his head above water.
---
This is why I prefer Many A True Nerd. Man is a constant optimist, bright and cheery, and still makes astoundingly good content full of bad puns.
---
I'd rather see:  
---
A) Better junk from scrapping that more closely reflects the components needed for repair (springs, screws, etc.)  
---
B) A preventative maintenance approach to repairing which also allows repairing weapons in the 100-199% CND range (with applicable perk rank).  
---
For example: If a weapon is in the 180-199 CND range, you might only need some oil and as the weapon is more degraded, other supplies would be needed such as springs and then screws, etc.  In this way, there is incentive to keep gear constantly maintained in an effort to avoid more costly repairs down the road.
---
I have not been able to get grim reapers sprint to proc. is it working for you?
---
Yes. Mr. Messenger can get stuck and never recover. It’s so aggravating because that event gives decent rewards and is very boring even when it properly functions.
---
I prefer metal walls
---
See how serious you are, and how you're writing full paragraphs about video games for kids? :-)

Yeah, the pipboy could be a great way for players to communicate. 
---
The main quest takes you to morgantown quite early on :) With a decent rifle / melee weapon and making sure you have stimpaks in case, i think you could go there then.
---
NOM NOM NOM.. Best quality of life combo. (my wife always comments on how gross it is, if she is watching me play) lol
---
Godwin's Law of MMOs
---
preorder cancelled!
---
F that noise lol. 
---
100% agree. While the game is bit rough in places, the "fluff and filler" team did a SPECTACULAR job. Some of the holotapes got genuine chuckles out of me. Some of the sidequests, discovered through notes and holotapes, have pretty much *demanded* that I follow them to the end. 
---
In short, we want traditional trading dialog, that every other MMORPG has.
---
Funnily enough passive perks was what the community was calling for from the begining.  It wasn't until the mod "Perk Loadout Manager" came along that folks started clamoring for loadout decks.  Personally, the loadout desks is just a fix for a not fun system.  Passive perks seem like a much better option.  Even if you earn them at a much slower rate.  There is no reason that at lvl 150+ I should have to spend time switching between combat and non combat perks.  It's not fun and takes away from the game.  
---
Fortunately, there is literally nothing that is "behind" a lockpick or terminal that is key to the game, half the time I just skip those things even though I probably have 2 copies of each lockpick / hack skill.
---
Rigell has done some impressive work, indeed.
---
Good to know, thank you :D
---
&gt;"Are they rewriting the entire trading system?"
---
No.
---
 We'll get vending machines a while from now though.
---
The noise completely grosses me out, no arguments there :)
---
I agree it only takes a couple of hours of play to know if a game is worth playing.
---
I can say from there I've had a greaser jacket &amp; jeans, policemans uniform, combat helmet (no armour values on it though?)
---
and you get the the achievement for being at ground zero ;)
---
I have been thinking this for a long time glad someone finally said it much appreciation 
---
Is it back yet? :)
---
Well in PvP, you lose caps based on level and you really don't get any stronger when you're beyond level 60-70.
---
The update over 50gb for any of my fellow pc players as well?
---
All PvP is GrEiFinG. 
---
Understand the mechanics prior to making yourself a target please. I dont want to make you feel bad for PvP at a workshop.
---
Until Suvival launches, PvP players are stuck with the PvE crowd. Lots of us are at max caps &amp; max junk... And we like to PvP...
---
If i smash your camp, sometimes im just trying to build a bounty high enough for high levels to bounty hunt me. 
---
If you ask a "greifer" for junk, we will probably drop 200+ of whatever you need. We are pretty rich as PvP is profitable as heck. And I am sooo bored.  
---
Ill even drop a legendary if you ask. Ill give you pointers on what perks are good for PvP!  Talk to us and you might find we arent so toxic afterall. We are just stuck with you guys as you are stuck with us. We can all blame Todd at the end of the day!
---
Im bored and i want to PvP.  Sorry bout wrecking your house!! But i need that 400 cap bounty to bait the level 200s who are worth fighting!
---
Waiting for this game to be finished. I enjoy it, but no other game requires me to log in when I change my armor if I want the benefits and crashes once an hour on a good day. Every time I try it out after an update I am disappointed and regret ever hoping this game would be finished.
---
Keep playing it so I can eventually get my money's worth after your unpaid efforts are used to finish this game, maybe they'll thank you in the credits!
---
Watoga
---
"this game sucks and you're all stupid for playing it... convince me otherwise, even though I have no intention of being convinced"
---
Ah so it’s only a negative for those engaging in pvp. 
---
I saw a targeting hud yesterday. I will buy those from this point. Had no idea they were that rare.
---
No, but a poorly placed shot can damage something, and thus you get PvP flagged due to poor aim.  I've seen this.
---
Yes I know that but this game shares ALL the traits of an MMO. It has a massive world, road bosses that you can take down with 18+ people (your number) it’s multiplayer, and it’s online. The only thing that doesn’t match up according to you is the amount of people per server is not high enough for you to consider it an MMO. Well who makes the rules anyway. What is the cutoff? Where is the official number per server that a game must reach to be considered an MMO?
---
Downloading now.
---
13.56 GB for the PC version of patch...
---
For me its saying its over 50gb
---
Man I got like a thousand shotgun shells on me, I don't use them, we could trade after the maintenance is over
---
13.56gb here
---
17.19gb xbox 
---
ps4?
---
17.19 on Xbox one 
---
13.5 here
---
Xbox One is coming in at 17.19 GB. 
---
I figure 10 hours is a solid try. Lets you peek in corners and try things out, means you gave it a honest effort.
---
It literally tells you when you claim one that you are entering pvp mode. They have said, on this sub I believe, that it is intentional. And they've even made changes to make them easier to contest and not just at the workbenches itself. It's exactly how they intended them to work. 
---
We may not like it but it's how it is.
---
Relax
---
Pc
---
I wouldn't mind getting the Winterized PA paints/plans. Even though Nuclear winter has nothing to do with seasonal 
---
winter.  
---
yup
---
On pc it is 13.56gb. Hope that helps haha 
---
"They ruined Battlefield..."
---
I don't know. Ask Todd, lol.
---
yesterday after around 150 server hops i found:
---
1xjetpack
---
1x reactive plates
---
2-3x targeting hud
---
no calibrated shocks
---
First I would like to see the ones we already have, fixed, and the missing parts added.
---
A few ready built House Blueprints would also be a nice addition.
---
And for The Love of Rads Bethesda! let us snap the floors, walls, &amp; Stairs together properly without performing some magic Campfire trick.
---
Can confirm, hopefully maintenance is over soon after the download finishes.
---
Considering I haven’t experienced a game crash in weeks, I’ll just assume everything else is exaggerated too. Sounds like you are projecting your own frustrations with your experience with the game onto my own. 
---
DC Universe was crazy in chat, i had so many laughs reading the asinine conversations!! :)
---
PS4's base game was over 100 gigs in the beginning, I hate to see what they have to go through.
---
Same
---
You then download the entire game for some reason, it happens.
---
Google "average gamer age". First result, for me at least is "60 percent of Americans play video games daily. The average gamer is 34 years old and 72 percent are age 18 or older. Women age 18 and older represent a significantly greater portion of the video game-playing population (33 percent) than boys under age 18 (17 percent)."
---
Sooo, how do you figure this video game is for kids? Because it is a video game? Again, Google, video games for adults. Plenty of M and even X rated games that cannot be *legally* sold to kids.
---
Ergo, not all video games are for kids, and vast majority of video game players aren't kids. 
---
See how above I said "why call it *anything at all*?" That's kinda what I mean. Why say *anything at all* when you are completely, factually, verifiably **wrong** in saying it? Just hush.
---
Seems to be luck of the draw then
---
Try to find a legendary weapon that’s low level, such as a level 5 explosive shotgun or level 10 bloodied hunting rifle, those will speed up your process tremendously. When you roam alone the system will only spawn enemies that fit your level, and those weapons will allow you to cut through butter with a hot knife. 
---
It's 17.19 on my XBox so itll be similar hopefully for PS4. 
---
Laser weapons get some love, and I think Fasnacht is this patch too!
---
there is no benefit to NOT having a perk card equipped  
---
"bonuses" to special stats do not grant more points towards using more perk cards, but those bonus stats are used by the game in various calculations.   
---
Example, if you have 15 Strength, and have 15 perk points spent, and get a +1 Str armor piece, while wearing that armor piece you will get the additional +5 carry weight a strength point grants.  
---
When it comes to +1 perception, or +1 luck, those factor into other calculations such as VATS hit chances, or if a "luck" perk activates. 
---
I like trading with people instead of dumping my stuff at the vendor. But its hard messaging people individually. Most low level players run from me. It would be great to just let everyone know I have stuff to trade or that im assembling a team of extraordinary individuals to inflict heinous acts against the SBQ.
---
Nor can you stop it from spreading wild rumors. Sighz
---
morgantown is one of the first few locations you are guided to in the early game missions
---
Are the patch notes out? I can’t find them anywhere yet. 
---
Oh man, wish we could have the fast travel targets from 4. I imagine walking those stairs again and again can be annoying.
---
Damn, that's huge. I might need to get another wireless adapter for that.
---
Not posted yet. We anticipate from minute to minute.
---
Welp rip me
---
Not yet, but soon.
---
What level are you? I liked it at first but it's honestly one of the worst I've seen. It's built around swapping out cards, but there is no quick swap. Most cards are lame or so necessary they aren't really "perks". The layout is annoying to find the card you need or even the category of card you need. I think I would honestly prefer a straight shooter with no RPG elements at all since the only way to really fix this perk system is to tear it down and start over.
---
Apparently he just constantly reposts and from what I’ve read in very shitty ways. I’ve also read something about advertisements but I’m not sure if it’s true or the details
---
No, best you can hope for is to work around it. 
---
Account based credit system.
---
You don't have the money to pay? Every cap you pick up from now on, goes to pay off your debt. Immediately. 
---
Didn't watch the video, my phone hates me. From the single screen shot I can tell you are out of the blast zone. Was this where the fight happened? Trying to lure her out of the blast zone makes her more likely to glitch out. I noticed a lot of the people seeing bugs with the queen are using this tactic. 
---
There are updates for Fallout 4, Skyrim, and ESO fyi
---
Every 3* I have killed lately just drops a crappy 1* item 
---
Imagine if this game survives a year or two, the people that start playing then will have no idea about the TSE crisis of 2019, the machine gun scorchbeasts, the stretchy giant power armor bug, building turret bases outside whitespring etc. What a beautiful thing to imagine.
---
Very cool!
---
Your special points are their own measure in terms of your character's stats. So yes, you will get all of your active bonuses from just having X amount of points in each special. Your active bonuses come in the way of perk cards you equip in those categories to make your character more powerful. In your example, luck is a stat that passively increases the durability of items you find AND leads to your crit meter filling faster in VATS. You will get those bonuses whether you have cards equipped or not. As far as active bonuses are concerned, there are a number of perks in that category that allow you to fill your crit meter even faster, like four leaf clover, grim reapers sprint and psychopath. 
---
The special categories, and the perk cards available therein, help you to develop some synergies that make your character more specialized to your style of play. 
---
18.698 jiggly bits on mah PS4.
---
I wish there was a Mad Max mmo. Maybe then I would go PVP.
---
Yep. You can get a bounty if you search or take from an owned container
---
Well, kind of. But look at most MMOs, the playerbase is split into servers, which are generally separated by platform and region. And then the server is split into zones. At any given moment, you are capable of interacting with players in the same zone or instance as you, which is usually from a few to a few dozen. You can switch zones, go to a different city, it whatever, and interact with different players... but you are permanent limited to the players on your server. Find out your busy plays, but on a different server? Can't play together, unless one of you wants to start over. See a post on a bazaar forum selling something you need, but it's the wrong server? Oh well.
---
Fo76 only has 24 on a server, but that's really more like how some MMOs create new instances of popular zones if too many players try to enter. Your buddy plays? As long as it's the same platform, you can play together. Same with finding players to trade with. If there's half a million active players on, say Xbox, then that's a half million players that you can meet up with, interact with, trade with, even if you have to go to a new instance/server. 
---
It's an mmo with shards, with each shard limited to 24 players and occupying the whole world space.
---
That cave with acid is so fortified, that if you build your camp inside that cave, the SB can't attack you and most of the times you wont even aggro him as long as you are inside. And it is possible to put up collector, stairs and then build platform above collector, with all the crafting stations. 
---
PS4 is 18.6 g

I am Relax just GIVE me the jet man... the jettt keeps me HAPPY I cant work without being HIGH man come on please! Share some of your JET!!! Just PLEASE don’t tell my brother he will make me clean the deathclaw cage again :( 
---
Hmm maybe I should get back into my dream of being an armorer 
---
Been wondering forever. Whats the point otherwise? Might as well not even incorporate that one Mr. Handy that says names from the applicable list before you leave the vault into the hame at tgat point. Guy shoulda called us all ‘Vault Dweller 584863489’ or some shot!
---
What a weird concept. Thanks for the explanation, though.
---
There's a challenge for using one of each of the bobbleheads. 40 atoms I think 
---
Yeah but right now those “shards” don’t interact with each other at all. When they do I’ll call it an mmo. But they don’t. 
---
I don't mind personally, just more of a being helpful to future people kinda thing. Could just edit the post to say it's resolved
---
It's 18,6 GB.
---
Every time I leveled, I looked under agility, but the card is not available
---
Is there a menu to see how many hours you play?
---
We will still use reddit to advertise legendaries. 25 people on a server make the likelihood that the few traders on any server will have exactly what you want slim. What the vendor update will allow us to do is play while ALSO trading.
---
Thanks. Yes, I’m on PC, and yes, I’ve got a mic. I’ll be in touch.
---
Check out fo76map.com leaps and bounds better, plus those of us who have a difficult time with colors it helps!
---
PS4, checked for update. Nothing for me yet. :(
---
Thanks
---
I'm a bit undecided on which way would be better for the game. I like the perk card system. I like that you can swap cards if you want to adjust your build. I like that it's your special stats that controls the build, so even if you had every perk card, your sneak sniper build can't all of a sudden be as an effective melee build simply by swapping cards. But I don't like that it's devolved to swapping cards to lockpick, or even craft/repair, etc.
---
Would separating the stack help, though? If there are enough non-combat slots, everyone would get every card, defeating the purpose of having different build choices. If there aren't enough slots, then you'd still be swapping cards.
---
One idea would be you could only swap cards in camp. With a save build loadout. Then at least, it would be just one button to switch from your farming build to your camp craft/repair loadout. This would also make taking lockpicking a meaningful decision since you can't swap perk cards out in the wild.
---
Also, didn't they mention something like legendary characters? Where you restart at level 1? Maybe the bonus of doing that would be to make perks passive, like lockpicking, so you never have to a perk card slot for it again.
---
Good suggestion. I’m on PC. 
---
Was waiting for these with baited breath, thanks for posting!
---
Mine still isn’t letting me update. You have to do anything specific? I’m checking for updates but it keeps saying it’s at the most current version. 
---
Wait.. do you hold onto your junk thinking that's how you need to craft?? Also you've got the junk shield perk. 
---
Yea man lets see it
---
The economy is very flexible.  Some players don’t value caps at all so they charge high cap prices in order to push toward item trades.
---
Can see massive cap value differences from player to player without having anything weird going on in the background.  
---
And it sounds like you are projecting your satisfaction with your experience into my own.
---
Glad you enjoy paying money to beth in order to do their work for them, it means I benefit from it when or if they finally finish it.
---
I could do with 10 at the moment.
---
Your "wife", or one of your dried turds from one of your unwashed adult diapers?
---
This is really cool.  I am a bit nervous as my primary camp location is next to 9ne of those locations that is mainly inactive at the moment but has lots of potential to draw people. Thanks for sharing.  
---
Cool beans, I'll be on around 3pm EST assuming the game is back up.
---
Each special stat has a passive bonus. For example, strength increases carry weight and melee damage. Special points also allow you to equip a certain number of related perk cards. 
---
If I have the numbers right, a player with 15 strength has 50 lbs more carry weight than a player with 5 strength and random perk cards slotted. If the 5 strength player equipped the Strong Back level 4 perk card, they would 40 lbs carry weight, so only a 10 lb difference.  
---
The +1 stat bonuses are small but meaningful since you have six pieces of armor and a +6 stat is pretty good. The passive abilities of the specials have been posted elsewhere. There are also other options to gain luck such as under-armor, chems, or certain food/drink consumables.   
---
I hope that helps, but it sounds like you could use watching some youtube for new player videos. There are several that you're likely to find if you search around a bit. Good luck. 
---
Thanks dude damn looks like i won’t be able to play today because my internet is slow as hell
---
I like the crappier lookin' stuff, myself. The more slapdash, rigged-up, junk-built... the better.
---
But I get it. 
---
I can see that being abused though to skim a constant stream of caps from a server by two affiliated parties.
---
14:00am.. Idk what to say about this
---
I was just checking for updates on the application in the PS4 home screen. Was seeing current version until about 5 minutes ago. Good luck!
---
19,5GB :-) on PS4
---
&gt;This is a rant to say that Whitesprings is for lvl 40 
---
...and this is a rant to say level 40 gear is not what you want when you are level 80 or above.  When farming ghouls at white springs I routinely come across level 40 legendary gear. 
---
And when I say White Springs, I am talking also about the surrounding area also, like the Uranium Fever event.  At Uranium fever not  a single  item is above level 40, and sometimes gear drops that is as low as level 35. 
---
At the Cranberry bog, which is clearly a late game area, I did a horde event where I killed a 3- star legendary robobrain that dropped a level 35 wooden chest piece, and another horde event where a level 23 mole rat dropped a level 20 ghoul slayer's  baton.
---
No one should ever encounter and enemy below level 50 in cranberry bog who drops gear as low as level 25.  That simply should not happen.  And yet it does.
---
Agreed. And it goes beyond just trading. I would gladly use the /talk "3\* legendary ghoul just north of white spring station" to let anyone else in the immediate area come over and get a whack for loot. Another option that should be considered is a quicker toggle for voice chat mode. Switching around from team to area is cumbersome and should really have a short cut somewhere if that is to be our primary mode of communicating with players we arent grouped up with. 
---
I mean the pipboy is litterally a precursor in the fallout world to the cell phone.  We get radio signals and interactively track actions happening in the world.  I don't get why this wasn't automatically a thing.
---
The pipboy interface needs a major overhaul though.  Tacking it on as another tab just makes a clunky interface worse.  I don't have a fix, but I do know that usability is low.
---
Why is this suddenly a competition. Talking to you has been the most “work” I’ve done related to fallout 76 since October. 
---
&gt; Tomorrow begins the path to full MMO.
---
I mean, I suppose the term "MMO" is now used for *any* multiplayer game, so...fair enough. Then again, might as well just call it "MO" now.
---
Have my upvote OP - thanks for posting here.
---
I haven’t played the game in months and am now downloading this patch and hopping back in. 
---
Keep going Bethesda, you really are turning this game around 
---
That helped! Thanks
---
Since patch 6 you have to destroy something to be flagged for PvP, its hard to come up for the solution to your problem because say we make it impossible for you to get flagged for destroying workshop items then players can abuse that and destroy peoples workshops with no consequence. Honestly doesn't pacifist mode protect you from that? I haven't tested it because I've never used it lol. My stance is if you are are true pacifist player you have that mode on all the time and avoid workshops like the plague because they are PvP areas.
---
Damn and I haven’t even seen the flatwoods monster yet and they’re introducing new cryptids
---
140-170 in a single day :D
---
Gib patch notes
---
Sweet, Thank you!
---
More than that, I need vertical half walls.  I have 1 x 1 and 2 x 1 floor pieces, how am I going to use those efficiently if I don't have vertical half walls? 
---
Commenting on downvoting results in more downvotes, watch it happen to this very comment.
---
I just want to thanks this beautiful community so much; grinding in this game got rid of my grandmother's cancer 
---
That is some thoughtful insight I just thought most griefers were aholes nice to know that there is a strategy behind it.
---
Interesting. I really thought energy weapons would be getting benefits from perks like Tank Killer. I assumed that was a bug. We'll see how well energy weapons work now, but I assume they'll be pretty underwhelming.
---
13 gb download!  Get that bandwidth ready peoples!
---
I tried that one but even inside the cave the Scorchbeast aggroed to me and I couldn’t do anything to escape it.
---
Actually I like them separated.  I mean sometimes if I'm wandering in areas where I know there won't be much more than locks requiring level 1 - maybe a few 2's... I only equip 1-2 cards leaving me another perk point to use for something else.
---
I have to admit - this really isn't a big deal for me.  I mean the same issue happens with hacking terminals - if you're done with most of the quests you're RARELY doing terminal hacks except to launch a nuke.  For me - I leave the lock picking and hacking cards unequipped 90% of the time unless i know I'm going out for a stroll/adventure in an area where I might need em'.
---
I did a full reset of my console and it started downloading automatically on power up. Idk if that was all necessary, but it’s done at least. 
---
Just in time for St. Patty’s day? Green goo beer anyone?
---
You better mark it on ny map then ol pal, i'll get right too it!! but when i come back i want your Hat.
---
I'd like to see the ability to modify armor from light to medium to heavy as well if we can craft a suit of armor we should be able to modify one
---
Radios!!
---
Moonshine. 
---
First
---
What about only being able to change perks in camp? Or what if loadouts are only available in camp? If the idea is to make taking lockpicking meaningful, ie you have to sacrifice card slots for it, then you can't just freely swap it out in the wild.
---
As a tangent, lockpicking/hacking isn't that worth it from my experience. If I don't have lockpicking, I don't really feel like I'm missing anything other that my compulsion to loot everything ingame. I've found rank 3 locked safes simply to be not worth it, the time I spend vs the rewards I get.
---
Craftable radios! I know this is a weird thing to be excited about, but here we are :D
---
Your reference is not lost on me. Yes, In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming. I won’t be on until later-around 8:00 PM EST, but talk to you soon. 
---
RADIOS
---
THANK YOU
---
Radios: Classical and Appalachia Radios can now be crafted and placed in C.A.M.P.s and Workshops.
---
I saw that and literally said out loud in my office - "YES!"
---
I can't stand YongYea. He has negative charisma, and sucks the life out of everything. The dude has no creativity and is just a boring and tasteless content creator. I almost fall asleep watching his videos, and has clickbait titles for anything related to something negative about 76.
---
I still like some youtubers who hate the game though. Laymen Gaming makes me laugh out loud almost every video despite shitting all over 76.
---
All that said, I haven't played 76 for maybe 2 months now. Waiting for some changes/for the duped items in circulation to become obsolete
---
Of course you get downvoted for not being hyped lol
---
You haven't gotten any crashes? Well look at that, I guess the game is fixed for everybody now!
---
Right? 
---
&gt; Really the only good looking one is the bricks and maybe the barn.
---
No, *your* house looks like shit! Mine is glorious, metal walls and all. 
---
The tag line for March 12th specifically reads “A mythical beast, a lost generation of scouts, and the strongest brew this side of the wasteland” 
---
April 9th is player vending 
---
They should make it a -50% PvP only debuff on the first two instances, and then after a warning on respawn it should be a full slap damage debuff in PvP for 24 hours unlogged or 4 hours in game, whichever is longer. Give them nothing to do but grind for caps for a day.
---
Your gear and perk selection has an effect on the drop rate. In my experience the easier it is for you to kill them, the less likely they are to drop legendary loot.
---
Wow they missed the mark on balancing energy weapons. Ignore armor modifiers need to impact energy defense as well. 
---
The only things your should worry about are perks and then the necessary amount of SPECIAL points you need for each category. 
---
Don't follow the guides necessarily they give you word for word. There's no wrong way to do it when you know where everything spawns, it's just about the most effective and comfortable way for you to clear out the buildings without luring too big a horde for yourself. The XP gain is so immense I've never felt rushed to do it
---
Yup. 
---
Need to me. Thank you and reddit for helping change my game. 
---
They nerfed Droprate of Legendaries in Patch 2 or 3.
---
It wont get buffed again. Get over it.
---
It’s certainly in a more stable state than crashing at least once an hour. Like he claims. 
---
FINALLY 
---
I assume fo76 colors things red like the others to tell you when you're about to be naughty? fo4 was particularly bad with putting a magazine in the middle of a bunch of other stolen gear :/
---
Did not know that. I don't watch achievements, so I had not noticed. 
---
I'm a bit sad, i thought we would receive the Survival Mode in this update. It was what i was waiting for, the sweet pvp :).
---
Thanks anyway for the update looking foward to brew a few drinks.
---
lol 20gb for console players.. what. Is that normal for games?
---
Legendary Creatures: Now always drop a legendary item on death. 
---
I sure hope this one works. I'm looking at you drill.
---
Yeah, they are a torso mod for the excavator.  Supposed to reflect 50% of melee damage back to the attacker.
---
Player vending is a start though I wonder what happens if  you have 10K caps on your player and someone buys 18K worth of items? Do the 3K caps just disappear? Will the machine have a cap pool separate from the player caps?
---
Sadly and technically our "trading system" doesn't facilitate true trades. It just allows you to sell items for caps. Luckily players in this game I've traded with have been honest. It is a good player fan base.
---
I do however appreciate the answer even if it wasn't the answer I was looking for.
---
But there definitely is a new duping glitch that got widely shared over the weekend. 
---
Where can you see the breakdown you’re talking about 
---
What you mean?
---
Yea big patches are a norn now. This one is big and good .
---
"Have some damn faith" 
---
Im used to it.  I guess its because often things they break are not affecting ppl who play this like a single player game and and so on. And eternal fanboys ofc. I like the game a lot but beteshda should not be breaking thing and stealth nerfing every patch imo 
---
Bye bye dead mules 
---
Hmm. So RIP my foundation pyramid? 
---
That's how social media works. No one's gonna upvote a boring repetitive post.
---
*sigh*
---
That's 2 days of downloading for me. AFTER the current 50GB Dl for ESO is done (that one is 4 1/2 days).
---
Rural internet sucks.
---
Damn, no fix for the favorites wheel not allowing multiple weapons of the same type to be favorited. 
---
It’s all on the roadmap that they released on their website. I don’t have a link but just google “fallout 76 roadmap”
---
Dupers and people doing the invisible bug, when it gets bad I just hop servers seems to fix it. Real pain in the ass being followed by an invisible tagging your mobs. 
---
Give me the name of an mmo that's alive which is finished and not constantly worked on, updated, patched and tweaked.... 
---
\- **Budget Adjustments:** Some C.A.M.P. objects, such as Turrets and Lights, now consume far less budget, but also have a maximum amount that can be placed in a C.A.M.P. or Workshop. 
---
\- **Bee Swarms:** Are now visible. 
---
Best things in the patch
---
Yeah all I get is the general chart you’re talking about without any side part 
---
Survival is coming on the 26th. Exact dates for all major content this spring are up on the roadmap if you're not sure when something is coming
---
Considering it was a mechanic in FO4 and everyone that tries it after talking about it seems to agree I think it's more fact than myth at this point. It only seems to be a myth to people that don't do it
---
*While above the absolute weight limit, items can no longer be dropped, traded, or consumed. They can only be kept or destroyed*
---
Excellent. Can't wait to season meats with the salt this produces 
---
Games are for kids of all ages, from 6 to 60.  The point is, they are frivolous activities that you're raging about.  Calm the fuck down, go outside.
---
Freak Show is a decent place to grab plastic as well. There's a good bit of bowling balls and bowling pins. Plus lots of caps, and a dead honeybeast to loot
---
Oh I hope this is true! :)
---
Sweet.  Yeah I had no idea.  Crazy Bethesda made it without any kind of description of what it actually is or does, lol...
---
&gt; High rate-of-fire automatic heavy weapons  
---
Can BGS actually tell us what they consider as high ROF automatic heavy weapons in the patch notes?
---
&gt; Weapon damage for all other automatic heavy weapons has been increased by 10% to 20%. 
---
Once again, which weapons are these and what's the percentage increase for each of these weapons?
---
The quality of patch notes for balance changes is really disappointing - we're left guessing what changed and people have to data mine the game files to figure this out.
---
Thank you
---
I wonder how/if it will work with workshops and team-member CAMPs.    
---
Conceivably, you could have a four person team with each player placing their own vending machine on the same property.  Even more if rotating group members.  Granted, ownership ties would likely break on logout but it could be something interesting.
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/Fallout/status/1105204764030177282/photo/1
---
That outlines the entirety of Wild Appalachia and when each part will be coming out.
---
OMG guys finally we can install a RADIO in our CAMP tuned on RADIO APPALACHIA!!!!!!!!!! I've been dreaming of this for so long... finally I can throw my jukebox out of the window!
---
&gt;Radios: Classical and Appalachia Radios can now be crafted and placed in C.A.M.P.s and Workshops.
---
We did it, Reddit!
---
Nah, can’t really “change your whole character whenever you want”. SPECIAL stats can only be changed one level at a time. It takes days of leveling to change a character, unfortunately.
---
they are dice that go up to 20 used in pen and paper roleplaying games to determine things like damage and dodge chance.
---
Hello first DlC! You are a country road sight!
---
This is great but I'm most excited about the in-world radio volumn slider. I never want to hear Atom Bomb Baby again.
---
What if it were a quest rather than having to kill the same group of mobs 500 times. 
---
20 sided dice. It is a TTRPG reference. 
---
Thanks! Two questions:
---
- Are there any key SPECIALs or perks I'm going to want to unlock? 
---
- Is focusing on a single weapon actually useful? I'm used ammo being a concern, so I generally carry a golfbag anyways.
---
 Bethesda missed the mark on balancing energy weapons. You guys need to re-balance energy/ballistic defense of enemies, and make sure ALL ‘reduce armor’ perks and legendary effects impact energy defense as well.
---
Energy weapons will still be too weak to be considered viable in end game content.
---
I always preferred the elder scrolls style of gaining skills.  The way you played guided your build.  If I use one handed weapons I gain one handed skills.  Maybe they could do the same thing with these passive skills.  Open enough level 0 locks to gain lock picking level 1.  Same thing with hacker and terminals.  Sell enough to the vendors to gain better bargaining. 
---
The Top of the World has an area that seems tailor made for something like that 
---
The heavy weapon fire reduction rate might actually be a net loss for gatling guns, which I hope isn't true. 
---
&gt; Radios: Classical and Appalachia Radios can now be crafted and placed in C.A.M.P.s and Workshops.  
---
I was waiting for this since the beginning ! Thank you :)
---
 **VATS:** Firing immediately after entering VATS no longer always causes that shot to miss. 
---
YUUUUUSSS
---
BRING ON THE “DRUNKEN MASTER PARTY BOY” BUILDS!!!!1!
---
&gt;**Stealth:** Players will no longer get stuck in the [Caution] stealth state when no enemies are nearby.
---
_Literally_ the only thing I'm looking forward to tbh
---
Hey there! Any idea how long this patch will take? Gotta plan my day! 
---
Thanks for the Patch Notes! I just have one question. Will the ability to use items from our stash to decorate our C.A.M.P. come today or at a later date?
---
I saw it listed as one of the things coming to Wild Appalachia but didn't see an associated date for release. 
---
Thanks again!
---
PS4 patch downloading, 18.7gb
---
Cannibalism… I assume it's an endurance perk? 
---
Maybe make completing mayor for a day a requirement 
---
Awesome patch , best part is the radios :)
---
Too late. They already distributed all of it to other accounts. This solves nothing 
---
Yeah that’s what I have already, and the info for March 13th says “a mythical beast, a lost generation of scouts, and the strongest brew this side of the wasteland”
---
So it mentions the mythical beast under the tag line for specifically March 13th. I don’t see where people are getting April 9th for the sheepsquatch since April 9th only mentions player vending machines. So I assumed there must be a more detailed chart than this
---
The fire rate change was only for high rate of fire heavy weapons, so I think it's safe to assume that doesn't include the Gatling gun.
---
Hello, legendary drills!
---
Thank you guys for the very helpful answers! Yes I did notice that when there’s certain items with ‘+1 strength’ equipped, my carry weight got a +5 bump. But the differences in other categories aren’t very obvious. I looked it up when I first picked up the game but most people were talking about the function of specific perk cards, not how the matrix is being calculated. 
---
They are broken for a long time, you can do nothing to fix it, just wait.
---
Well, there's that challenge for playing 7600 hours. 
---
Love y'all 
---
/u/LoneVaultDweller, could your team please look into renaming perk cards so that like-items appear together alphabetically?
---
During tense gameplay moments, it’s uber frustrating trying to find the right cards to equip, especially for high-level players who have a lot of duplicates.
---
If we could rename “Master Shotgunner” and “Expert Shotgunner” to “Shotgunner (Master)” and “Shotgunner (Expert),” that would be a huge QOL improvement.  These cards would be then grouped togther and much easier to equip. Ive suggested this a number of times.  This would apply to numerous perks, like picklock, slugger, heavy weapons, etc.
---
Sorry ahead of time for high-jacking the thread.
---
The difference is those games are adding content to a finished product.
---
When 76 released it literally had broken missions, broken servers and *still* requires updates to address game breaking issues.
---
People are pissing their pants in excitement over adding content that's only missing because the game literally could not run with it until they fixed it. Then the update breaks something and they have to fix *that* as well.
---
76 is a lot closer to an mmo than it is to anything else. Only 24 players per server, but you can go servers to play with anyone that plays on the same platform. How is that different from a mmo with thousands on a server, but it used shards to limit the number of players in any given instance?
---
No favorites wheel fix. I’m a sad wastelander with too many legendary weapons of the same type. 
---
&gt;Mutations: Fixed an issue that prevented Adrenal Reaction’s positive effects from being applied to players who had the Mutation prior to Patch 6 release.
---
Thank you. I haven't played the game in a month because of this bug.
---
Ageed, if we start label all online multiplayer games as mmo why not call BF, CoD, Overwatch etc moba games -.- 
---
Ive got double barrel twoshot. Pretty neat and damage with max perks is shown as 277. But i agree it costs a bit too much, cost imo should be lowered to 5 plastic instead of 10.
---
Survival mode is coming later this month, currently planned for March 26!
---
Super excited for all of the new content! 
---
Here's another (slightly smaller) bug list. 
---
For anyone interested, here is list number [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a575z2/fallout_76_patch_notes_december_11_2018/ebkrjo0/?context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a83nxr/fallout_76_common_issues_and_solutions/ec8eabn/?context=3)/[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aejlcj/fallout_76_january_10_patch_notes/edpv47p/?context=3)/[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al0bl3/fallout_76_patch_notes_january_29_2019/ef9gpil/?context=3)/[5](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asat8r/fallout_76_patch_notes_february_19_2019/egsw5r0/?context=3)

***Bugs***
---
* When dismembered, glowing enemy pieces sometimes [revert to their base textures](https://imgur.com/a/W0HojBj) (enemies that I have confirmed this happens with are Radtoads, Ants, Wendigos and Snallygasters)
---
* It is possible to go out of bounds in the General's Steakhouse after standing up from a bench, [as seen in this gif](https://imgur.com/a/lqSlJwt). Your character must be female, and you must be in combat
---
* The hand coverings on the Ritual Bindings outfit [glow in all lighting conditions](https://imgur.com/a/poRVLTf), only in 1st person
---
* 'Plan: Water Purifer - Small' is spelled incorrectly, 'Purifer' should be 'Purifier'
---
* Plan: Water Purifier - Small does not correctly show up as (Known) by default; once consumed it gives you the message "You already know", and then gives you a (Known) version of the plan
---
* The loose version of the Cryolator Crystallizing Barrel mod (as found in the world or bought from vendors) is misnamed "Cryolator Long Barrel" 
---
* Pipfall, Zeta Invaders, Grognak &amp; the Ruby Ruins, and Atomic Command holotape games are all missing their unique holotape model (for reference, Nuka Tapper, Automatron and Red Menace have their correct unique models)
---
* Dropping junk too quickly can sometimes drop random inventory items including, but not limited to, keys and holotapes (this is why the "you cannot drop keys" message sometimes pops up while dropping junk)
---
* Mini-nukes (and certain other projectiles like missiles) can sometimes disappear when they hit an enemy/terrain, without doing damage/exploding
---
* In locations where enemies are randomized and high level (40+), Liberators can spawn that will incorrectly drop Glowing Meat when killed
---
* Charleston Landfill and Lakeside Cabins still sometimes cannot be claimed, with floating quest markers but no actual enemies present
---
* Equipping a Junkie's weapon while you have an addiction will cause grenade/throwing weapon damage to increase as well (you can see your other weapon damages also increase when you equip the Junkie weapon)
---
* Pompadour Wig has a white model when 'inspected' but is black when equipped
---
***Quality of Life Wishlist***
---
* Increase rain/rad storm frequency slightly, these are the types of weather I see least often (only seen 3 rad storms in all my time since BETA)
---
***Gameplay/Balance Wishlist***
---
* Enclave Plasma mods cannot be learned via scrapping - seems like a bit of an oversight (remember that Enclave Plasma guns do **not** share mods with normal plasma guns, they are treated as entirely separate guns) 
---
* Ghouls/Scorched/Hermit Crabs/Gulpers/Wendigos that are "hiding", be they up in trees or prone on the ground, are too easily detected because of VATS/nameplates. Personally I would love if they could still be damaged, but **not** show up in VATS/show a name when looked at, until they stop hiding (and maybe moving VATS-detection to a perk like Awareness?)
---
* Buff the Syringer, it's not viable as a main weapon due to incredibly low damage (30-40 damage over 10 seconds?), nor as a supportive weapon since Endangerol is very inconsistent
---
Ban The Bot!
---
Now its suddenly just a "joke" and your follow up is more toxicity. 
---
You just proved my entire point.
---
That's fair. Cheers.
---
also Fort defiance has a ton of plastic and ballistic weave (as well as almost everything else). I like to go there just to get both at once.  Takes a bit longer and not the best place for low levels but once you have gear its a good haul for the time.
---
You can see the math for yourself in game if you apply all the armor in question. Your DR, broken down by type, is displayed on the bottom of your pipboy screen. I find this really handy for figuring out how which armor is better when it comes to the sliding scale type stuff like vanguards where it has a higher DR the higher your health.
---
&gt;It's built around swapping out cards, but there is no quick swap.
---
This is the entire issue in a nutshell.
---
Radios!
---
Lol that assaultron head ate over 2300 fusion cells I'd scavenged. I was mad until I realized I could craft them with the other stuff I scavenged. Oh well, glad its fixed
---
Cool! I use to live here until recently. I even placed my stuff like you did (kinda the only way). After a while i moved down to the base of the stairs and used the monorail as a bar, placing barstools and tables in the middle. If you have your turrets on the ground, scorchbeasts may still fire some shots at the top structures, but will fly away since no turrets are firing back. I also noticed some things. Molerats spawning every time i fasttravel, login or approach the basebase. There are also recipies that might spawn inside the monorail sometimes (along with other random stuff that spawns there). If you plant some gourds, you can quickly access the cranberries that grows in the middle of the "pink forest" nearby. add some carrot flowers and boiled water and you can do Cranberry Relish, which gives you an XP boost :) Cheers!
---
Thanks again for the flux!  👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
---
My headset was on my other PS4 that my wife was using, otherwise I would’ve verbally thanked you!   
---
Seriously it’s so annoying there’s at least 100 of these a day even when i sort by best/hot...you’d think they’d just check the frickin sub first 
---
Appreciate the love for Energy and Heavy Weapons! But is there any talk about increasing the crafting amount of Flamer Fuel? The base amount of 5 seems way too low.
---
They have a list of names from fallout 4 , they could add those names plus your fallout NPC classic character names onto a name generator thingy then we pick upto 3 names from that list. Easy.
---
I did the same, lol!
---
Anti-armor chainsaw plz RNG.
---
It does not cancel it out. I have both the mutation and +200
---
Requests for marginally useful/useless camp items. "Bethesda I simply NEED the drapes from that one window in that one place in FO3!" I can appreciate that people love to build even though it's something I don't care about but it annoys me due to more urgent matters I feel should be addressing. To each their own, I guess.
---
On a side note, I also don't understand why people get excited about Grahm, charming personality aside. I check him everytime I see him but have never once found something useful on him. 
---
It happens with ghoul officers when they don't drop the code piece. Which makes sense that it will follow you into a new server.
---
Not ranged but melee I should have specified. Since people are saying they get 1000’s of damage with melee I guess I’m still pretty underpowered.
---
I went into my xbox and did not see any update ready for the game. Does anyone know when it drops/is it out?
---
He makes like 2 or 3 vids with actual validation and decent content, then makes 20 more vids around tiny insignificant things that thrive off of the bandwagon of hate. I’m not saying I think most of the things he says have no basis of truth at all but he just drones on and on about the same things just to farm content surrounding cheap drama.
---
The radios were in the BETA and removed.  Odd thing to remove, I'd say.
---
Now, they just need to bring back fast travel mats for CAMPS and not just workshops.
---
I, too, have now subbed to him. Props to the OP for introducing me to a new fallout video guy.
---
It’s in there, no longer consumes all fusion cells.
---
WTB: Bloodied Drill!

Re: the new reporting feature
---
I have a house with a shed to the side, in which I’ve got all my workbenches and a power armour station, and it’s guarded by an unlocked garage door. Next to the power button, with the small metal lettering, I have written “use my shed? Owe me head!” Is that something I’m now in danger of being reported for and consequently could lose my account for? 
---
Booze.
---
Hooch.
---
Firewater.
---
They are adding the ability to make your own alcoholic drinks in the game.
---
Video games for kids? I could be wrong here because I haven't actually checked the age on F76 but I dont think it was made for children.... I could be wrong though.
---
Excited for brewing! Thanks for this update Beth!
---
I only wish I could use a flamer to unceremoniously burn that Classical Jukebox.
---
Movement speed, definitely not. Sneak, I don’t think so? But I’ve never really been a stealth player, so I’m not 100% sure. 
---
I don't even bother picking locks anymore.  The reward is never worth the pain of equipping the cards.
---
So now if i dont sell my weapons randoms request or i reject trade they can report me? 
---
C.A.M.P. decor is coming in a future Wild Appalachia update, starting with the ability to display certain items in display cases and racks.
---
I request Greenhouse from FO4 but must mention my love for the black metal set 🤩
---
EDIT: this acts like a AMA and for you to tell me your raider moments, get high on Med-X and kill a vault dweller, get fucked up on Psycho and go psycho on a settler, let me know! 
---
Damn that sucks dude. Hopefully in the future they can consolidate the patches more. I definitely didn't expect a patch this large in size. Hopefully the changes are worth it. From what I read on the notes I don't know why it'd be this large unless they're replacing entire folders with new ones with similar contents, but maybe there are patch changes they didn't list.
---
Yup. Wasn’t one of their first patches like ~45GB or something?
---
Radios!!!
---
I think people are over using the term griefing. You guys are just getting your camp destroyed all you have to do is change worlds and it’s part of the game anyway that’s why Bethesda doesn’t ban ppl for destroying camps and it results in bounties. The whole point of the game is to grind and part of the grind is gonna have to include getting your shit blown up from time to time it happens to everyone 
---
Cold Case fixed. Be still my heart! I can finish it. :D
---
Guess I'm driving home at lunch. Good thing I live 10 minutes from work.
---
It’s not. I’ve been talking about them since beta, it’s about damn time. 
---
As a builder, this pleases me to no end.
---
This is, hands down, my number one request for the game. 
---
Can bethesda fix the double and quad effects on the gatling plasma? I've had one since launch in the Hope's it would get fixed bit the double and quad effects dont effect the ammo capacity in the gatling plasma and presumably gattling laser as well
---
  Why wasn’t ignore armor effects changed to ignore energy defense as well? Without this change, there’s still no point to use energy weapons over ballistic.
---
Also, why does a level 50 ultracite rifle do LESS damage than a normal level 45 laser rifle?
---
What do they plan to do with the legacy explosive energy weapons?
---
I just gained a massive appreciation for the 3* bloodied meat hook I've been keeping around.
---
Thanks for the reply! I'm really excited for everything coming up, especially the ability to use stash items for decorations.
---
I think your weapon will do 50% armor pen of the 25% that's left
---
Man people will whine about anything here these days 
---
Not Really. Many have spread some of their items out -- however are still *vastly* over the limit in weight. 
---
Connect power to the switch on opposite side of keypad, and not the door? Took me a second...
---
Dang, no BOS daily quest fix yet. =(
---
VATS fixes FTW !!!
---
Especially for bethesda and WB.
---
I still remember Doom being a 100 gb download just like that.
---
Account name should ALWAYS be displayed, but I wish it was secondary to character name. 
---
The griefers would have a heyday if they could hide their account names.
---
Fair, that's still pretty damn good then :) cheers for the reply 
---
Legendary Creatures: Now always drop a legendary item on death.
---
YESS
---
&gt; Radios: Classical and Appalachia Radios can now be crafted and placed in C.A.M.P.s and Workshops.
---
Yay!
---
Its baby steps, I'm sure they'll slowly fix them as more patches roll in
---
I hope we dont have to reapply mutations again 
---
The catch: drills will only drop with Stalkers legendary prefix. 
---
YASSSSSSS, Radium Rifle suppressor!!!!!!
---
I just want to know why we can't quick swap loadouts in this game without having to use a mod. Is the current, 'one-freaking-card-at-a-time' loadout swap just another attempt at padding the game? Because that's the only reason I can think of.
---
Did they really need to "fix" stackable foundations?
---
Yeah, no worries. It might be the other way around, though. I'm honselty not to sure about the order, but I'm pretty sure it will NOT do 100% or (125%) armor pen. Have fun with the new content!
---
Can you comment on the ability to place ANY items in our camp? This is really what we want, not just specific items. 
---
Who hurt you? ;)
---
WOW!!  
---
I think you meant "Whitespring" when you said "Whispering" lol
---
“fo76 is $15 at my local GameStop is it worth it to buy?” 
---
I never understood that, if you want to try it try it if not don’t why do they have to get approval 
---
rest in pyramids
---
Guess we'll see
---
If you are in a sharded mmo and another player is in the same spot, same zone, same server as you, but in a different insurance from you, how do you interact with them? If the game has the option, one of you can hop instances, it your can both rezone and try to end up on the same instance.
---
If you and another player on in the same spot in 76, but on different servers, how can you interact with them? One of you sender hops. Exactly like any other mmo that had population limited instances, only the map isn't broken up into zones. 
---
If you dupe and flood and the market on a sharded mmo, you affect the economy of the whole server, but not other servers. If you dupe and food the market on 76, you affect the economy of every server on your platform, but not on other platforms.
---
ATOM BOMB BABY LITTLE ATOM BOMB
---
Thr vanilla was better people will arrive soon. 
---
What was the point of reducing the price of raw flux that much? Unless I'm remembering wrong it was like ~30 before 
---
 **Stealth:** Players will no longer get stuck in the \[Caution\] stealth state when no enemies are nearby. 
---
I recently started a sneak/vats build, this and the vats fixes are very welcome. However, I also notice that scorch beast spawns instantly take me out of hidden into danger, as well as legendary mobs spawning in events like uranium fever. Are these intended or bugs?
---
Yeah this is a big one for me.  Wasted so many shotgun rounds due to this.
---
Didn't knew that, i really apreciate what you guys are doing, thanks you very much.
---
Grenade it instead! Explosions are twice as much fun as fire.
---
These are all great, I'm particularly stoked about the energy weapons. I have a few ideas to add. Legendary minor quests? Ones that don't need 20 people like the scorch queen. But will be extremely hard for 1 min/maxer to do by himself/herself. How about a bat cape that let's us glide at whatever speed we started without using extra ap? That would give us something useful to craft out of sbq wings
---
Enjoy yourself and take your time. Don't grind until you hate yourself just for some good gear.
---
Don't bother comparing your gear/ability to kill to other players. A couple months ago practically everyone and their sister got their hands on all the best gear through exploits and is actually why I haven't played in about two months (downloading newest patch to get back into it). 
---
Treat it like a single player game, and make a friend or two to enjoy the experience
---
Any news on fixing the fact that energy weapons don't benefit from anti-armor effects? Or is that intentional and energy weapons are just meant to be worse than ballistic?
---
I'm concerned about wiring. Hopefully we can still send them through walls 
---
As a home brewer, I cannot tell you how ecstatic I am that my IRL hobby is now in game. 
---
Couldn't they just raise level cap to 76 or raise level cap in increments based on expansions to the game? 
---
No, it's multiplicative, not additive. It's 50%+(50%*75%) for 87.5% AP total. I just explained this in a thread earlier today so look through this for a more thorough explanation.
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0kohm/lone_wanderer_and_legendary_armor_damage_taken/
---
I did think it would be a bit too easy to be able to completely nullify armour that way haha. I can't waut yeah, update is finished downloading and installing now, hopefully it's not offline for long as I have a day off today. 
---
I had pacifist on but I was killed.
---
Oh, I see youre a veteran of the glory that was post NGE Star Wars Galaxies... lol
---
This is for sure going to be a controversial one. Rip mules, but hello new found server stability 
---
From what I have read they struggle to even respond to support tickets, so I wouldn’t worry about this player reporting thing bieng something they take much notice of either
---
It’s the dlc kind of. Small and large I installments of content. Like right now they’re adding brewing to the game. New craftables and stuff. 
---
I would not be able to live with the constant creaking back and forth of the suspended train 100 feets in the air and sleep soundly in my camp
---
You guys have been busy. Thanks !
---
The Assaultron Head should be fixed with today's patch!
---
&gt; Weapons: The Salvaged Assaultron Head no longer consumes all Fusion Cell ammo when fired for the first time.
---
Yeah I mean a lot of the credit card gamers have all the atom shop items already. Credit card gamers for the win!
---
the healing factor mutation not working bug wasn't addressed? Phoo
---
Its not sweet, its a one-hit fest.
---
thanks for the info about the xp boosting food. I'll look into it
---
This is discouraging to hear, a shotgun build was going to be my next character. Hope this gets addressed, as well as all the other weapon types - flamer/cryolator/etc.
---
Glad to help!
---
&gt; Kill him in one shot 5 caps reward: awesome! Pretty sure that doesn't even pay for the bullet I just used to kill him.  
---
Sorry, that's the chance you take when you engage in PVP.  If you don't like it maybe you shouldn't engage in it. 
---
Perfect answer thankyou very much, I shall go read that now. That's still pretty damn good AP so I'm happy :) 
---
Bethesda is listening to the people! Thank you for these updates and bringing us new content and updates. People around the net Hating on Fallout 76, but I’ve enjoyed it so far. 
---
You think TSE is OP but you haven't tried it? I appreciate your desire to avoid fueling dupers, but I hope you get to try one. I bought a TSE handmade post-nerf, and while it's the best general-purpose ranged weapon I have, it's not amazing. It's only a marginal improvement over my previous weapon, a furious + 10% aim handmade. Super mutants and gutsys are still bullet spongy. That's okay I guess. I like a challenge, but I really worry that DLC will add even bigger (boring) bullet sponges.   
---
You should be able to get a good max-level one-star handmade without getting near dupers. Just furious or anti-armor alone isn't that expensive. I cannot rule out anything being duped, but it seems unlikely.   
---
Not to get into the melee-versus-range morass, but my TSE with full perks is far lower DPS than my melee despite only having 8 strength and martial artist 3 for perks. 
---
There was a note they are down for maintenance this morning. Can’t remember when but it must be now. 
---
The servers are down because they are applying the update... you’ll be able to download it when they come back on.
---
Really? LMG, 50cal, and minigun for ballistic weapons. Cryolator, flame, gatling plasma, and gatling laser are energy.
---
What do you mean ?
---
This is a huge patch and I’m excited. Can’t wait to login later. 
---
Glad to have you back! :)
---
oooohhh nice, some free shopping in the store after all XD
---
Wear the eye of ra it gives BoB 100% armor pen
---
That was legit a lot to take in. Now I giddy with excitement waiting for the servers to come back online.
---
We're working on that one! 
---
Mine was downloading. Reset your system maybe 
---
&lt;Clicking “Report Player” will open a reporting menu that features several reporting options, including: Cheating/Exploiting, Harassment, Offensive Name, and Real-World Threat.&gt;
---
Can someone at Bethesda define "harassment"? Me and my friends roleplay as Raiders sometimes and don't want to get banned because someone doesnt like PVP (We don't grief, if someone isnt into PVP, we leave them alone. But we have still be called griefers from just dealing the initial slap damage to see if they hit back, or when we contest workshops and are worried this feature may be abused).
---
There is still an issue affecting Adrenal Reaction that can cause its positive effects to disappear from your Pip-Boy if you log out/in or change servers. This is a visual issue, so you should still actually benefit from its positive effects. 
---
We're actively working to address this as well, but it didn't make it into today's patch.
---
oh thought you could download the patch already? seems others already have here in reddit
---
Literally had no idea there was any differences from anything I learned in game. Only know because of this sub.
---
also looks like the various SBQ glitches haven't been addressed either. Well, I guess the solution is to just turn your attention to the Fasnacht parade and not bother with the SBQ anymore
---
Yeah the camp items thing was kinda dumb to me at first but people just want Bethesda to put stuff in so they can give them money and give them an actual reason to do challenges and stuff. Idk why they always ask for the most obscure stuff but I doubt Bethesda will even put in 5% of those item requests in the game I’d prefer they work on stability and the overall gameplay more tho since that’s what most people have trouble with 
---
Then that would be really limited content.  I was a hardcore Everquest raider for years.  Stuff like Epic quests were great for really awesome items, still had some farming involved to get things you needed but if that was all the content that was in the game, it would die quickly since everything was a one-off.  Hell, once you beat raid expansions and farmed most of the guild up on current gear there was some dead time until the next content release to farm up/grind again.  Only time that didn't happen was when I played Everquest 2 and you could auction loot in general server chat so there was always a reason to farm.
---
But like I said, I also was someone who in those dead times for content would actively go back to older content or get stuff together for current content to farm effectively cosmetic items because I did/do enjoy grinding for something.  
---
With MMO grinding, it was literally get a group if you can't solo the content, find a spot that you guys could farm and sit there for hours killing the same spawns over and over again until you get what you/your group wanted or had to leave.  MMOs I think have become more casual friendly over the years (like I said, been out of MMOs for 7ish years) so that there is a lot less grind needed since most of the player bases now have other responsibilities and can't sit there playing the game for 10+ hours a day.
---
Final note - to illustrate why your idea is bad for all content for online games like this, think of it this way.  If to achieve your final build, all you had to do was complete say 7 quests and it would be done, that would mean you would have a reason to play for 7 quests and then afterwards nothing left for you to do so you quit.  Single player games, that's fine.  You bought the disc, there are not any server costs to keep the game up and running so it's fine if you just plug, play, and drop because it's designed to be limited content.  Online games have server costs.  While Fallout76 does have a base cost game and does not have a subscription cost, it does have microtransactions to earn money for all the costs associated with keeping the game running.  If people just quit after finishing 7 quests, the game would die due to people not spending money on the earned revenue portion since they didn't have a reason to continue playing the game or really even stay that invested with it.  It's basic gaming industry business.
---
Are there new Achievements?  I don't recall seeing anything about this.
---
Yeah it’s a little annoying, I was have a small panic thinking I’be lost one of my handmades
---
yea, mines not. 
---
When a player’s caps isn’t sufficient to pay for his bounty, he shouldn’t be able to play pvp any more and his future earnings of any caps immediately go to the person he owes. This should have been implemented right from the start. However shooting a piece of wall will get them covered at 5 caps no matter how much griefing they do to others next. It’s a pro-crime system at its core no matter what. 
---
I really like where your head is at on this. I dunno about you, but I loved the Oblivion/Morrowind system of using it to level up. To apply that to a 'passive' sticker system I think can work really well. Also the idea of them being personal only works well. My thought anyway
---
Oh yes!!!!!
---
Yeah... seems broken, but the PvP is broken or at he very least unbalanced... why would you play PvP on a game that seems to treat it more like an afterthought.  Sure you can... but you can do a lot of things, seems to me a game specifically designed for PvP like Fortnite or Apex Legends would be a better choice. I mean you do you .. but why? It's like eating tacos at Outback Steakhouse.
---
What a phenomenal patch across the entire board.
---
&gt;**New Features: C.A.M.P. Decorating, Player Vending, Functional Camera** – Use items from your stash to decorate your C.A.M.P. Build vending machines and flag items for sale. Simply set your prices and walk away to continue your adventures in Appalachia, being sure to capture all your favorite memories using the new functional camera. The vending machines do all the work, you just need to count the caps.
---
I don't see anything about this in the patch notes. Can anyone confirm? This was the only thing I was super excited about.
---
Someone mentioned something a month or two ago that made perfect sense. Reopen vault 76 and make it a marketplace where players could go and buy and sell. And because it doesn't have combat or enemies make it it's own server with a much higher limit on players. That way it solves the player limit issue and the trader availability issue. 
---
Enjoy that Swiss German. Hehe.

And yes, it is a huge 3 Day long Party.

&gt;Legendary Creatures: Now always drop a legendary item on death.
---
YES!!!!!!!
---
I like to WTS the emperor outfit, and laugh at the people who ask HM.
---
Duly noted.
---
it just stopped working, everything is correctly powered.
---
The necklace you get from the order of mysteries? All it seemed to do for me was increase the armour rating of the garb of mysteries, but then that was a pretty late night session haha. 
---
The wasteland needs villains after all.
---
LMAO
---
It is very good. There was another thread on AP that discussed how AP is way less important for melee weapons due to incisor although I can't find it. The blade of bastet is a great early weapon but note that you may eventually want to switch to a different legendary modifier as you're only getting 12.5% extra AP while running incisor. 
---
Its actually unclear - I could see the 50cal falling into either category.  You're guessing that list you provided - I want a definitive list.
---
As for the slower automatic heavy weapons, they gave a range, which weapons got 10%, which ones got 20%, which ones got something in between like 15%?
---
This is what happens when you write bad patch notes - people start making ASS-umptions!
---
Hahaa I managed to stay online about 1-2 minutes AFTER the logout timer expired. Never seen that one happen before, it was just down to 2 seconds when I finished off my business with last vendor on my cycle, at Harpers Ferry.
---
I'm a bit surprised by one thing. Although I like playing and whenever I play I tend to play a lot, Fallout 76 doesn't have anything highly compelling thing, to make me play it daily. Sometimes I play it just maybe twice a week. And it's all because other games are more compelling. They have serious dailies and stuff like that. I kinda wish Fallout 76 would have more of that. Some people hunt daily and weekly atoms. I barely even look occasionally at the stuff, atoms don't seem worth chasing for.
---
This upcoming stuff today is not really exiting. Collect plants that grow on spesific regions and brew some minor boosters that last whopping 30 mins. No thanks.
---
Or the event that starts next week. Stupid masks I don't care anyway. I will still play it in case I get something valuable I can trade for something I personally value. With very strong likehood I won't.
---
But when vending machines or dungeon raids come, oh yeah...thats the good stuff I look forward to. I don't think the game changes much, YET. 
---
Depending on how they do it and how do people like it, the new PvP mode could be a  major change. Player vending machines is not a major thing for most players, I believe. I think it will be badly implemented too, where you can set only prices in integers, not allowing you to sell or buy ammo that's way below that in value. I have not seen anyone else mention it needs to change or it won't be good for all stuff.
---
Events ect: I donä't think it's really going into MMO mode. The rate at which Bethesda is doing them, it's anywhere near MMO class. We will just have some new events and quests, not a game changer.
---
Vault Raids will probably change the game quite, if the new PvP mode fails to make that impact.
---
See you on other side of patch!
---
Same, and honestly when I see a random player in game that is putting up the “let’s trade” emote, I will always stay away from that person. Read something on this sub a while back saying other players can access our inventories during a trade, what if it was a hacker of any sort? No buy.
---
no
---
I thought they were adding legendary vendors, so we could sell our useless 3 star stuff and get new stuff????
---
Me too! I have always been on the lookout for a buildable area that happens to have a radio. Now I am free!
---
Perfect
---
That's not true. Unplugging the gamepad switches to m/kb. At leat it does in Fallout 4, never tried in 76.
---
No ninja-nerfs. Please no ninja-nerfs...
---
Does the Fasnacht Parade go live today?  The calendar had it listed as the 19th...
---
&gt;  The message displayed when an individual server is shut down for maintenance is now: “Please join another World. This World will be undergoing maintenance soon.” 
---
There was a message before? Previously I would gradually become the very last person until I got kicked. Never saw any kind of message. It was right after my first nuke launch too. That was a bummer. But at least I got all the violet flux I needed.
---
I dunno. Invisible mutant bee swarms seems like a real terror of the wasteland.
---
Why do you complain where there is a roadmap to see yourseld?
---
We have them for workshops so there really is no excuse.
---
SO people are still banned 🤣???
---
Atoms are shared per account. I have a couple locations that I missed/didn't get credit for on original and got them with the second.
---
Yay, reboot fixed it.  Downloading now = ) 
---
Laser Rifles last twice as long? Am I the only one that thinks they need a bigger buff than that? 
---
Not even an exaggeration: they barely last 5-10 minutes, so twice as long is only going to make them last 20 minutes or so whilst my ballistic guns can go for hours and hours without needing a repair.
---
Try it with your BoB! You can wreck with 100% armor pen.
---
I thought I was going crazy! I could have sworn I had a radio in my camp and COULD NOT for the life of me find that anywhere
---
I'm updating on Xbox now. It also saya 17.19 GB instead of 20.
---
I'm currently switching between black diamond and blade of bastet, waiting on upgrading black diamond to lvl 45 though so it's doing less damage than the bastet even with the +2 str. 
---
restart PC, was able to start downloading it now.  Don't have to wait for servers. 
---
I love all the VATS fixes
---
thank you
---
This patch sounds amazing. Can't wait to download and play! Thank you!
---
I found them once on my main and once on my alt.  So I took the pair found by my main, transferred it to my alt and now have them on both legs.  I don't expect to ever have them for my alt. 
---
typically MMO servers can host thousands of people.   
---
but I'd argue that fallout 76 fails to pass the test based on a bunch of other metrics. No world chat (or any chat other than proximity voice chat), no central economy, no dedicated social space, no dedicated fixed servers, etc etc.   
---
We let games like monster hunter and destiny get away with the misnomer because they have SOME of these elements but fallout 76 has almost none of them. It's pretty much just a single player fallout game you can play with other people. It's an expanded coop rpg. Not much different from something like divinity original sin, just with a few more players.   
---
but hey, If you want to call it an MMO I'm cool with that. No need to be pedantic about it, right?
---
&gt; **Legendary Creatures:** Now always drop a legendary item on death.
---
\#YES!
---
I will have to check again. Thanks.
---
17.19gb update on Xbox! 
---
&gt;Radios: Classical and Appalachia Radios can now be crafted and placed in C.A.M.P.s and Workshops.  
---
Ayyyyyy, a nice Cake day present for me
---
you can still download patches during maintenance.... Reboot fixed my situation
---
My main is heavy weapons. I don't have to guess which is high ROF. Every gun on that list is automatic. The only automatic I didn't include is the gatling because it is slower than a semiautomatic rifle.
---
How do you define “content”??!?
---
It seems to me that having to camp all day killing the same mobs has far less content than a very difficult quest that it takes you a few attempts to complete. 
---
Really great news. Glad to hear. I'll be giving the assaultron head a shot.
---
If there's one more thing I'd ask, can you bring up the rate in which flamer fuel is being made to the team. You can only make 5 at a time and unfortunately the weapon isn't viable because of this.
---
If you search through this sub reddit it's pretty widely requested but I don't think it gets the attention it deserves.
---
Thanks so much. 
---
Yup, 10 out of 10, will build many radios
---
Glad you got it to work. 
---
No, because you obviously are asking for a salvaged assaultron head in payment. You aren't responsible for anyone else's dirty minds. 
---
Well shit! Thanks dude :) 
---
Lots of plastic can be found at Ohio River Adventures.  And you only have three low level ghouls to deal with.
---
There are lots of lifesaver rings and you can also find a bunch of golf balls.
---
I missed this, this is huge for me. Always loved coming back to my FO4 settlement and having the radio in the background, having it in my camp will definitely make it feel more homey.
---
I have not been able to do the daily where you get the Bat DNA since early December. Many other people have the same issue.  I think the issue comes from when you get booted from the server while its up.
---
So, I guess power armour pieces randomly unequipping is something we'll have to wait until the next patch to sort out?
---
That's some cold shit, Beth. I like it.
---
Loophole!
---
me 2 =)
---
Marsupial will be -4 intelligence and you won't be able to jump at all
---
Concur completely. Mixing crafting/lifestyle perks with combat perks makes zero sense. It is an unnecessary annoyance.
---
I like the idea of presets you can select but still think non-combat perks should be separated.
---
Dayumnnnn! Bethesda really did put some work into this one
---
am i a joke to you?
---
So the gatling is the only slow firing heavy weapon, and they list a range between 10 to 20% for slower firing heavy weapon automatics?  You're absolutely wrong then cause there's got to be more than 1.  Remember what happens to people that make assumptions...
---
Yes. Maybe add some distilled recipies to give them buff and debuff effects. Load a distilled stimpack and shoot your teammates. A distilled toxic goo to add a DOT to a bad guy. A medic build dream weapon.
---
What? Why? Where did you get this from?
---
I never played FO4 but I make a lot of 9 story skyscrapers in FO76 so a glass wall may be really good for a modern designed skyscraper
---
 **Foundations:** Addressed an issue that could allow players to stack Foundations under certain circumstances. 
---
Guess I can’t renovate my bunker Maby I’ll make a bar! :,( 
---
Are you on PC? If you are we can run the MoM with my berserker and Ill give you mine
---
I hope you are right.  In my view creating a reporting mechanism without some notions of due process is dangerous, but adding such protections is expensive.   This could go poorly in either direction.   Wasn’t too long ago “witchhunters” assumed every high-level, low-level pairing were “dupers” and every one who beat them in PVP was an “exploiter.”   
---
I Really hope they fixed those duping issue, btw the VATS and Stealth issues fixed makes me happy ;)
---
I didn't even realize that was a thing, I just thought I had shit perception.
---
A couple of new quests...wow, goodbye base game for a full hour !
---
Are people still going to be able to freely switch between survival and normal mode?
---
Yeah I'm on PC, we will have a look when the server is back up, thankyou :) my username is the same as my reddit one. 
---
Buy my shit
---
Yup! That’s me! 
---
Actually so true 
---
Maybe I missed it, but did they address bulk items being broken down with scrap all? 
---
&gt;Heavy Weapons
---
&gt;We’ve reduced the fire-rate for high rate-of-fire automatic heavy weapons across the board and increased their damage by +10%. Adjusting these weapons’ fire-rates gave us more room for a damage increase, which will help them punch through armor more effectively without increasing their baseline damage per second too high.

so the LMG is still going to be garbage it seems. 10% increase to 16 damage (with perks iirc) only makes it do 17.6 damage, that is not really a buff. even if they drop the godly RPM to something closer to the 10MM SMG, it is still going to be chewing through ammo and doing cotton ball damage.
---
Oh wait, i got it. Haha hopefully not
---
Oh this one is hilarious.  So you dupped 5 million ultracite rounds?  Well guess what, now you can destroy them.  Thats funny.
---
Thank you! It is a nightmare cramming all that stuff in there but it makes for an amazing camp!
---
Person is being a Debbie downer, can’t make everyone happy.
---
Yes!!!
---
In that case they should be named Daryl.
---
I was under the impression this is what was coming as well. Hope we get there eventually 
---
Still can’t place a ‘welcome mat’ to set a spawn point in your CAMP?
---
Please add it
---
You joke but you are right, with the insane rate that laser rifles were breaking, a 2x durability increase isn't going to do much. The damage buff isn't much, and without armor pen they are still completely gimped.
---
I don't want to derail the topic of the latest patch, but since I'm attacked about once per day at Whitespring, I thought I'd ask.
---
When Whitespring is hot post-nuke, I notice melee builds in PA kiting hordes of glowing ghouls as they run around backwards.  Since my toon is in a hazmat suit and squishy, I perch on a wall and use direct fire weapons and MIRV grenades to tag and cripple the mobs to slow them down.  Since I have pacifist turned on, I'm doing direct damage to the mobs, but not the players.  Would this be considered reportable?  I'm doing my best to give everyone a chance to tag the mobs for XP, but if I go toe-to-toe with a dozens glowing ghouls, I lose all my junk, some of which took a long time to farm.
---
Also, just a request / suggestion, any chance a hazmat suit might be allowed to work with non-powered armour, i.e., allow the benefits of the armour while providing the rad protection and Fleet Street fashion sense of the hazmat suit?  We're naked underneath that tissue-thin protective layer.
---
Agreed!!!
---
Again showing your knowledge of things, which seems to be lacking in gaming, and health. The 405 is 2.3x my body weight and I do it for sets of 5.
---
And we’ve already pointed out that there is a lot of skill involved according to the giant discrepancy in knowledge between you and me regarding the game, good job.
---
Btw, your post is still stupid and a bad idea.
---
Time to conquer the wasteland with eleventy billion discordant radios!
---
Amazing!
---
Think of content as reasons to continue to log in and play the game rather than the literal definition of content.
---
I am honestly sad to see this go.  Stackable foundations were great.
---
Thank You Bethesda
---
Pro tip? I think you mean common sense. And along with that, don't play a game if you dont like it enough to actually play yourself. 
---
I'm not sure actually, since it doesn't seem to be affected by the Herbivore mutation either. 
---
Damn thats messed up
---
Sounds good! As a berserker I don't wear armor so I can't use eye of RA so I don't need my BoB or any of the other parts to be honest so you can have any or all of them if you need them.
---
I was being serious in my time estimate I've used the laser gatling gun, thing might as well be made of paper and dreams
---
Good job with this patch. Really impressive how many things got fixed.
---
Am I blind or is there no legendary trade vendor? I've been holding out got weeks now with a stash full of 3 stars so much so that I'm now always near over3ncumbered keeping extra 3 stars on me, waiting for this dam vendor!!!!
---
Easy solution- character name in game, Character(gamertag) in social menu where you would block or friend them.
---
How about nerf 75% down those Sentinental Assasins armors encoutered 2 of em with full set yesterday killing me like hell.
---
To spawn the toads you have to run into the lighthouse (all the way to where the souvenirs are in the box) and then fully into the house (over by the kitchen)
---
I still have my fast travel mat from beta, but after last camp move it won't let me place it :(
---
Or have it auto-vendor something they have equipped. Like that legendary they were shooting you with.
---
u/Valseek, any word on events and daily events showing as completed?
---
It's normal for BGS games, since in order to make changes you have to basically redownload any file that's been changed.
---
YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Yeah, I always run at first sight of these high level players.
---
The context is a name. Thus what qualifies as an appropriate name and an inappropriate name is defined by whatever Bethesda deems as acceptable names.
---
Can we get a little clarification on this?  Is this in reference to automatic weapons firing critical hits while the trigger is held down?  Or is this another situation unrelated to automatic weapons in VATS?
---
Exploits: Addressed an exploit that could allow players to repeatedly fire critical attacks without consuming critical charge
---
Can't wait to leave one OFF for aesthetic reasons. 
---
I am more curious about what the consequences will be for legitimately reported players.
---
Congrats on emperor, my dude. No small feat
---
I always go clubhouse, villas, garage, hotel. 
---
Is there a specific reason to do it your way?
---
Sorry bro. What arguments of yours would you want we to counter? Your insults or what?
---
I'm confused, why would anyone need a legitimate mule? It sounds like they just need to work on their inventory management skills.
---
I just got back into this game and had that happen and I was so confused. 
---
He one shot you but not out of pvp. You or your friend probably owned a workshop.
---
I bet most of the reports on "Harassment" is going to be false reports- "You attacked me, here take report for harassment".
---
WE LOVE YOU!!  Now c'mere and let me give you a big smooch!
---
Nice one! Hope you find a good spot.
---
Made my own comment in this thread about it but upvoting this for visibility. As it stands Flamers aren't worth using when ammo is so scarce. I want to go around healing folks and scorching the earth, but even with max Ammosmith and Super Duper, it doesn't seem feasible. Bethesda pls!
---
Should I just throw away my anti-armor laser? Still not fixed!
---
Wait is this why I can only make normal BoS Combat Armor? I have a really nice legendary combat leg that I tried to mod to BoS but it isn't an option. I know I learned how to make it all but that option wouldn't populate anymore.
---
Moved out of the sticks and was glad to finally be done with rural internet. Now I'm cheap and use a 4g hotspot from my phone to play. It's nearly as bad. Usually right around 8mb down and ~1mg up. Internet is internet though lol. Better than nothing. Waiting on this update is definitely annoying though. 
---
Thanks for the energy weapon updates, but in testing there are still some critical issues that are causing problems here, /u/Valseek. I am especially pleased that we can finally get 2 and 3-star Plasma Guns.
---
* The Anti Armor legendary modifier only reduces DR, not ER, thus causing Anti Armor energy weapons to be useless. This also appears to be true of most armor penetration effects from perks as well, significantly reducing damage of energy weapons.
---
* The level 50 Ultracite Laser rifle does less damage than a normal level 45 Laser Rifle, which makes no sense.
---
* The Gauss Rifle frequently misses with 95% VATS accuracy because the projectile travel time is slower than enemy movement. This is frequently observed against Scorchbeasts.
---
* Gamma Guns cannot have most legendary modifiers for some reason (they always have Limb Damage, for instance).
---
* The Explosive modifier causes many energy weapons, like the Flamer, Cryolater, and Tesla Rifle, to lose functionality (no arcing on Tesla, for instance) and behave strangely (longer range, more likely to miss, etc). I realize these no longer drop now, but you said the existing ones would be updated and that hasn't happened yet.
---
* Gatling Plasmas and Gatling Lasers display the number of Fusion Cores in the inventory as their ammo instead of the ammo of the most recently reloaded Fusion Core. This also periodically causes Fusion Cores to just vanish from player inventories.
---
* The crafting amount for Fuel appears erroneously low for the materials cost compared to other crafted ammo types (did someone forget a 0 in there?).
---
While we're at it, here are a few other random related issues:
---
* Wood Armor can only spawn with 1-star right now and should be able to spawn with 2 and 3-stars.
---
* Black Powder Rifles/Pistols and Dragons cannot spawn with the Quad legendary modifier. This might be intentional, but it would be good to check with a dev since we _can_ get Quad for Double Barrel Shotguns.
---
* We still can't get Dense/BoS mod plans from vendors ever since Patch 5, and this was confirmed as a bug recently by other BGS devs.
---
I don’t have emperor, but I can link it in chat so people think I do. 😉
---
I hope they fixed the hot wheel so I can add my collection of shotguns to it. Right now only one per type or they will disappear. 
---
Slow firing ballistic heavy guns: broadsider, harpoon gun, gatling gun
---
Slow firing explosive: missile launcher, fat man, grenade launcher
---
That's my last response to you as I don't have anything else to say other than you're wrong.
---
Its not a complain, i really liked this update and i need to be crazy to dislike new content. I just said i was a little sad because i was expecting for today, i didn't saw the date in the Roadmap (My mistake), but otherwise i am glad we received Wild Apalachia
---
We had Billings Homestead, and was NOWHERE near it. So yes, we’re outside of PvP since you know.... you can’t BUILD your camp inside a workshop...
---
Realistically its only going to force those players to make 5 more mule accounts. It does however give players like myself a more even playing field coming into trading.
---
High risk/ High reward
---
This sounds more like an issue with PVP assuming you were in passive mode, hadn't previously engaged in combat with someone on that player's team, or claimed any workshops. Bloodied comes with a MASSIVE drawback so you should be able to one or two-shot them back.
---
(please don't nerf my build, I don't want to totally respect again ;_;)
---
It's always workshops.  People seem to leave that detail out.
---
Hey, some of my whiskey spawns there! You keep yer filthy hands off my whiskey! I need it  fer my, um,,,medicine.
---
Plastic is not too hard for a shotgunner. I bulk and sell scrap to vendors and still keep several hundred shotgun shells on me at all times. Sometimes I sell stacks of bulk plastic because it builds up.
---
Tons of items provide plastic. flag it, and grab them all everywhere you go.
---
Watch, in 10 years time people asking for vanilla fo76
---
brute force the possibilities with some luck it can be done without keywords.
---
The question is WHY were they removed???  I was sad to see mine go missing after Beta.
---
I am hoping armor penetration perks/modifiers will now properly work with energy weapons and they just forgot to list the change here. And I sound like a broken record but those damage/durability changes are very underwhelming for laser rifles.
---
If it's not one thing it's another, that's a glass cannon build, put on a set of sentinel assassin's or go vanguard or pop on a PA. That build sacrifices every bit of defence for damage and is weak against stealth assassin builds. Also remember the higher you repair your armor the higher your resistance. 
---
It is mostly traders with shops. Many have mules to keep inventory. I think most are under the weight limit now with the past changes, but apparently some never did that 
---
It's a workshop issue
---
Maybe I should not be dropping shotgun ammo so much if it is worth caps to players.
---
Do you mean the one where the wheel pops up for no reason? Or something else?
---
I believe it's coming in April.
---
They can claim the workshop, immediately leave and fast travel to you. The contested workshop notification will only show up for a second so if you miss it you won't know it's coming. This is an issue with workshops/pvp, not bloodied or slap damage.
---
Massive drawback? What, that you can stack protections and with serendipity avoid damage altogether, how is that a drawback? You’re god doing over 8k damage taking nothing but bits of damage.
---
Oh most likely they're sharpening the "Ban-Hammer" right now getting ready for this one...
---
And I still won't have any friends to play with lol
---
Fuck mule accounts
---
I found a clean space helmet there last night. It offers the typical gas mask protection.
---
Who the hell walks around with 1500 lbs of stuff lmao
---
About 3 minutes on my connection.  Of course Bethesda's connections are the limiting factor, not my connection.
---
Lots and lots of keycards. Lol. 
---
Battlefield has 60 per server. You can server hop whenever you feel like it and play with friends. Same goes for Battlefront. Titanfall, halo, cod all have servers of 16-30 players. None of them are considered MMOs and neither is Fallout. 
---
They're online multiplayer games. A massively multiplayer online game requires a massive multiplayer server, not thousands of small multiplayer servers. 
---
Will the change of energy weapons also apply to the Gauss rifle? Energy weapon with ballistic damage.....
---
How do people still not know that owning a workshop at any point leaves them open to pvp? You didnt get killed through slap damage.
---
So in other words, it’s an exploit?
---
yep. the current state of pvp is a team will look at workshops. then find the owner on map. one person will fast travel to you. then the other person will contest the workshop. you are then open for pvp anywhere on the map.
---
Well delete their current excess and then create 5 more mule accounts. I think the change is good overall, just for the few people that played legit and never reduced their weight it will suck 
---
Visited it on Monday. Pretty fun to watch. The rain and hailstorm that came, was less fun... 😂
---
I'm updating now so maybe check again. Could be gradually rolling out.
---
Negative caps balance and a "you suck" loot pool for events/quests. Ah you just finished the quest for the All-Rise, unfortunately you suck so your All-Rise was immediately sold to a vendor and 118 caps have been removed from your debt. You have 20 hours to purchase the All-Rise from the vendor meaning you better clear that debt. 
---
Oh interesting, I hadn't heard of that before. I'm curious to see how the incoming vending changes affect that as well.
---
prob because i have never been to the clubhouse without anyone there, so maybe ill go to shops first and let things reset so i get a good run? 
---
That’s broke as fuck.
---
45 minutes? How much are you carrying?!
---
On a serious note though; I'm sure they told us this was coming and we've had warning we won't be able to trade stuff when so badly over the weight limit. It's a shame for anybody with a mule over that limit but, if I'm honest, there's surely no need for more than 1500lbs of backup stash (basically what a mule is)? + the 800 stash on that mule = 2300lbs. That's just the mule and not even our main.
---
Ultimately I'll take this if it stops people complaining about servers. I've been lucky and almost never get DC but I know a lot of other people do regularly (reading through this sub).
---
Low health is a massive drawback. You're assuming they were doing 8k damage. I'm assuming they were not doing 8k damage because you were already in combat due to the workshop. 
---
I one shot wanted players and workshop owners all the time. If you don’t like it, don’t get wanted or claim a workshop.....duh.
---
So harvesting and selling raw flux was a game breaking mechanic?  Collecting stuff to sell at vendors was already tedious with the micro inventory limitations.  Yuck, little joy in this patch again.
---
The vendor remains .... a legend 
---
&gt;*While above the absolute weight limit, items can no longer be dropped, traded, or consumed. They can only be kept or destroyed*

As long as you dont tear down your camp, it should be fine.....
---
Remember when the duplication glitch allowed massive camps, people werent affected until they tore down.
---
except i wonder if we have to tear down in order for the game to correctly register the new camp budgets. 
---
Some nice buffs and fixes for my characters there. Look forward to seeing what horrible fluids I can turn in to booze.
---
Background updates turned on?
---
You initiated pvp once that was captured.  Don't capture workshops if you're not ready to fight.  I'm not saying the system is perfect, but you need to accept that before you engage with them.
---
You're obviously quite incapable of reading - the broadsider and harpoon gun are NOT slow firing **automatic** heavy weapons!
---
Good stuff, nice works
---
The following still needs focus asap though (Its baffeling how this is still not fixxed / implemented):
---
Add missing items to the legendary pool, for instance ultracite gattling laser, scout armor, etc...
---
Armor penetration for energy weapons
---
Out of curiosity, have codes repeated themselves?
---
Correct, it goes live the 19th but was added in the patch today. 
---
semi-auto. I assume rifleman and not commando?
---
eh my camp remains in ruins, while a radio is neat anything which further gives away my camp location is worrysome
---
:-D 
---
Rated M for Mature
---
Wait until you’re at least level 45 before performing most of the main and side quests if you want special weapons to use later. 
---
Exploit or feature, only Bethesda knows!
---
It was OUR workshop that wasn’t contested since we WASN’T next to the workshop. Don’t jump to conclusions.
---
Only remark =&gt; one week for the new event? at least two weeks would be better to give everyone the time to complete the event...
---
Especially if every reward may give several different masks and workshops items :/
---
That's coming in May! [Here is the dates](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/3WheBXLAEMvTMFH70ejA9x/c38119dfaf0c67a3434df05b7d76d2c6/Fallout76_RoadMap_1920x1080_WildAppalachia-05-EN.png).
---
Where the f is player vending?
---
It...it isn’t in the patch notes.   But still I have hope. 
---
You would be over the absolute weight limit, and if your running a mule like that you need more mules have one for junk one for chems one for legendarys and you should be set nothing else is worth hoarding.
---
This is the solution I’d like to see. I think the whole point of passive and active perks taking the same slots is to force you to choose. Except since you can easily swap cars around people do that. And then complain about the inconvenience cause they don’t even realize you are supposed to sacrifice one or the other since it’s so easy to just swap when you need. 
---
The exploiters and cheaters?  Gosh I hope so.  They made their choice, keep them out of the game forever.
---
It's there:
---
* Weapons: The Salvaged Assaultron Head no longer consumes all Fusion Cell ammo when fired for the first time.
---
I created a mule and I felt like a cheater almost immediately.  Now I just use it to view my camp from multiple angles when building lol. I feel this is okay 
---
Whats with automatic non-heavy energy weapons as in an automatic laser rifle ? Does it still break in 5 magazines ?
---
Can't wait to see what you create!
---
Thank you so much for getting this issue to the debs. I have 18 mutations so I am very squishy. Adrenal reaction was a big player in giving me enough damage before I was mowed down.
---
 Great day for energy weapons, but while i love these:
---
* **Energy Weapons:** The amount of condition damage heavy energy weapons take per shot has been greatly reduced, and they should now last 4 to 5 times longer before needing repairs.
---
* **Energy Weapons:** The amount of condition damage semi-auto energy weapons take per shot has been reduced by half, and they should last twice as long before needing repairs.
---
* **Energy Weapons:** Base damage for semi-auto energy weapons has been increased by 10%.
---
I dont see noted the automatic energy weapons, maybe im not reading it right, but im worried about automatic energy weapons (specially tesla rifle) that consumes ammo like crazy. its been adressed as parte of the general balance?
---
When i attempted to use the glitch, i couldn't get my CAMP to respawn. Is stacked foundations limited to the play session or have others been able to successfully respawn their CAMPs after logging in?
---
I think the phrase is bated breath. Baited breath is possible though, I suppose. Anyway, yes these patch notes are pretty awesome. Cheers!!
---
They get them from someone who takes them from the dev room. There was a post about a week ago on the topic. 
---
Right on. I was just wondering if it would help efficiency. I actually check to see if anyone is around before I do a run. 
---
Plus it probably helps that my camp is a bit south of there at the Snake. The clubhouse is the first building I get to running in a direct line. 
---
Thanks. Maybe us up here in the frozen lands of Ontario have to wait for the update to be delivered via polar bear lol
---
yes, it is. 
---
Lose in pvp and losers will report. It's pathetic and not needed unless it's made clear reporting for unfair or unjust reasons will not be tolerated. 
---
Only while AT the Workshop and during it being contested.
---
1 We was NOWHERE at the workshop for it to be contested.
---
2 The workshop was OURS and again, nowhere near it. Where did WE initiate PvP?
---
Read the post.
---
And I don’t have the Seducer’s Assless Chaps, but that doesn’t stop me from trying to sell them. 
---
Or the Morning Wood Staff.
---
I still constantly get accused of being a cheater after beating people in PVP. You should see my Xbox messages, there are some pretty intense threats in there lol Crazy how many people don’t invest into understanding all the different builds that you may encounter.
---
Lol I don’t actually feel this strongly about them. I just associate people that play games with mule accounts on the same level as the kids you’d play basketball in PE with that would yell “FOUL!!” on every shot they miss.
---
I assume if you don’t move your base, you still have a bunker 
---
True I guess no matter what they're only keeping legit carry weight worth of goods. Think I just felt a million pieces of ballistic fiber scream out in agony, and suddenly be silenced 
---
In WoW I used to organize groups of 120-160 people on a weekly basis to raid the 4 major cities and unlock the war bear mount. Each week over half the members would be new and different people who wanted to unlock the mount, while the regulars would always come along for fun. That's massively multiplayer. 
---
When is 3/4 of the player base going to get unbanned?
---
i did this the other day.  made alt char and i got some of the missed locations but some of them still didn't count.    hoping this is fixed with this patch and it's retroactive.   i really don't want to make a third character just to do this.     I need them atoms!
---
Thats not really a fair statement.
---
PvP players like myself are in the same boat as you. We dont want to be in your server either. 
---
From my point of view Anakin, the PvE players are toxic! They are the ones angry and upset!
---
Honestly sometimes i just need to rack up a 500 cap bounty to get the bounty hunters after me. Its the way the game was designed...
---
Its not really fair to call us toxic. You are opting out of the PvP experience. We are using the tools we have to engage with other players and we have no idea who is "chill" about pvp and who is going to have a melt down. 
---
Its more of an unfortunate design than intentional toxicity. Blame Todd!
---
Use a mic and ask me for help repairing if you need it. Ive got plenty of junk and caps to spare. All PvPers do. The truth is that its extremely profitable.  Im only wrecking your camp to get the other high level players attention!
---
Survival mode cant come any sooner imo. I never intended to cause any "Greif" and i hate being painted as such. 
---
Not fair man. Not fair.
---
The workshop was yours... that initiates pvp regardless... he can come and kill you during the claim.. he can very easily leave a teammate to claim it and fast travel to you. Dont claim a workshop then complain you got killed.
---
Getting frustrated with the silence on the Heart of the Enemy and Queen of the Hunt quests.  I've sent tickets, I've posted and not one actual response.  I asked yesterday on a Bethesda response to the question about Adrenal Reaction yesterday....
---
I don’t know the answer to this. It took me long enough to get everything lined up once; I wasn’t going to try again. 
---
The absolute weight limit is 1500 if I recall. Hard to get there unless you're holding way more than you should.
---
I put in the codes without a keyword and got 206 possible codes.
---
I really hope nothing happens to my base, it's not a fortress considering only 3 sides have walls but it uses stacked foundations  https://imgur.com/a/RKbK5Gk

---
This is a very welcome surprise, first thing I'll be doing when I log in tonight.
---
Actually you can enter any nuke codes you have in and considering its the same code across 3 platforms and say only 1000 peeps care to help find the codes its quick
---
I wasnt banned BUT if you think all that got banned were guilty then you probably think everyone in jail right now is guilty as well
---
The Commie Whacker Gang is looking for like minded people on different platforms. We believe communism is a joke.  We fight communism with socialism, helping people we come across as a lot of us in the gang have more than most we require no payment for services such as building/escorting/modding. 
---
Cry more. Flux were stupidly over valued for how easy it was to gather. Before I started caring about my carry weight I'd just load up on it every chance and never have to sell anything else. 
---
Sounds familiar...
---
The one thing I got out of my post on that subject was that it stayed at 0 upvotes, with most comments being in the negative about my opinion. It's almost as if the people that voted "up" were silent and feeling a little bad about agreeing, while those that disagreed were not happy about my perceived "elitism"
---
*Texas Red had not cleared leather fore a bullet fairly ripped*  
---
*And the Ranger's aim was deadly with the big VATS on his hip*
---
The PvP bankruptcy damage debuff should be -100% and kick in as soon as bounty+level exceeds caps carried. The debuff should last until caps on hand are sufficient to cover a death.
---
Want to PvP? Carry caps. Out of caps? Get more caps. If you can't afford to pay, you don't get to play. No more handing caps to a friend to fight risk-free.
---
Per the roadmap, that's coming in late May.
---
Exploit, considering only the workshop and the worlshops area is generally considered the Contested area, and that should be where you can PvP, not this “contest an kill across the map” bullshit.
---
Hey that's twice as many opportunities for Luck of the Draw to proc, so that's significant. The lack of changes to anti-armor does suck, but it will probably come soon.
---
Read other comments.  The system is a bit broken.  All I'm saying is be aware that you paint a target on your back when you take them.  Don't blame something else.  The workshop is broken currently.
---
I had to download 70 GB for the new season of Rainbow Six, so 20 GB is not a big deal anymore.

that is scheduled for later. exact dates for some upcoming content, including the legendary vendor, can be found on [Bethesda's roadmap for 76.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps

Better be good cause I'm balls deep in ESO with no sign of stopping. I do miss my character Cletus but I felt pretty at the end of things to do so I want to be persuaded back.

Player Vending is coming April 9th. [Here is a link to the dates!](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/3WheBXLAEMvTMFH70ejA9x/c38119dfaf0c67a3434df05b7d76d2c6/Fallout76_RoadMap_1920x1080_WildAppalachia-05-EN.png)
---
I am so excited to have some new classical music in my camp.  The jukebox was getting a little repetitive lol
---
Maybe this will be the path to allow banned players back in?  Before they can play they have to go through and delete all the dupped items.  It would be like a Parent disciplining their disobedient kid; "Now Johnny, before you can go play, you have to clean up the huge mess you made..."
---
son of a..........i missed that from last week.
---
thats a crying shame if thats what their doing. I was hotly anticipating a single letter to come up so I could figure it out. Either way I still enjoy the 24 mini quests that we get to get the codes for each silo
---
Just use the wall pass through under the connectors like a normal person.
---
My first floor is stacked foundation with warehouse for the second floor. The whole thing might be destroyed. 
---
I actually know this pain, not because players themselves are trashing my camp, but because clueless idiots kite scorchbeasts toward my camp and then run off when the flying cancer factory's attention shifts from them to my camp.  It happens once a day, without fail. Once, it happened when a player who previously bought some screws from me came to me (with no prior warning!) to buy more screws, and he brought with him not one
---
not two

but *three* shrieking garbage bitches.  My whole team had to fight those stupid things, and what was our reward?  A pet my friend had to unteam and unfriend me to mercy kill for me (it got scorched when one of the fuckheaded scorchbeasts pissed on it), a lot of wasted ammo/resources, and literal trash for drops.
---
Trust me.  I'm at my wit's end for camp defense too.
---
Yep. My Two Shot Laser going from 100% to &lt;20% in 8 clips is better than doing it in 4, but still makes the weapon completely impractical.
---
"New people will come" ROFL, no they fucking won't.
---
Yeah we didn’t know since it’s not listed as a bug anywhere, well i’ve not seen it once myself, lessons learned.
---
I guess you saying offensive things at players like racist words
---
Legendary vendors will be in the update on May 23rd.  
---
it starts the 19th and lasts a week. this Patch includes everything we need for the event, meaning we likely wont have a patch next week. they were just commenting that the content is present in the code.
---
Same here.  Cant wait to try it out.
---
Yeah, give it time, I wouldn't be surprised if next patch we get another buff to durability and maybe a basic look at AA
---
That's not a bad thing. It also would remove the effective punishment of not having the atoms or not even playing yet at the time each limited item was released. There's no reason to withhold those items unless one is an elitist; the desire for stuff is an intrinsic motivator for many of us to spend atoms.
---
I used an adrenal reaction serum. I cannot see the positive or the negative effects, and the effect on my weapons damage is intermittent, sometimes it's there, sometimes it isn't.
---
&gt;What do they plan to do with the legacy explosive energy weapons?
---
Remove the effect. 
---
No fix for the 'Kill 10 golf ghouls" yet? I guess that one's a "feature". 
---
Yea there are some trade discords out there I would check out, some pretty good trading communities for this game 
---
Road map stated that this was to come May 23.
---
Im concerned about people who rage qnd spam report for cheating too. Everytime i beat someone in pvp, about 80% of the time i get called a cheat or hacker. Im on ps4. 
---
Ok, so for the people confused.
---
1. We already HAD the workshop for HOURS.
---
2. We was NOWHERE near the workshop so how did WE initiate/engage PvP?
---
3. We didnmt claim it from a player, it was unclaimed and we claimed it and WALKED AWAY.
---
So wait you own two consoles and two tvs to view yourself building from two angles lol
---
This made me laugh hard 
---
Sad about " **Foundations:** Addressed an issue that could allow players to stack Foundations under certain circumstances. " if this also means placing a pressure plate to make my keypad door open from the inside on my second floor or higher is no longer possible. I just hope Bethesda is considering the various reasons why people try to get around the CAMP restrictions on objects and try to improve things while they disable other things.
---
It's about as cool as floating bases IMO. The giant blocking doesn't look very realistic. 
---
and AP
---
People report others for even lesser things than that in online games. The real question is whether whomever reviews that sort of report at Bethesda even cares about a homemade sign that contains mild off color humor. If it really worries you, you may want to take it down just to be safe. My gut tells me it’s probably not a huge deal though. I mean, when it comes to actual game content/decor they’ve got teddy bears stacked in compromising positions and giddy up buttercups stuffed in porta potty toilet holes and piles of dead bodies laying around. Your sign ain’t that bad. 
---
Patch notes right here even state it is to start March 19.
---
When it worked, yeah.  I could never get it to actually work to keep mobs away from my shit (but maybe it was never intended to, just intended to balk griefers?)
---
Mules are a time honored tradition in games. Some people would rather just dump the crap they don't know what to do with onto a mule rather than spending however long it takes to do inventory management, **especially** people who have a limited amount of time to play. 
---
Also, not everyone *can* get good at inventory management, especially in a series like Fallout where the previous titles didn't just allow hoarding, they encouraged and rewarded it.
---
Most threads mentioning griefing issues are all linked back to workshop capturing.  It's a big exploit.  I personally don't mess with them.  
---
My best advice is to build your camp on a resource generator, like a junk extractor.  I have zero need for most junk nowadays.  Gathering mats from certain spots is a ton better than workshops with greater reduced risk.
---
Absolute Limit should currently be 1,500 lbs plus your character's current carry weight. I know that's a small detail but the limit can be slightly different for everyone.
---
What are the current viable builds? I'd like to jump back into FO76 for the patch but have no idea what I'm doing.
---
I am actually really happy with this change there are going to he alot of mad dupers
---
For the 10th time, you dont HAVE to be at the workshop. Just stop complaining and blaming exploits and get good at the game if you want to claim workshops and not get killed
---
I am seeing more and more of this. Higher level players “forcing themselves” in a way, on lower level players, whether it be griefing or being generous/nice. Not all low level players want free stuff, nor interaction, nor power-leveling, although many do want these things. Some want to experience the game in their own way, and want to not be followed around the map by someone who thinks they the player must “need” this great gear. Honestly some players just want to be left the f alone, and no I don’t need help killing the level 10 enemies.
---
Great patch!
---
Any word on missing BoS plans and the Strange in Numbers perk bug? 
---
Thanks a lot in advance! u/Valseek , u/Ladydevann
---
It is crazy, I only use my laser rifle periodically and on low level enemies, 90% of the time I am firing my combat rifle. Yet my laser rifle still breaks multiple times faster even though I barely use it....
---
This is the kind of support I want. They game has come a looooong way, cant wait to get home and play.
---
I didn't know that but now I miss them even more.
---
read the road map
---
It tells you when you claim it. Claimin a workshop is basically the equivalent of "hey mr pvp guy, come kill me". Trust me. I learned this same lesson the hard way. Since I hate pvp in fallout I have just accepted the fact I can't own workshops. 
---
you might be right, but wouldn't it make sense to actually test it out before complaining?
---
With the ark extension for sitting I can have a nice spot to stay awhile and listen to tunes so I can eat irl... XD
---
If you're curious, I participated in two SBQ events the other day, did not get any caps, did not get any loot. SBQ corpse didn't disappear, I just didn't get squat.
---
yep. the nukacrypt guy used to stream them brute forcing all the possibilities on twitch. havent watched in a while though so not sure if he still does it. if you get lucky might be on the 1st one you try or the 206th.
---
One really big change with this patch people may not realize is the ability to mute in game radios. They play some copyrighted music so it's been a pretty big issue around this game for content creators. I've just been removing the audio altogether most of the time
---
Lol really? Get killed because of an exploit... and then not talk about said exploit, and “get good”? 
---
Haha yeah good one Mr. Intelligent
---
Can I build a camp out of radios?
---
I got 4.....lol
---
probably not enough
---
It's a tough design problem as I see it.  I've played many games where it was either too easy to change builds, making swapping on the fly "mandatory" (ie., lockpicking perk cards), or, too hard to switch, making experimenting or just trying things out to see if you like it, too punishing, especially for those who had limited play time/couldn't make 100's of alts. I like the perk card system bc the special stats dictate the build through available card slots, but the ability to swap cards allows for experimenting or trying things out. They just need to put in some way to make choosing cards more meaningful. Swapping in camp addresses lockpicking, but you'd still swap to craft/repair/etc. Not that bad, but choosing "camp" perks will still be mandatory. It's how I do all my builds now, having enough min. card slots for swapping.
---
It's weird, everytime I take a workshop someone that is clearly a HACKER and a DUPER kills with me their OP 10k damage bloodied paddle ball! PLEASE nerf paddle balls!
---
I think responses will vary accorded to platform, consoles aren't as lenient to repeat offenders.
---
It is very risky, yeah. You might have been very unlucky if somebody took the stuff or if the friend (used as an anchor here) might have server hopped and you might actually be in another server.
---
I use a friend to hold things for alts but did this a load before and didn't once lose the items. I had a close call twice though when the friend server hopped (I hadn't actually told them what I was doing these two times) and I had to add people front he other server until one of them accepted!
---
You have guessed wrong, as i have my mic muted in game as i use Discord
---
Dude I never mess with workshops, other players based, and I'm in pacifist 24/7. I've had one experience with two assholes while minding my own business. They both punch me repeatedly and if it wasn't for stimpacks they would have killed me. Dont tell me I can't die from slap damage.
---
Yeah, FOR THE AREA OF THE WORKSHOP. NOT THE ENTIRE FUCKING MAP.......
---
Judging by your username you are a man of impeccable taste and intellect so I'll let your sassy bs pass this time. /s
---
But seriously dude you didn't have to reply if it was SUCH a bother. 
---
Any word on if they will only allow new characters on survival servers? Not going to come back unless they do.
---
This needs more upvotes.
---
The one shot factor is why I won't engage in workshops or pvp. Takes literally zero skill to vats and one shot me. 
---
Why do you think people with mule accounts were literally crashing and ruining the game
---
DANGIT  
---
 **Exploits:** Addressed an exploit that could allow players to repeatedly fire critical attacks without consuming critical charge.   
---
there goes my rifle build fun.
---
It’s going to take me a whole week to download but hopefully it’s some good changes. 
---
This is a good point and we'll have to wait and see how much rate of fire has been decreased in proportion to the damage increase. 
---
While we're at it could we also get some new stairs and roofs as well.  Maybe something that could snap onto the bottom of floors to act as new ceilings too.
---
to my knowledge they have not repeated yet.
---
Remember that the term and genre came about when 32-64 player multiplayer games were not uncommon.  In contrast MMOs generally have thousands of players with potentially hundreds in a given area.
---
EVE has had battles in the thousands, WoW had open PvP with 60+ fighting (and I'm talking initial release before battlegrounds), EQ had 200 person raids to kill a dragon 20 years ago.  Battlefield and Tribes had over 100 and they weren't even MMOs.
---
24 is tiny.  That's almost as small as Black Squad.
---
Now THAT is a list!
---
The fact that you claimed a workshop at all initiates pvp... what dont you understand
---
Realistically this won’t happen. It’d be unfair to the players who found and purchased explosive weapons. I imagine the effect will eventually be replaced with an equivalent effect for energy weapons.
---
&gt; **Foundations:** Addressed an issue that could allow players to stack Foundations under certain circumstances. 
---
I wonder if this will have additional downstream effects on other build tricks used. I guess it depends on whether the change was made to campfires or to foundations.
---
I also wonder if Bethesda went and reset every bunker base or allowed current bases to be grandfathered as long as they are not moved.
---
They should rework it to be a bit easier. The entire process is too complicated.
---
Yes! Now I can be a proper hoarder! All I need now is 50 cats. XD
---
Any word on Brotherhood of Steel Combat Armor mods/plans being added back into the game?  
---
I see that the description no longer states Rad protection, but if we can't get the plans or armor in game...
---
Are being getting unbanned yet?
---
Recently I played a whole day(like 20 hours) on my second char. I was about level 25 in morning. I took ammo plant and sent team invites to other low levels. 
---
In particular when I was level 32, I was teamed up with about level 38 melee player, and level 30 sniper. We played together for hours, it was amazing.
---
I reached about level 38 in the evening, and during that one day I joined both Brotherhood and Enclaive with the melee player, after the sniper had logged off. I don't even yet are Enclaive member with my 160 level main, and only like 2-3 weeks ago I joined BOS. Somehow the military ID quest seemed to semi-bugged because I got there little later than the melee guy, but I managed to complete it faster than he. I think one step I did in advance(in wrong order), because HE had that step open and somehow being on same quest but previous step, I managed to complete it to myself too, while still doing another previous step. I don't know how exactly it happened. I think that player might could have been slightly confused about what quest marker and task is his and what is mine, when we were both doing the same overall quest. I'm kinda assuming anyone below level 60 or so is alt, but perhaps not everyone is, particularly how the game has become so cheap it's easy to come try it even if you aren't overly intreted in Fallouts or online Fallout in particular.
---
We nearly managed to go and do the find BOS leader quest, but it was getting late, he dropped off a bit for a phonecall I think, and when he came back I was getting tired. It would have been intresting to fight the SB in the cave with such low levels, and because it's second char I don't really care if the reward items are low lever or not. On my main I was already &gt;50 when I completed the first quest you get a special item, the responder airport thing that gives you named AA .44 pistol. Sold it off for like 500 caps because back then nothing but TSE was valuable.
---
That was all so amazing. No craches, no server side disconnects. I disconnected few times as I could return to the server thanks to the other guy, because the game looses loot and death location markers when you die indoors, it doesn't like that, and I don't like hauling large amounts of junk with my alt and not have a location marker in case I die.
---
With my second char I find it relatively easy to explore most higher level areas, as long as there's no high level players around. Enemy level scaling seems pretty decent, so that you don't need high level char to go to high level areas.
---
you can 100% die from slap damage. the claim is usually they were one shot killed in pacifist mode.
---
No it really doesn’t. It activates PvP for the area of the worlshop WHILE IT IS CONTESTED. It doesn’t open PvP cross the map by design you muppet.
---
Shortly after launch (when they had a bigger volume of tickets, I'm sure) I reported two guys for duping, and the next day they were banned. Never seen them connected in F76 since (I added them to my friends list and they accepted, so I can see what they play).
---
I had 2/5 for the northen parts of the map. I made a new character and whent there. I got a few more locations discovered (4/5) but when I tried to get the last one, Grafton Dam it didn't register. I guess I'll have to start a third one...
---
No one can really tank hits with the current pvp unless you're full ass/sent/cav set. And a large portion of the playerbase doesn't care about pvp so they aren't geared for it. Most of the pvp I've watched is just a shitshow of exchanging one shot kills. 
---
You can die from slap damage yea, but it takes a while. People are claiming to have been “one shot” through slap damage
---
I WANT HER IN MY WIGWAM
---
I wonder how many players will be impacted by their change to Foundations. From the notes it sounds like they fixed the stacking bug that gave people foundation-bases
---
Grinding in this game made my peen grow two extra stalks.
---
Don't go to Charleston station and think "ooh, this looks like a good camp spot".
---
Lol yes. The TV from the other room is now beside my couch hooked up to my Xbox one... I bought an Xbox one x for the 4k which I play my normal character on. I bought just a month of live lol. The living room is a bit cluttered at the moment
---
Might sound weird but another angle on a different TV makes it easier to spot flaws in my camp designs. Especially the object placement 
---
We need to be able to lock items to prevent accidental selling, dropping, scrapping and destroying before they add that as a default feature. 
---
Thanks to your grandmas cancer for giving me the laugh I really f\*\*\*ing needed right now
---
I'm destroying every single base I hear with that gawd awful old music radiating from their house.  Old music is terrible and I vow to remove it with explosive rounds. 
---
Instigating gauss with +50% limb damage.  Headshots and leg shots do crazy damage.  Even crazier with sneak attacks.  It does about 90% health of a lvl65 SB from sneak.  I have a bloodied one too but haven't rebuilt the char to see if it's better... I'm sure on average the bloodied build is a lot more dps, I just hate walking around at 25hp
---
r/Fo76bazaar
---
The shards aren't limited to 24.  They're not even remotely close to that small.
---
I'm slowly working on leveling up new characters to try out different archetypes (heavy gunner, sneak rifles, vats pistols, etc.) and I like to store items I'll use later for those characters.  In a perfect world, there'd be a way to easily move those items between each of my characters on a single account (account-wide storage, as seen in many other MMO's) but for now mules serve that purpose well for me.
---
I'm glad that you 'leave people alone'.  However, for better or worse, people view and slap damage as griefing.....and I bet you will get reported.  
---
At any rate, the rumored pacifist mode changes (should do away with these problems altogether.   
---
I'm always puzzled at why the Gamma Gun lacks variety in its legendary effects compared to other weapons. It's an easy fix to be honest and shouldn't take much time to implement and yet it seems to have been overlooked. 
---
Prolly gonna need a few hundred more to sit there and guess till ya get it. Lol
---
Numbers don't lie. There's no need to test it out. If a weapon type has multiple ways to reduce enemy armor and another does not, then the weapon that can reduce enemy armor will obviously have a significant advantage. 
---
&gt; A new Brewing Workbench has been added that you’ll learn to build by completing the Wasted on Nukashine questline. Use it to craft a variety of new Wines, Spirits, Beers, and Mixed Drinks that will temporarily apply positive and negative effects when consumed.
---
As someone using a Drunkard build this pleases me.
---
Ouch :(
---
I did not have that issue but my bunker was only a 2×1.
---
Servers are back up?
---
You could just turn the wall around until this is addressed.  If you have issues turning it, temporarily place a foundation on both sides of the door and you should be able to face the wall either way you want and then remove the foundation.
---
What about armor penetration perks and anti-armor legendary modifiers? Will they actually reduce energy and rad resistance of targets?
---
Indeed, that would be a sweet feature. A post suggesting this feature I made didn't get much love. :)
---
Is that including the HD texture pack? 
---
PvP trolls will get reported which is fine by me - if you want to PvP just wait for survival mode to release and move to those servers.
---
Heres the problem i have qith the forfeit:
---
It makes it harder for PvP players to find eachother. It allows the PvE community to effectivly absorb Workshops and take them away from the PvP players. 
---
Suvival mode tho.... So wutever.
---
 I still like to PvP and im sure ill find myself in Adventure occasionally. I dont want bethesda to give a forfeit options. 
---
Yes i farm players for caps/junk.. Well i did, until i maxed everything out.
---
This isn't a bloodied build problem. This is a PVP balancing problem. 
---
everyone engages in pvp on some level if only during workshops after level 60
---
No, just the intro load screen/main menu has changed. I wish!
---
DayZ, TF2, Tribes, Battlefield, Battlefront... all MMOs.
---
If R6 siege could just open a 12v12 it would be too.
---
So what's the excuse going to be when this doesnt fix stability?
---
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!  SUCK IT CHEATERS!
---
healing factor didn't work if you were in caution. There was another bug where you could get stuck in caution. That bug was fixed and I think is related to the bug you're talking about
---
Yeah, pretty sure "high rate of fire" only applies to Minigun, LMG and Gatling Laser.
---
I wondered about that - Whitespring got nuked last night while I was in the Enclave bunker and there were no letters showing for any of the silos.
---
Did you read the patch notes? They fixed a ton of crap let them chill. Gezz. 
---
I use it to protect my resource extractor from the super mutants with the miniguns.  I got tired of constantly repairing the walls.  Because my node is on a hill, there's no way to raise the foundation high enough to protect the node all the way around.  I basically created a 1 story bunker just for the node.  it's 2/3 story uphill and 1-1/3 story downhill.  Then I added a door on the side that the enemies don't attack from, and a roof.  Everything else is up in the air many floors up.
---
WHERE IS MANKRIK'S WIFE?!
---
I'm not going to lie, I showed up from /r/all looking to see how crazy the drama in this thread was going to be lol
---
Soooooo many missed shots with this glitch. Gun fu helped solve the issue some but even this morning I ran into this glitch.
---
Yeah, if they own a workshop and you kill them they call you an exploiter (a cheater if they know nothing about builds or armors) and if you keep killing them you always hear "This is a toxic behavior and you're bullying me, I'm reporting you, enjoy your ban".  
---
I don't know how many times players actually reported me, but now?
---
How can Bethesda support know if I really harassed or threatened them?  
---
I once was one shotted by a duper and was killed via slap damage. This was before the bobblehead and TSE changes. It's no longer possible as I have tried with friends to see what was possible. 
---
Yeah slap damage isn’t broken. That said, there may be some way that a player is able to do it because of a bizarre, player specific bug like the guy who unwillingly has god mode bestowed upon him. This game is sort of the Wild West when it comes to that shit.
---
Possibly the LMG too, even though I don't think lowering it's fire rate but increasing its miniscule base damage would solve its problems. Kinda ruins the fun of using an MG42 as well.
---
The patch note referring to the nerf to fire rates is very vague, they could have done better with that one. It doesn't actually tell us which weapons are going to have their fire rates nerfed.
---
Enjoy doing that on your PvP server soon.
---
Don't forget making the turrets more useful by fixing the failure to target bug.
---
Road map specified this was coming May 23.
---
Absolutely love it!
---
Or when finding a turret base behind the golf place... 
---
Group of us had this issue last night. First time I've encountered this problem 
---
A little change is always nice. 
---
Love it giving me some ideas
---
I know, it was legit midnight when I wrote this and I was just not bothered.
---
thx for feedback btw
---
Maybe 1/10000 times there will be some bug, but I see this claim every day atleast 8-10 times. Then the people always leave out that they captured a workshop before it occured
---
Although I like that look on it -- I kind of hope not.. I don't really think we want those types of toxic players back..
---
Kinda like how workshop production rates got slashed? Or how glowing ones in whitesprings had a significant drop in XP? It’s not like they haven’t done this before
---
The legendary vendor isn't until May 23rd. Its labeled on the roadmap. 
---
So many good changes/fixes... can't wait! Especially for these:
---
&gt;Budget Adjustments: Some C.A.M.P. objects, such as Turrets and Lights, now consume far less budget, but also have a maximum amount that can be placed in a C.A.M.P. or Workshop.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;C.A.M.P.: Several additional environment objects, such as grasses, ferns, and swamp fungus, will now disappear when the player builds C.A.M.P. objects on top of them.  
---
That's understandable.  
---
I solo pretty much all the time since all my friends rage-quit the game, some of them calling me up to lambast me for recommending it, I use a build that allows me to scale my attacks while I say, "Oh shit!" repeatedly while I scramble to get out of a corner in the golf clubhouse as the glowing groovy ghoulies all spontaneously respawn around me.
---
I look forward to when the PVPers get their own servers.  It won't solve the problem, but it will help.
---
I laughed out loud.  What a stupid noise I made.  I just pictured it, a flash of imagery/sound
---
Distantly a white-ish object, and on the faint breeze a strange dioscordant sound, and as you get closer, you realise it is an entire house made of radios, and they aren't in sync, so it is just a cacophony of noise. Add a mailbox for that final lunatic touch.
---
Not my style of pvp. I would much rather play bfv, cod, apex legends, pubg etc etc. I play fallout for pve content. So I avoid all things pvp. It's just unbalanced poop imo. In pvp I wanna test my reaction time and aim against my opponents. Not my gear set, weapon, and accuracy of my vats. 
---
Yeah i did. It wasn't on there. That's all. I'm chill. Check my post. Chill, no? No swearing, all caps or exclamations. What's your deal? 
---
Mine spawns in every time, but if you move the camp it breaks it apart into layers - one layer per floor of stacked foundation.  I only stacked it because I built into a hill and super mutants constantly fire at it.
---
That reminds me.... has anyone ever seen a paddle ball weapon, I’ve never come across one, never seen someone using one 🤔
---
The crazy ammo consumption is part of the design of the Automatic Tesla although you could actually bypass this by getting a Quad version of the weapon so instead of a capacity of 15 you actually get 60. This effect when combined with +25% fire rate makes the Tesla a very powerful weapon for taking down all kinds of groups and crowds with minimal fuss. 
---
I will! I'm currently at Max budget. I don't have turrets but maybe a dozen lights. 
---
Yeah.  Not cool to downvote the question but pretty funny. Rolled a natural 1
---
As a person who has played MMO's his whole life, I can't fathom thinking that having a mule feels like cheating.
---
You own two copies of the game and are utilizing both characters in a way that is allowed. Why would it feel like you're cheating?
---
True I guess just less incentive to re-install until the content drops are done 
---
Will the adrenaline mutation be fixed in this update ? 
---
I need me some wallpaper dammit
---
I love this one. Right next to it is a tunnel complex under the road. I have my camp in those tunnels. Completely scorchbeast proof.
---
Lol is crap a swear word?
---
Yay! Now I have to break into OTHER people's camps to turn the damned radios off...
---
Question, why the difference in download size compared to pc?
---
Only if inside the mailbox there is a radio
---
Well. You and me getting one shot halfway across the map and the dozens of other people saying YOURE wrong would disagree. Just keep being dumb man. Can't fix stoopid 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Hopefully you can keep it if you never move camp, but we'll just have to see.  &gt;:
---
Found the player with extra salt to trade. 
---
And this is why it needs a nerf/change. what’s the fun in a game where everyone just one hits? Where the only way to play and enjoy it is to buy a duped remaining god build of assassins/sentinel/cavalier/bolstering/unyielding sets?
---
Power armour and standard armour is completely redundant.
---
I miss the scrapeverythng mod from 4.
---
It's a fair question and tbh that level of specificity should be expected. Otherwise, we kinda just have to assume
---
It must be the only one not playing the same station as all the others.
---
So was the campfire foundation exploit removed or was the stairs foundation stacking exploit removed? If you removed the campfire exploit I hope your other improvements will allow more reliable foundation placement in legitimate areas. Not everyone was using campfires to stack foundations to build impenetrable fortresses. Some of us were simply using that to get foundations to place over small rocks or stumps that inexplicably wouldn't bulldoze. If you insist on not allowing that exploit please at least consider allowing normal floor pieces to attach to foundation pieces so that gaps can be filled.
---
Yep this must definitely. Or slow the rate of Consumption. The plasma flamer just melts things but damn does it eat ammo. 
---
I think they crack it but someone has been giving them codes from the dev room. They were trying to get Bethesda to understand there is still an unfixed exploit 
---
While the road map looks amazing and all, I really dont see that much more content coming out. I mean yes omg new stuff! But a vendor, a questline and a crafting station does not actually come out to a bunch.
---
I feel there is a good reason they are calling it a DLC and not an expansion.
---
Look here you salty bitch.
---
If you claimed a workshop and then left, no one could ever claim it. It is necessary to be able to challenge you anywhere on the map.
---
There was no exploit, no bug, and no OP build. You engaged in PvP and got fucking wrecked.
---
Deal with it.
---
This is a fantastic patch. Thank you /u/bethesdagamestudios_
---
I know nothing of this patch and haven't played since launch week. Is this worth coming back for, or is it still a mess? 
---
These patch notes keep getting thiCCer and thiCCCer 🤤😩
---
Some rats or mole rats will climb the stairs, but its rare. Scorchbeast can cause a lot of damage, as the monorail does not stop that screech blast entirely.
---
then quit playing.
---
Love it.
---
"VATS: Firing immediately after entering VATS no longer always causes that shot to miss."
---
4 months after release.  4.
---
I got a 1* quad tesla, but the damage feels really low even investing in all the damage perks posible, not even bloodied build has a decent damage. 
---
The wording in the message about claiming workshops is definitely vague but it doesn't state you're only vulnerable in the workshop area. But now you know that claiming workshops is an opt-in for PVP so use stealth and think twice before spending ten minutes at a workbench.
---
Report for offensive name? Super Hitler senses (((trouble))).
---
or u/Ladydevann?
---
Yeah, I tried that but the mismatch between brick and a white wall kills me... I appreciate the advice though!
---
Any new Atom shop items? PA and Weapon paints?
---
Have the fix the bug that stopped BoS mods and plans from showing up in vendor inventories? 
---
Totally agree. Getting sick or people calling for un needed nerfs over this. 
---
Or better yet allow them to go negative. 
---
will the change of energy weapons also apply to the Gauss rifle? Energy rifle with ballistic damage....
---
I think they are afraid it will be used to exploit. Push it through a wall to get outside the map or the like.
---
I think Bethesda are mentioning the Minigun, Gatling Laser and LMG. These are extreme rate of fire or "high rate of fire automatic heavy weapons) with ROF over 200 which are currently struggling on enemies with high DR. 
---
What? Can’t you just turn it around and have the keypad facing out? That is literally the situation I have. A terminal connected from the inside can open the door from the inside.
---
I'm hoping the reports aren't going to be automated and people who could be falsely reported will have some recourse in appealing. I've killed plenty of wanted players and others in PvP who weren't too happy with me
---
Ya thats further down the road per Bethesda’s roadmap..
---
Lmao, ive found the red things and the string, but never the weapon I kinda want one
---
Certain MGEF effects are applied by the engine directly when triggered, e.g. the PipBoyLight effect in previous games. This may be similar. It would make sense since as far as I can tell the Bounty system is also handled by the engine directly.
---
This is a massive security risk they elected to take. I hate they did this.
---
Keeping my fingers crossed too 😬
---
17.19gb on xb1. My dogs are very happy I came home during lunch to kick off the download.
---
You really are... that’s what the entirety of the red boundary is for during a contest. You leave that area for a few seconds and the workshop isn’t contested anymore, and that stops PvP
---
Do you even play the game to not know that? Like seriously
---
Next.. on Pawn Stars
---
You took/owner a workshop. You willfully engaged in pvp. Full stop. 
---
Isn't that part of the always in caution bug? Or is three some other bug I'm not aware of?
---
I totally get that. I'm not saying it's a good system, just that I enjoy *certain aspects* of it. 
---
I haven't played since December. I'm probably hopping back in this Friday.
---
Has the bug been fixed where half of the tamed creatures at your camp (deathclaw, mega sloth, and yaogai for example) stay hostile to every player but the owner? 
---
The good? old days lol.
---
Yes in the same sense that a 60 player battle or a 6 player dungeon is an "MMO experience".  That doesn't make the game an MMO.  The whole point is MMO focuses on large scale and 24 ain't even close.
---
I don't want 76 to be an MMO either btw, it can be great as a coop game with some PvP.
---
It activates pvp, regardless of you being close to the workshop.
---
Simple as that. If you don't want your ass to be wiped, don't take a workshop.
---
And if you do, be prepared to face this exact situation.
---
Unless I’m missing something, no the keypad is on the inside (white part) of the brick wall. I’d like the keypad on the brick side, then a pressure plate inside to walk out. 
---
How did they not notice this during pre-release playtesting?  Wait, I think I figured it out.
---
Only, we wasn’t at the workshop. Go and capture one, read the patchnotes that changed workshop radius, you’ll feel stupid re-reading your own comment.
---
I miss BFF :(
---
Workshops are broken - DO NOT take a workshop right now or only do it briefly and relog.  Unfortunately there's an exploit that people can use to initiate PvP by just trying to claim a workshop and cancelling out.
---
Given the new report feature, anytime you get killed outside of the workshop zone via PvP, I suggest reporting them for exploitation until Bethesda fixes the workshop PvP system.
---
Personally I'd just remove PvP from adventure mode entirely, and leave the trash PvPers to go kill each other in survival mode.
---
Sure, it needs to be balanced. But blaming builds like bloodied when you don't understand the game mechanics will not help. Assuming things like they were bloodied/doing 8k damage and that everyone is using duped equipment is not helpful.
---
I’m a 151 haven’t had any scuffles since my 70s. Also have still never had anyone mess with my workshop (not that I’d mind). 
---
Yuuup sometimes 
---
You’re stupid and should probably pay more attention to patch notes and in game messages as is clearly stated “Workshop AREA”
---
I'm gonna build like 10 radios all over my CAMP, just for you ;) 
---
You know the servers are down for maintenance, right? It's all over the sub right now and at the top of it.
---
It was never intended to be at all. It was obvious from the way the CAMP system worked that Bethesda did not want people having CAMPs that other players could not access. That is why the system requires you to place a stair before you can place a floor and why the 2 types of foundations have an invisible stair component.
---
That makes sense! Thanks for the context.
---
They can contest, cancel out and you'll be in PvP anywhere on the map with them.  The system is broken and this is a confirmed workshop PvP exploit.  When they cancel out, you won't even get the notification that someone is contesting the workshop.
---
1 from experience, they can just walk on and shoot you, or snipe you from a distance 
---
2 in not sure if it works both ways, the owner might not be able to damage any intruders until they initiate either by capturing or attacking first. I can't test this because I'm only lvl 35 and everytime this happens I get one shot before I can even react 😁
---
3.  if someone contests your workshop they'll get a tiny bounty of 5-10 caps if I remember correctly 
---
/r/circlejerk
---
Oh my god, you guys are really turning this around. EPIC patch.
---
I enjoy helping people level up by kiting ghouls around, but I much prefer when they use molotov cocktails over grenades to tag everything without blowing corpses everywhere.  Thanks for considering it!  (Note: if MIRV grenades don't blow corpses everywhere then I'm good with those, I haven't used them.)
---
This reporting system sure seems like it has the potential to be abused.     
---
The guns I was referring to have struggled against enemies with high DR and I've used them all personally with some testing. The extremely low damage output per shot seems to be the reason why people have been complaining about the "perceived inferiority" of high ROF heavy weapons when in actual fact the amount of ammo used against the amount of health decreased on the enemy feels out of proportion. So I guess this is probably why Bethesda have decided to go for this approach - to eliminate that perception and make killing things a little but more satisfying while spending less ammo.  
---
I uhhh.. haven't even explored half of the current map lol. Level 37 life!
---
We need a more nuanced system than something that forcibly takes hard-earned loot from you. I'm not going to miss an all-rise, but if I ever lost some of my weapons and armor, regardless of the reason, I might put the game down. 
---
This is the first thing I thought of, as well, when I saw this in today's patch notes --- all the many posts showing creative C.A.M.P. builds using this technique that had Bethesda staff comments stating how cool or ingenious these builds are/were .... only to turn around and say "yeah, we're taking that away now."  :-\\
---
As this is my first time playing in awhile I’m wondering if I should make a new character in the new game mode they added awhile back? Or should I just continue with my level 30 character because honestly I want to make a new character but if it’s way to much of a hassle for nothing then I won’t 
---
Still down for me. In EU and on PC.
---
that would be the quickest update yet if it's back up!
---
Thanks!  Makes me feel better
---
Zero skill..??  you still need the right weapon, the right perks, and to remain undetected. And have a critical shot on deck. So not quite zero skill. I personally take workshops every time I log in, rarely ever “one shotted”.....
---
But it’s a fact, a god set of 3* bloodied/unyielding will literally get an unarmed weapon to 8k. Literally if stacked right, i know my numbers, i’m a sweaty guy when it comes down to stastics. 8k is 100% achievable.
---
Check your email
---
I'm happy about that. I crafted a jukebox but what I really wanted was a radio.
---
A lot of good stuff in this patch, but one I thing I really wanted to call attention to is:
---
&gt; **World Radios Setting:** A new  World Radios slider has been added to the Audio Settings menu and can be  adjusted to increase or decrease the volume of all in-world radios. The  existing Radio Volume slider has been renamed Pip-Boy Radio, and both  settings can be adjusted independently of one another. 
---
I've wanted to stream Fallout 76 for a while, but the world radios were my main hesitation because outside of a third-party mod, there wasn't a way to mute them and avoid potential copyright strikes.  I'm happy this was officially added.
---
If you haven't already, add the searchlight - that helps (if only a little)
---
Lmfao THIS GUY is smoking crack.
---
I'm not sure they are spawning inside your locked rooms, so much as there being pathing issues that allow mobs to push *through* your walls.  I've experienced this at my CAMP in a couple of different ways.
---
* Near 'Top of the World' there is a popular lake location where 3 Brahmin spawn. I would routinely find that one of the 3 spawns would path in a way that pushed it up the foundation of my structure.  All creatures can climb foundations so this pushed it against the brick wall.  Eventually it would sort of glitch through the wall and appear in the interior.  That particular wall was part of a room that was locked, so it was trapped there.
---
* I recently moved my base and almost immediately became under attack by an Assaultron, lucky me!  I ran into my CAMP and it chased after me.  The door was closed and somehow it pathed in such a way that it became stuck beneath the foundation of my base.  It kept trying to shoot me with its laser but the laser could not penetrate the foundation.  Made for a neat effect though.
---
* At this same location I came home to find my teammate had left my doors open and a couple of Scorched walked in and wrecked the place.  Whatever right? But I killed them all and could still hear a Scorched slashing at something.  Eventually I was able to target one that was, again, inside my foundation.  I had to store that foundation only to find a Scorched trying to use a lead pipe to beat up the water purifiers on the exterior.  Jumped down, killed him, and replaced the foundation.
---
The thing all of these seem to have in common are issues with how mobs path around / in foundations.  Might be something Bethesda has fixed inadvertently with the current patch (which modifies foundations to fix a stacking bug) but we'll see.
---
From their forum:
---
**Update - 12:15 p.m. EST:**
---
Today's maintenance is now complete, and you can once again log back into Fallout 76 on all platforms. We also released a new patch during downtime today, and you can [**check out the patch notes here**](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/21zDUJWJbcIyv2vKmvSSjB/fallout-76-patch-notes-february-19-2019). Thank you very much!
---
Should have been 1k lbs honestly
---
Let me explain this without being rude like the other person.
---
when you claim a workshop, if you are present or not, you open yourself to PVP. Bethesda designed this intentionally as otherwise if someone was not present at a workshop it could not be contested.
---
What you had happen was someone on a team had their team member go to your workshop and begin contesting it. This put you in PVP regardless of your location on the map. At that point depending on their build and yours yes indeed they can oneshot you. 
---
It is sadly not an exploit. It is working as intended. It is however very poorly balanced.
---
I should add, that I am aware that it can be used functionally, but I’d like it to be aesthetically pleasing where the walls on the inside and out match - not where it was obviously flipped to have the keypad out simply to work.
---
Well, yeah, it wasn't intended as a game mechanic.  What I meant by that was the intended use of the bug was to balk griefers rather than mobs.
---
I'm going home to tear down my camp and start over from scratch! Wait... I do that almost every day anyway!
---
STILL... now I'm just going to do it with more enthusiasm! :D
---
Anything about the legendary vendor? 
---
oh... I hadn't thought of that
---
Lots of options!  What's your preferred playstyle?  Are you good with gathering resources regularly or do you need to play a low resource collection build because you don't have much time to play this game?  
---
This was screwing me in melee VATS constantly, and I thought I was losing my mind until I saw this patch note. :D
---
uh-huh. on may 23.
---
 
---
Theres are intended limitations with the amount of stuff a single player can do in this game. I'd rather figure out how to play and manage things like inventory, selling/trading, etc the legitimate way. I truly believe its more rewarding and in the long run makes me a better player. I feel the same way about looking up specific tricks online such as “where can I get large amounts of X.”  That’s not to say I haven’t done this, just that Ideally I find my own way. 
---
The issue is not with people being Overpowered, it is that they have manage to get a hold of 5 pieces of god-roll armor
---
The forums do not say it is back up, still down i'm afraid   
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/327802/fallout-76-maintenance-march-13-2019/3](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/327802/fallout-76-maintenance-march-13-2019/3)
---
I don't believe that they've released any information about this, though it's certainly possible I missed something.  But I've kept up with most of the official announcements and I've seen quite literally 0 information about how survival will work (whether it's new characters only, one-way move, free choice of mode, etc.)
---
It's there and it works, but some builds you can do enough damage that 50% reduced damage isn't that hard to overcome. 
---
Why would you take the time to leave such an astonishingly dumb and pointless comment? 
---
Ah, I just realized the forum post is from the Feb 19 patch, doh!
---
HOLY SHIT WE CAN FINALLY FIND 
---
ONE LEFT LEG
---
I would paint my Excavator set Extravagantly.
---
And they also designed the PvP side of the workshop to be limited by area. Literally go back an read patch notes, go back an capture a workshop. It’s stated multiple times PvP can be engaged at the workshop during contesting, and that is ENTIRELY what the red boundary is foe when you’re doing so.
---
It was an EXPLOIT.
---
I will look in to that. I like to make primative camps that are cozy. Oil lamps, camp fires and such. I seldom add power.
---
Classical radio never really fit with my bar camp, will be glad to have a bit more variety for my guests ;)
---
Also the lighting adjustment has the potential to be huge for me, hopefully the limits are generous.
---
We already know that Rockstar is fucking stupid though, lol. 
---
To increase the grind.  Clearing 1400 caps from vendors was too easy with Flux at a base value of 100.  I could sell them for 11 caps each, only 18 raw Flux per vendor, so 140 raw Flux to clear all of them, which takes about 10 minutes to gather at whitesprings.  Now it will take longer to make money which is their main goal
---
I didn't know what was happening. Besides it's stupid that you get to 1500 an suddenly can't get drop anything.
---
There's an issue where if you have 2 different weapons of the same type, say an AA war drum and a suppressor's war drum and you have fone Favorited, selecting it from the favorite wheel will often equip the wrong one.
---
Same, this is the kind of stuff thatll bring players back.
---
Keep it up!
---
Here's hoping that there's a few more changes behind the scenes, like a 3-star legendary enemy always (or at least more often, come on!) dropping a 3-star legendary.
---
Hope this helps,   
---
Its an anagram game.  
---
you have 8 static known pieces and 2 variables, using anagram sites out there that allow for wildcards you can then get a list of 8 letter words for Alpha it was about 30, you then Keyword Cipher translate the new numbers and positions and you have your key! normally you wont have to use all 30 key-cards but it does happen.   
---
Sidenote: it only takes about 10 min to track down all the cards, all you need is Travel Perk and caps!.
---
Doesn’t add value and takes effort. 
---
Ah sorry. I am using the wooden one and since the walls are the same on both sides maybe I am not noticing that they are switched.
---
Maybe go outside if you're getting upset at the computer. Did you read anything anyone said here? The current owner of the workshop is vulnerable everywhere on the map once another goes to that workshop and presses "claim". If the contesting player immediately leaves the workshop area without fully claiming it most certainly does not stop PVP. I'm happy to explain things to people but FFS, you're in denial about what happened. 
---
You get them by being exposed to rads or taking the serum.
---
What happened to player vending and legendary scrapping?
---
I think I'm kinda in the camp that no mule is a legit mule. It literally makes zero sense from a realism standpoint.
---
Yeah.  In theory, my Anti-Armor Meat Hook should be amazing, but I rarely end up using it.  To get the most out of it, I'd need to take more ranks of each Gladiator perk, and I'm not sure that's something I really want to do, not knowing if they'll change this one day.  I only took Rank 1 of each (for +30% damage overall) and I don't have trouble dropping most enemies.
---
k
---
If you have two weapons that have the same "base" weapon, e.g. two Combat Shotguns, and one of them is favorited, the favorites wheel will often consider *both* to be favorited, and in the same slot. If you try to select the weapon in that slot the game will pull out whichever of the two weapons comes first alphabetically. In my case I'll go to pull out my Recon something-or-other 10mm Pistol and instead pull out a normal garbage unmodified 10mm Pistol.
---
Fortunately the mixup only triggers on login (and a few other uncommon things) so you don't have to worry about looting weapons to break down during normal gameplay, at least if you get rid of them before you log off.
---
Sure that's possible but explosive energy weapons are virtually useless (Explosive Tesla anyone?)so removing the effect would actually do you a favor. Not to mention a few explosive energy weapons could cause balance issues further down the line which can simply be addressed by removing the effect altogether. 
---
Also there is a legendary vendor expected to be released in May so they may implement an option to exchange these "legacy" weapons for something similar in that regard. 
---
Goodbye and thanks for all the fish.
---
Could do with less variants. I Was hoping for more placeable objects but lights and floors are always fun. 
---
Yeah, my lovely fort is also no longer thanks to this, but I think I understand it. With the upcoming PVP mode, they probably wanted to get ahead of the problem when it comes to people firing out of impenetrable fortresses 
---
Bethesda doesn't seem to think so. I disagree with them and would like it changed myself. It sucks, it really does. But I agree bloodied builds need addressing as well as PVP balance overall.
---
I've grown strangely attached to living in an impenetrable concrete box
---
Like i said and others, it’s an EXPLOIT. A GLITCH. Something that should NOT be happening, has nothing to do with being dumb as you’re the dumb one who isn’t even aware that there is an AREA PVP LIMIT at the damn workshops, yet you sit here an say you’re right because you live in your own private bubble.
---
Well anyway why would you want to get past 1500 and then start complaining that you can't drop sh1t
---
You can buy one for a modest fee of 50 Mr. Fuzzy tokens at Camden Park! I've been saving up for... a month now. 
---
Over 4 months for a quest, a new crafting bench, an event, and some balance fixes... 
---
Would agree those are clear - its the middle ROF weapons that has me wondering which category they landed up in...  50 cal, gatling plasma, still good ROF, does middle of the road damage.
---
I originally tried building there but couldn't manage to place a door over the entry and couldn't block off parts of the tunnel so I gave up :/
---
I mean, you could level up a character to 150, have a friend fight+kill him over and over to farm caps. Once he has enough, switch characters to someone that isn't permanently bankrupt.
---
Yeah probably. If you would get in trouble for saying it to a person at work in real life then it's likely in violation of the TOS. The whole "It's an M rated game about a post apocayptic hellscape you'll have stuff like that happen" doesn't seem to sate the lawyer happy people who drag this stuff out into the real world to see what monetary benefit it might bring them.
---
Oh yeah, that's true. Something like that could be like, don't disallow 88 but disallow 1488, and say sorry to anyone born on Jan 4, lmao. Dogwhistles are a complication, but doing something is better than doing nothing, or disallowing everything.
---
**QUESTION!**
---
&gt;**Legendary Creatures:** Now always drop a legendary item on death.
---
If a legendary creature 'drops dead' as I enter the area (as can happen say with the Watoga bots) will it still drop a legendary item or does this only fix the occasional issue when a legendary creature is killed, their swag bag infinity spins and then drops only standard mob loot, or nothing? Also does this fix the issue where a legendary creature would (very) occasionally drop nothing in their 'corpse' but then drop an actual physical legendary item next to their dead body?
---
They have previously mentioned you could swap characters between them, which is why I'm asking.
---
Scorched beasts have always been auto detecting stealth, and it has not been listed as a bug in the known issues, so I guess we just can't hide from the cancer bat's sonar sense.
---
I don’t think they realize that they just increased the workload for their customer service reps by an order of magnitude. “I saw two guys trading, must be dupers” “Some dude is using exploits and is a duper because he one shot me in Pacifist mode at Poseidon Energy”
---
Are we assuming this applies to vats critical use with automatic rifles?
---
Holy cow, you work fast. I have no idea how you do it, but I appreciate all this information. Thank you!
---
Sounds like Daddy needs to be stabbed through the lungs
---
A drop consisting of a combination of legendary items with a rating up to the enemy's rating could be nice.
---
3star could drop 3*, or 2* 1**, or 3*
---
My female character needs those two outfits
---
Time to do some challenges

My mistake, the link should be updated to the correct post now. Thank you for catching this!

I got called a hacker yesterday because a guy couldn't kill me. Got the convo saved and all...
---
What if their vision is that people will use energy weapons against certain mobs and ballistic against others if they want to maximize their damage against those particular mobs?  Perhaps they'll reduce the ER on some mobs to make up for the lack of energy armor penetration?   Lots of ways to solve the issues with energy weapons, and I'm certainly glad they've started by increasing durability!
---
Sure, it's achievable. But you could be one-shot with wayyyy less damage so why make up a bullshit number? Did you take to the player and confirm it?
---
I thought they messed up the first patch and it basically made people reinstall the game and that's why it was so large
---
I like the (partial?) football helmet.  My character would totally have that.
---
I'd pay money for that.

I'd pay 30$ to respect no questions asked.

3/4 huh?  Pleaee Clean off those numbers after pulling them out of your ass
---
How long it was last time?
---
Let me guess. You have high end armor and perks and the person doesn’t think that is fair. You must be a duper (sarcasm)
---
Because it's all about character building. Don't build your character for PvP? Then it's going to feel like it's broken and unbalanced. Built a character for PvP? You might find it engaging.
---
Wait. What about the decorating camp update? Is that not today? :[
---
Frankly Fusion Cells are the one ammo I am usually swimming in no matter how hard I try not to be. Liberators and Protectrons drop 8-ish on average. I think I've given away near 5k+ Fusion Cells even after deliberately trying not to loot them from robots.
---
Buying gear and getting random drops from legendaries isn't skill my man. Crouchwalking around invisible to sneak attack people isn't skill my man. Googling "fallout 76 sneak/crit build" isn't skill my man. Shooting some random mobs in vats to build your crit meter before engaging someone isn't skill my man. 
---
Harvest their salt to preserve your meats!
---
Servers still down? They may not be back up and running
---
There are ways to counter that armor, or so I've read.  If you're into PVP you'll probably need to read up some more or spend a lot of time really getting to know the various perks, weapons, and armor stats.  Your goal against sentinel is likely to involve a perk or ability that makes them move.
---
The servers aren’t up yet. It’s the same with every update. 
---
Can you play both at the same time?
---
Skin for Excavator Power Armor looks frigging awesome
---
Excavator Skins! Neato! Also, are those new wall skins or curtain skins?
---
Soooo, that Helmeted Cage Armor is just a skin? I thought the base armor wasn't even available in the game.
---
I'd really love if they'd unfix the foundation stacking glitch :(
---
I run marsupial, bird bones, and speed demon. They work well. You need to be level 35 plus, and invest a lot into luck. Starched genes and class freak to get the most out of them. I’m a rifle build btw.
---
Interesting, I didn't catch that.  Not sure exactly what that means, but it does shed a little light.
---
Do you have a link to what they said?  I'd like to parse the wording to see what they might be planning.
---
Will we still have an ITV tomorrow?
---
TIL The Salvaged Assaultron Head isn't a weapon that' supposed to fire all of your ammo on the first shot
---
Seriously it was so consistent I thought that's what the weapon was supposed to do lol
---
I’m level 65 and neither have I. I’ve never launched a nuke or seen a sbq. I’ve only been in one nuke zone which was at whitesprings. So much to explore still. 
---
I was hoping this was going to be one of the fixes this time around. Maybe they might just show back up in vendor lists but was one of those un-listed changes. 
---
that server stability is a complex problem with many intervening variables, a change to one of those variables does not ensure wholly stable servers 
---
"maybe they'll suck your dick". 
---
Isn't that exactly what you are trying to do with your post? Get your epeen stroked by using the same sensationalist tactics the person you are accusing does? 
---
Thanks for this explanation!  Hopefully I can put it to use and try to find a workaround for this annoying """feature""".
---
Lmao. You sad sad salty little sack of destroyed pride. 
---
How about use the system they have now?  Like file a ticket. This thing is going to be massively abused. 
---
lol that is what the atom shop is for
---
100% correct...with new system I'm 100% sure I woulda been false reported

I actually aim a the feet, its weird i know, but relying on bugs and random legendary drops dosnt make viable the weapon

Yes!

&gt;**Mutations:** Adrenal Reaction’s damage bonuses have been restored to their original values.  
---
&gt;**Mutations:** Fixed an issue that prevented Adrenal Reaction’s positive effects from being applied to players who had the Mutation prior to Patch 6 release.
---
I blocked the tunnel with defense walls. I am playing around with placing foundations to see if I can get one down there. Having some luck with one high, drop ladder, then floors off the bottom of the ladder. Placement of the first foundation is a futhermucker to get right though.
---
&gt;Inventory: Fixed an issue in which certain invisible and unusable creature weapons could be unintentionally looted, adding “phantom weight” to the player’s inventory.
---
Let's just hope that this fix is retroactive. I think I've been running with at least 50 extra pounds from the B.E.T.A. times on.
---
Cheaters kicked out, new content coming today. The roadmap begins and whining haters continue to whine.
---
It's all base game. This isn't even DLC worthy. I miss games with actual meaty expansions :(

How about not being stupid.

The patch was 13-17GB compressed and would need to inflate and then patch the binaries after making a backup copy of the original to fall back to until the process completed successfully.
---
Yeah, stepped outside, picked about 6 flux and my client game stopped responding. Oh well.... 
---
That's just because they don't want to admit they suck.  I KNOW I suck at PvP so no one will ever hear me complain when I inevitably lose ;)
---
What about mules doesn't make sense? People need extra room to store items so they put them on a second character 
---
No love for empath and herd mutations interacting with class freak :'( these mutations shouldn't hurt the solo player so badly but encourage them to pick them up for group work. +33% damage hurts and -2sp hurts. Especially combined
---
I just hope their improvements to bulldozing mean that I won't NEED this exploit just to place the whole single level foundation for my house because of a single piece being block by a rock that won't properly yield.
---
Those outfits look like things I would actually wear in an apocalypse! I'm glad Bethesda is finally starting to give us cool stuff.
---
Exactly, he is using the exact same tactics op is accusing YongYea of doing. XD
---
I can’t wait that long....
---
" **Daily:** Fixed an issue that prevented certain Daily Challenges from being offered in-game when they were scheduled to be available. These Challenges will now correctly appear going forward."
---
Is this finally fixing the daily *quests* not respawning daily? I have 3 hours of downloading ahead of me before i can try it out.
---
Yeah, the Nuka grenades launch them skyward.  It can take a hike and a good tracking Dogmeat to find your loot afterward.
---
I have Demolition Expert equipped when I solo, but I definitely need to remember to swap it out (thanks for the reminder) when running around a nuked Whitespring.  I'm doing my best to not be a jerk so everyone can get XP and have a good time.  I'm big on cooperative play.  
---
I'll have another look at Molotovs.  I was avoiding them for the visual disturbance they create for the melee builds.  The MIRVs produce a area-of-effect localized cloud of smoke that lasts for a second or two, and that's it.  Again, just trying not to be a jerk.  
---
I can't return fire at people attacking me to demonstrate that I'm set on pacifist, because it'll flag me and then they'll desecrate my corpse and take my stuff (learned that in a most unpleasant way), so it's a bit of a problem.
---
F\*ck me sideways, that black and red excavator looks very desirable.
---
(Sharpening Hammer) is Rathalos here already?
---
He was eating mackerel, duh
---
Can't see anything about renaming power armour or weapons, is this going to be implemented in a future patch?
---
Way to marginalize all of my skills, dude! Seriously, though, I hope they add some sort of thunderdome type PVP arena. Throw a bunch of players in a room with pipe weapons and no outside gear and let them have at it. 
---
Wait. What? Foundation stacking has been patched? RIP, my base.
---
Wrong.
---
You can find out more about it here: [Survival Mode](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1PnLPLl6a8D6gPNWvSVA0Q/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-24-2019)
---
RIP AND TEAR.
---
Pacifist would protect him from accidentally destroying things and getting flagged. You don't get flagged for being in a workshops area while others are claiming. It doesn't even pause the claim progress bar. I think he just doesn't understand the mechanics
---
This is what I came for
---
That was my worry too, but thankfully the base game is still there with no issue.   I just made the space that it says that it needed and it started downloading the patch.   It's a 13 GB patch (roughly) so why do I need 53.7 GB free to even download it.   I am not downloading the entire game again because it's still there on my drive.   I just do not understand why I need 53.7 GB free to download a 13 GB patch?
---
yeah, the vague "will be fixed in an upcoming patch" i just want to know which patch. today's doesnt have any info about it in the notes, and is apparently 18GB, to update. i dont want to download it if its not going to let me in.
---
Mate. There’s guides an video’s of people doing over 10k damage LEGIT. Why are you questioning this? Go on youtube and type in fallout 76 insane damage. Crack on.
---
Outside of power armour, even standard armour you can stack upto 300 damage resistance from Mutations and perks alone, that alone sits already at Excavator level protection.
---
Then take in the armour, then take in the percentages from prefixes an mods, so... dense to reduce explosives/fire etc. Assassins’s/Sentinal etc aswell?
---
Perks too? Serendipity/Barbarian/Evasive/Dodgy/Blocker again offering extremely high resistances.
---
Then with Unyielding procking Luck to over 35 points, you get that lovely Serendipity prock. Then Adrenal reaction too...
---
Trust me. You can get some pretty crazy numbers. You can have someone doing a mere 3% of damage if you build right.
---
The mutations I use Marsupial, Speed demon, and Scaly skin. You can get mutations randomly from taking on radiation (standing in it, being hit by a radioactive creature, etc) or by drinking a serum bought at the Enclave base or from other players.
---
Yeah. This bums me out.
---
Not this time around.
---
The owner being there or not really shouldn't make a difference in whether you can claim it or not. If they're not there then its uncontested and becomes yours unless the owner comes back to defend it within the timeframe. Theres really no need for you to be open to pvp outside of that workshop area. That being said the fact remains that you are open to pvp anywhere on the map and shouldn't take workshops of you're not prepa6to engage in pvp 
---
Thanks for the radio! Maybe Explosives will be buffed soon?
---
Kind of like how workshops after 2/19 patch are easily exploitable?  After that patch, workshops became  basically impossible to defend by constructing defenses. It's simply not possible to guard every square inch of the workshop with turrets, and the workshop can be contested from anywhere within it. 
---
The response to that I always here is, "If you don't want PVP, then don't take over workshops. It warns you that PVP is possible when you claim it."  
---
Well, the same applies to your complaint. You know the rules of PVP, so you can't complain about not getting caps that the player doesn't have.  If you don't want to waste ammo on players with no caps, then don't engage in PVP. 
---
I obtained mutations recently and can honestly say that they have improved the game for me.  
---
I have a few of them, but the most relevant ones for my stealth sniper are Bird Bones (+ Agility - Strength, reduced fall speed and fall damage), Marsupial (+  jump height, - Intelligence), Speed Demon (+Walk, Sneak and Reload Speed, increased hunger and thirst while moving) and to a certain extent, Eagle Eyes, which is a bonus to perception and reduction in.... something, possibly :/  
---
I can sneak at almost normal running speed. I can jump and almost damn near float. Really, being able to just leap cat-like up on to the tops of buildings and into trees is amazing.  
---
Some folks say it doesn't make that much difference but I accidentally took a hit of Rad-X the other night which suppressed all my mutations and I couldn't believe how slow and crappy my movement was without them :)
---
The CAMP shots with the new blue-and-yellow lamp... the one with the bear on it... what's more intriguing is the building around the lamp.  Just an example placed somewhere in the game, or new tilesets for CAMP building?
---
I cannot express my excitement.
---
Ahh ok thanks m8
---
Well that stinks. The only other issue then is legendary mobs spawning, like in the uranium fever event.
---
I also find it strange they didn't address this. Was it accidentally omitted or did they really ignore them?
---
&gt;Weapons: Plasma weapons can now correctly spawn with 2-star and 3-star legendary effects.
---
They never did? Intrigued to find actually usable plasma weapons now.
---
As someone who doesn’t know what launches tomorrow, can someone explain?
---
the only people worried about it being abused are the ones that grief the fuck out of people.
---
Did the camp dozing thing improve?
---
There are trees that I can’t doze down in camp. I’d like the real estate for planting crops
---
Hacking 3 is fun for silos, at least. 
---
This. 
---
They stay ready to shit on something, no matter how dumb. Look at example Anthem.
---
I forgot, what’s changing in the dlc?
---
Damn I'm gonna get 50 reports a day... gonna get banned for pvping lol lame
---
Finally skins for weapons people actually use
---
They'll handle it. If you get reported someone might check the account, maybe if they find some odd items they'll ban the user, otherwise everything is fine and move on.
---
This report systems seems to be added to find the dupers/exploiters, since FO76 has no chat so it's pretty much impossible to get an archive with what someone said.
---
Pacifist mode is working pretty well, workshop kills cases will be quickly dismissed after a quick check.
---
They're still working on detecting dupers, this is just a part of that. If you're just some legit raider you have nothing to worry about. 
---
If they removed all legendary effects and vats, I would maybe participate in some of that. 
---
It's more so this community is comprised of whiners. To implement this type of system later in games life, instead of at launch, it's going to be overly abused
---
/u/Ladydevann can you comment on this?
---
I ended up going here right before this Mornings Server Maintenance. Didn't get to finish exploring it but hopefully Bethesda resets world item spawns during their maintenance.
---
Because many people don't even realize they can do that, maybe?
---
Numerous times. I've taken them off, logged off, put them back on... Nothing seems to work 
---
Ah the ATLAS facility! My BOS group ran a research patrol there, seems like it will open as an event further down the line similar to repairing a reactor. Maybe allow a player to choose the weather on the server?
---
In the rease notes for todsy, it states all legendary enemies now drop legendary loot.
---
On PC, individual files can be updated. On consoles, the same files are essentially "packaged" into larger chunks. So they have to make you re-download the whole chunk to update one or two files. 
---
Right now there are none in the Atom Shop and hopefully Bethesda puts some in there
---
Ive got Plastic marked. Ive been checking every container, room, enemy, etc.
---
And it doesn't unlock shortcuts like DEus Ex would - you trade limited inventory space to hold more lockpicks so you could take a shortcut somewhere and avoid a fight or find an upgrade...
---
Gaming in general is comprised of whiners, sadly. Still, every decent multiplayer game has a report system, and there's a reason for that.
---
Is there anyway to cure radiation damage without losing your mutation? Eventually, you get so much that you have very little health left. Radaway: diluted and the radarches don't work.
---
Ngl those outfits look amazing
---
I love shotguns, as long as you're comfortable with constantly looking for plastic to make more shells.  One of my chars is a melee/shotgun build - I use shotgun to cripple and try to use a vampire sledge to finish them off to save on ammo where possible.  I'd also recommend the "Can Do" perk heavily - it's good for finding most any food and water, so you don't even need the "Good Doggy" perk if you check all the trash cans in whitesprings every day or two.  Good chance of finding plastic in those trash cans too!  It's hard to do a jack of all trades without giving up a lot, so I'd recommend sticking to two weapon types plus QoL perks.
---
Oh i lose my fair share too. Lol just a wise man knows when he met his match sometimes and goes his own way.
---
I’m hoping it’s just a “guess what you’re in again situation”
---
I’ve been playing for about a month and a half and have yet to run into this “fuckery” you speak of. I’ve only been disconnected a hand full of time. I can literally count on one hand how many times I’ve been disconnected. 
---
One step I've taken is putting up fencing around my base.  It serves a dual-purpose: Keeps mobs from butting up against my foundation and possibly clipping through, and it keeps them far enough away that my turrets don't get dumb and go "Oh gosh you're near my wall? Can't see you can't shoot you!"
---
Such a good song though.
---
My suggestion is to build towards a shotgun/melee hybrid. Most of the perks for both are in the Strength stat, so you're not spreading yourself too thin. At this point (level 140ish) I have accumulated enough shotgunner and slugger perks that I can go full on with either one or mix and match 4-5 points of each depending on the situation. 
---
When I run low on ammo (which is rare) I swap in a bunch of melee cards, take a run through Blackwater, and usually end up with a net gain of 100-150 shells along with plenty of plastic and steel scrap to make more if needed.
---
Also, OP is kind of exaggerating. If you "tag" plastic in the component menu you'll quickly realize that tons of things contain plastic. If anything, lead is usually the bottleneck I have to deal with when crafting shells.
---
the helmet cage armor you mean is probably the one on the screenshot for the supersledge? i'm not sure where that helmet is from, maybe its an unreleased set, or it was released before. It's not part of this update anyway.. The screenshot is purely for the supersledge
---
This only hurts dupers, anybody using mules already scaled back after the last inventory nerf. But making the dupers delete their own stuff manually is genius
---
Interesting 
---
Folks without enough caps go PvP and have their bounty higher then what they own.
---
I don’t PvP usually but when some griefer attacks me, I block GT and server hop
---
Those PA skins are 🔥🔥🔥
---
I’m so excited for the dress!
---
I hope Bethesda resets world item spawns during the current server maintenance.
---
Another good suggestion!
---
We're still investigating these, I'll check in on where they're at.
---
You’re exactly right. That’s why I mentioned they need to re-balance energy/ballistic defense of enemies. As of now most enemies have a higher energy defense than ballistic defense. There isn’t a reason right now to use energy over ballistic weapons because ballistic weapons have the advantage when it comes to enemy defensive stats right now.
---
So you would rack up a bounty you couldn't pay off? I'm talking about thousands of caps before stuff like that happened. Negative cap balances get paid off through any cap exchange high bounties can usually be attributed to the leveling of someone's camp, the way I look at it, if you were being a dick to someone and can't pay the bounty the game should be kind of a dick to you. What you're talking about sounds a bit like a lack of personal responsibility. Or as I like to say "play stupid games, win stupid prizes." Acquiring a bounty you can't pay off is the stupid game. Not getting rewarded for anything until the bounty is paid off is the stupid prize.
---
Well I hope it does
---
Yep
---
Outside of weight of equipped armor affecting stealth, Heavy armor doesn't lower you ability to be stealthy.  And Weight below 1lb. doesn't seem to affect stealth at all, regardless of the armor's base weight or type.  So Weightless, Ultra-Light armor has no reduction in your ability to sneak regardless of if you are wearing Light leather or Heavy Metal armor.
---
I noticed a wallpaper and cinder block walls?
---
They were great. Anti grief proof. But not mole rat proof 
---
Paul Manafort got off easier.. should have just cheated on your taxes dude.
---
Not to mention it would be punishing to new players. Imagine having very little stuff and getting grieved by high level players only to lose your gear because you havent played enough to earn the caps lol
---
This is only a problem if they don't verify the reports and ban without evidence, which hasn't happened yet so don't freak out.
---
I agree but fallout has an exceeding abundance of them. I cant being to count the amount of take away pvp posts I've seen on here because someone destroyed a plant at there camp.
---
"Can someone tell me if the game is finally worth playing?"
---
Exactly
---
I'll never shut up about it 
---
No need to apologize friend-o! 
---
I love you too. 
---
Well that ultracite paintjob is... disappointing...
---
I pvp daily...I am one who will get flagged easily
---
Entropy!
---
That thing is janky as hell to place.
---
That being said, you can usually place walls over conduit. 
---
I remember when they finally patched God of War so basic attacks dealt damage instead of doing nothing.
---
Wait, that never happened. GOW was released in a finished state and didn't require paying customers be the company's quality assurance testers and fix it when they finally get around to it.
---
Still haven't reached the endgame? 
---
Thanks. It would be good to know if it's intended or not so we can decide whether or not to spend time farming items or just wait for a fix.
---
For really real, it’s been a month by now, surely they’ve made some headway
---
&gt;Main Menu: The background video that plays while viewing the Main Menu has been updated with a new Wild Appalachia themed video.
---
Just finished installing the update. I love the new background video! It's a bit short, though.
---
Buy a Grape Nukacola from the soda fountain at Whitesprings. It will cure the rads and leave the mutation. 
---
It didn't use to be that way.  Prior to the patch that changed the vendor inventories (also, Bethesda, are we ever going to look into that again?), Grahm used to stock some one-of-a-kind items.
---
Very, very good job. I love to see Bethesda giving exploiters the treatment they deserve.
---
Lol I bet you play melee
---
Why did you get banned exactly? Did you dupe?
---
I hope this means my garden will be more bare and I can finally see my melons and carrots.  
---
My point was more that they don't have to do \_both\_ if they do the other sufficiently, but it does probably make sense to do both and be more balanced.  Fundamentally I agree with you.  :)
---
I think he is reffering to the one where you choose say a tse handmade, but what you get in your hands is a quad handmade. 2 of the same weaponin inventory, gets mixed up. 
---
I don't even use rifles, but I might get that lever action skin just because of how cool it looks. Thanks for sharing!
---
The reason you're getting jumped on is because you're deliberately ignoring that MMO stands for "Massively Multiplayer Online". Not "Massive World Online" or "Massive Raid Bosses Online" but "Massively Multiplayer". 24 people per *server* isn't a massive amount. Most games with raid bosses do have limits to raid parties afaik, yeah. But there are *lots* of people who are *not* in that raid party on the server *at the same time*. Just because a 24 member raid party is happening in "Boss Zone Alpha" doesn't mean 40 more people are leveling in "Newbie Zone Beta" on the same server in an MMO. But in FO76, if 24 people are taking on the Queen, then *nobody* is anywhere else on the server. Because it's *just* an online multiplayer game, not an MMO.
---
By "roleplay as raiders" do you mean that you get informed consent prior to pretending to be raiders attacking your victim(s)
---
Or do you just randomly attack folks and claim that you are roleplaying?
---
(Workshops are fair game and anyone who complains about getting shot over one seriously misunderstands the game)
---
Seconded...
---
Weird, because a few day ago i had a workshop and some low level tried engaging pvp with me and he was killing me very slowly. For 15 minutes he kept firing at me....
---
Player reporting. This is good and bad. I'm gonna get reported for artillery striking whitesprings backdoor turrets aren't I?
---
"You cannot fast travel with enemies nearby".... THERE ISNT ANY I KILLED THEM!!!!
---
Explosive effects are the only way to make a laser rifle viable right now. So removing the effect would not do those a favor. I personally invested quite a bit trying to create an energy weapon build that's viable (purchased and found multiple explosive laser rifles), so taking away my explosive effect without replacing it with an equivalent effect would set me back a lot of time investment.
---
My hopes are that they just come up with some equivalent change, however they plan to do it.
---
It is a beautiful tradition. I live 15km outside of Basel.
---
I know. In the official forums, several people called me psychopath and compared me to school shooters when I mentioned that I enjoy PvP.
---
But luckily, those idiots are few.
---
Did someone say Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
Oh, thanks, guys -)) Didn't expect anyone mentioning my mods here. Much appreciated!
---
The way I can tell is that if you use a special paint job on one set, and none on he other, you can than distinguish the two. Sadly and obviously, this will only work if you have two sets of power armor. 
---
Ok I see your point 
---
Just think about what you're saying man. If the pvp for a workshop was limited to the workshop area what's stopping me from jumping in and out of the contest area to keep you from killing me? It had to be the entire map otherwise it wouldn't work at all. "Spend 30 caps to claim workshop? Others may initiate pvp with you to attempt to claim it from you". Is the exact prompt when claimin a workshop. No where does it state only within the claim area. The patch notes you keep referring to. They extended the range of the claim area beyond the tiny circle around where you claim a workshop to the whole area so people trying to take a workshop werent limited to a tiny circle to contest it. But if you wanna keep pleading your case. By all means. Go ahead. I'm getting quite the laugh outta all this. 
---
Update. Nobody can get on right now. 
---
Congratulations! You have become today's winner of Least Useful TLDR!

Heavy guns.

Yes the SPECIAL system is suuuuuuper restrictive.

I hope the light budget is big enough for mine. I have one large structure with three smaller ones and each is lit well.

Cerial reposter, karma whore, lieing about advertising things, mod on most subs and uses it to ban people he doesnt like/ disagree with him. Also not the nicest person.
---
Yeh' best start believing in post-release playtesting from paying customers.
---
Yer' in one!
---
Yeah thats one of those QOL items id like to be addressed. I have a suit of everytype and typically only carry three but no matter what its always the last one i put down is the one i want. Was actually nice for a bit when the bright headlamp had the atom shop symbol so i didnt need to fumble about to get to my Excavator set
---
I've tried going to Wasteland Hoarders Anonymous at the Church in Flatwoods for help, but my base is within a minute walk to 2 known power armor spawns and I just can't stop  picking them up. 
---
Yep.
---
*laughs in 400mbps connection unlimited downloads*
---
Sorry to be smug, i had crap internet from 99-2017. Now living the dream!
---
Might as well play cookie clicker then. 
---
I’m more interested into story, interesting encounters, and interesting locations to explore. 
---
Which FO 76 does have. 
---
Just also lots of grinding, which I hate. 
---
No there's a separate picture of the helmeted cage armor. I'm wondering if it's something that can be applied to the driver outfit.
---
Does the absolute carry weight count in factors like weight reduction perks or legendary effects? I tend to carry a lot of food and chems on my characters.
---
Again gonna disagree with this, don’t take peoples equipment i feel thats too harsh because it is possible to do lose 1k in a long fight which if you aren’t a rich guy could be all your money just prevent people from abusing it dont take their items. Not only that i dont want bethesda accidentally dropping my items cos they modify their spaghetti code
---
&gt;“Some dude is using exploits and is a duper because he one shot me in Pacifist mode at Poseidon Energy”
---
Are you worried about being falsely reported, or accurately reported? 
---
Should be, if it’s classed as a heavy weapon
---
I must have accidently scrapped my voice of set as it appears in my crafting items.
---
Anyone know how I can find another one? 
---
In order to craft it, I need a voice of set... 🙄
---
I think if a gun would be affected by it, it would be the light machine gun. It certainly is the one that needs it the most
---
Plan your build. NukesDragons has a pretty good build planner: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
Vault raids is coming in the summer. This update adds in two main quest lines and in a few weeks the legendary vendor, which is what I'm most excited for
---
Thanks! Have a great day!
---
I’m talkin about the green, red and white full body armor with the “ski patrol” text on the left leg. You can find the armor on dead raiders but there’s not a lootable version.
---
If it's fun, that's the best motivator to chose I feel. But is it fun enough that you'd work it into your build over something else, like damage/survival perks/card slots? In a game with repetition, like running silo's, after the fun, it's about grinding/farming, I feel people chose to min/max to make the grind faster, and "fun" takes a backseat to efficiency. While you may chose fun, many others don't, hence the point of this post. That's where the "reward" comes in, nothing makes a choice more meaningful to efficiency minded players than weighing risk/time/reward.
---
What about building a CAMP made ONLY of radio &gt;:D ?
---
The problem with this one, though, is that it further encourages the annoying, cheat-y ai of ranged enemies (commie bots, scorched, super mutants) that has them stand just out of turret range and merrily plink away at your stuff.  :/
---
And i’m getting quite a laugh seeing you deny it’s an exploit when it’s been confirmed to be a workshop PvP exploit, you seem so oblivious to the fact to contest the workshop you HAVE to be in the workshop are. I was not in the worlshop area to contest it, therefore PvP should NOT have been active.
---
That’s literally why the Workshops have the boundary, to restrict play WITHIN THAT PARAMETER.
---
I got killed OUTSIDE OF THAT PARAMETER. it’s simple logic here that you FAIL to understand.
---
CAMP items are being placed on top of tent while trying to place it on a bookshelf. Will that be fixed?
---
Your won't get banned aslong as you do nothing wrong. Bethesda would need proof of griefing and unless your going to go around killing low levels in flatwoods and calling people racist profanities, your good
---
I have a tendancy to stay away from everyone. Had a bad experience in a Online game way years back. Fo76 was the game that got me back to Online gaming.
---
Still waiting to find out, but I would imagine so, the damage/rate of fire buff would finally make it a viable option.
---
Why is the West Virginia sign sideways?
---
He has to claim the workshop too for it to initiate pvp with the owner
---
Doespecially the absolute weight limit consider weight reduction perks or legendary effects? I tend to grab lots of Nuka cola, canned food, and scrap and I am worried it will prevent me from playing a vendor character style.
---
I just want the mosaic tile floors, dammit. Couldn’t care less about skins
---
This is the best thing this patch brings for me ! So happy!
---
Starched genes perk 
---
We both either buy one, hope someone vendors it and we see it, or make a separate toon
---
A perfect 5/7.
---
What's the max amount of characters a person can have?
---
And they didn’t ban any innocents for items either 
---
I do hope they sort this out. I have actually witnessed, on multiple occasions, enemies spawning in inside of my camp. 
---
Frequently 2/3rds of the enemy mob will spawn inside my locked home and start right away beating the shit out of my generators. The other 1/3rd spawns outside. Unfortunately by the time I get to the door my generator has already died and I get completely locked out of my Player Home due to my powered doors not having power. Which forces me to scrap/store walls and doors just to get inside my home. 
---
Bethesda if you want us to build C.A.M.P.s that are highly decorated DO NOT spawn spam enemies inside of our buildings. Especially when they are locked and sealed tight. It’s just a frustrating game mechanic. Do they want us building our turrets inside of our homes instead of on the outside? 
---
But if they have full sentinel armor, they're virtually invulnerable too, no?

Rifle

Will we ever get a suppressor for the 10mm SMG? /u/Valseek /u/Ladydevann

 Does that yellow power armor give anyone else some Bumblebee vibes?

Nah this dude eats fish food pellets so its baited breath, dont judge him.

5 on one account. I have 2 playable and 3 mules. I have been slowly selling and trading things to get a 3rd playable.

You sir will get so downvoted for speaking the truth 😁
---
Whats considered wrong in pvp? Theres no rules to pvp lol
---
Thanks.
---
Saw your post. Got excited to download and play. 
---
"Play" button just means the game is ready; above the button, next to version # and Game Options, is an icon with a red or green circle which is server status.

Huh?

FINALLY !
---
Well, people like drama. It’s *why* it makes it to the front page. 
---
Yup. *Spends next twenty levels going back to hunting rifle build*
---
Yeah, I'm just telling you how it is and why you can't expect it to change.  Removing all grinding from Fo76 would actually kill the game.  A multi-player online video game is going to target a different audience than a single player role playing game would.  What fo76 needs to achieve is going to be way different than what the other Fallout games have aimed to achieve.  MMOs will have elements of both as you've recognized.  Unfortunately for you, 76 is a MMO, not a single player RPG.  So there will always be a grind element.
---
I’m awaiting my own base’s fate, too. I used campfire to snap walls onto that horrible staircase, and as you said - around minimal terrain objects. Gonna be pissed if I have to rebuild. 
---
Save us, u/juggs !
---
Dunno about the mobs question but as for the SB the thought that comes to mind is:
---
A giant mutant bat with echolocation so strong that it can hurt you can see through stealth? Say it ain't so! lol j/k
---
If I had to guess, Id say it meant he is used to skipping to the bottom and reading the tl;dr, so even on a small post where it's not really necessary to include a tl;dr he is used to skipping the write up and only reading the tl;dr so he did it anyways
---
I think Phoenix only has T-45, T-51b and T-60 mods. I go to Harpers Ferry for Excavator mods, just look for any mod that scraps to black titanium. As for the Ultracite set, I only get plans from the SBQ, but there may be another source that I'm not aware of. The X-01 mods can be found in the Whitesprings (Enclave) bunker.  I hope that helps. 
---
It’s my own fault, but I’m a little sad that I’m gonna lose an awful lot of junk and aid on my (very) over encumbered alt character I’ve been using as storage since day 1. 
---
I guess it fixes the issue of all those stockpiled duped items, but I’ve a few thousand Nuka Cola farmed over multiple characters and purchased from players that I won’t even be able to drink for caps. Sad times. 
---
Happy to see some decent fixes and new content, though!
---
it is in reference to an experiment done by a scientist name Pavlov. It has to do with conditioning a response to stimuli. 
---
[https://www.simplypsychology.org/pavlov.html](https://www.simplypsychology.org/pavlov.html)
---
Any photos of your skyscrapers? 🏢
---
Personally I find the game much more enjoyable  when teamed up with other players. Depending on your platform you should be able to find folks to join you and explore the world with. You'll be amazed at what you will run across while just out and about.
---
Referring to Pavlovian response, in which behavior is caused by a stimulus. Pavlov trained dogs to salivate when a bell was rung, by conditioning them with ringing a bell and giving them treats. 
---
Or lying in bed trying to get to sleep! 
---
The good news is that you will now have a 100% VATS hit chance instead of the non legendary 95% VATS hit chance.
---
That's the plan at the moment it seems but I think many people disagree with the idea because it undermines the core of the survival aspect. 
---
You'll get some people who want to make a fresh character from the start on survival and then have some people move their high level character over. It defeats the purpose of 'survival' of you already have a CAMP stockpiled of everything you could possibility need. Only chance that would dramatically affect the high level player would be the PVP restrictions lifted and loot (Chems and Stims) dropped on death. 
---
There is the rub, this doesn't necessarily apply to suspended accounts but to active accounts instead.
---
For """immersion""", yeah, probably, but I already get my shit leveled by a scorchbeast some derp kited past my base on the regular, so it'll just be another day to me, tbh. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
No time. Too much masturbation.
---
You see, this what I am talking about. Here is typical user who is going to make false reports.
---
I’m sure reasonable 3 point lighting in a few different rooms plus exterior will be ok. If you lit you’re camp like a stadium however.. 
---
 Really, this is a problem with all news and social media in general. People are trying to stay so relevant and offer the best hot takes that actually investigating things fall by the way side. What happened to those Covington kids is a perfect example of this. 
---
PRESTIGE WILL FIX THIS STOP REPOSTING EVERY SINGLE DAY WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE
---
Which would then mean you couldn't put those points into, say, Strength for example. So you'd have sacrifice there. 
---
Well, at least until you started leveling past 50 and started getting the respec points...
---
Good to know. I'm sitting on 3 on one account including my main but not a single one has come close to maxing a mule stash.
---
This confirmed my theory for my next build. First floor: Garage Second floor: Bar/lounge Third: Private apartment
---
That is what I was saying.
---
That it's the future and there's no music that doesn't suck? Ever let your grandmother DJ? Is there ever a better time where you want to undo her seat belt and push her out onto the highway? 
---
True, they didn't. People tested the claims made by people who were "innocent", like 900 pound guy and found them to be full of it.
---
Banned players screaming innocent is pretty common for the first few ban waves.
---
Light, sturdy, and heavy and the variants of each armor, its how they naturally come basically so it cant be changed
---
Looks nice splash screen 
---
I can see how the new reporting system could be easily abuse.  What if someone file a report and gets a dozen of his friends to file the exact same report?
---
Someone dies in a PVP workshop battle, and he and 10 of his friends report someone for hate speech (that didn't happen). 
---
Which is why I said that the user name checks out.
---
I thought it was mildly amusing, obviously it was only amusing in my head.
---
I sold nuka cola for my friends
---
I don’t even bother with pvp. I was wearing ultracite power armor and I got one shotted by a guy only 3 or 4 levels above me. I’m assuming it was some kind of mutation because he only had a sliver of health but still. I had ultracite power armor lol
---
You have to leave then equipped
---
His Fallout 4 retrospective was so awesome. That Survivor 2099 video was so well done
---
wuh happen
---
Whining about perk cards EVERY SINGLE DAY!!! Today it's 600 upvotes, WTF goldfish people - no memory?
---
Oh Pavlov, with the spelling I wasn't sure
---
Yeah, flea market. Can't tell me there arent any of THOSE in West Virginia! Lol
---
That *was* my plan but it’d be a waste if my acct gets re-enabled today
---
Hermit Crab in FO4: Van full of junk, van full of junk, van full of junk...oh hello...proceeds to kill Hermit Crab.
---
Hermit Crab in 76: There are no vans full of junk, they are all Hermit Crabs and unless you have PA or are prepared to fight them, they will probably kill you instead.
---
Meanwhile...
---
Fog Crawler in FO4: Stop staggering me and die already(against 1).
---
Fog Crawler in 76: Huh, they died pretty fast(againt 4 at once).
---
I miss that song...
---
At least that's an answer.   I'm not a tech person so I asked a question that I did not know the answer for.
---
Yeah I gotcha man, I wasn't saying all monsters should have the same defense for both weapon types. I was saying that all defense stats for enemies need to be re-balanced. Like you said, it only makes sense that some enemies should be good against ballistic and some should be good against energy.
---
How do you know which is what. Do you have to mod it to see? I've had trouble figuring out which is what and im sure its something easy and im being a noob lol
---
Oh.  I get it.  Lmao.  Most people don't get my name.  So it flew right over my head. 
---
I've noticed as well with 4LC and reported it, but it doesn't seem to get much traction. Disallowing crits themselves from filling the meter is shitty enough as it is.
---
Stop being so literal.
---
 Yeah they dont explain this in game at all so my very first camp didn't have a door! Just 7 walls and one empty wall space.
---
With the last update changing the hard cap on carry weight and now this one, my theory I made weeks ago may be through. Bethesda never intended for people to hoard items to the level of using alternate characters. If they wanted this they would have added the ability to transfer between characters. 
---
Of course you're right, but you're also ignoring the tacit approval given by Bethesda community members of the technique. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ane0xv/fallout_76_pyramid_camp/) for example. If your community manager is telling you your camp is awesome, but not giving any hint that they will be removing the ability to have this awesome camp, that's a failure in communication. Like I said, all it would take was a warning that this was temporary.
---
But the Storm lastet only a brief period.
---
The weather is changing every 30 minutes right now. From Snow to Sun to Windy af.
---
ps4 here and they seem to work fine - i don't run Psychopath though
---
Wow, this is impressive work. Congratulations! And thank you for all you do!
---
Please just leave reddit for everyone's good all you do is whine.
---
Thank goodness!
---
I usually sometimes do so I refer to a sheet someone made on here, search on this sub “armor stat” or something similar and you should find a spreadsheet with the info for each. Basically light is the lowest dr and heavy has the highest defense
---
This sounds pretty cool. I’m definitely more of the combat-focused variety. I’m rocking an Unyielding-Bloodied build right now. No, I’m not a duper, just deep in the meta. 
---
Thank god we have you to show us the way! 
---
So for challenge tracking what about bugged challenges?   I’ve got 5 characters that have visited Grafton Dam (wonderful this time of year) and none have got credit to “ding” the challenge as complete.
---
Beautiful patch.  Granted we got a new quest line I'm not doing back flips over but it seems they are trying.  The bug fixes are a really encouraging.  3 months ago I loved the game but was really worried about it's future, your getting there Todd.  
---
Woah awesome hopefully by the end of the day we can crack open a cold nukashine together
---
yea using rank 2. Shame i just leveled up and already selected another perk so i guess need to rank it up the next time i level up :) 
---
Bahahahahaha. You're the first person that's ever gone through my post history for some ammo. Bahahahahaha. You aren't even worth making fun of anymore. I usually block creeps. So enjoy having your ass handed to in fallout then having it handed to you again when you cry in Reddit about it. 🤠🤠👋
---
And how did that get you banned? Also, how did you get said Nuka Colas and how many did you sell?
---
Not sure how I feel about fighting communism with socialism, but thanks for the info!
---
I feel like he's trying to ride the wave her had with MGS5 and all the bad fallout that happened after that, no matter if it actually works. 
---
The bug causes weapons of the same base type to get removed from the wheel. If you have 2 legendary handmades favorited, only one will be on the wheel when you login. Every time you join a world you have to rearrange your favorite wheel if you use more than one weapon of the same base type.
---
The key point I think we're both trying to make is that energy weapons should be better at _something_!  My heavy gunner should have a good reason to carry around (or at least store) a couple of weapons of each damage type based on what he's expecting to fight.  Currently ballistic is king, when energy should rock at least a few important mobs.
---
I paid less that £4 for my copy.... on PC digital so yeah just console....and I do play...This is a live service game Bethesada has running costs... Its naive to think they will keep supporting the game if the player base doesn't grow or they cannot make money from atoms or expansions....F2P is not a bad thing if done right... for example when time comes to sell an expansion which will come then making the base game free is a good way to sell that expansion...
---
End of the day a live service game cannot survive without revenue coming in..... how do you suggest they make money?
---
I thought they fixed this in Patch 6 - I have always received a \* item when downing a Legendary creature
---
Other people duplicated them and sold them to me for cheap, I never did any crafting or force disconnects or anything 
---
Building has been greatly improved, even more so with today’s patch. There are NPCs in the game, they just aren’t humans. The map is huge, rewarding to explore, and decently populated with enemies. Overall, the game is very much like fallout 4 and better in some areas, worse in others. Enjoy!
---
I always do, to see what drivel the person spews out and to see who they are, and i saw enough of your stupidity. Bye felicia.
---
There's been a clump of logs in the middle of my camp that have stopped me from perfecting my industrial compound. I sure hope this let's me build there, it's taking up valuable real estate 
---
sound about right
---
I think in that case, those players can't report you. I mean even if they reported you, they are digging their own grave. In that situation them report you is like invading someones house and then calling a police to you. 
---
I really like that Pip-boy with all the stickers on it and those posters look really cool too!
---
Not really. For correctly geared players its a more read and react experience.
---
You cant 1 hit anyone who is prepared for PvP. You need to know what they are wearing and how to defeat it.  
---
Damn PvE kids not knowing what they are commenting about bothers me lol!
---
I run 11 mutations,  can craft 5, my buddy can craft more, i sell and i love them.  I run marsupial Speed Demon Carnivore Chameleon Healing Factor Bird bones Eagle eyes unstable isotope electrically charged grounded and plague walker. O never ever ever every Unequip my starched genes max rank card.  I run class freak maxed out so with my 2strength spec and my forest scout underarmor i actually have 15 plus carry weight strength3 despite all the negative mutation affects.  Love it
---
SHEEPSQUATCH
---
So many things fixed! This, is a **great** patch.
---
In the meantime would you mind doing a bit of a test? Try to occasionally check your weapons condition and take note of it’s position. If it goes up or seems to have stayed still for a while. That’s a good sign that it works but just doesn’t display it.
---
Or not, you do you. I’m just sad ever since I accidentally levelled it to 3 and lost my chance to test it. 
---
oh and even though i have healing factor with class freak my stim packs actually heal me during battle lol
---
N group i run stranger in numbers and can walk on air
---
Oh wow I should totally do the same thing. Never even occurred to me and I have my old Xbox One just collecting dust at the moment. 
---
Being that the majority of players will eventually have at least 3 Power Armor sets (their first one, their Excavator, and their Ultracite set) I would say this is a mandatory feature. With C.A.M.P. Decorating coming the possibility of Power Armor displays would also be a good case for implementing this feature. 
---
Can you imagine switching Power Armor in your Pipboy in older Fallout games without being able to see which set is which? I mean just imagine if in the older games every set of Power Armor in your stash and inventory being labeled as the same item. Sillyness. 
---
With that said I hope Bethesda Austin/Maryland we’re aware of this dilemma early on and have just been working out the proper way to codify it. Other QOP things were higher priority for mantaing the playerbase I suspect. 
---
Do people still have poor enough internet service that 20gb is daunting?
---
If you have learned them the base stats for each type and level are shown when you go to an armor crafting bench.
---
Ah, ok. Thanks. I lost my healing factor by a radarch the other day :( but I was so radiated that it didn't do much, lol
---
I just started playing with ranged weapons and I didn't notice this problem before. I definitely struggled killing level 5 Radrats yesterday hahaha. Shit -\_-'' 
---
Couldn’t tell you. As far as I can tell the game doesn’t reveal bashing damage in any clear way.
---
I suppose it could be tested on another player at various DR values, but that’s the only way to get any meaningful data. 
---
Though next time I’m in whitesprings I’ll stab some ghouls to get a sense of how much it takes out of their health bar...
---
Maybe I’ll try full tests for this at some point. I’d also want to look at armor penetration on bashing. I’m confident that it’s a thing.
---
Because I have an anti armor minigun with +40% bash damage and it’s disgustingly powerful. I also have a nocturnal one with +40% bash damage and at night it’s crazy powerful too (seems stronger than during the day)
---
So it would seem either bashing has some correlation to the weapons true damage and is affected by perks and legendary bonuses... OR bash damage is an individual hidden value that also gets boosted by effects like nocturnal or anti armor on its own, separately from the guns bullet damage. 
---
I lean towards the latter since a shredder barrel minigun clearly is many times stronger than shooting bullets with it. 
---
The next questions I have are does stabilized influence this? And if so, is the same for tank killer on a handmade bayonet? How deep does the rabbit hole go?
---
Stopping myself now because this got way too long...  maybe the answer is in the data files but sadly I’m not on PC
---
I see what you did there
---
I personally think that each rank of locked crate should have a small chance to spawn an equal starred legendary. I'd actually bother picking safes that way
---
Also Cyberpunk. I get the feeling that game, while being good, it's going to be so overhyped that fan expectation is going to be near unattainable. 
---
Anyone know what build is good? Should I do sniper, shotgun, melee or like automatics?
---
Ya ft to camp is generally buggy as hell,I often times end up in water or the side of cliffs,I don’t understand why we just can’t have ft mats
---
This is joyful news indeed if that is the case.
---
Having Healing Factor gimped by this was doing my head in.
---
 Could you clarify if the bug with the Tesla rifle, which makes your enemies invulnerable, has been fixed? The bug was originally fixed and returned with 1.5. It should not be a big effort to fix that. At least nothing more than removing an armor effect. 
---
You bought it CD-keys, I presume. They sell questionably obtained keys.
---
Had a rifle build and it said 95% chance and it would miss when I first entered vats. Big oof
---
Love so many things here! Have to grind more challenges.
---
Based on lvl or Cap Stash ? Legit Question. Also if I Give my Mules all my caps and I leave my pvp toon broke how would they get caps from me?
---
Yeah I've played with a dude with a legendary serrated switch blade. He would kill you if you didn't stimpak due to the speed of attacks and bleed damage.
---
Oh, shit ! These skins are gonna make the wallets OPEN tonight
---
Yeah I think the vast majority are just ignorant of how the mechanics work, but I’m not going to discount someone by default.
---
Sounds very similar to the explosive bug that was patched out a while back
---
Well Ill see Appallachia next week
---
*cries in 5mb*
---
Yeah i think so too, i cant even imagine the report amounts if not 
---
It did regen. I tend not to one shot it at all.
---
There are no real rules but there are grey areas. You want to kill someone fair enough, but if you continue to bully someone for no reason other than to feel superior, then your crossing a line. Same goes for using insults. You want to kill someone fair enough, but don't insult them or talk shit. Try to be as decent of a human being as possible. 
---
Its because the shuffle is/was different so eventually the radios would fall out of sync and play different dongs.    Glad to see it been fixed
---
Finally an Excavator paint, right?
---
I actually got rid of healing factor because of this. May have to try it again
---
Ohh lol... still nice camp ;)
---
This is good news. I went through Wendigo cave with a constant danger message two days ago. Let’s just say I was on high alert.
---
Yeah if theres one issue that needs to be solved its enemies spawning INSIDE your locked down base. 
---
Any news on whether the vault tec workbench is fixed or not?
---
Wait your in the game?
---
Hahahaha please dont make laugh, i have high fever and whole body hurting . That was a good one 😂😂😂
---
It may, but the issue with the flamer is the ammo consumption/cost, not necessarily its damage output or durability.
---
I don’t have a problem with that if it means that system kicks in at -5000 caps or something egregious, but if I went -100 and lost everything I’m done with the game. Takes a few days to get to level 70, but months upon months to get the gear I need. Fuck all that
---
Someone also mentioned this could be abused to strip low level players of all their gear. A level 15 that just wanted to learn some plans could be defenseless after one fight where he’s just trying to figure out how he can stop flagging for PVP after taking over a workshop
---
You mad bro? 
---
I have the Blueprint saved but i Cant place it anywhere lol
---
I didn’t buy the game twice btw. 
---
I'll do that on your safety bubble server too.  Hewhohoards500lbsofjunkbutcrieswhensomeonedestroyshisbaseandmustuse5lbstorepairallofit. 
---
So many lovely bug fixes, and new content. Thanks so much Bethesda. Can't wait to get off work today so i can play!
---
Ugh I feel you on that one. Currently I'm camped out near an event location that spawns a couple high-level Colonel Gutsy bots and they like to sit 800,000,000 yards away pinging my base with lasers.
---
Maybe back off of the testosterone injections and your post history won't involve you having toxic arguments with everyone.
---
Ooohhh ok :)
---
4LC works. I have it and it will proc a full crit bar. The issue is that it doesn't have a fancy sound and animation to tell you it happened and you may just assume that it was normal crit progression rather than the perk. I know it's worked because on multiple occasions I have had a blank crit bar, taken one shot, and had my crit bar completely fill.
---
As a side note, I do wonder at the usefulness of these cards. With a high luck and crit savvy you can basically be close to filling a crit bar when 4lc procs. So how useful is it really. I have not done the math but I wonder if their is diminishing returns on having all the crit perks and that maybe the ranks are better spent elsewhere.
---
I agree- whatever underlying logic that prevents a simple 3x3 or even 2x3 CAMP from being easily replaced without "floating" needs to be addressed if you want to see the asinine floating houses go away.  Even I ended up going with a floating house (albeit, with metal stilts to try and give it some context), simply because I didn't want to worry about replacing it if I had to.
---
reduce max. special points to 10 and have 2 decks so u can spend 10 special points max. depending on your stats for non combat perks like crafting, weight management or bonus from foods or drinks etc. and for combat, like resistance, improved weapon damage and specific damage perks. 
---
I know a few!  Guess they are kinda pointless now though
---
I didn't take them off just keep happening hopefully it'll fix itself after the update 
---
Same, that explains a lot
---
The Appalachian radio station will be available too
---
Nope amazon on a deep discount deal they did before christmas.
---
I’m a hoarder of junk. I try to hit blackwater mine once a day and loot every single body I come across so I can have steel to make ammo. Uranium fever event helps me even more with that but now I can’t do that. I always walk out of there with my carry weight being way over. 1000+ 
---
Guess I’ll have to find some other way to stay stocked up on steel 
---
Any one who thinks people role playing as raiders need consent seriously misunderstand the game.
---
I fucking hate the internet these days. "Ughhhh you're using a in game system in a way I don't like, and interfering with how I want to personally experience the game"
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0nahb/mobs_should_not_spawn_inside_my_locked_rooms/
---
Lol I actually made another thread about this and some wit's genius solution was 'so stop playing'.
---
now your Excavator PA can look cool, and your T-51 can look like the Excavator PA!!
---
I can confirm. Had this happening yesterday, but i didn't realize it was due to my tesla rifle. I ran out of ammo and switched to 308. I was unable to deal any damage. 
---
Thunderfury, the Spiderman Thread of Azeroth
---
As a non pvper, once pacifist can carry over to your camp and you won't be able to destroy it because the owner of the camp isnt willing to participate in pvp, it should cut back on the salty reporting. I would assume anyway. 
---
And apparently a lot of people are still confused on pvp involving workshops. So until that is more clear cut I deffo see a lot of salty reporting coming from that. 
---
Yeah because the game didn't have any content at launch and this is the only content we have in the game. /s
---
I pick either clockwise or counter-clockwise and continue .. And The guard Shacks hahaha ?   I always end up hitting a Bot and then I have to deal with them I hate that .. But yeah Killed a 3\* Super Mutant last night at the guard shack .. So they should be included in your patrols.  Upvote!!
---
I just want to buy games, then play them.
---
I don't want to buy a game and wait six months to a year so it will be finished. Dlc used to be additional content, now if you want to unlock something in a game you need to buy it instead of playing it. It's so bad you see lootboxes on single player games. You can defend this game all you want, enjoy defending all the other games that will soon require customers do their own product testing after release because companies know they can get away with it.
---
I guess I will find out when I get off work because I use auto vats pistol for the critical hits. I lose about 400 DPS and the ability to kill sentinel users if this in regards to holding the trigger down after activation.
---
You do get a notice but you don't always see it and depending on what they are using to destroy your camp they can do considerable damage before you even notice it.
---
Not bad idea. Will do that and let others know if it really is broken and hopefully devs will eventually fix it so others won't have to deal with that same issue. 
---
And in Skyrim they added a "Legendary" prestige system where you could reset your lockpick or one-handed back to zero and start over again to gain more levels.  It gave you a reason to keep doing the mundane things long after you normally would have gotten bored.
---
I really liked the Skyrim system (at the end, after they patched it a few times) and was hoping they would incorporate that somehow.
---
Now that just deserves a gibbs slap right up the head, wheres the fun in building a castle if you don't get to enjoy the ensuing tower defense? 
---
I agree, there's going to be a lot more reporting. However I disagree with one thing. 
---
Harassment is not very broad. If you use derogatory language, based on race, gender, sexual identity, then you have crossed over into harassment. Gay isn't a swear word. Broad isn't a swear word. But they are all words used to hurt and degrade someone. 
---
If a person can't find a way to be a raider, a nomad, a crazy person, or whatever, without using words that are used to degrade someone, based on something you don't even know is true about the person, then you deserve to get reported. 
---
Yeah read that this morning. I'm glad this occurence won't happen anymore.
---
The reporting system is not an automated system. Reports will be looked into and evaluated by our Customer Support team.
---
Or you know, they could stop PVPing until they have the caps to cover it.
---
I've heard people say that, and my mouse is about 5 years old, but it does not exhibit this random pop-up behavior in any other game I use with the mouse wheel. I guess I can buy a new one to see. Thanks.
---
I wish I could unassociate the wheel with the quick menu.
---
Erm, what? “If you claimed and left nobody could claim it from you”
---
What the fuck are you going on about? You don’t NEED to kill someone to capture a workshop if they’re NOT AT THE WORKSHOP.
---
If they’re not at the workshop like we was, then it shouldn’t be contested, and should be captured by said person claiming it (which IS what happens) only during this phase, you shouldn’t be able to fast travel away from the workshop and kill said player just because you’re capturing a work shop that neither player is currently at to contest.
---
At no point are you restricted from “claiming” the workshop. So how is it “necessary to kill you across the map”?
---
I’ll wait.
---
It often amuses me when I find a gatling laser in a small wall safe, how did it fit in their? I think the loot tables could be tied to safe size.  I am also amused when I unlock a level 3 explosive box and find an empty nuka-bottle (though that doesn't bother me as I could see a raider leaving it behind to troll)  
---
Small safes (wall) could have things like tech documents, money, rare plans, small crafting mats (ballistic fiber etc)  
---
Medium (floor) could have outfits, money,  plans, mods, larger junk items, smaller weapons (have a chance at all other smaller type loot pools)
---
Large (actual safe, boxes) follow box type (explosive = grenades/missile etc) weapons, larger ammo (missiles, cores, mini nuke), rarer mods, larger/rarer junk, rarer plans (have a chance at all other smaller type loot pools)  
---
Oh well. 
---
With the changes to Flux, can you also consider reducing the weight of Stable Flux from 1.0lb to something less?
---
That’s awesome man. Appreciate you taking the time for the greater good!
---
Jesus man who pissed in your Cheerios?
---
I got 8 levels in one run from 75ish onward before. Was nuts. Most of my xp between 40 and 100 was all from whitesprings. 
---
Is there any update on what patch the suspended players will be integrated back into the game? 
---
When using melee at lv2 I never saw it proc. Not once. Since then I ranked it to lv3 , still didn’t see it work so just unequipped it. I really like lucky break and wanted them both at lv2 cuz lucky break works all the time.
---
There was no mention of it in today's patch. I would just recommend keeping on reddit, because once people do unsuspended I would imagine everyone will be talking about it. 
---
I agree it's a failure of communication but I also wonder how much the community managers are in the loop BEFORE a change is made.  
---
Let’s hope they actually drop 2 and 3 star legendaries when they’re supposed to, as well. So tired of getting 1 star legendary items.
---
Fucking garbage...
---
FREAKING CLEAN OVEN!!!! WOOOT!!!
---
Yes, the reporting system is not an automated system. Reports will be looked into and evaluated by our Customer Support team.
---
Or they could make perk choices permanent trolol. You didnt get to trade out a weapon skill for 5 seconds to pick a lock in the past games. Just be glad you can in this one. 
---
Of all the shit wrong with the game this is a non issue
---
Well, it's not your game. You paid for a license to play *their* game as long as you behave. You didn't behave, so now you can't play. Simple.
---
Personally, I'd like to see some kind of combat dummy that we could place in our CAMP that would say how much damage we do to it, sort of like the firing range in Marcus has in Borderlands 2.
---
You’re irrelevant bro?
---
Haha, I have a portopotty outside my camp that says "Sit, shit, or get"
---
Yours isn't remotely offensive. 
---
Oh I wouldn’t either. I’ve got another account that I share gent gold and games with and could log in with that. 👍🏼
---
Well aren't you edgy and funny. Its not like their grandmother couldve died. You're a comedic genius.
---
Still no solution for the -50% weapons damage  bug it seems :(  last answer from bethesday was on friday.  Sent a reminder yesterday but no news yet :(
---
This is the issue. I've been farming acid for days ready for 1 lucky hole run lol.
---
Stop thinking out loud. 
---
Shouldn't have sold duped Nuka Cola.
---
Like you said there are no rules. Everything goes. They made "block for session" for a reason. If you feel builled, leave the server join a new one. Its a pvp game people, if you dont want to die from another player do not play fallout 76 lol. Go back to fallout 4.
---
Yeah it's the future but it is different timeline that's effectively stuck in the 1950's culturally. Just turn off the radio in the audio settings if you don't like it.
---
In other words Play while Encumbered.
---
Slocum’s Joe...
---
...
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I think that some people misused stacking foundations to make certain thing inaccessible to other players.  In particular, I've seen the workshop bench walled off behind stacked foundations before.  
---
some people might not know about workshops or pacifist but it is definitely possible to knock someone down in one shot
---
I’m on the train bridge on the hill near Charlestown (I think) and every time it dumps me under the bridge and I have to run up the hill 
---
I'd be happy with a floating combat text option to see the actual end-calculated damage I'm causing.
---
There is a mod on Nexus that shows you your targets actual hp values and you could do the math to find out; but it hasn't been updated in 2-3 patches now.
---
I do agree with you that there are assholes out there that do bully. I stop at that point im not lik that. BUT its a part of the game regardless. 
---
i still have this issue. do you think todays patch will fix it? let me know if it does, i wont be able to try it out until later tonight :/ 
---
Oh shoot they have been up for a while but no one here was gonna tell you we all made a deal. 
---
Simple fix: Don't make it possible to get *all* of the perks. If you pick card X, you *lose* the chance to pick card Y. Not "you didn't pick it this time, so you can pick it next level" or "you didn't pick it this time, but it might show up in a perk pack!" but "you didn't pick it this time, so you're locked into this character path".
---
Yeah, it would definitely frustrate people. Especially the min-maxers. But I'd rather have to actually put some thought into my pick and plan out a build path than have the ability to be pretty damn near anything and everything once I get to a certain level. FO4 was kind of frustrating for me in that the *only* restriction to getting perks was based on how much time I wanted to invest. If I played long enough, I could take *all* the perks and basically be a Wasteland God.
---
You knew they were duped. 
---
"I never made the cocaine, I got from a dude, and sold it... so I'm not guilty!"
---
Or they realized Bethesda isn't gonna respond. I know I'm still pissed that the game was unplayable for me for months and they wouldn't give me a refund. I had to upgrade to Win10 just to get the dmn thing to play so I could play with friends. Only thing really keeping me playing now.
---
Are we there yet?!
---
That is an amazing idea! Either a CAMP buildable firing range or one in world!
---
Bethesda.
---
Then they had the gall to ask for feedback so they could know wether or not to nerf the piss. Then they nerfed the Cheerios instead.
---
You made me spit drink out my nose. 
---
Gauss Rifles are categorized as Energy Weapons at the Weapons Workbench... does this mean a 10% damage buff and less repairs?
---
That would be awesome.
---
Did you look into it?
---
It sucks, but I completely understand why they did it. Foundations are indestructible, so people were exploiting this mechanic to create unbreakable bunkers that defeat the purpose of mobs attacking camp, and would also make them unkillable in PvP.
---
That’s all games on console. They download the patch to a separate place then “copy” it onto the game file, basically rewriting the file. The length it takes to finish applying depends on how big the game file was originally. Since Zenimax games are massive it takes exceptionally long.
---
I have never seen it sell so low on Amazon, but maybe you caught a lucky sale, DURING CHRISTMAS, which does not mean the game is being "given away for free". Check now, it sells full price or close. Everything is discounted on Christmas, that's the whole idea of Christmas.
---
Also, Bethesda has already said that all future content for 76 will be free, so they were never planning to sell expansions anyway. That, and Bethesda confirmed on Twitter that it won't go F2P, when these kind Youtubers spread the f2p rumors and people spammed Beth with the question.
---
well if you're consistently bothering people who don't want to be bothered then that would probably be considered harassment I would think. I get that you're having a good time but if you're ruining the game for someone else that's kind of a shity thing to do.
---
Are they up or are you trolling 
---
Whoa there, put that edge down before you cut yourself. 
---
A compulsion just like checking bathroom stalls
---
I could see them doing either option. But I'm leaning towards old bases are grandfathered in
---
This mostly looks nice. The only thing I dislike is the change to flux. Instead of selling Raw Flux you can't use, you now might as well just drop it. What was the point of this change?
---
Looks better! The original had some shots that were a bit washed out 
---
man, that's some fun stuff! However, once there was a fez in the datamined stuff, a long time ago. I'm guessing it never made it into game. =(
---
Sure, a lot of crybabies... but why are the "crybabies" worse than the dudes that literally follow people for hours, lobbing grenades and slapping the shit out of players supposed to be treated better? Players that literally spend their sessions making sure OTHER Players don't enjoy their sessions are far worse.
---
I am officially moving due to this patch. I can't wait!!
---
Right?  I would actually *enjoy* the thrill of crouching in the other side of my locked door with sledge at the ready while they try to break it down!  That would actually be cool, not this cheap ass 'oops, I'll just spawn 89745798 ghouls inside your house and skip all that immersion nonsense'.
---
And don't get me started on the Molerat Education Initiative (Roofs are not dirt, you cheating little monsters)
---
I am messing around. This place gets absolutely flooded when they get back up. It will be obvious. Other than that no one knows when.
---
First part of Wild Appalachia is adding alcohol distillation and brewing. 
---
Most pathetic. I wouldn't get these even if they were for free.
---
Lol they did change patch notes to make it so you didn’t have to click a on the workshop to capture or contest since people where hiding it under concrete. But what didn’t change and has been the same SINCE LAUNCH is that when the workshop is contested meaning i go to a workshop hit select an pay caps, the former owner is flagged for me, meaning i can shot and kill them, regardless if they are there or half way across the map. 
---
There’s a reason every one of your comments here are getting down voted. You assumed shit and are wrong. 
---
you can, twisted muscles, adrenal whatever, chems, stealth, I mean so many ways to boost your damage in a Fallout game, you can deal over 10000 damage in one shot, and not even with only melee
---
But screens before bed are said to be a bad idea for restful sleep!
---
Ohh okay thanks!
---
If you were bored after the first play through no. I’ve been on one character and had plenty of fun. 99% of the fun is helping others enjoy their play through and interacting with the community. If you did you and beat feet then you probably won’t enjoy a second go any more. There is so much more to this game than just running the very short story line.
---
This includes Deep Pocketed Plans as well, right?
---
It seems like half the time I spend 10 minutes escorting him around and he just gets stuck somewhere. It probably has to do with the way they designed it, he doesn’t even seem to know where he’s going half the time. 
---
BGS Please fix this event or give us a new one that’s actually enjoyable.
---
Fair enough. It's just tedious having to cycle threw a metric tonne of cards just to pick a lock then do it again to re equip basic cards so my gun and armor doesn't break every 5 seconds
---
That’s my plan right now
---
I had three three stars drop zero legendaries in like an hour last week
---
I do miss the permanent boost from finding a magazine or bobblehead and am not a huge fan of there being multiple bobbleheads and magazines to be found. Make them *only* findable once per character and let us have the permanent boost from finding it. I don't even use the damn things now, so they're just clutter in my stash.
---
It's such a bummer we can't have bobblehead displays or magazine racks in our camps too. There's just *no* trophy displays possible and it rather sucks.
---
That's your PC's problem. Do you expect to play Fallout New Vegas on Windows 95? How is Bethesda to blame for you having an old OS?
---
Agree with this.  I'm a shotgunner and the shells are too much.  It forces me to use a melee weapon unless fighting a mob to conserve ammo and i'm not perked for that build so its always out of balance.
---
I've held onto the flames and dual bar mods in hope this happens.
---
Fixed vats and working radium silencer make me happy. Worth waiting for the huge patch to download. Little bothered they have yet to add credit sinks to the game. More caps have to leave the game each day then enter, this needs to be fixed. Caps have already lost most if their value. The longer they take to fix it, the longer it will take to right the economy. 
---
"Powering up" are events that pop up at the various power plants.  "Powering up Poseidon", "Powering up Thunder Mtn", etc.  If they aren't active on the map, they usually pop up if you fast travel there.
---
Rewards include various plans for generators, including the coveted Fusion Generator.  Rewards are random so it might take a few tries but you'll get it eventually.
---
I always feel I see a big uptick in many of the kind of posts listed in the comments as we get closer to a patch day. it's like some people want to make out like the game is horrible after all this time. 
---
Overseers quests give basic CAMP buildings plans / materials and food/drink. 
---
TIL, Thanks 
---
deep pocketed combat limbs plan dropped for me yesterday, dunno if you can get it from scrapping?
---
Let’s just say it’s somewhere in between. 😂 
---
I made an outdoor concert venue
---
They usually wait until we get about 30 of these posts  ;)
---
I actually didn’t pay for the game, it came with my Xbox, I just *care enough* to want to play another Bethesda game, read the patch notes, keep up to date on reddit, etc. If you want your community to get *smaller* I’d keep that attitude you have!
---
&gt;Yeah slap damage isn’t broken.
---
tf it isn't, you can deal over 10000 damage in one shot in this game, also slap damage shouldn't even be a thing, just make pacifist so you deal *and* take no damage, and you have to come out of passive to claim a workshop (or have it happen automatically with a warning screen)
---
Were talking new players here. They're allowed to not know every single game mechanic
---
people fiending to play
---
This and camp radios!
---
I appreciate that and I hope it works as intended. That said, last time I had a customer service issue I think I waited a week with no reply before I aired the dirty laundry on this sub. Only then was my ticket escalated. I'm hoping the current system will be much more efficient. I think you can understand my cautious optimism
---
The yellow-green variant its pretty disguisting, but still needed for the carry weight.
---
oh yeah you are completely right, i hadn't noticed it until i added in the names of the items :P
---
Thats what i get when i batch make the pictures and dont actually look at them myself ;)
---
Well everything is marked with the correct ingame filenames now so it should be easier to navigate (hopefully)
---
&gt; toxic piss puddles
---
God I hope this is a new drink in this patch.
---
ammo is a grind to me..i buy mine off the market subs
---
Yes.
---
Also why should Bethesda respond to "Shit game glad i never bought it haha keep the servers offline lulul"?
---
Is it possible to get a non PVP game as well for those of us who never have any intention of attacking other players and I'm sick of being harassed. Honestly the PVP elements are the worst part of the game as far as I'm concerned and have at times ruined the experience for me. I enjoy playing against the environment and interacting with other players but there are always some jerks out there who just use PVP to annoy people and have fun at other people's expense.
---
This is what's so annoying about your account name being displayed to other people instead of the name you gave your character. My first toon was named "Gary."
---
How much you want to bet Bethesda left PvP as a way I bypass this. Get killed drop the 5k junk in bag from being killed and then spread it out. Knowing Bethesda I'm sure it can still have things taken off the mule.
---
I don’t think me and a few other people having max caps was the issue, the server stability of people making weapons in ludicrous numbers was, my save file is 100% legit except for my caps, which you have to admit are a pain to acquire through normal gameplay
---
About now it seems
---
haven’t encountered that glitch yet. also gets stuck down the toad from mega Red Rocket. 
---
Hahahahahha.  Ur going to stayed banned my dude.  And thank you BES.  
---
My understanding is that people were using them to clip into areas players weren't meant to access.
---
Maintenance just ended! You should be able to log back in once you've downloaded today's update.
---
I like the all black one, very Stealth!
---
My charicter was an atlantian. A mer man. Vacationing in new gad lake.
---
He has mutated into a man-man and lost his aquatic abilities once the bombs dropped. 
---
He was once a merman but is now a man man. 
---
Santa beard/ mantaman outfit/ sea captiains hat
---
You can run in normal armor but the rad resistance on gear is non existing in zones. I've tested this with full trapper gear some with rad resistance, after all the chems and perks the difference between been in a full set and naked is about 4 rads, it holds steady at around 11 rads with rad shield, then as mentioned rad sponge with a few members let's you run around for as long as you have chems to keep up the resistance. 
---
This is their bulldozer solution
---
But to answer your question they are back to right now.
---
I see a couple people already saying they shouldn’t be unvaulted so let me say this. Limited time skins/items/etc are stupid and pointless. I’ve got World of Warcraft items older than a lot of the people on this subreddit that you can’t get anymore and haven’t been able to for years. I used to think these items made me King Shit and that everyone in the community would have to envy me for having them. 
---
Then I grew up. Nobody cares. Nobody gives a shit about an exclusive item beyond the fact they don’t have it. People aren’t going to look at your mosaic floor tiles or blackbird skin and think “Wow, this guy is so lucky and cool”. They’re going to think “I hate I missed out and that *I* don’t have it”. 
---
Unvaulting them isn’t going to have an effect on how you’re perceived because people *already don’t care about you*. The only reason to be against unvaulting items is because you’re a conceited douche bag that incorrectly believes these items makes you special and worth recognizing. They don’t. Eventually this game is going to fall out (ha) of popularity. People are going to move on. You’re going to be left sitting in your CAMP alone with your limited time clock in one hand your dingaling in the other. It’s always better to be inclusive than exclusive because at least then everyone can enjoy everything together. That’s what a game like this is supposed to be about.
---
Beat me to it haha see you in there
---
It automatically happens when you go to place your camp items over things up t ok a certain size. You'll see the items, logs and smaller cars and such, disappear when you go to build something on them.
---
That's what I immediately first thought!
---
Didn't defeat the purpose of mobs attacking camps, as mobs will just spawn inside them.  Mobs don't have to follow the rules like we lowly players do!
---
You can sit here being a sarcasm sponge, monitor [https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status), or keep trying to log in until you get in. The second two generally have better results than the first.
---
It's multiplayer co-op, nothing more. Missing one key factor in the definition of MMO...Massive(ly). 24 is not massive.
---
Only i don’t give a fuck about downvotes nor am i here for fucking karma, i’m here to report on a blatant exploit on the game, BLATANT exploit.
---
“You assumed shit and are wrong” right back at ya.
---
Yuppers
---
Note that the download is 17gb, but you'll need close to 50gb available because the game has to uncompress the files and keep the original versions as backup until the install has completed.
---
Not in this patch, but they've mentioned they're working on a fix.
---
I’ve already done everything in the game, if I can’t play it’s no issue, I just like the social platform of meeting people with similar interests, have fun farming flux for the 83rd time this week though!
---
They're not a "pain to acquire"... they're a game mechanic, designed to maintain an in-game economy... .
---
and in-game economy that gets *fucked* by impatient gamers that cheat.
---
Duping is cheating. Caps, colas, weapons… all the same shit.
---
May I ask why builder you're using for your bar? I want to and a bar too, I've been collecting caps to purchase plans.
---
Mr flyboy, please tell me you're joking
---
Yeah for Excavator and Ultracite PA paints finally coming. 
---
Those Trapper outfits look awesome. I assume they drop with the cryptid DLC.
---
Nice to finally see some stuff I can use my points on.
---
Yeah.....
---
PvE players have a reputation for screaming at their TV and throwing remote controls across the room. Probably the first thought of a GameStop employee when he sees someone buying a new controller....... definitely and RPG player.
---
Nothing is molerat proof. Molerats are magic. They can wormhole through *anything*.
---
Nowadays, you'd get bonus points if you knew what a Mervyn's was.
---
Yoooooo..........wow.
---
[This looks so bad-ass](https://i.imgur.com/7qiJymj.png)
---
I actual like the stickered up pipboy skin.  I'll probably pick that up.
---
I'm definitely getting the inlaid lever gun and the super mutant sledge skins.  I'm not sure if I like the shiny AK look.
---
I like what they were going for with the bloodied up combat armor, but it just doesn't look good.
---
Forgive me if this is a dumb question, but doesn’t the whole no NPCs directly conflict with VTU students are hosting a party thing? It seems like you need some serious cognitive dissonance and suspension of disbelief to play a lot of the new expansions in this game no? It’s just hard to get excited for all this new stuff when at the end of the day it’ll be empty. But I hope the expansions prove me wrong.
---
Well maybe it's a gameplay mechanic. If stealth effects a enemies ability to see players that would make sense. However if scorchbeasts which are mutated bats use echolocation to see then stealth that affects light reflection would not affect the sonar. It kind of makes sense to me that they would do it like that that way stealth isn't some magic bullet.
---
Login failed on ps4 for me 😐
---
Grumble grumble stupid work grumble grumble
---
Me too. Now my friends will probably stop telling to wear another power armor. Lol
---
Ya well 🤷 thought he might know something about the Raider suit rumour I've heard about, since it's a Raider AMA thread. But no, he don't know shit. Really don't see how that could lead to him scamming me though 🙄
---
Those would definitely be good changes to implement, but slap damage is negligible enough to stim and go away if you don’t want to fight
---
Lol true that
---
1400 a day + whatever you can scrounge up sounds like poverty to me, in other BGS games you could set your character up in a way to get rich fast, in 76 everybody slowly gets poorer as the C.A.M.P. costs increase and mods from vendors become more important
---
The grass thing alone is such a massive improvement for me that I almost jumped out my window when I read it. No more having the almost perfect spot except for that *one piece of fucking grass poking through the floor*.
---
I can place my camp in so many more places now and be satisfied with it.
---
I am going to put 60 radios around my CAMP. RIP peace and quiet north of the motel in Flatwoods.
---
Go find mole miners they are great with shotgun shells.
---
Oh god, no! Not the Whitesprings Carpet everywhere! That stuff gives me an instant migraine
---
If I could go back in time I'd never even select a lock pick card.......but of course I'll get 40 of them every time I get a card pack.
---
Right?! Love those outfits. 
---
I've been hoping for a Jackie Kennedy type outfit and that green ensemble will work nicely. The tied off red shirt outfit is pretty great, too.
---
Marsupial is a must, I couldn’t live without it, With it I can get to cap stashes I couldn’t reach before and bounce straight back out of the annoying trenches in cranberry bog I’m always falling into lol. I also use adrenal reaction, scaley skin, speed demon and chameleon.
---
Wow, looks like Bethesda really is in for the long haul here, think I will have to reinstall!
---
you can manual check and download the client update for the last couple hrs. my guess is on pc too. you can actually boot the game now and go to atom shop, new west virginia pa skin is looking good. just cant join world until server mantainence is done.
---
My budget is about 5% open now. I did not have turrets. I have 11/50 lights placed. Both turrets and light budget size seems cut in half.
---
He said grinding in this game got rid of his Grandmas cancer. Believe it or not, he wasn't being serious, and neither was I.
---
Sure thing- no worries. Glad you’ll be able to make use of the flux, and it’s nice having those 10 lbs free in my stash again- I always seem maxed out.  Enjoy the calibrated shocks :)
---
I PvP a lot, and players giving all their caps to a friend so they don't lose anything when I kill them is worse than having a team of non-hostile spotters.  Also I think I've fought you before.
---
And painted brick walls
---
Ehh. Conan Exiles has set the bar for massive updates. Anything better than that game, for me, is "still not as bad".
---
However... 53GB, if that is what this turns out to be... is about 110 hours of uninterrupted download, assuming the XBone is the ONLY thing in the house using bandwidth.
---
*sigh*.
---
Oh well, fingers crossed there's no "Day 1" Division 2 updates, at least I can play something this weekend.
---
When will I be unbanned? Been months now no updated ticket? I just want to play my Skyrim game I got for Christmas you bums!

Is the Bull items being scrapped from inventory issue fixed in this patch?
---
thanks
---
Prize is in pre-war money.
---
AFAIK, you can't. Some mods are plans only, but some plans fell off the vendor list like BOS lining on combat armor. Deep pockets are still purchasable AFAIK
---
*Some interesting camp objects at 29 seconds into the video.*  
---
Looks like vending shit to me!
---
HECK YE
---
I thought this was a Feature, not a Bug?
---
I eventually resolved this problem, but only by upgrading my hardware.  :-/
---
it really pissed me off in FO4 where you were supposed to build up defenses for settlements, so i made walls and gates and kill chutes as the only way to get into the the settlement with traps everywhere...
---
but then the enemies just magically appear INSIDE your settlement.
---
so what was the @#$@$#@ point of building up defenses????
---
People are still playing this game?
---
You will find a severe difficulty spike around level 25. Be prepared to grind. Also manage your stash and carry weight. It will be the death of you.
---
but it's the most ridiculous thing that makes zero sense and was slapped together last minute when the community freaked out about griefing...  there are better alternatives, like why defend this ridiculous system when those that don't want to PvP shouldn't have to, not to mention with slap damage no one can be a raider like they said at E3
---
I really don’t need to see 700 Alex’s or Braykayden’s running around so no thanks.
---
Legendary mobs always dropping a legendary loot is really nice to see. All the CAMP tweaks too. BUT most of all the fixes to stealth and the eternal Caution stuff!  It has been a long time... so thanks for that.
---
For the love, how about Multiplayer RPG with MMO tendencies.  Can we all agree to stop typing now....
---
"Sounds like poverty".
---
Geezuz man, it's a game. Is this your job? 
---
Look, duping and exploiting fucks the game for everyone else that doesn't. Period. You sold duped items. That's it. That's the end of it. You cheated and got busted for it.
---
I spawn in then have to twiddle my thumbs waiting while my camp rebuilds itself. Eventually.
---
Guess ur not happy about it
---
Mutual PvP doesn't trigger a bounty if your camp is destroyed in the process AFAIK. Also, I never said you would lose items from your inventory. I said you would get thrown into a "you suck" loot pool for quests/events. Like you would get a notification that basically says you got x legendary item unfortunately due to negative cap bounty it was sold to x vendor and x amount of caps have been removed from your debt. Giving you time to do other events/trades and maybe buy back the item from that vendor after you are back in the green.
---
If you have an idea of what kind of build you're going for, you can use this site to see all the perk cards, mock up your build, and get a road map of suggested perks to choose at each level.  
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Note that this site contains some minor spoilers by revealing all the available perk cards, so if you want to go in completely blind I'd avoid looking.
---
I have to be in power armor when I log out at my camp or fast travel there bc it clips me into the mountainside and I infinitely fall until it brings me round full circle and I die from fall damage. Lol.
---
alot of these are not in the atom shop yet, but there is a new west virginia PA skin that has a kool rasta bibe to it.
---
along with the blue/red excavator I can see some transformers RP! LOL
---
What is your malfunction coming to this subreddit if you don't play or enjoy the game? How many subreddits do you do this to? Are you posting in Barbie's Horse Adventures' subreddit?
---
Very clever! Thanks for sharing
---
Triggered
---
Point taken. Counterpoint: I have a catapult that launches 8 miniature nukes. What's realism?
---
And now you’ll never be able to spawn in and keep it.
---
I love how dramatic she’s becoming.
---
I just want to play the game again take my caps or whatever, Bethesda is shooting themselves in the foot by abandoning fans of the sandbox genre
---
Super mutants, assemble!
---
lol and afaik mods don't work on consoles. I am XB1 now

Thanks for sharing.

FANTASTIC! Thanks for posting! :D

You’re taking this 200% more serious than I am btw dude, it’s a yes or no question can I play or not
---
/r/fo76CWG is the sub I just created for it. It's currently private as I have a lot of stuff to figure out.
---
My post about bloodied build and the workshop PvP exploit is a brilliant example of this.
---
Are you using mods or a custom ini?
---
No problem and enjoy the wasteland
---
hi, you can move your actual CAMP machine to a different place within your CAMP once its been placed, (it wont move your whole camp)
---
the placement of the CAMP machine within your camp determines where you will spawn into your camp at
---
so, pick up the CAMP machine, move it around your camp and test it by fast traveling to your camp until you find a spot for it that places you in a good spot
---
hope that helps!!
---
Same here. I was able to FT to Vault 76, but has soon as I head south it starts dropping me through the map.
---
Where was your camp?
---
Does any one else smell burning pants?
---
that sounds really cool
---
Harrassment and offensive language are two separate option in reporting according to patch notes. So I totally agree with the offensive language option. However that leaves harassment open to interpretation
---
same here :(
---
Thanks! You too! :D
---
Right. Oddly many of us have played the game since beta. News flash FO3, FONV, FO4, all had/have bugs. ESO was a freaking mess at launch. 
---
This isn't new.
---
Just the Power Armor HUD mod.
---
I would file a Bethesda ticket.  Then,  while you wait,  uninstall and reinstall the game.
---
Kew this argument was coming. At least that is somewhat realistic for the Fallout universe. Having some mule just stand around with all your cool gear you found makes zero sense. People just want it and justify it because they don't want to adhere to a restriction on their inventory.
---
 I am excited about the new update! 
---
It will be interesting to see how things play out here, with the new ingame balances and new content. 
---
I am not to sure what to expect with the new PVP system in a Wild Appalachia, I have had nothing good come from any form PVP at this point. I find after various character changes via perc cards, and mutations, armor and weapons changes, at level 236 my character still gets killed in one Shot or swipe, from players well below my level, levels 35 - 56, not sure what I am doing wrong here? I never intentionally attacking anyone only defending myself  from  the continuous griefing in game a late, I  feel I have become an easy target for free scrap! I am being stocked on a regular basis only to turn the game off and try back later! Not fun to say the least, kind  of  feel like I getting punished,  I would love to be able to at least fight an even fight, just once! 
---
 I  wish everyone the best, special thanks to all the efforts from the community and team at Bethesda for your continued Support and work to make Fallout76 the best game possible.
---
I think you’re purposefully trying not to understand the meaning of OP post. Just cause you don’t PvP doesn’t mean you have to be a dick to people who do. This game was sold to people who are PvP minded aswell and included PvP features from the start.
---
We’re trying to improve the system as I’m sure you’d want for PvE. Or have you never suggested any improvements to the PvE system before? Smh you’re a hater dude gtfoh.
---
I wasn’t level 50 until a few days before the update that banned me, duplicating weapons/flux wouldn’t really help me
---
Engaging in PVP is meant to have risk. If a new player just jumps right into PVPing everything they see, they deserve to learn that PVP has consequences. It takes effort to rack up large cap bounties. The game tells them it is happening when they do. A new player could throw themselves at a legendary mirelurk queen and die too, but that doesn't mean mirelurk queens should be nerfed, it means the noob learns not to do that.
---
Doesn't apply to the people caught duping those accounts are still banned.  Nor the people that still dupe (they are forced already to stay under the 1500lb limit).  It would effect people that run stores, or had mules, or bought supplies cheap for future use (and put on a mule), or people that duped before but not the extent that they got caught.  Playing on the characters is not an option either, they said items could not be consumed, those people on those accounts will need to destroy items until so they can get down in weight enough to eat and drink.  I don't think anyone knows how many people cheated enough to get massive weights but not get caught.  In case I bet at least half of people targeted are legitimate players.  The other actions they took were pretty legitimate but I think this one was a bad idea.
---
Same problem here.
---
happy cake day!
---
Hey, I too am looking for a cool group to join, and am on PC. Is it cool if I come and check out your discord?
---
It helped him cope with it. You clearly haven't been in his shoes before.
---
No argument here about racist loudmouths and ima kill your mom'rs. It's the "o no I got killed lemme report them" types. I have countless msgs of those already.
---
Every build is good if you spec into it.
---
Even if they have to destroy some, they still have 1700 lbs of duped goodies to sell. They don’t need a million pounds at any given time anyways, they can just dupe as it goes and raking in all the cash. If this ‘measure’ unbans the dupers, I feel happy for them and their business 🤑
---
Its your custom INI.  They have changed some of the texture load requirements (you can tell because the atom shop has blanks again).  I don't know what the custom load order is yet, but just remove your custom.ini for a quick fix until mods are updated.
---
These all look like positive changes, I am excited to see the vats changes. I'm curious when a re-join server/world option is going to be implemented. I am tired of taking workshops, building them up, just to DC right after and join another world that someone else claimed the same workshop. It's honestly a waste of junk, and a waste of time. In fact I have just started taking these workshops for xp only, and usually only build a stash and maybe one workbench for scrapping and move on. Last week I took poseiden and monongah power plants 2 separate times, took the workbench outside, built it up for passing travelers, then immediately lost connection to server, just to rejoin another server that had the power plant down with unclaimed workshops. Honestly just feels like a waste of time. I now only see low level players doing the event for the generator plans and it is a real shame because the idea behind the power plants is really good imo. Just some feedback, I'm not trying to be negative, but the game does suffer greatly not having that options for solo players. All that being said, I am excited to see what wild Appalachia has to offer!!
---
Hi! What platform are you attempting to play on? If PC, do you happen to be running any mods? Does disabling them help resolve this?
---
Did you look at the front page at all? Posters. At train stations, etc. You can also get the plan in the atom store.
---
It was there in the stress test, don't know why they removed it
---
Shit sorry. Missed that
---
Bout fucking time
---
Holy shit, weapon skins!
---
I thought Bethesda forgot about them. You know, the part of your character you actually look at for hours at a time.
---
&gt;Has this new "destroy" function really helped? 
---
The feature they JUST added?  Probably need a bit of time to see how helpful it is...
---
Reference this post, you need to update your Fallout76Custom.ini
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124?tab=posts
---
Remove your custom.ini for now.  It's the ba2 load list that has changed.  Until we find out the new order you will need to remove it.  Verified it works for me.
---
Between this and perk loadouts its crazy it hasn't been addressed. These are like two of the bigger issues we all talked about during the first week or two. Bethesda even chimed in on them early on but here we are...
---
If you read my original comment you'll see I specifically talk about them getting griefed, not wilfully engaging in pvp
---
hits rhe bots! ha i got put in time out yesterday for a little slap. It was a nuke zone and everyone is cleaning up and i had to leave because the bots dont like me hahahaha.
---
Lmao
---
I did a little happy dance. It was Nice.
---
By your definition RuneScape is not even an MMO anymore.
---
You need free space for:
---
1. the download itself, 
---
2. the uncompress download/installer
---
3. the space to copy the exisitng (working) installation (for restore in case the update fails)
---
4. Overhead for the uncompress engine and the OS itself.
---
Once the update is installed and verified, the backup copy is deleted, the download is deleted (I think), the temp files are deleted, then all the space space is released back to the system.
---
A stelth buff
---
Still gonna end up with all the three and two star enemies only dropping one star leggos. I genuinely can't remember I found a three star enemy and it actually drop a three star item.
---
Use the plain 'Bookcase' (or 'Bookshelf, can't remember which) the one that is about waist height and as plain as you can get. 
---
Flip these around and line them up together, they overlap slightly so it's not too fiddly. I recommend making sure you've lined them up and then blueprinting. You can also try throwing a desk into the mix for a cashier area of you prefer. One of the wooden ornate desks which doubles as a stash works well.
---
I have a brick wall behind the bar with a few of the atom shop beer/drink signs.
---
There are many options for seating, I chose the red cushioned stools from the 'Bar Stools' plan.
---
Have fun!
---
Lol.  Im moved on man.  Havnt played in about a month.  Div2 dropped.  Prob wont ever load game back up again.
---
Lol dude be prepared for some salty people to comment on this
---
Same here.
---
10/10
---
Are the mirelurks your brethren?
---
I wouldn't start with spending money (unless you have plenty to spare), but that's an option.  If other games have similar settings that aren't affected, that's certainly a differing indication.
---
(My mouse is *way* over 5 years old, so I'm certain that the wheel is my issue, but I have few of the issues that a lot of people *do* have, so I am not the keystone for figuring this stuff out)
---
Not sure there's a patch/DLC for that...
---
Any news on updating the amount of flamer ammo created? It seems like its off by a factor of 10 when compared to the ammo of all other guns. Especially based on the resources needed, and how quickly you go through it/damage output
---
I’ve never had that happen or heard of that happening. I know the post you’re talking about, it’s fake news to the bone.
---
The last RPG i played was ESO. I LIVED in cyrodil (pvp zone). 
---
The biggest problem i had was that the game would rebalance every 3 to 4 months. 
---
Thats fine... Except it FORCED me to go out of Cyrodil,  join PvE dungeon groups for gear. 
---
And if you didnt run a "meta" pve  raiding build/position. Boy did other players let you know you "werent doing it right".  Kick you from the group, rage at you...
---
I left because it was too much trouble to maintain. Switching builds and spending half my time in PvE just to get the stuff i needed for PvP... Only to have the game rebalanced after i spent so much time dealing with the arrogant pve crowd. 
---
I wasnt about to farm meta pve stuff ao i could be in a group to get the pvp stuff i wanted. I wasnt a slob either. No one had to "carry me" they just had to share in on CC and stuff.  
---
" hey i claimed tank for this random group... And i can tank just help me out with CC... BOOT"
---
" HEY i claimed dps but im going to be in the shit, so healer please keep an eye. Im self sufficient and tanky" BOOT
---
Oh your a vampire... BOOT
---
OH YOUR A STAMINA TEMPLAR? BOOT
---
The irony is that if 4 players geared for solo pvp joined together for a dubgeon they could roll through it without proper "roles" no healer, no tank, no dps. Just 4 self sufficient pvp builds. Dealing dmg, tanking and healing themselves...
---
Some of us didn't get banned for cheating and can still play like you wish you could.
---
Pepperidge farm remembers
---
But I’ll say I stopped playing around the same time and came back a month or so ago, and I’m really enjoying it
---
Okay so I phrased it wrong would you prefer "will this new "destroy function really help?"
---
Not just paper, but wet tissue paper.
---
I run a store and keep all of my items on my main, anybody who had a mule already took the hint and changed their muling methods. Do you have a link that the banned accounts are still under suspension? Thought we wouldn't know until servers were back up
---
As a not-nearly-as-bad hoarder, serious question: why so many? My collection is as follows:
---
* ECD: T60 BOS Initiate level 50
---
* Junker for getting my ass handed to me in nuke zones: Raider level 45
---
* Pretty: T51B Nuka-Cola level 50
---
* Gotta spend those atoms: T45 Mothman level 45
---
* Wanted the armor stand: Excavator level 45
---
* All the cool kids got one: X01 Prototype level 50
---
* Too expensive to repair, never taken out of the box: Level 50 Ultracite
---
Are you going for every level with every paint job, do you have specialized suits (with/without jet packs, etc), or are you an honest-to-goodness hoarder willing to give up 180 lbs of stash space for pretty much no return?
---
"Your parents must be proud of the dumb fuck they raised that has to ask is it safe to have a gaming PC without anti-virus software 😂 get the fuck outta here shithead." That was your recent comment, and your here trying to play the victim and complaining about toxicity. Grow the fuck up man
---
Thx for the warning! I'm willing to take it, I really do want to know if I should get back into the game or not.
---
I really like the idea of that. I'm trying to convince one of my friends to play for that specific reason. They want the game but are in college so money isnt a real thing
---
Agreed , since lack of endgame i like to respec a lot. But atm its not really fun
---
Harassment is actually pretty well defined. The only people that often have trouble with it, are those who routinely harass other people, and then lie about it, claiming they were joking, role playing, or just pretending. 
---
Simply, if you aren't the kind of person that gets into harassing others, you won't. Those that do, know exactly what they are doing, and more so, they know exactly what lies to tell to cloud the issue.
---
Lol, you really got me there! Like I wish I could, haha, gold.
---
Other ideas:
---
\- Add a quest to repair a broken radio tower, completing it unlocks two new radio channels in your pip boy: Trade, and Looking for Group.  Tuning your radio to that channel enables server wide voice chat with anyone on that channel.
---
\- Add the ability to craft functional mailboxes to your camp, for a small fee you can hire a courier bot to mail items to other players that will then show up in their mailbox.  Also have the option to specify CoD (cash on delivery) to facilitate remote trading.
---
\- Add the ability to add a public note to your camp that shows up when people click on it on the map, you can use this space to advertise certain products/services.
---
I can get it to respawn reliably now, but I don't go back to that area for at least two days between, not 20 hours.
---
I used to play on PS4 and the community was... ok. High level players were pretty hostile and not many people used to a mic.
---
I bought the Xbox One X 76 bundle and the Live community is way more friendly in comparison.
---
Guess after the game is live again I can see if my Atom Shop items become visible again. 
---
I've already edited the INIs and reinstalled the game and all that trying to fix it, no dice, tons of shit invisible. :( 
---
Here's hoping!
---
See, I went to Camden park and thought to myself "oh damn, I bet my character loved this place as a kid, now it's on fire"
---
Hi there are you both running any mods or custom ini files? If so can you delete those and validate/repair the game files from the launcher?
---
Nothing false about it unfortunately - PvPers are constantly harassing other players who don't want to PvP.  Or exploiting workshops - those should get reported if they don't actually contest the workshop and just use it as a mechanism to initiate PvP elsewhere on the map.
---
Some of those prepper outfits look like they'd go good on raiders.  Really wish we had some human, or ghoul raiders to fight right about now instead of just scorched in tattered clothes.
---
You're the one here crying like a bitch over a game you allegedly hate.
---
Yeah I finished Red Dead, got good at Siege, and got back into Borderlands 2 again. All with people I met on 76, I’ve never played a game with such a complex social nature and I miss meeting the people wrapped up in it
---
What are MMO tendencies? I often see dailies or other stuff labeled as "MMO features", but they really aren't. Plenty of exclusively single-player games have dailies, or daily activities, resetting events, etc. They are ubiquitous in MMOs, true, but it's not an MMO tendency.
---
PC. I was only running the clear Power Armor HUD. Disabling it seems to have resolved the issue.
---
Another way to maybe tell, the value of your weapon is tied to condition. Might be a more objective way of telling if it has changed or not.
---
You suck at this game bro? Quit bro?
---
Respawn at vault 76 fixed it for me.
---
Oh boi, here we go again... Btw, what platform?
---
Yeah but think about all the time taken to get down to that 1700 before you can move anything lol
---
Hoooootttt poooo----ttttaaaaa----ttttooooo bwahahahahaha
---
Better start downloading it’s 18gb
---
It was just recommended to me to move my camp box as your placement is revolved around where that's placed..
---
let's make a petition to add a radio booster signal to your pip boy that picks up Mojave radio!!
---
kek
---
r/whoooosh
---
They have fixed a ton of stuff, mass banned the dupers and looks like they actually read all the positive and negative stuff this community leaves and tries to implement the stuff they can. I’d for sure give it another go my dude
---
To be fair, Christmas/Holiday items don't need to be cluttering up the store for 12-months, just around the holidays would be sufficient.
---
Yeah, where’e the context for it? Where i’m repeatedly being told i’m wrong. I’m stupid and i should “get food” for mentioning an EXPLOIT?
---
Again another idiot.
---
My char was born in the year of somewhat he was just a guy kicking back having a good time getting drunk. When he woke he knew he was drunk. He was wondering where everyone was because they took all the booze his mission in life is to rescue the booze and bring it home to vault 76 and obviously die alone as their are no other people.
---
They're not abandoning fans, though. Not even a little bit. They're trying to prevent cheating. End of story.
---
Yep. This is retroactive as well, so you should be free of that extra weight!
---
Same, I got it for Christmas and played through some of January. Looking forward to getting back into it.
---
Heavy gun damage increase when that just became one of my key guns in my rifle-automatic build. Holy FUCK this is a godsend. I am now unstoppable.
---
&gt;Just cause you don’t PvP doesn’t mean you have to be a dick to people who do.
---
The workshop system enables people to force PVP on those who don't want it. Fine. But don't tell me that I can't be a dick about it. 
---
In other words, if you take my workshop and kill me,  you are going to have to deal with whatever consequences come from that. 
---
One of those possible consequences is that the player keeps coming back and you keep having to kill him but he has no caps.
---
I would 100% support this.
---
Which is cool until you get DCed before you can earn the caps back. Now the vendor pool is gone. There’s probably a better a simpler fix for this. Seriously just making it so people can only do slap damage with no caps is enough
---
That's really good to hear! I'm glad that Bethesda seems to have stepped up their game after the s***storm that was launch. I'll give it a go for a day or two when I get home, I think.
---
Change servers.
---
You use mods, yeah? [it was brought up in this thread too, with a fix](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0oa2g/psa_mod_users_and_those_with_a_fallout76customini/)
---
They're still decent. But not broken like they used to be. Currently its meat hooks that are broken.
---
I really would love to see them introduce more older Fallout game tracks. 
---
So many good tunes. The stuff currently is getting old.
---
This is where I’m at as well. Ran out of shit to do around 55 hours and people acting like brewing alcohol (that has never been useful) is going to rejuvenate the game. They really need to add some npcs that you can actually have a conversation with, quests that are more than “find this missing/dead person”, and a vault you can actually explore with history behind it. You know, things that have been staples of the game since Wasteland
---
Rest assured that this will never happen.  Think about what it takes to display something in your camp.  It has to be craftable, which means it has an entry in the camp menu, which requires icons and models for every item you want to craft. And if they stick with the current approach you will need to find plans for every one of them. There are thousands of items floating around the world.  They aren't going to put every one in the camp menu.  It's just impractical.
---
anyone else find it interesting they had the modern fireplace displayed with the whitesprings floor skin
---
I've got a Quad assaultron head I was saving for when they fixed it.
---
Gonna have a lot of fun with that one
---
Yea, mods and custom ini file. Deleting the file (for now) fixes that problem.
---
So then describe to me how you think this is happening, that a player engages in PVP so much that their cap balance goes negative, or they get a bounty so high their cap balance goes negative without willfully engaging in PVP. You'd have to be standing there letting people slap damage you to death repeatedly, or you'd have to be willfully engaging in PVP, again, repeatedly.
---
I'm confused too.  I got this error about not being able to place my CAMP because it was in a new quest area, but it still lets me move and place my CAMP object there (it's not red when I try to place it).  Maybe it's an error everyone has?  Or maybe it barely touched one of these areas?
---
And for the record, this was my last reply “Erm, what? “If you claimed and left nobody could claim it from you”
---
I’ll wait.”
---
So if you want to make me out to be a villain, try harder.
---
I don’t like jokes either
---
Right outside the Whitesprings trainstation.
---
If you sent me a team invite I’d decline, I don’t care about your herd mentality
---
Yeah the game was lacking of a story but the exploration was very good , also I really liked the level of detail on the map
---
That's ultracite, not t51
---
Yes, as Pacoboyd mentioned, this is related to the Fallout76Custom.ini file. Removing that file or adjusting it as mentioned above should help resolve this.
---
Are items that are put on display going to be stealable by other players, or can we just hang our power armor up for example and trust that it will be there when we need it?
---
If you have any custom ini files or mods, try to remove those.
---
"correct geared" lol. So only people running around in full sentinel should play survival? PvP is totally broken. Deal with it.
---
They use to work great for me until patch 5 😡 
---
Do you have 15 luck and run better criticals and critical saavy?  I wonder if i don't use critical saavy if one of those three will work?  
---
Does it show you the animation when they activate like it use to?
---
I mean in comparison to the other games in its genre (Anthem, Destiny) I found the holo tapes more interesting than anything the NPC’s had to say in those games. Really thinking of jumping back in.
---
You may want to add the last "2" to the .ba2 at the end for the people copy-pasting, but this method worked just fine for me. I assumed this was the problem and came here to see what ya'll had and you did not disappoint. This fix worked for me and I have a few mods installed like Better Inventory and I believe the SB animation one.
---
Thanks FO76....
---
I worked so hard to give MagicMan's grandma cancer....
---
And you just took it away,. All my work....gone. 
---
Never playing another Bethesda game again.
---
Its been like this. Nothing to do with update
---
Oh god no, Carla2 got taken out by three mirelurks!  I was clearly not meant to have pets.
---
ya no shit Sherlock
---
Make sure you don't build above a spawn point for enemies. I had this issue every single time with one of my builds, the one I built on top of the pylon bunker in The Mire.
---
Really hoping so. I've got a one man vault built by the map edge and I love it lol
---
 I have never used VATS in thousands of hours, in all the Fallout 3D games. It just seemed like cheating.
---
Mole Rats have lvl3 pick lock skills. Saw one do it!
---
Nice work, Bethesda!
---
I've tried to edit it twice, for some reason it keeps removing it.
---
Scrap walls would be nice. Scrap raider camp walls fit into the environment and make our camps look scavenged and actually made by survivors. These walls would also be great for roleplaying as a raider and fit in nicely at the Top of the World
---
It's a step in the right direction but man, some of the outfits still look so damn goofy. The tire armor is cool but it's being worn over a raincoat for some reason? The catcher's mask and chest protector are also cool but then that's over what looks like a sweater my grandma knit for my birthday when I was ten and a pair of galoshes I wore to school when it was raining.
---
While they've increased the stash limit several times, it's still very easy to hoard in this game - you don't need to pick up everything - big one is ammo - just pick up ammo for weapons you will use, you can discard the rest - you can't sell ammo to vendors in FO76. With that said, chems are always worth picking up. Screws, springs are used in many items, ballistic fiber is very rare and used for armor, definitely pick those up.
---
You can tag stuff like screws, springs, and ballistic fiber for search by having them in your inventory under the "junk" tab, switching to "component view", then "tag for search". When an item in the world has the components in it, there will be a little magnifying glass icon next to it.
---
Picking up weapons/armor is helpful to scrap them - you learn mods by scrapping them.
---
The perk card system is a little un-intuitive at first, but I quite like it. When you level up, you pick a special stat to level, then pick a perk card. You don't have to pick a perk card for the associated special stat you just leveled up. For instance, you can pick to level up strength, then pick a perk card under agility instead. You do, however, need enough special stat to equip the card. Some cards require 1 special stat, some require 2. Ranking up a perk cards makes it require more special stats to equip. For instance, lone wanderer perk under charisma requires 2 charisma to equip at rank 1, 3 charisma at rank 2, etc., while other perk cards like slugger requires 1 strength to equip at rank 1, 2 at 2, etc.
---
Otherwise, don't worry as much, the perk system is forgiving, you can swap special stats around after level 50. At level 50, you stop being able to level up special stats, and only get more perk cards, but you can chose to move around your special stats instead. The game has a lot to explore and experience, enjoy your journey!
---
It would be interesting if they reuse the map to make a single player fallout
---
i believe our hardware wasn't the issue seeing as how i can run better looking games at max graphics with no issues at all lol
---
Good news: we've fixed PVP
---
Bad news: it can only be done with level 5 wiffleball bats.
---
It seems like they are following the steps of no mans sky compared to the newer mass effect, if they wouldn’t have done stuff with this game I prob wouldn’t have gotten another Bethesda (didn’t enjoy eso online) game until I trusted them. Sadly preordered anthem even after the the mass effect shit show and 76 is 10 times more fun
---
&gt;I am not saying you good sir are not telling the truth, I am however saying that usually Staff does not ban on a hunch or just reports. They have logs of things that happen and usually consult those - or have a script that does it for them.  
---
&gt;Good luck however, hope this clears up.
---
Wrong. I have 140+ games in my steam library. I play tons of online games and have done so for about 11 years and never ONCE cheated.
---
Slap damage is capped at 5 health/second. Even back when stacking explosive bobbleheads was a capable of producing insane amounts of damage you couldn't get higher than 5 health/second.
---
Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw4xomXVwpQ
---
From the thread, you respectfully told him why he got flagged in PvP and how to avoid it. Then Aj90lfc couldn’t accept that it was part of the game and not an exploit. His biggest crime is overusing CAPS LOCK to emphasize his terrible arguments and not accepting your response and moving on. He seems to think his complaining and insulting you will somehow fix his problems, sounds like an entitled 10 year old to me.
---
I just clicked on each link, what are you talking about? I cant find it
---
The idea, I think, is to make our community *better*, not just bigger.
---
So basically, you're whining cus someone killed you across the map after they claimed your workshop?😂 if you're so entitled that you're not willing to be killed, DONT TAKE THE SODDING WORKSHOPS!!!!!!!!
---
Frat house near VTU in Morgantown
---
If I'm using VATS I prefer the reflex sight since scopes increase VATS AP cost.
---
That said, using the beam splitter, I haven't been able to get consistent hits in VATS (sometimes all the beams focus on the targeted spot, sometimes they just spray everywhere).
---
Like you I have a small collections of Legendary Ultracite lasers that I've been testing against various enemies. I've tweaked my weapons similar to yours and they're *almost* useful. So close yet so far ...
---
You’re too stupid to understand what an exploit is bro?
---
Oh god, yes, I hope not being able to team up without closing the app and relogging until you magically can (if ever) is fixed today.
---
No,. Locking you out of game is keeping with the agreement you made when you paid for the license to play the game. 
---
You exploited the game, and you got banned. You weren't "abandoned". You were punished.
---
You summed it up perfectly my friend, crying because someone took his workshop and killed him. Pathetic
---
What items?
---
This was done so we’d have to buy the columns even though what I build wasn’t out of the realms of reality considering it was made of metal.
---
ouch - i hate downing a 3\* cause of the effort (ammo and what not) I can't one shot anything in this game. But then I get some crappy 1\* wood armor piece or weapon i don't use.
---
What's the point of sitting down at the dining tables the Whitesprings if you cant eat or drink?
---
Woohoo!
---
Inb4 someone finds an AAE chainsaw
---
i have 14 Luck - Mutated so 5 of those go to Starched Genes / Class Freak
---
the others are 4LC, Better Crit, Grim Reaper Sprint.
---
I see my AP bar regen when GRS procs, but I don't get the sound like FO4.
---
I do get the sound when my crit bar fills, and it has filled from empty multiple times with 4LC
---
I didn’t pay for this game and I certainly won’t be paying for the next, no more licenses to worry about
---
With the roadmap for the rest of this year it seems we are getting a ton of content and utilization of unique locations that while you might have checked out before. Those are geting new details and quest lines opened up and it seems like a great time to come back it it at least for a while. I'm level 98 and have a somewhat okay build and decent armor and im super excited for whats to come. Might not play 40 hours a week now but ill still get at it.
---
The entire camp. I can’t place it and now I have to rebuild.
---
Agreed, I turn off the radio from time to time because hearing the beach boys for the 6th time during a session tends to be much for me. Don't get me wrong, love The Ink Spots, but damn, with the volume of songs they have in this game, it feels like all you hear are dem boys.
---
I'll recheck
---
Yes it is false report, because PVP is feature of the game, otherwise it wouldn't even exists. As long as there is option players to do damage to other players, it is normal part of the game. Slap damage, low rewards, low repair costs and non existing death penalties are there just so that "you" guys wouldn't cry so much about it, yet still "you" guys are incapable of handling these situations, even after so much "handicapping" the PVP. You don't want to PVP, don't play games that has PVP in them. If you make false reports for harassment after getting attacked, attackers have all the rights to make same report at you for harassing them with false reports.
---
Ok?
---
Heh. Ok? No clue what the hell you're on about, but you do you.
---
I use one often. Have the powerful auto receiver on it with an 85rd drum magazine. And all the perks for it. It cuts through a scortched beast. Not a queen obviously..
---
It’s an exploit. I shouldn’t have been killable FULL stop away from the Workshop, yes i’m complaining at a team ABUSING an EXPLOIT to kill me an take my junk whilst i’m stood still BUILDING at my friends camp. 
---
How can you seriously NOT see the issue with this? I wouldn’t care IF i was fighting, or IF i was at the workshop. But nowhere NEAR the workshop? Not in PvP? It’s a fucking joke.
---
They go hand in hand when the good players leave day by day
---
I dont wear any sentinals...  You really gotta learn more!
---
How to beat sentinals: Vats Crits, invisibility, stagger. 
---
Thats 3 ways to easily take down a sentinal clad player. 
---
Its an RPG. You gotta read the role of the opponent and use the correct counter. Its not broken. Its pretty good right now. Its just they dont LOOK VISIBLY different like in WoW. You dont know someones a rogue or a tank or a mage right away. Read and react. Carry things like stealthboys and berry mentats.
---
I disagree. Ive been PvP only since the end of 2018.
---
Yes, some people will report they are being harassed in game, because they are immature or sore losers. But the amount of those players, is always way less than you are trying to make it out to be or will be.
---
You also have no idea what is going to happen once a report is generated. It's like you're assuming that people are going to get banned for one report of harassment. 
---
There's a lot of research and data on this kind of stuff. There's two reasons why people always say harassment is open for debate.
---
I love fallout. It's a shame what Bethesda turned it into. 
---
I hate very few things in life. 
---
I am merely a man sharing his unwarranted and unpopular opinion in response to the fine folks of this community.
---
‘What is you malfunction” lmao I love it, well said 👍
---
Yeah you have to be careful when dealing with damage number buffs and nerfs. Going to far in either direction can change the way the whole game functions. 
---
In fact, there was a fairly insightful comment from a Dice developer on r/BattlefieldV where he said that simply changing damage numbers should he a last resort on weapon balance.
---
To put it simply, GET GOOD KID
---
Mine never ever works.  After i use my critical two shots and it's full no matter what.  It never ever fills completely with one shot.  I pay close attention all the time.  The reason it takes two shots is because my luck is 15 and i run critical saavy so it's not super upsetting,  rappers sprint is what really bugs me that it never works.  I threw psychopath in there just to test and broke as well.  I've always liked gun fu reapers and any critical buff n w my adrenaline it's like a non stop chain kill provided the perks work as stated which they don't anymore
---
Eyyyyy
---
I'd rather have it smaller than filled with exploiters, so I will keep my attitude.
---
I really, really wish that Scorchbeasts would wander off if you're Hidden. I'm too low-level to fight them, and I can't tell you how many times I've been trapped in a building by a scorchbeast and forced to just stop playing. It's to the point where I'll be trying to make progress on a quest line or in an area and as soon as I hear the wingbeats I have to give up on whatever I was doing and fast travel somewhere else.  
---
It's literally the only thing in the game I dislike.
---
Late, but in case someone else comes across this thread....  
---
Scorched Officers carry codes for launching nukes. Those codes reset weekly (Monday evening, as of this writing). If you've already gotten a particular officer's code, he'll have some random junk or a shotgun and ammo.
---
Make your own opinion you own the game login and find out. But if you must know here are your answers in no particular order.
---
1. This game sucks I got banned
---
2. This (insert object) needs a buff/ nerf
---
3. I keeping getting killed by slap damage
---
4. Griefers keep targeting me
---
5. I hate this game I will stop playing it after 200.   hours of play.
---
6. It's a masterpiece everything I expected for an online Fallout game.
---
I have liked it since day 1
---
Click on the Skins link and scroll down a bit. There are new skins for excavator and ultracite PA, also for handmade and lever action rifle.
---
Thank you!
---
Even before the bobblehead change what you couldn't have gotten one shot by slap damage.
---

---
It's probably more than a little unfair for me to say that PvP players are toxic. There are definitely toxic PvE players also. Toxic people are just going to be toxic no matter what they do.
---
There is something about the competitive nature of PvP that seems to make some people toxic. By toxic I mean those people who constantly feel the need to tell other players how bad they are at a game or how stupid their ideas for improvements are....as opposed to being helpful to others or having logical discussion.
---
So while this fixed the falling issue, I am getting "LOOKUP FAILED" for crafting some things in the crafting menu that I purchased from the Atom shop. Such as the Party poster. It will craft it, but even then when I look at it I get "LOOKUP FAILED". This also happens for crafting the Inspector's Hat and Nuka Cola RocketGirl outfit.
---
Can't aim and I am falling through the world.  Quick travel doesn't fix it either.
---
Doesn’t ingame threatening equal immediate ban?
---
I woulda thought threats of violence against other players is against bethesda TOS
---
Go to Atom Shop, get the free poster, put it in your camp and read it.
---
Dont craft glowing blood packs and use your blood packs for stimpacks, get the chemist perk and dilute stimpacks and medsso that you get 4 diluted radaways and stims and 2x the value of them.
---
Just checked in game, they did not :(
---
I think there's a misunderstanding as to what the word "good" means.
---
&gt;Thoughts? Ideas?
---
My first thought was "Has this guy read the god damn [roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps)?"
---
Did i say it was? 
---
Nope.
---
Just that i didnt swear, thus am chill.
---
Check your reading comprehension skills please
---
So...meaningful changes to weapon damage, durability or enemy armor/EHP.
---
Well, this sucks.
---
Pretty sure banned players received an email.
---
Dawg if you don’t use VATS you’re crippling yourself.  Especially in PvP
---
Crit perks
---
Action Boy 
---
Is all you really need for VATS. I run rifle
---
Build but only
---
Use Action Boy 
---
And Better Criticals 
---
Why do I use these maxed perks on my
---
Build? 
---
Because I only
---
Need to VATS shoot you twice to end your life. 
---
It just doesn’t seem like it’s worth the trouble my friend, but if you want, run rifle build without VATS perk and replace with scavenging perks because Idk how you gonna survive in PvP.
---
Updating your Custom ini in your Documents&gt;My Games&gt;Fallout 76 folder should fix the issue. I was having the exact same problem and it fixed mine. Just paste this before all the .ba2 files, my example will have Better Inventory on the end as an example:
---
 \[Archive\] sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2, Better Inventory.ba2, .....
---
Most of the major mods should still work in the game and you should be able to plant your feet. Hope this helps.
---
Platform?
---
Delete mods and custom ini files you have and itll fix the problem, multiple threads if you scroll through already
---
Where is it in the buildin menu?
---
Hating on FO76 went out of trend when they released first Anthem's clip. Try out over there fam.
---
Can't speak to your problems, obviously.  But a better CPU and doubling the memory solved my issues.
---
Good-hearted, good willed, good intentioned, people you’d want to play with, not the type of good players you’d want to play against^^
---
That did the trick, thanks alot !!!!
---
Good call, fixed
---
Same. I think it's a great game, sure there's issues but overall it's great fun
---
I have a guide on my sale doc that allows you to figure this out. 
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vkqdm8iOlgTb1oqS_Lw39T7E5FEocoPMH6Ea6oUOyPY/
---
And what equivalent effect is that?
---
r/ilovecats93
---
Like in Skyrim? Heavy snow storms for the high elevation areas?
---
I’m over it. I can just rebuild but I liked my camp. The fact I can place 10 turrets now though made me get over it quick
---
u/Ladydevann or u/Valseek any hints, rumors, insight on what's going on with the often reported bugged daily quests like Heart of the Enemy and Queen of the Hunt?
---
I'm not a technical type of a guy, sorry for unable to help. I'm viewing them on a PC.
---
Don’t forget to like, share, and subscribe for more content
---
i use to get sound and animation every time before patch 5
---
Now i run critical saavy better criticals bloody mess searched genes class freak all Max rank and mysterious stranger rnk 1 
---
I occasionally swap out and put on reapers to test for extensively kills and it has never worked since
---
Do you play on xb1?
---
I'm gonna Unequip every luck perk except starched genes and reapers and test
---
Then try 4lc 
---
Frustrating
---
sticker PipBoy, excavator skins, and a red stove all now on the want list.
---
um... or you could have just server hopped geez
---
Any chance of getting new achievements/trophies along with this update?
---
You should learn to cope with being so serious. You must be AWESOME at parties
---
My storage weight is currently over the max limit, it's 806/800, I don't want my account banned and I don't know how the hell it happened? Any chance it's a bug that allowed too much to placed at once?
---
Wall decorations (don't remember what sort tho)
---
Scroll through. Countless posts on this, its because you have mods and custom ini files you need to update/delete to fix the problem
---
Its okay, thanks for trying!
---
Reddit comments are not  a representation of the in game community. 
---
Do you think r/politics is how people discuss politics outside of reddit too?
---
Reddit is toxic. Sure. I agree. All internet forums are. 
---
I have more PvE people bitter i killed them cussing me off at a workshop they own than people being mean as they attack my base!
---
When PvP players find eachother its great. One side may lose 3k caps and when its over we stand around. Jump. And talk about our builds and base building and junk. Often we drop supplies to fix bases we just smashed if they other team are being gentlemen and ladies about it!
---
Do we have a # limit on lights? What is it? *I NEED TO KNOW PEOPLE!*
---
You have to unlock it in the shop first
---
Oh that one ticks me right off. So many places to picnic and ya can't even sit while enjoying your meal.
---
R.I.P my wallet I guess.
---
Hello! Thanks for this report, this appears to be related to mods. Please disable any mods you may have running, or remove your custom INI file, and see if that helps resolve the issue.
---
I’m gonna wear that crop top so hard!
---
Where's the frat house?
---
I'm going to be on a houseboat in the everglades completely off the grid next week so that is for sure when the black excavator power armor will be in the shop.
---
Hoo-ray!
---
Remove your Icon strings mod until it's updated.
---
Thats a must have
---
If you have a custom ini, you should follow the information here: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124?tab=posts
---
Oooh they finally added that? Yay!
---
PC.  It was an ini file issue.  
---
Its so not a PVP game lol. But when I do get attacked I do tend to be the one in the winners circle
---
Is in Morgantown close to the high school.
---
Damn all those PA skins look great. Good thing i have points saved.
---
Legit problem and annoying as heck, but I literally lolled at the constant falling.
---
My base is still fine.
---
Sigh ..... Failure to read the last 30 posts on this issue. You have a mod.
---
Those skins are going to hurt my self control. :(
---
Wait, the RADIO was being used for that!??!?
---
There was some roadmap or some shizz awhile back that mentioned Raider factions being added so its probably in prep for that
---
I have it (rank 1)  and still get the animation from time to time - like twice yesterday during one battle I can recall, and I mostly was digging treasure maps rather than fighting.
---
Oh so I gotta re-place my floor back down to get rid of the grass clipping through it
---
Shotgun/Rifle build with Marsupial.  No need for Class Freak.  Requires Gunsmith ranked up to 5, then take it twice more to get a rank 2.
---

---
Mine uses stacked and its fine
---
Lotta people rn hoarding Legendary stuff because the vendor is coming in May.
---
Humans...so small...so weak!
---
This is exactly what I would do. Non combat perk cards make them be a 0 in special points so they are added to your list of current active perks, and then because the 0 point perk cards would not need to be moved after that, put them at the top of the active cards. So if you do need to switch combat perk cards, you can without hitting the 0 point perk cards at the top.
---
This game doesn't have lootboxes or paid Dlc, I think you might be on the wrong sub.
---
Yes, it's a small improvement but please Bethesda please.
---
Some had an interact button
---
This has me concerned as well, I got a great gun that shuts down bloody builds , and have been accused of cheating . It has executioner, limb damage and 250 damage resist while reloading . No cheat , just gifted by rngsus.
---
Anyone else notice that some enemies see you like right as they spawn even if you're no where close and invisible?
---
This happens to me at every radium fever. The legendary spawns and I go from hidden to danger and it comes straight for me.
---
Happens from time to time with super mutants too. I'll be about 60+ feet away and I'll shoot them once and they automatically see me and I go to danger.
---
Thanks. Just started the new quest line and I think that's where it's bringing me. Patience is a virtue. Lol
---
Some of these are must haves for me.  The bear overhead light.  The painted water pump and cooking stove.  I'm up for nice weapon skins like the handmade and the lever gun.  There's a lot to like here.
---
People play games for different reasons man, I’ll give you that I want more content out of this game but I’ve been playing for like 400 hours now so I’m pretty satisfied with my investment at this point and it’s only getting better with future updates. 
---
Some people play for the community and building and just adventuring. Just because you got bored with the game, and depending on your play-style I can understand why you might, doesn’t mean you have to question people’s enjoyment. Can we live bro?
---
COPY PASTA FROM OTHER THREAD:
---
(fixed it for me)
---
Today's (March 13) update, Patch 7, again, makes changes to sResourceArchive2List. Please update the beginning of your Fallout76Custom.ini like so:
---
\[Archive\] sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2,
---
An initial slap or even two or three to try and see if they'll fight back is one thing. If you drop it and walk away after they don't respond, no big deal. If, however, you *keep* slapping at them and chase after them if they try to get away from you, you *are* harassing them at that point.
---
Their way of wanting to experience the game doesn't outweigh yours, no. But yours doesn't outweigh theirs either.
---
Update Fallout Custom INI
---
    [Archive]
---
sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix -  00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix -  00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix -  00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix -  MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba
---
It sure is.
---
Did that
---
It looks like they placed their CAMP down in an abandoned house, unfortunately.
---
Hmmm.. so should be able to scrap the laser one, finish up with fourth missile turret, hopefully enough budget to add 3 more foundations and expand first floor for the new crafting stuff.
---
They’re adding prestige...
---
There are at least 1 thing I do not agree with unless someone really explains if this is true or not. But from what I have seen so far into the Patch 7 Notes. There is 1 patch that needs more explaining to do.
---
1 The weight limit: 
---
If a player has 230 Space and if they exceed that space even the slightest to 232 or 231 would that mean that the player is unable to drop those items he doesn't need at all and has no choice but to destroy it or would he still be able to drop whatever it is that he doesn't need anymore and be able to share that with other players. For example. There are a number amount of players like myself that do not mind sharing any left-over junk or items that are not really interesting for the next player by putting them in a oversee stash boxes across the map. So the next player that comes across it either they be low level or high level, they would still get it. Would that Player that exceeded the space limit only by a little still be able to drop it and still transfer it into oversee stash or any other objects like a briefcase or they have no choice but to destroy it? Can someone explain?
---
aaand blocked
---
Yeah i got tired of either having a static camp or being hella frustrated when moving so i have scrapped my wasteland resource mega compound monstrosities and constructed 1x2 footprint 2 story forward operating bases. Still plenty of room for all tables 2 beds and instruments. I'm pretty sure this is actually what camps were supposed to be. if everyone did this there would be alot less whiny posts about "griefers ruining my camp". If its mobile theres less sentimental attachment. I intentionally drop mine in hostile areas.  Kite scorchbeasts back to my 6 turret gunship.
---
I meant to say theres pvp always involved. Someone can always blow up ur base. Someone can always just follow and keep attacking you. Its the game. Im just saying dont cry over dying or pvp. Just join another server and play. Its just a game lol
---
How does he know he was reported?  Was he banned already?  Did he receive a notification? Did they just SAY they reported him?
---
They're useless now
---
How can you tell if someone reports you?
---
Sorry about that. I guess I missed it. I will look at it again.
---
Can’t find it as well
---
Im sure they have ways to deal with all the fake stuff, in fortnite for example the reporting has been there since start and every salty kid automatically reports you after you kill them and it does nothing
---
Nice. Thanks!
---
or wolves, or Scorched , or super mutants .. LOL How the little SOB'd magically appear in a walled up room with generator is beyond me. Started lining but generators with punji boards . that would kill them and save me a lot of repair instances. Back to the Topic .. I really hope they leave this alone (foundation stacking) .. it expanded what I could do with my base .. And it does not hurt nobody .. So leave it alone .. I like my castle build. I like it that griefers can't get to my main stuff in my base.
---
So that would be mods like BetterInventory?
---
ooh nice
---
Here cuddle with these puppies while I grab you a coloring book.
---
"I don't dislike so and so and I couldn't care less and stuff but here's a thread of me talking about him."
---
great to hear! thanks
---
Well, I mean that's a given
---
Hes posting video now. I believe they told him they reported him. As most reporting systems no prompt will show. Knowing this community I'm 100% certain they click this new feature
---
So it is possible to hack the game? I have been killed numerous times now by griefers at level 35 one Shot or slap damage, and I am a level 235, legendary armor, including - 15 damage from other players and various character changes to see if my character build seems to be the problem, and I still get stocked and killed in any type of PVP in defense of my character, before I can even react to the other player, I am killed, my loot taken and then I respon, and then attacked again, try to defend myself and killed instantly? With out chance to fight!
---
awesome, i was worried I'd have to redo my temple of doom
---
Thank you kindly
---
I don’t like that the new limitations were not mentioned in the notes.
---
Okay book nerd.
---
the server just went back online like 10 min ago no one would have been able to complete it yet
---
I cant see them will retroactively remove the effect. At this point I think legacy items are safe but will continue to slowly dwindle in supply. Surely there’s people who own some who aren’t playing anymore or got banned or just took a break for other games.
---
If they replaced them with their own new energy effect that would be okay provided the damage boost was the same (if not better) than explosive
---
Strange.
---
The servers just got back online.
---
You can’t be serious...
---
Like most reporting systems you cant. He said they were angry at him and said on the mic they were reporting him. Abusing the system already.
---
How could he possibly know they reported him unless they both said "I'm reporting you," at which point (unless he gets flagged many many times) why would there be any consequences? Do you really think they just instaban accounts that get 2 reports??
---
Right? I learned about it yesterday and sorta build a fort. But now it may be gone and or not able to be expanded
---
ah im sorry man to hear that, i think that might be due to it being too close to an area they have now designated as "out of bounds" due to future story content
---
This is my hope.
---
Got blasted repeatedly by Fatmen (ha ha) and didn't die.  Different day: Teammate had a workshop and someone started to claim it.    Then I died across the map by someone who didn't appear to be hostile to me.    Suspect they were on the same team as the claimer.    We server hopped after that.   No idea who I was supposed to be fighting or not.
---
Does he have his own cap amount or is he tied to another vendor?
---
ugh ..
---
Yup yup.
---
Probably. Just made my base yesterday and took me hours.. lost all that work + resources.. sigh.
---
it was.
---
What platform are you on?
---
says limited though lol just like that vampire costume i bought last week that is now back and NOT limited haha
---
Yep, I never lockpick anymore. Not worth the hassle.
---
Xbox one
---
I knew it!
---
It’s completely nerfed now too. Used to do 920 with my Tesla, now 45
---
You can get a quad explosive or two shot explosive, but not quad two shot explosive
---
aha! this is awsome thanks i will try this way!
---
Exactly.  The echo-location would be able to detect you, right? It only makes sense.  I hate it because of my stealth build, but I get it.
---
In fortnite you play two modes: one that has no purpose besides shooting other players, and another where there are no forms of PvP. If you are killed, it means you have been killed in a PvP mode where your only goal was to kill other players. Its hard to compare this to Fallout where the source of bullshit reports would come from PvE people after any interactions with the PvP folks.
---
OMG this. My camp is next to a cliff. If I log out in my camp I literally spawn mid air and fall to my death.
---
Every. Fucking. Time.
---
Seems to me, at the very least, I shouldn't log on and spawn 30 feet in the air.
---
Wow, that sounds not fun. Was it your only mutation or did you have to reload a bunch of them?
---
Don’t forget the Railway Rifle STILL doesn’t benefit from any perks other than bloody mess. Feels bad man.
---
There wont be any consequences. But Bethesda knew what they were getting into when they added this. They aren't a stupid company. Without legit proof, there isnt a lot they can do. This whole system hinges on the concept of "innocent until proven guilty".
---
About 20-25 minutes
---
Glad they added it back, it was in the beta cause I still have a blueprint with a radio
---
At least full MMO's have npc's.
---
Seems tied to a faction, his caps amount was 0 and i did trade with all vendors in the past 24 hours so i can't say which one...
---
Too bad, I'm on PC, but whenever posting I'd recommend indicating what platform you're on.  Some people might hop on and help out if you need it. Of course, on patch day, everyone will probably want to be out trying new content so might be unlikely today.
---
Also you need home defense to place you turrets. That sucks for anyone who has other people build them.
---
I think you are overreacting. Have you never played a game with a “report player” feature? They are always spammed by kids, and it never results in anything. They provide extra data to aid in bans, they don’t directly lead to a ban.
---
Just an FYI, in my experience, usually the last one you put on is the one that's listed first in your inventory. So that might help when trying to organize your PA.
---
If anything, reports would be taken more serious in a pvp game.. because cheating has a much bigger impact than in fo76. So yea you can compare the two
---
uh oh... what system you on?  I wont be able to test this until after work
---
It will probably be like the fortnite reporting system, absolutely fucking useless
---
Thoze vats fixes, my ass re respecing back inti my crit rifle build sighhhh to the next few levels.
---
Atleast I already have the perks
---
Well you're in luck.  Looks like it was just added today for 200 atoms.
---
That imgur list is a mess of datamined stuff mostly and a few limited edition things.
---
Good Job Bethesda! Keep it up! Ignore the haters, most of them have moved on to hate on Anthem or Captain Marvel.
---
Can confirm, I have an anti-armor, increased swing speed, +1endurance meat hook with the extra hook. It’s the only weapon I need.
---
If you’re on PC, it’s due to ini files or mods.
---
I am in the same boat. I just try to always have a bulletsponge...I mean teammate with me to catch the aggro
---
My game froze on first step of quest...
---
Why wait for the mayhem if you can prevent it now?
---
It's your custom.ini that needs a little work: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124?tab=posts
---
Not that. When you browse their wares there used to be an Inspect option (X on PC) to view items. Useful for checking Legendaries with 2 or 3 stars. It's gone.
---
this is about my plan .. quick question, what "armor stand" I made my excavator but didn't get a stand. this is kind of my want, but be able display my sets in camp (remove the timeout?)
---
Boat fucking time
---
You are correct. Im still on this subreddit. Im still intersted in the game that i preordered the day preordering was an option, even though it has let me down since the so-called B.E.T.A. 
---
Gratz on having the entire active playerbase of Fo76 upvote your post.
---
I haven't played this game in a long time now but these patch notes are exactly what I want to see! Will probably fire up the game first thing when I get home from work!
---
you mean to check out the 3 star items hidden perks you could "inspect"t he items the vendor is selling (seeing a close up of the item with additional descriptions)
---
is that what you mean is now missing?
---
Hes posting video now so you can see
---
I'm sitting back here laughing at y'all, but they day they take away my rooftop adhesive garden I'm gonna cry. Just found out about the rugs instead of campfires thing and ended up getting 6 tatos, 6 corn, and 6 mutfruit into a single piece of flooring. Harvesting is a bitch, but totally worth it for my vegetation clump.
---
This is Bethesda we are talking about here. My trust in them is minimal
---
How so
---
yup .. gonna try to place a few things and reload
---
&gt; Considering it was a mechanic in FO4
---
What? You're full of shit. The legendary loot mechanics in fo4 have been broken down line for line by people who actually know what they're talking about. You can read a very thoroughly detailed analysis of it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/6l91w8/comprehensive_legendary_farming_analysis/) You'll notice there's no such bullshit in fallout 4, so instead of perpetuating bullshit while adding lies on top of it do some research.
---
**If** getting 2 and 3 star loot is more likely by letting them regen, then that's because servers are laggy and aren't processing information correctly. It has nothing to do with fallout 4 and certainly nothing to do with some stupid fucking loot mechanic so please stop lying and perpetuating lies.
---
Did theh really? That's my concern.  This is Bethesda we are talking about here
---
sounds like Lahey
---
yay more dead people quests!
---
Unpopular opinion: I PREFER "locked in" perks. Allow a chance to respect at some point at high level... but swapping perks out makes no damn sense to me in context of a role playing game.
---
I think the gamma gun blast is technically treated like an AoE so that would explain it not having explosive (even before they pulled it from energy weapons). I could be wrong though...
---
Clarification on why some weapons can’t have certain effects would be really nice... 
---
Railway rifle (double, quad, two shot, explosive , 10% dmg aiming???)
---
Crossbow (explosive?)
---
Explosive heavy guns can’t get double or quad, which I honestly get... a quad fat man would kill everyone and the server... but I don’t see why the M79 is immune. That would be any worse than the auto grenade launcher.
---
If there are other exceptions it’d be nice to at least know the reasoning
---
I haven’t played in a few weeks, excited to get back in!
---
I actually got lucky. I decided I was gona just try and get rid of it and buy whatever ones I lose and it was the first one that went
---
without giving away spoilers...you will encounter something that you need to listen to his random ramblings...they are great!
---
It didn’t take much effort but the lack of reward at all was bullshit.
---
Go playing something else fool. This a good day for people that actually like the game.

---
really dope trailer. did it suggest we were getting additional underground areas?? from the footage that was shown, it doesn't seem like a vault, plus vaults aren't supposed to come until later this year; this is only a trailer for wild Appalachia. 
---
really like that they used actual gameplay for the entire trailer too.
---
Wait, there are new underground locations ? Have we heard about that before ?
---
Damn. You said it.
---
Marty Robins... his ballads are awesome. 'Utah Carol' is a personal favorite of mine.
---
Xbox One S. I'm timing it right now to see. Will update once I disconnect again
---
...what’s the point in this post?
---
Obviously you still can’t do that. It’s not listed in the patch notes, so it hasn’t changed.
---
Looking forward to checking that out
---
Should have said Power Armor *Station*, my bad. I **wish** stands were a thing, as well as mannequins for my favorite outfits...
---
I bet it'll only consume half, now.
---
I already crafted nukashine, it goes pretty fast. Also nice new jackets.
---
Ugh .. I hope they left this alone .. 
---
 **Foundations:** Addressed an issue that could allow players to stack Foundations under certain circumstances 
---
or better yet .. it will only affect me if I try to move .. Cause I aint moving hahahah
---
Agreed and so glad to have been with FO76 since alpha. It'll be fun to look back a few years from now!
---
Well,that's actually pretty cool.
---
Underground areas are the two vaults they are opening in a later patch

Alright you've revealed yourself to just be a shit-stirrer with this comment. Nobody cares about you and your friends' reporting battles with a couple salty 12 year olds, and this post has nothing to do with anything except creating drama.
---
It is really nerve racking that I have to rebuild my entire camp. I spend hours building it and now it’s all for nothing. One of my friends quit playing the game forever because the game destroyed a camp he worked hours creating. They need to realize how frustrating it is when they do stuff like this and make people lose hours of work!
---
When i log in, the stealth bug for assaultron heads better be fixed as well. I could careless about the ammo bug being fixed if i cant damage anything with it.
---
But obviously it wasn't supposed to be allowed as they have now patched it to break mules.  If you think it should be allowed because it was possible in the game I mean so was duping.
---
Imagine coming home to rest and relax and having mirelurks munching on your wires and walls
---
he seems fitting lol
---
We shall see, I'm diving into the code on release so I can see if there are any more of those Stealth Nerfs and also see what's being added :P
---
\- On the roof of Posiedon Energy Plant is a trailer, inside spawns an undamaged hazmat suit.  Wearing it gives you 1000 rad resist.  This is useful to have, the main reason being you can use it to gather dirty water from rivers and lakes to boil without getting much rads.
---
\- Under the junk section of your pipboy is the options component view and tag for search.  What I do is set a limit for how much of a certain component I'll store in my stash, usually 200. Scrap your junk and store up to the amount you decided in your stash.  If you have less than the limit mark it for search, if you have over keep it unmarked and use a tinkers workbench to bulk the extra and sell it to vendors.
---
\- Vendors are on a faction, each faction has a pool of 200 caps they will give you for stuff you sell.  Vendors on the same facton share the same caps pool.  This pool refreshes \~20 hours after your first transaction with them.
---
\- When you level up you can raise a special stat and then pick a perk from a different special.  To do this from main level up screen first pick the special you want to raise, this will bring up the list of perks for that special.  From there, use the "filter" option to select a different set of perks from another special and pick the perk you want.  Be aware if you raise one special stat and pick a perk outside of it you might not have enough levels of that special to equip the perk you selected without swapping something out.
---
My bad. No idea then,
---
I've got bad news for you, 'There are no rules' is wrong.  The rules are whatever Bethesda wants to make them, and they can change the rules at any time.
---
But yeah, if you attack someone a few times, that's PvP (or retaliation for CAMPing at Whitespring, which personally I'm fine with).  Reporting that is a waste of everyone's time.
---
If you attack someone a few times, chase after them when they server hop, and make it you life's mission to find and destroy that one player constantly over many playing sessions, that will get you in trouble.
---
That area is a random encounter spawn point. So we will have to keep a look out.
---
So is the "enemies take 0 damage" and "enemies refill HP (even non-legendary ones)" bug gone?
---
What about scrapping all scraps your bulk as well?
---
PS4 - never once saw an animation for GRS or 4LC
---
id ALWAYS rather wait for quality then rush into a half-ready product.
---
That’s extremely helpful. Thank you
---
There's a direct opposition between your description and cheaters/exploiters, though.
---
Thats always the solution people offer. why should i server hop to compensate for a flaw? What if i have workshops? Some quests reset progress when you relog. So not only is it a crappy bandaid fix it's also not always viable, but is always a waste of my time. But thanks for the insight.
---
Still waiting on an answer to this. Feels like they're ignoring it everything it comes up.
---
I hope the level 100 fallout forever trophy glitch has been fixed because I’m about to hit 100 and it’s all I need for platinum.
---
I had a slightly similar experience. I got a new Xbox and loaded the game and a few of the items I bought couldn't be found. I got to poking around and went back into the shop and "re-selected" the items that were (owned), and that seemed to fix it.
---
Oh darn. I was hoping the questline would be longer.
---
Who says there will be mayhem? Only mayhem I see is your post.
---
You don't have to be on Reddit for political conversations to be toxic. Partisan assholes are the most toxic people on this planet...... Republicans and Democrats alike.
---
Thank you all so much! This is huge!
---
Hell, I'm on east coast time, and it's still more than 5 hours until I get online.  Some westerners are just getting their day started, they've got even longer to go.
---
So i just read the blog post and it said stuff like player vending is available for free today, however i was under the impression that it wasnt coming out in a month or so. im at work. is this in game?
---
Disable your mods and/or custom ini file. This has been posted several times already.
---
Yup, mines broken. Was at 900 with hunting rifle before they broke it the first time.  Dropped to 400 when they broke it. Reapplied serum and got it up to 900 again.  Now THIS patch. Back down to 400 again. Fuck.
---
Do you enjoy plopping down multiple power armor sets to figure out which one you want or what parts you need to complete a set?
---
I don’t need it, I don’t need it...  I NEEEEEEEED IIIIIIT
---
They're on my ps4 and I won't be home until 5 hours
---
There are no rules right now... obviously betheada can do whatever the fuck they what and we have to follow... LOL
---
absolutely !
---
Ok so should I finally buy this game then? Or is it still fucked?
---
now if they would just up the rate of legendaries in non-nuke zones that would be great. haven't seen one in west tek in over a week and i hit it at least once a day.
---
Well shucks. Now I feel like my bedroom juke box may have been overkill ;)
---
Aha well how about this!

😁😂
---
Ummmm what? You make no sense. Who's in a reporting battle? I'm creating drama because theirs a new feature that may results in many accounts being falsely accused?
---
If you want to break it down I’m a sales man, I bought items and sold them for a higher profit I didn’t duplicate, I didn’t cheat and I helped some players out in the process, if you fail to recognize the difference between somebody in my position and somebody selling things on ebay, multiple mules, server crashing, then now I know why you’re defending BGS so dang hard
---
I'm literally talking low level, new players. Who might not know how the game works. Might not have turned pacifist on because they didnt realise. People used to try to engage pvp by walking in front of your bullets and hoping you didnt have it on. These low level, new players probably wouldn't have very many caps either. I spent a lot of my first hours in the game exploring and constantly spent most of my caps on ammo at vendors. I'm not saying people shouldn't be punished for doing pvp without caps, I'm just saying there needs to be something to protect new players
---
Shouldn't they be more clear in that not all of this content is available today? Seems like a recipe for trouble...
---
Nukashine has some...er...interesting effects.
---
Correct.
---
I'm running:
---
Marsupial
---
Bird bones

Healing factor

Scaly skin

Grounded

Unstable isotope

And they are great. I was getting dirty water to make into boiled, and it says " you have mutated" what? I left my dang super duper on instead of starched genes. Gained Egg Head. Not really hating on the +6 to intelligence. I do have a few left to sell as well. On Xbox.

The stimpacks in the safe after finishing Mayor For A Day were an exploit?

Oh
---
Is it gonna make it so I feel like having alcohol ever because rn I feel like there’s a bunch of different ones that are the same (stat wise)
---
Took about 30 minutes. Would probably be quicker if you have some ingredients on hand already.
---
Move on to another game then? You don’t need to expose yourself to something that makes you uncomfortable. That’s your own fault.
---
F5
---
it’s not?
---
Yea but we all do it anyway!
---
not yet in the game
---
according to the roadmap it should arrive on 9th April
---
Looks awesome, really excited for the legendary purveryor to come, looks like a scorched mole miner with a shop as opposed to being a traveling merchant. And that weapon at the 35 second mark looks pretty wicked, might need to get one my self when they come, unless they already are in game.
---
Oh if we'd just completely ignore all F76 cheater reports as invalid (which would be a rule to achieve excellent accuracy in handling those reports) then yup
---
I’m uninstalling the game when I get home, I’ve had my fun but now it’s just a sad memory
---
damn.. i was hoping i missed something...lol.  
---
need a place for my armor, bears, and gnomes.  ty
---
If you own a workshop your open for PvP the PvP radius thing is only for initially claiming a workshop. From reading your replies I have gathered that what you want is to have it so if someone claims a workshop you (the owner) have to travel to your workshop to defend it. If you choose not to defend it they can have it. No PvP outside of the workshop area. 
---
Currently the system is flawed but works as intended. Yes, people will use it as a means to PvP which you consider an exploit. However it does work as intended.
---
I sure hope so...
---
Any word on account unsuspensions? Not going into detail even just saying this is gonna bring toxic people my way. Just saying what was the point of removing dupes on maintenance when you guys just go and ban every other person.other than that little spill. Keep putting the new content can’t wait till I can play again!!! Looking good Bethesda!!!
---
Or instigating on a weapon with a base damage of
---
I’m completely lost on what this mule thing is?
---
Yes you are. Nothing has happened. Also nothing happens in all the other games where this system is implemented. You are just creating drama kid.
---
time to build a farm and plant some razorgrains.
---
Takes two ~'s
---
Eh. I have no sympathy for cheaters in online games.
---
I’m not starting fights??
---
Look, I’m happy that Beth is still working on this game, it shows a good commitment, but unless the price drops, I’m not buying. I was foolish enough to pre order, I’m not buying for over 40CAD.
---
i know it was just posted, but im really surprised more people haven't seen the trailer/are talking about it. i was very lukewarm, yet cautiously optimistic about wild Appalachia. this trailer got me full on hyped.
---
the underground locations are the biggest thing that nobody is talking about. this had been suggested by people on this sub before. it looks like they are going to be pretty big too. i think the point of the camera panning down through levels was to emphasize the depth/size. definitely a pleasant surprise. 
---
its going to be an exciting month
---
Its just a placebo effect. Absolutely toothless system put in place only to make whiny children feel vindicated after being "griefed" by "bullies" who properly utilise game mechanics which are misunderstood by said whiny children.
---
For some reason the console versions don't support differential patches while the PC version supports differential patches. A differential patch has changes made to a file which are then merged into the existing file. Without a differential patch the entire file has to be replaced. This is why the console patches are much larger than the PC patches.
---
I have a workaround.
---
I carry two sets of power armor: full X-01, and full Excavator. I put camo paint on the X-01 armor. In my inventory, the frame that has the X-01 set now has an Atom symbol next to it, so I now know exactly which frame is which.
---
Hope this helps.
---
So you tell me to speak proper English but then you tell me to stop being literal. At least I know who the griefer is
---
I figured out yesterday that Pacifist mode is being switched off randomly. I've had to turn it on four times, but I've never switched it off. :(
---
I found this out because I was in an event at a claimed workshop. I expect pacifist mode to be on, as does my teammate. We didn't try to take over anything, we just killed the incoming ghouls for prizes. The owners popped back in and one-shotted me (we're only like 34, they were 130+). I was not listed as wanted, nor had I shot at anyone else.
---
I don't think it was "slap damage" in this instance. I don't think the attack was filtered AS slap damage. I think something is legitimately broken with PvP and the interactions of slap damage / pacifist mode / workshop areas.
---
I'm very much looking forward to Bethesda making pacifist mode a full PvP opt-out.
---
Its weird that they didnt show the underground locations in the roadmap.. seems like something really eventful, I wonder when they come out. But tbh, the trailer was better than the roadmap, got me way more hyped
---
Remove any mods (.ini files) and validate your game through the bethesda launcher.
---
I’m almost 40 and have a console table in my entryway that I bought from Mervyns around 1998ish.
---
Can you explane why please?
---
From experience (not necessarily *good* experience), often just a bit more than everyone else.  Sometimes on purpose, sometimes from a lack of internal channels.
---
I don't consider 'That's cool!' to be a tacit approval of any kind, that's a false flag.  Even if the CMs are privy to all the upcoming changes, announced and otherwise (which I don't believe), just saying something is cool doesn't mean anything deeper than you read on the surface.
---
Remove all mods and custom ini files.
---
Sorry, I can’t empathize. All I can say is make a new account? Is that possible?
---
I get wanting to play, especially with the new stuff coming out, but to sit there and want to be informed of when you’ll be unbanned is a little ridiculous since you cheated to get to the point of where you are now. 
---
The in game economy was ruined, server stability shot to hell, amongst other things, so I don’t blame Bethesda for not caring to inform cheaters if and when they’ll be able to play again.
---
That's what I figured, thanks.
---
You need to update your Fallout76Custom.ini to start like so:
---
 `[Archive]`  
---
`sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2`
---
Yes this is probably my 7th favorite thing to do in the game.
---
I would love more wall styles to choose from.
---
No problem
---
There's a reporting system now. It's been out for 2 hours and you're already whining on Reddit about how it might be abused because of an anecdotal story about 2 kids who reported your friend. Then when asked why this matters, your reply was basically "It's Bethesda, so they'll probably screw it up". Fuck outta here with your concern trolling.
---
A new poster for the frat party (free), a tour guide outfit (600) a mini deathclaw statue (200), west virginia billboards (500), and a new ceiling light with animals on the lamp shade (I think it was 300, but I already bought it so I can't see the price anymore).
---
Carebears like you need to stop pretending like PvP is not one of the base gameplay loops in this game.  
---
The "Why don't you go play X or Y" arguments can be applied to every single gameplay loop in FO76. Why don't you go play Minecraft if you like building? Why don't you go play Battlefield if you like shooting? Why don't you go live on the streets if you like scrounging for garbage?
---
IKR? It's almost insulting that [this](https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/3464971-fallout+76+atomic+shop+camp+vault+boy+lawn+gnome.jpg) is likely the closest we'll get to placeable gnomes.
---
I dont believe so. I could be wrong but I thought their roadmap listed all this stuff as staggered releases.
---
My camp is a 2x8 that is blueprinted as 4 2x1 pieces and then I just build the front and back porch myself, though since they did away with the whole "automatically scrapping your camp if the spot is taken" thing I haven't had to utilize it.
---
You can absolutely proc a crit off a crit with four leaf clover.
---
I agree psychopath is worthless. I don’t understand how it’s any different than a shitty version of four leaf clover, which will fill your meter on hits, not just kills.
---
So is this DLC free?
---
It is one of the better ways of beating sentinel users, but people want to cripple themselves just because. Vats is a game mechanic for boosting damage. You think these people would play something like Overwatch and refuse to use Soldier 76's tactical visor because, "It feels like cheating"?
---
What's weird is that you still take slap damage with a workshop unless someone has contested it. I know because I almost always have at least one and sometimes encounter a slapper out in the wilds. Fine with me. I don't really want to PVP although I do understand I've signed up for it by taking workshops. If real PVP does happen, I'm never so attached to my junk or caps that I put up much of a fight. It's not what I'm there for.
---
This is a mod compatibility issue. Either remove your Fallout76Custom.ini file or replace sResourceArchive2List to begin with:
---
`[Archive]sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2`
---
Id be down for a Melee/Shotgun build as well, that sounds fun. Do you have it saved anywhere?
---
And on the other end of the spectrum there's people like you who pretend like PvP isn't a horribly broken mess that has about as much engagement as Trump has faculties.
---
Now instead of bunkers, everyone just lives under the map. I see the change.
---
Oh Hell No , These Ideas Are great For After they Fix passive Mode IMO -  Until then .. Nahh Put your caps on your Mule and Do pvp all day long hahaha.  With the others PVPers that have found yet Again,  another loop hole in the system.
---
I was just thinking to other day .. what happens when the person does not have any caps in  a bounty instance.. And this post just answered my Question.
---
Cheating was also awful. Ever though about that?
---
limiting someone to 1500 pounds carry weight and 800 pounds of stash hardly breaks mules. Figure some dude has 1 playable character and 4 stash characters on acct a, and 5 stash characters on acct b, thats 9x2300 pounds, or 20700 pounds of crap they don't need to store on the main character. thats a long way from broken.
---
Where do you start it? I've been dying for a cool jacket.
---
I believe Bethesda only considers being an annoying turd ferguson would be inappropriate. So a sign that says "Owe me head" would not be inappropriate, but if you followed somebody around screaming it at them then that would be inappropriate.
---
LOL this nails it! Well Iam guilty of whining about point nr 3. but at least I mentioned it in some kind of a resume comment, where also pointed out all the good things in this game. But you’re right, it often seems to be that either people are completely trashing this game or over-glorifying it while denying some bugs who are still in the game. But to say at least something productive in this comment: for me it’s good to play now, since 3-4 weeks I would say i have nearly no more problems with blue screens/ server disconnects. The game all in all runs smoother, with more people at one place you still have to wait sometimes for the loot to spawn in the dead bodies of your enemies, but apart from that it finally runs! Some might say it has something to do with the fact that more people left this game, I don’t know if this is the case haha
---
Still no way to differentiate power armor suits?
---
This is the fifth month post release and you get given at least three suits throughout various quests.
---
Don’t run away from ANY high level player. If one starts messing with you just fast travel away. If a player approaches they likely want to help, and if not they can probably outrun you.
---
Yeah because it makes sense, it’s not logical to have it initiate cross map PvP, and it should cancel the PvP tick the second they leave the workshop area, that’s the reason the tick comes is because it’s contesting a workshop that they want. I understand PvP and i do enjoy it, but you should not be able to abandon the workshop an just kill the owner away from it, i don’t really understand the logic behind it going cross map after starting the capture and then leaving it. It’s not like i was wanted, or on the wanted radio station. 
---
Caught me off guard admittedly, but i don’t think it was intended to be like this.
---
Which game?
---
On the other hand, why did you put your locked room on a mob spot? ;)
---
Agreed I was just saying this on Twitter. That's what I built all my settlements with in FO4 after the creatures DLC came out.
---
What? How does this make me uncomfortable?
---
Fucking boat time
---
Spoiler....they won’t stop
---
PvP is broken and unbalanced and I say this as someone who only played this game for the promised PvP.
---
I didn't know the cheating dupers were still suspended. Interesting.
---
What happens to all of the caps, premium weapons/armor, mutations they amassed across several characters?
---
It just doesn't seem fair they are not allowed back in to disrupt server stability and wreck the gameplay of honest players.
---
I haven't seen many complaints about dupers for several week. Why is that?
---
If you're a bloodied build then yes.  Its good for all bloodied and melee builds.
---
Yeah try putting a scope on one of your rifles. I dont miss often with my splitters in VATs. 
---
Fyi the accuracy stat of a weapon is taken into account after the VATs percentage is displayed. This is why a gauss rifle misses so frequently ar 95%
---
There was too many I just picked up a stack and was banned posts on here. Well they got what they asked for.
---
Here is to hoping!
---
So this new story line is a random event?
---
There are a few 'choice' participants here who choose to insult people they don't agree with, but honestly it's a small minority.  I just downvote and ignore mostly, though I'll at times engage if they're not obviously trolling.
---
Really the community as a whole here isn't pretty decent, you just need to filter out the small percentage of trolls and egomaniacs.  
---
As a side note, please learn to do that on RL as well.
---
People still play this dumpster fire of a game?
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  Be queit 😀
---
I so hope that wiffle bat has that hollow plastic sound when you hit mobs with it. I would never take it off.
---
You're comparing other games to this? We'll see what happens but I dont see this turning out well.
---
Same, it has which a quick fire rate and low damage so it was ineffective against armored opponents and are through a ton of ammo.
---
The same customer support team that handles our support tickets? 🙄
---
&gt;be able to play the game people paid for again.
---
They should've also read the terms of service.
---
Finally some skins for weapons. No love for pump shotty but that’s ok, I can use a different look for my ak too.
---
Enjoy your time in purgatory for cheating *quietly*, please.
---
That’s what I’m hoping
---
Agreed, that is dope. Shame it isn’t compatible with plague walker because that would be great in a narrative sense. Particularly when that nurgle looking pestilence power armor skin drops in the future.
---
Defeatist nihilist pessimist!
---
No wonder you said the community is toxic!
---
Meanwhile... im the dude! Get me a white russian, and roll with my gang tonight on PC!
---
And now I get to deal with the buggy freaking camp system again trying to build a base when I just want to play the freaking game. It’s so frustrating when things like this happen and I have to spend hours rebuilding something because you change the game. It’s not in the patch notes for further frustration.
---
If you are using the mod Save Everything, try temporarily disabling it. There have been significant changes to the trading menus.
---
Two kids claimed to report your friend and you ran to reddit to spread fear about something that doesn’t happen with no evidence to support it. All while you are playing a game made by a company that you say you don’t trust. So you think you are going to get wrongly banned. So you are uncomfortable playing this game. There.
---
Thanks so much for everything you guys are doing.
---
Sad that this question didnt get an answer. Im really interested in Survival Mode, but if Survival is flooded with max level characters on day 1 it wont be too much fun.
---
Bethesda doesn’t really have a way to monitor it themselves. It doesn’t really bother me so I never report them. But I’ve gotten messages calling me the N word and saying that they hope that my mom dies of cancer etc. All from getting killed by me in the workshop. I grew up playing COD so I’m used to the mom threats lol
---
I think the destroy only option is for people at the absolute weight limit. That is 1500+ your carry limit.
---
You had to mention the blue screen rule #1 never mention the blue screen. It has been a while since I got a blue screen.
---
It only works for one set, however. If you have a set of ultracite, excavator, or raider armor, those can’t get paints. If you paint multiple sets, you can’t identify them with the symbol anymore.
---
The trailer on youtube hyped me up a ton
---
This was actually happening to me while loading in on PS4 before the patch, I would load in already falling through the ground and end up back right in front of my base with and a landing animation would occur
---
It's new 🙂
---
It says if your over maximum allowed weight. That is 1500 pounds.
---
No, don't do that!
---
When you make a new account and make characters on it which just hold stuff for your main. Like pack mules
---
1. Increase your luck stat as high as you can.
---
2. Go to pleasant valley cabins. ( [https://i.imgur.com/ynKnlhU.png](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FynKnlhU.png&amp;v=L7VXftGBN5I&amp;redir_token=YluI5R577va7V1-s5prNGq1GL-p8MTU1MjU4NDE3OEAxNTUyNDk3Nzc4&amp;event=video_description))
---
3. Follow the route in this video: [https://youtu.be/L7VXftGBN5I](https://youtu.be/L7VXftGBN5I)
---
4. Rince and repeat.
---
You can also buy them at the enclave production vendor.
---
Actually, thanks to the movement of "guilty until proven innocent" people who make false claims against others are rarely held accountable anymore, and there doesn't need to be much in the way of proof of the claims.
---
Also, people don't invade someones house and call the cops on the owners, they simply call the cops pretending to be the owners/residents of said house and say they are trying to kill their family(AKA Swatting).
---
The should keep old things in rotation, and maybe during the anniversary week have everything for sale at once.
---
how do I find it?
---
You wanna know some new stuff, there's this awesome key on your keyboard called capslock that I think you might have accidentally hit.
---
Trippy, huh?
---
How else to appropriately celebrate enclave stash boxes?
---
Yong flat out lies about a lot of things, and not only that, he’s the biggest Kojima dick sucker out there.  More reason to hate him
---
A chameleon deathclaw that you dont know is there is a horrifying idea. Have you ever been hit by a level 91 glowing deathclaw? That s**t HURTS
---
I can’t turn tiles near stairs so I have to literally rebuild the entire camp again because of that simple dumb mechanical error. So I get rebuild the camp for a freaking third time. Thank you Bethesda games Dallas! You really know how to make thing way more frustrating than they should be!
---
They won't create a new account until their mules can transfer the loot from the old account. 
---
But rest assured, it's all there in the suspended accounts.
---
As an achievement hunter, I'm now even more concerned with getting the "Good Grief" achievement.  I had assumed until recently that I would just get it by responding to people attacking me.  Now a hundred or so hours into the game, I think I've killed maybe 6 people.  I was starting to think about going after people, just enough to get the achievement, and now this.
---
When you load into the world, you fall through the floor of the world over and over again until you scan and repair your game files. It’s so cool!
---
I wonder how things would have been different if they waited a few more months to smash lots of bug. I'll never forget them adding the final lighting pass a week after launch.
---
Honestly I couldn't care any less. I don't care if you paid $59.99  or over a hundred for the game. You cheated, that's all that should be needed to say. But apparently not.  You know that little window that pops up the beginning of the game, the user agreement? Yeah that one. Actually sit down and read it before you just click accept. It's a warning, clearly folks didn't realize that.  Actions have consequences. Symphony falls on deaf ears.
---
So I shouldn't be concerned that I, along with others, could be banned unjustly?
---
I am set up there now. Scorchbeast is common, with the fissure nearby. But they can't touch you in there so it is irrelevant to me.
---
That looks like blackbird it’s sick af
---
Bye Felicia.
---
Yessss backpacks :)
---
This is very likely a mod compatibility issue. Try temporarily disabling mods which modify the Pip-Boy interface.
---
There are no real numbers because that would be to embarrassing for Bethesda to release. All I know is people on all 3 platforms have stopped playing not only because they are banned but some have stopped playing because they have nobody to play with. And please learn how to spell.
---
Do you really know for a fact that people have been unfairly banned? Because I've been looking and I still haven't seen any evidence.
---
Can Bethesda please look into the major bug on sneak damage? Anytime you hit something that's considered in combat with anything else, sneak attacks do no extra damage.
---
So no point unless you're bloodied?  like if I hover around 70% HP?
---
We have identified an issue where characters may fall through the world as a result of modifying .ini files. To rectify this issue, we recommend restoring these files to their original state.
---
and reminds me of Bender from Futurama
---
You're trapped! You're trapped! You're trapped!
---
I think the thought behind it was to add an element of danger to owning a workshop. Knowing you could be PvP'd at any moment adds a nice element to the game for some people. I can also understand why some people hate it.
---
I dont know, whatever the devs decide to make. It could be an extra strong burning effect, similar to the current mod.
---
It is probably Vaults but I love it
---
Excavator power armor AND skins for handmade and lever action rifles?! Yes please.
---
What. So a new character effectively shares the loot for another character? You just can’t have them on screen at the same time... obviously? I thought new characters were completely new games effectively.
---
A simple improvement could be to change the wanted/bounty icon on the world map to gray if the player doesn't have enough caps to pay the displayed bounty, and the wanted status should persist until the player is able to pay off their total bounty and debt.
---
If this were to be combined with increasing the bankruptcy penalty to 99% or 100% less damage dealt to players, it would essentially mark the player as a free kill to the entire server, and would be a more-appropriately harsh punishment to discourage players from trying to get around the caps penalty.
---
Might be worth a shot... I'm getting like, "everything in the atom shop that didn't ship with the game" not having skins though. :(
---
1. 800
---
2. Yes
---
I heard you can bypass the ban by deleting system32.
---
Thats where ur wrong pleb im on mobile - checkmate
---
Lol it's both annoying and humorous
---
Watched it 3 times now
---
This is everything I dreamed of. I am willing to pay real money for atoms now.
---
I don't play the game anymore but plans used to drop from events on the map, workshop defenses, and merchants sold them. Then just read the plan from your inventory. I assume it still works this way.
---
people are going to have their friends mass report for thing that didn't happen and they have no way to verify
---
Shitty part is it seemed like if you fired too fast on even the second and third shot it kept missing.
---
Agreed. There’s no way they’re going to just let people place any items that they want, unfortunately. The servers would grind to a halt. Can you imagine how many hoarder houses there would be if there weren’t strict limitations?
---
I imagine it’ll work much like the bobblehead stands in FO4, where you’ll have specific items that you can add to a given piece of furniture. For example, I’d love to see the ability to add place settings and food items to kitchen tables and countertops.
---
Someone with a username like FloppyGrandmaTitties worried about offending people... Odd.
---
R/Fo76filthycasuals is what you are looking for if you want a more positive subreddit but overall the majority of people in this one I find pretty decent. Always going to be a few specical cases on the interwebs.
---
2.  Was it broken?  Been playing since before Xmas, and it seems to work as intended since then.
---
I post things that are usually seen much less often on the front page, the things you list have been posted loads of times and noted by CM's.
---
I got the update done and I went to go on my game and I got a message saying that a Fallout 76 update has blocked the building of my camp at the location I am at what is this about
---
Unless your a banned one...
---
It’s not out until the 26th
---
It's not been released yet.
---
Holy late to the party, Batman!
---
Easily.  So very easily.  It'll be a cake walk.
---
Several mines have deposits you can grab in a run.  Lucky Hole mine has Lead and Crystal.  The Glassed Caverns have Ultracite, Gauley has coal and gold, the Burning Mine (Belching Betty) has Black Titanium and a single ultracite.  There's another thread here with more details:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a900n4/best\_places\_for\_deposits\_mining\_is\_the\_way\_forward/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a900n4/best_places_for_deposits_mining_is_the_way_forward/)
---
There's little benefit really if you're that high up in HP.  Makes more sense for melee since they'll regularly lose health even if they're not bloodied.  Considering putting it on my main if it works correctly (heavy gunner, melee secondary) since I do get low on health mostly during Scorched Earth/SBQ fights.
---
We're gearing up to release Survival Mode with a future update later this month. Currently targeting March 26. [The Roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019) we recently posted on Fallout.com has some more dates for upcoming content, too!
---
You should make available DVD copies of large patches for those of us with data usage and bandwidth issues!
---
Seriously this has to be the most frustrating thing you could have done. Destroy people’s camps. Good job
---
Calm down edgelord hahaha
---
Speaking of C.A.M.Ps there is still a problem with floating items and not being able to remove them. 
---
I haven’t played in close to a month because, amongst other things, one of my favorite things to do is build my base but I keep running into problems. 
---
I loaded up this time, to find I can no longer build where I was, just a small issue, and set off to build a new base. I’ve been playing for less than an hour and have already run into the same problem:
---
“Cannot remove item: Part if the structure would not be accessible”. 
---
I constantly get this error when I build and end up not being able to do anything with large portions of my base. It takes up budget space, and is impossible to get rid of without deleting the entire structure and starting over. 
---
Is this going to be addressed at some point? It’s been around since the beta...
---
Nope. And that's what literally every person that replied to this post told you, and you personally replied to all of them because you're not asking the question in good faith-- you're creating drama.
---
Are you thinking of "I Am Become Death."?
---
Belly of the Beast is glassed cavern.  Scorched, Creatures, and an SB.
---
After activating the plant you couldn't get energy out of it, so you had to build generators.
---
Ok thanks a lot! By the way, what's your status on mod currently please?
---
Ah. Ok. Darn :( because the damage bugs especially are the reason I couldn't keep playing the game. I was hoping I could pick it back up once I complete my playthrough of Horizon
---
I still have, at the very least, one Mutation that doesn’t appear in my tool-tip screen on the Stats page, but is very clearly still active. I received Speed Demon Mutation as my character died, and the positive and negative effects are clearly active, but not displayed. I only really noticed it was still active due to how quickly my Food and Drink meters were falling. Is there any effort to address Mutations not displaying if we got them during death?
---
K
---
I like the Pip Boy idea or hell just a giant board with a bunch of notes pinned to it from people on the server. I'd take it one step further for trading and add an auction house / bazaar where you could just drop off weapons you want to sell, set a reserve, and go back later and collect your caps! You could post what you have or what you're looking for in trades and then people could make trade offers that would go to your Pip Boy in real time for you to accept or decline. Thoughts?
---
The servers very unstable for anyone else?
---
How would destroying the item be better the. Just dropping it and moving on?
---
When you mod your game and tweak your ini files you shouldn't be surprised when an update breaks something.
---
It's been good since beta
---
The weapon names are still messed up and can’t add different versions of the same weapon to the hot wheel.  Just did a test, added three pump shotguns to the wheel, one suppressed, one TSE and one bloodied non explosive. After quitting the game and login again, two disappeared. The one left has a wrong name on it. Looks like it’s an impossible fix for Bethesda.
---
My god I am sick of all these PC users thinking everything is broken after a patch quit using your mods
---
Technically, unless another player has fixed it in your server, it's always broken and needs repaired.
---
No mods here buddy.
---
Hope it helps!
---
For those with only two- put an atom shop paint on one. Leave the other normal. Then you have an atom chassis and a normal one to choose from. I do this to differentiate my main from the Excavator set.
---
I feel like mole rats do this already. Hate those little bastards.
---
I've been playing but my damage hasn't been anywhere near what it should be. Was about to break down and reapply like 11 mutations but I'm glad i didn't.
---
This change was only known after the patch was implemented. Nobody had time to move stuff in reaction to the new destroy feature.
---
If you anger the Bots, just find an anchor player, log off &amp; rejoin on them, Walaa! Bots are happy again.
---
The server still needs to keep track of dropped or stored objects. Destroyed ones are deleted.
---
Take my upvote... TAKE IT!
---
I love caves and exploring them alone so I'm really happy
---
&gt; Too expensive to repair, never taken out of the box: Level 50 Ultracite
---
that got a chuckle/cry
---
Anything limited time?
---
The quest to unlock the new equipment is short (30 minutes or so), but the new robot has some amusing lines, and the effects of Nukashine are pretty awesome. I haven't had a chance to brew anything else yet because I'm gathering mats, but I'll update if I find any other interesting recipes.
---
I want near my workshop the first time, I was across the map from there, I just went there after the first death
---
 We have identified an issue where characters may fall through the world as a result of modifying .ini files. To rectify this issue, we recommend restoring these files to their original state.
---
If you folks hit all of this, it's an amazing patch, and well done. This is tremendous. Thank you!
---
I don’t think that’s the same as having four leaf clover proc twice in a row. Besides, that was a patch note from January, and I have absolutely had crits proc right after a crit. It’s not uncommon.
---
Its like Bethesda read my threads and completely implemented everything i was talking about. \*Slow clap\*.... im proud of you Bethesda.
---
Yet still suspended and no communication from Bethesda.
---
Well, I guess that'd be "working as intended" too :)
---
I remember a manufacturer changed the part number on a temperature controller.  We ordered the same part number, but it was actually different.  It didn't come with an internal alarm relay.  Unknown to us.  It still had the connections, but no physical relay inside.  I sent it back to them saying "Alarm Relay does not work".  A week later they sent it back to me saying "Working as Intended".  I hooked it up again, still didn't work.  "WTH" I thought.  So I busted it open only to find the relay wasn't physically on the circuit board.
---
"Working as Intended" they say -_-...
---
I'm sick of idiots like yourself. Quit living.
---
Well, it doesn't seem to help. Looks like I need to remove all the mods from this string and start adding one by one to see, which one causes the issue...
---
Hey there thanks for acknowledging this post but this has been suggested many dozens of times.  
---
Switching perks is not fun or engaging in any way, shape or form.  It's a boring chore that should happen as infrequently as possible.  
---
The only way a perk loadout system would solve this would be if it was a literal 1 click solution.  If you still have to enter the perk menu to make that change it's only marginally better.  
---
So if the plan is to resolve this with perk loadouts please consider something like "Shift + 1-0" to swap to perk loadouts at any time without needing to open the perk menu or even look at the pip boy.  I'm sure a similar 2 button combo for controllers could be devised.
---
Great notes, /u/valseek! I recently reinstalled FO76 because of how cool the roadmap looks. A question: any chance PC will get a shortcut so the Escape Key goes to the main menu? Having to go M, then Z, to get to my settings is kind of a pain. Thanks again!
---
This!
---
I love the original, but Johnny Cash does an excellent version as well.
---
Ok, then we agree you will be banned.
---
Is additional music a possibility for the future of FO76?
---
Pretty much, yeah. They will have unique effects, which change based of freshness and/or how long you ferment them.
---
I don’t hate it i just think if it IS intended to be that way, it needs a more descriptive warning, first instinct is only within the region of the workshop when contested you can be killed, which i understand. But if you leave the workshop, not present to contest it and you let them capture it, or they leave the radius before it’s captured abandoning the capture, i don’t really understand why you can still be killed, without PvP engagement when you’ve essentially both abandoned it.
---
Maybe it’s my mistake for assuming it, but is it far fetched to think this isn’t intended? It is an abuse of a mechanic that essentially shouldn’t apply if the workshop contest has been abandoned by both parties
---
I would merge the two. If you cannot pay off your bounty a random selection of items are transferred to the nearest vendor to be held in repossession safe. Other players can’t access it but you can’t either until you have enough caps to pay it off
---
I am very pleased with the patch notes/level of detail. Im also loving the direction he game is heading! Kudos to Bethesda and the entire team, ESPECIALLY the community managers. Your patience and involvement has been reassuring, to say the least. Keep up the good work.
---
It’s about time !
---
I'm on a boat man
---
You know, I've only found one so far, but I bet there are more - there's an unmarked tiny fissure site west of Top of the World and South of the Monongha Power Plant, south of the acid crack in the earth here: [https://i.imgur.com/HuX7E1s.png](https://i.imgur.com/HuX7E1s.png)
---
Is it safe to say that, based upon the past few ITVs, that tomorrow's will be focused on survival?
---
Well, hopefully you will go to the PVP servers and leave the rest of us alone since you get your kicks annoying people.
---
Nice.  Is there one in the Armory though?
---
That would be awesome, kind of like how for every 3 charisma you can share 1 level worth of a card.
---
I did it around 50. Hated it, would not recommend it, but you can def do it at 83.
---
It's 1-2 SB's and a bunch of scorched adds. Just like walking near a fissure, only indoors.
---
Np, just wish we could have taken her down... there’s always tonight I suppose!
---
There aren't a lot of ways to counter that set up, with Rad damage being one of a few, but you need to be able to stack it up quick enough that they can't recover and heal from it fast enough.
---
Damn, you're right. Belly is also pretty easy. Just don't fall into the fissure, lol. And come to the cavern lightly loaded, since there is soooooo much loot!
---
Yea is a real shame, still great to find another aspect of the game I'd never seen before such a good watch.
---
Oh baby!
---
I've been polite so far, no criticism or gossiping, so why are you hating? If you're jealous that's none of my problem.
---
I thought the Vaults were supposed to be with the Nuclear Winter update, not Wild Appalachia.
---
That’s why I ditched my shotgun in favorite of melee. Way higher DPS
---
That actually sounds like a good finishing product but we have to work with what we have. Lets face it, the game is buggy as shit. For now keep it simple. Leave the trading up to the players for now and let the game evolve into the trading bazaar. Personally i like interacting with people because you never know what youll find. Experience is sometimes worth more than convenience. But i like the bazaar idea. Maybe they could do that as an event, every now and then like the parade and keep a regular messaging system.
---
probably related to the sheepsquatch
---
I'm not hating ,the front page is full of this crap every patch use your brain maybe it's mods causing the issue
---
Is the DLC out and more importantly, is it free?
---
Pls do, so you just do the main quests to unlock the brewery
---
Yeah, if you dupe or cheat in an online game, fuck you....  Enjoy you're well deserved banhammer.
---
I said this in the main thread, and I'll repeat it here...
---
Yay! Now I have to break into other people's camp's to turn off the damned radios...
---
By the Power of Bear Skull!
---
Awesome! Loving the improvements so far, the camp budget rebalance is just superb too. Hats (or power armour helmets) off to Bethesda, they’ve played an absolute blinder!
---
This is a great idea!
---
I hate the random plants that grow and you can’t do anything about them (harvest or remove). It would be pretty nice to have nicely tended areas around camps
---
Sounded like they may have fixed some of that?
---
I remember your tag now.  I looked that post up and I have to agree with your assessment.  I replied that I was going to stay neutral as far as voting, but I did agree with your perceived "elitism" to a degree. I like having the skin and others saying "Thats a dope paint job, where can I get it?" I was of mixed opinion in that I would like others to eventually get a chance at it too, whether it be brought back into the A.S. for awhile or "earned" as a prize.  I did not agree that it should just be given as a gift by Bethesda because someone missed out. That would take the uniqueness of the skin away.  I believe I said that many would be glad to have an opportunity to "earn" it. However we "earned" ours, by either saving our points for the cool stuff or buying the points with real money makes no difference to me.  Most folks have to earn their real world money and how they spend it is no one's business.  Same as saving their points.  So, RTF, you had a really valid point of view that is still fueling discussion whether you got voted up or down or no voted.  Just for the record though, I didn't feel bad about agreeing with you somewhat.  I'm 59 years old and very much don't care who I piss off if I feel strongly about something.  So I'll give you a personal "thumbs up" for having a strong opinion and sticking to it
---
I will be in both. Since pvp is a part of the main game as is. Hence the kill 20 ppl trophy
---
Haha, pleb.
---
The Wish You Were Here photo frame and rustic stash box expire in 6 hours, the sniper outfit expires in 1 day, and there's a new "West Virginia" PA paint job (1400) that I didn't notice at first that expires in 4 days.
---
What did they do?
---
Yea. He grew up in a vault.
---
The reporting system introduced with today's patch is not automated 
---
and reports will be looked into and evaluated by our Customer Support team. If those players did follow through on reporting your friend just for PVP, there should be nothing to worry about! :)
---
Oops, fun detected. No no no, can't have that.
---
I view it as a high risk high reward situation. Also if your sitting at a workshop waiting to claim it. You are also highly vulnerable to being 1 shotted.
---
Personally, I only used it as an easy source of water until I can get a Purified Water farm going.
---
I snuck around the edge of the cavern, didn't even have to engage the sb
---
So....like this post?
---
Hmm I wonder if I can pull that off :) Thanks!
---
Not gonna lie, I kind of love the "kill laugh love" neon sign.
---
I said PvP players are toxic.....and of course people who spend their pathetic days crying about Donald Trump.
---
I get that, but all of us we across the map from the workshop in my friends camp at the time, not once had we gone back to the workshop since the initial capture hours prior to this moment, that was my problem with it
---
ahh okay thanks so much!
---
Thank you for letting me know what this really meant.
---
I assume you're saying you want to inspect items on offer? I find the current ability to browse other player's inventories to be strange. I suppose it helps spot dupers, but it's not a great user interface.
---
No, attacking other players aint harassing. Show me the rule that says I may not attack other players in Fallout 76?
---
Thanks - I believe some of those are just on sale for a bit but the PA paint job might indeed be limited time.
---
Thats the idea Right there! 
---
Makes trading and communication so much easier! When you can make one post and pin it across the board... no pun intended
---
Finally!!!
---
Okay thanks, Im pretty tough and have decent TSE weapons
---
0:55 
---
First teaser to first new enemy added into Fallout 76??
---
i only have two necessary mods: BetterInventory, PerkLoadoutManager
---
why aren't those basic features in the vanilla game yet.
---
it's like you're trying to make people suffer when playing the game.
---
Thank you! :)
---
I spent 80 dollars and didn't get the game please help
---
This all looks fantastic, and I'm excited to play! The patch should be done in a few minutes. 🤙
---
Some UI related things I wanted to ask any Bethesda employee that (hopefully) sees this: What's the possibility of getting HUD/Pip-Boy color sliders? Is that unavailable for specific reasons? Also, would it be possible to get Pip-Girl animations/graphics for UI elements for female characters?
---
\&gt;  It’s always better to be inclusive than exclusive because at least then everyone can enjoy everything together. 
---
This sums it up best. I don't like time-exclusive things because the urgency is deliberate to get you to spend. Especially for things like digital items, it's not like they can run out of them. Feeding the "exclusivity/elitest" mindset is also an unfortunate side-effect.
---
Im a PvP player!
---
We are just misunderstood!
---
Yeah. I general I see community managers as:
---
Attempting to aid players with issues by giving canned advice or forwarding issues to devs.
---
Giving positive enthusiasm to players experiences with the game.
---
I wonder if they even have the authority to negatively comment about a specific player action.
---
Nah. The absolutely ridiculous bring up VATS...get hit two or more times...wait...take another hit from the amazing sharp shooting scorched and mutants...THEN you can fire with a maybe hit until 2nd and on shot of your own.  That’s the best part.  Now they need to either show the scorch AIMING since they hit at a 95% rate.  Or put on the map the Scorched Gun Range and Military Academy....
---
Weird flex but okay
---
What should I switch to, or look for?
---
Go stealth mode.  I snuck through the vast majority solo without having to fire a shot, including the last cavern.
---
I've begun using mods recently and I'm sorry but I wasn't aware of this issue. I don't see how I could have found by myself, but anyway I'm seeing your point and won't bother you anymore.
---
Okay, thanks for letting me know about this.
---
And if you had a way to advertise in game you could have that. 
---
Or do it for fun... who the hell are we to judge lol.
---
Tha k you for the reply Bethesda!! This I'm sure will put us who pvp at ease!
---
Sheepsquatch is not getting released until April 9. That first panel THAT SAYS "March 13: A mythical beast, a lost generation of scouts, and the strangest brew this side of the wasteland" is just a teaser for the entire spring season of updates. The only thing added today was the brewing.
---
what are you talking about lol

Does not work now. Also falling thru the ground if I step off the rock. Another Bethesda mess. Makes me wonder if they test these patches or just let us do it for them?
---
Thats my setup as well, been wonderful when selecting....
---
What's the Daredevil set? Not familiar with that one
---
I don't have any mods for fallout 76 on my pc and I'm not falling through the map 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Probably weren't ready to talk about it.  Or wanted to build more hype by casually showing everyone.
---
If only there was some way they could have built a C.A.M.P. that didn't violate building rules?
---
I tell you, it's dastardly how Bethesda **forces** people to use exploits. Shame Bethesda, shame!
---
RIP my wallet. I’m normally not a person who drops cash on micro transactions but these skins and armors are looking like a snack
---
the distillery quest is all for now till the 19th
---
Does 'Scrap All' still scrap bulk?  This was introduced a few fixes ago to allow auto scraping if bulk while crafting.
---
Well done Bethesda, our faith in you has be thoroughly vindicated.
---
Today I’m a very happy wastelander!!!
---
Congratulations
---
Yeah I ended up seeing it when I logged in to play the update, snagged it :) Thanks for telling me though!
---
About the Player Report system, what if players abuse it?
---
Or right beside the Morgantown train station.  No need to go that far.
---
It was a game called APB. Ever since then I said F online gaming and stuck with single 1 player games until now. Even though Fo76 is online, I have a tendency to stay away from everyone and explore by myself.
---
Is it because even when you do get unbanned you'll have to destroy everything?
---
Biv had me rolling when I let him taste my nuka shine. Lmao.
---
The Evel Keneval Suit
---
If you did the event sometimes the power fusion core generator would not automatically start. The easiest way to correct this was to out a power connector pole down then connect a wire from the fusion core generator to the power connector pole. The fusion generator would then kick into gear. I used to just put down a water purifier and connect that for the same effect.
---
Dude - the whole slap system is to prevent PvPers for killing others who don't want to PvP.  Get a clue...  go read up on the dev interviews prior to the game being released.  If you're killing someone via slap damage its going to be harassment, you tried to initiate PvP, they didn't respond, and you killed them.  Then you get reported, and do it enough times and you'll likely end up getting banned.  Not sure what else to tell you, but you do you if you want to.  Just don't come crying back here when you get banned.
---
It’s exactly what it was in the roadmap. I agree it’s not a lot. But more is coming.
---
No it’s because all my friends quit when half our group got suspended, thought I’d be able to make some more but now I know it won’t be on 76
---
Yes! Whitesprings is a very silly place to visit when you're low/mid level but now maybe worth the risk!?
---
Of course it had content. Content that was broken, unbalanced and requires a shitload of work to be considered ready for release; but they released it anyway and use paying customers as BETA testers.
---
Do a good job for them because I want to have fun in a year and a half when it's actually finished.
---
mods
---
Ah yes. I was tempted. I had been saving my atoms for the blackbird paint to get rereleased and blew it on the mothman stuff.
---
Search the sub, there are numerous posts about this being related to mods and custom ini files.
---
This brought a tear to my ear, kind of like watching my dog exit the puppy stage
---
Hey. That's my line. When I'm overloaded on meds I go around the map to low level players dropping em meds and ammo saying "congratulations!! You've won the great Appalachian sweepstakes!!"  But hey, if you wanna keep being a smartass. Go ahead. See how far it gets you with people that could help.
---
Can there be an achievement for getting reported by 76 players?
---
Just a heads up; if any of you built a radio before they were removed, you might have one under the ‘Stored’ tab in construction mode! I found my old appalachian radio in there, didnt have to spend resources on a new one :)
---
its pretty good now not gonna lie.
---
Is your camp on a cliff edge or something?
---
For a moment I thought that was in a silo the saw modus on the left.
---
You know what. You're absolutely right.
---
I entirely forgot that in prior Fallout games you could stop raiders from attacking you or your settlement by complaining about their behavior, even though it is entirely setting appropriate and a system that was purposefully built into those games.
---
Big step in the right direction. Prepped trapper and wep skins are welcome. Keep em coming BGS. Shameless plug for a ghillie suit!
---
There are multiple topics on the issue already, apparently it's an issue while using certain mods or a custom .ini, is that your case?
---
Yeah, but in most other MMOs there are limits to how much stuff a mule can hold. 
---
For instance, in WoW you're limited to the mules inventory and bank (limited by the size of the bags you have) and a guild bank (limited by how many bank tabs you purchase, which are in turn also limited).
---
Before the patches that addressed it, a mule character in FO76 could have unlimited inventory, which in turn affected server stability. Now, the mule is limited by his normal carry weight plus 1500 plus stash, which is not unreasonable in this type of game.
---
I also love the solution Bethesda came up with to get rid of much of the duplicated items in game by having to destroy anything over the hard cap. Quite a nifty solution to a difficult problem. And a solution that shouldn't affect very many legitimate players.
---
I got a new quest called irrational fear.. defend a bot while it collects honey three star honey beast and two yogui at the end
---
I would also like to know.
---
Whereabout?
---
Agree'd. \*Slow claps\* for bethesda.
---
Also why the hell would we build an already broken tub and toilet?? Drives me nuts.

Disable mods and delete custom ini files.
---
i have 3 characters and each one spawns and falls thru the world, no matter where i respawn  i fall thru worlds, and this is only since the new patch. so i can no longer play.
---
I didn’t use an exploit. I just build a mushroom type base that had top floors and a narrow shaft leading up to it from the ground. I was proud of it and it’s actually look like it could be a real structure considering it was made out of metal. It’s so annoying that I have to rebuild my camp now especially considering In the process of building a new one a tile was turned the wrong way near a stair case on the bottom floor which If you try to turn it is says it’s intersecting with an existing object. So the only way to fix it is to literally rebuild the whole thing again.
---
Conflict with your mods.
---

We are no longer able to see the perks of something from a vendor when clicking the right stick on Xbox. It's Russian roulette now when buying something.
---
ah - yea - i looked through the first 10 or so reddit posts but didn't see it - certainly explains it then, thanks.
---
Not new.
---
Exactly what I was thinking as well. The OP is so invested in the success of this game that any criticism whether warranted or not, he takes a personal attack. And retorts in a childish way.
---
oh well that is not good! im at work so i cant verify until later tonight, im on PS4 though so it might be due to any mods you have set up on PC?
---
gotcha, thanks.
---
and the poster is at all train stations to read
---
I checked their twitter just now, it seems that is the issue, thanks
---
Stop using mods!!! At least try to disable them. We get this after every single patch when will people learn
---
Do we have a date yet?
---
I've rebuilt my camp close to 30 times before they patched your camp disappearing from someone else being there.  So I'd say walk it off.
---
YES! YES! YES!
---
True. The days of owning software are over. Now we all purchase a revocable licence to use.
---
Agreed
---
Might be better off uninstalling and then reinstalling.
---
I remember that. Never played it but I just read up on it a bit, and the players seem to agree that it isn’t s friendly place.
---
I like the idea, but I think it would be important to consider the reason so many players already hate Scorchbeasts. How would this be similar or different? Would there be an audio clue that you're being stalked? Would it feel fun and rewarding, or prompt players to fast-travel or jump servers?
---
You only get benifit from Adrenal at 50% or less pretty sure. Its an all or nothing kinda deal. Bloodied is different since its 5%hp = 5% damage.
---
u/ladydevann
---
Assuming you're a pc player, did you ever use mods and just removed them from your custom.ini?  If you ever used ratmonkey's item tags then you're going to have to delete the files added to it in "Fallout76/Data/Strings".
---
^(Yes!) YES! **YES!**
---
Nukashine = instant get hammered!
---
The DLC is all free broseph.
---
I mean people were claiming to have carried 10s of thousands of pounds of things.  I think this will definitely hurt them.  Although you're right it doesn't 100% break mules which, in my opinion, I wish it did.  For a community so fervent against pay2win everyone seems to be okay with purchasing extra stash space.
---
Looking forward to all these updates. Looks like a lot of fun new additions so far.
---
There should be a warning when they go to make a harassment report that informs the user of what does and doesn’t constitute as harassment. This warning will also inform them that if they report people for benign things that aren’t harassment that their account will be flagged and excessive report abuse will result in action taken on the account up to and including a ban.
---
Calling someone defeatist nihilist pessimists is considered by many to be considered..... 'being a toxic asshole'. So that may be your problem with being misunderstood.
---
My rule of thumb is if you don't have the stones to say to a man's face....... don't say it on the internet.
---
Not in the same way, you know when  mole rats are burrowing to find you cause they are teleporting everywhere, whereas what I'm going for is that you don't know it's following you until it attacks
---
And is ultimately the most important point I’m trying to make. Who actually enjoys having to grind in a game just so they don’t miss something? Every game these days wants to be a “live service” and it baffles me that the gaming community is so supportive of it. If there’s a limited time event going on in five different games in the same week you’re likely going to miss out on something because it simply isn’t possible to do all the grinding or reasonable to keep dropping 10-20 dollars on a skin(s) in each title. 
---
Games have turned into jobs that are sold piecemeal. People keep acting like mictrotransactions are the villain destroying gaming recently but they’re just a symptom of these live service BS that, as you said, causes an urge to spend because nothing puts pressure on people like time and a desire to not be left out. It needs to end sooner than later. Everyone should be against this exclusivity issue.
---
Stealth fix ✔️
---
VATS fix ✔️
---
Legendary drop fix ✔️
---
Well done BGS. Those 3 were critical. Maybe Gun-Fu will be usable now, can't wait to get home and try it.
---
Possibly because they don't want people using unverified mods on a game that has had issues with unscrupulous players exploiting certain mechanisms. It doesn't mean that everyone one using mods is shifty, just that Bethesda would like a level play field for everyone.
---
It's just the first quest. Biv will keep giving you quests for recipes.
---
Oh, no, sorry was reading a discussion about the Welcome Mats you could use to set  your spawn point at your CAMP, somehow glossed over that this discussion was about radios.
---
That's the idea, there's gotta be a bigger fish to keep people in power armor holding two shots on their toes lol
---
Material bugs have been resolved.
---
you are very welcome, i have ,y base hanging off a cliff so initially the game would spawn me at the foot of the cliff, and each item i would have to hike all the way up...very annoying!
---
so once i heard about the CAMP machine fix, i was able to finally find a  place for it that the game would them spawn me right at my front door! much better!
---
good luck!
---
? They didn't change anything significant.
---
Wtf.
---
I think i just came
---
Yeah some things aren't there like survival they're coming later in this month
---
Something is wrong with the shag carpet now.  It's just a flat grey texture and looks more like concrete than before.
---
Lol. Hey Bethesda I installed a mod that broke my game. Fix it.
---
Me about a man
---
+1 for “whilst”
---
I will load 4lc and see if I can get a proc on a crit. My understanding is. That 3 ranks in 4lc gives you a 13% proc chance.
---
That silver Handmade skin is going to look so good with the Silver Shroud outfit.
---
The one thing I've found to prevent base attacks is to have only 1 or 2 foundation pieces actually toughing the ground.  For some reason the game seems to calculate base attacks only when you have a bunch of foundations.  
---
My current base has 1 foundation, the rest is technically above the ground, and it gets attacked maybe once out of every 20 or 30 times I travel to it.  Last few bases had at least 4, maybe 6-8+ foundations and got attacked almost 100% of the time.
---
God damn. Might have to stop giving Bugthesda such a hard time every other post...
---
Thank you, Betheseda, for listening.
---
I don't think that there is a Speed Demon perk, it is a mutation. There is a Dead Man Sprinting perk (that had reportedly have bugs).
---
I am curious which has been fixed.
---
Maybe an abandon workshop option would help. I actively farm workshops when I take them. I know some people claim them for the plans you get. Workshops have a high rate of rare plan rewards.
---
It'd make sense if you could capture a workshop get the resources you need then abandon it. I personally server hop when I'm done with them. It usually takes an hour to get enough fusion cores to last a few days. Server hopping avoids PvP.
---
To fix this you need to do this:
---
1. Remove all lines from [Archive] section in your Fallout76Custom.ini
---
2. Add this line instead: sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2
---
3. Put you mods at the end like so:
---
sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2, BeardsFix.ba2, PA-HoloHUD.ba2
---
4. Enjoy not falling through the ground.﻿
---
Dude - the whole slap system was just to give less capable people chance against stronger. If there was no meant to be PVP in open world and it was so "Harassing", they wouldn't even add it to the game first place.
---
Exactly, they've got one real blemish on their entire history of games (that I can of). That blemish is the initial release of this game. I trust in them. However, fool me once, fool me twice. They are a good company that I believe actually cares about its community. I mean they are going through pain staking efforts to satisfy every major complaint/request. I.e. new quests, legendary vendors, legendary prestiges, stash increases, tse nerf, pvp mode, being able to place items in your camp like magazines and bobble heads, energy gun buff, etc. On top of this they've fixed almost every bug to get the game up to par to where it shouldve been released at (righting their wrong).
---
Im not exactly a fan boy, but I will give credit where credit is due. It could be worse, I mean, look at how Activision is treating the BO4 community. Its sickening. They make EA look like a charity.
---
fake and homosexual
---
I can't see my own post?
---
Shitty, but not much of an 'abuse' if he only makes 100+ caps before the trick doesn't work any more  
---
If he had teammates keeping you on for full damaging and killing you repeatedly that would be abusey
---
Those were references to the big libowski!  Its a movie and everyone should see it!!
---
You used the same language and nihilist in the movie used... and i referenced your language with a move reference... Also called myself the dude and invited you to play with me and mentioned white russians so you would know the insult was tounge in cheek as i was referencing a movie...
---
Still it went right over your head and you took offense!!!
---
Yeah, that’s literally all we take them for is the plans an a free FT point
---
My quest won’t start
---
Huh
---
Well here on Reddit that’s an immediate banning offense. 
---
I agree I wouldn’t know how to share audio threats via ingame other than record them and upload to Bethesda’s ingame servicedesk software.
---
I’ve identified fo76 software issues and done screen grabs to upload ingame and that’s helped
---
Good luck
---
Mod configuration needs to be changed if you have any installed, there are a few posts about that.
---
Like I said above these enemies would be triggered by certain conditions whereas just roaming around in the world, say for example theres different enemies that have different conditions you meet for a chance they spawn gonna go with the death claw again, An example would be -Carrying Spoiled meat/Below 50% HP or Currently Crippled/Not in Combat
---
There have been several posts about this already, with the solution spelled out in them.
---
Keep 3 star legendarys you find. Some one will want them, some will be worth alot more than you think.
---
yes you’re the only one.
---
Exactly, I like the game, but I’m not blinded to the fact that it’s a shit game. Bethesda has a longways to go before this game can be considered finished. Notice how whenever someone does a post complaining about Youtubers criticising the game, the sub never bashes Youtubers who have nothing, but glowing praise for it, like Oxhorn.
---
I've had to rebuild my camp because I got the message when I logged in that it had been deleted with the update, presumably the area is to be use in a quest. It allowed me to rebuild it in the exact same place though. When I logged in again (after a crash and the computer locking up when exiting) it did the same thing again.
---
Just wait til you get a lever action, so much better than the hunting rifle.
---
I've seen those in a few places, they are usually pretty close to actual fissure sites so I didn't pay attention to them. If there is one that is a significant distance from any fissure site I will be adding them.
---
Aww, what a cutie
---
"we are happy to announce all limited time quest rewards will be available for sale in the atom shop"
---
I wouldn't put it past them to pull something like that. Hell, I'm sure they would put these patches behind a paywall if they could.
---
Lmao I never saw that
---
This link is the easiest way I could think to show a photo of what is taking place.

---
I will but it’s annoying because I have to go to work now and can’t finish. It would be nice if they included in the patch notes what the new limitations are though So I can plan and adjust accordingly. This is a pretty big change to leave out.
---
holy shit that excavator skin looks awesome, Thanks
---
I really think they would have offered one already if they had any intention of doing so. It would appear as though Bethesda would rather you make different characters to try out different builds. 
---
Personally I agree with that and feel a full-respec is too much. They met us halfway in the middle and allow us to move one Special per level up after level 50. That made me happy.
---
I was once killed cooking at a nearby CAMP. I honestly don't think the guys that did it expected it to happen. They both shot at me point blank with Explosive Shotguns. Instantly dropped me.
---
They talked about the CAMP change that you’re talking about like a week or two ago.
---
I tried placing one for ten minutes and gave up in frustration. The door/wall pass through is so much easier.
---
3 nuclear materials and a quantum? Hope it's worth it
---
plastic is pretty valuable
---
You must be a melee player. Show me that build and I'll show you plenty of weaknesses.  There is a reason you see posts about people starting new characters to try different builds.
---
If only there were some place you could post, or *read*, about stuff like this.
---
In that case, we would have a new xp farming method:  team up with any random player, go afk and get rewarded for doing nothing!
---
Ok imma make some updates to my camp and I’ll link a vid later today
---
swapping cards isn't the same as swapping special points. Your not swapping from a melee min/max build to a vats stealth build by swapping cards and being optimal in both. Sure you can run a melee build and swap so you can start a battle off with a few shots as a mob closes the distance, but its not going to put you at god mode.
---
That seems more like good news, good news.
---
I mean that’s what it told me then and then I couldn’t place it because it said items were floating so I just assumed it was because they changed the distance you can build a floor away from a foundation or pillar. Ark survival evolved has the same limitations.
---
Seriously that thing is beautiful
---
Ok I have 0 mods installed for Fallout 76.  At present I do not have any mods for even Fallout 4 on my PC.  So any further help would be great as a few items from the shop can still be seen.  I must suspect another issue
---
Apparently not. Check  Bethesda's reply
---
like i said, why aren't those basic features in the base game yet.
---
What if *my* favorite part is *you* losing your junk too?
---
You mean falling through the world? Thats a problem with mods not the game
---
Good movie. I do remember that now. It sounds much less offensive when you put it that way. Quotation marks would probably have helped.
---
Your alcoholism has affected us in the following ways... You are annoying!
---
Can you check the Command room? With the officer vendor!?
---
thanks for the hint, but i am not a bethesda nanny and i expect that bethesda is monitoring social media for useful information like my bug description.

Sheesh. Thanks for the reply
---
It’s not in the patch notes.
---
Wish the door was closed/fixed but still, so much nicer.
---
Did you modify your ini at some point?
---
that worked, thanks.
---
It's your custom ini. Scroll through some of the recent posts, you're not the only one.
---
r/T_D and Qanon (before it got banned) like to use the quotes when talking about the deepstate
---
Do you mean the Command room?
---
You can put a shitload of effort in making a decent non-melee build, or just go melee and be OP.
---
I didn't buy the blackbird skin and I still regret it.
---
It did look very different to vaults, hopefully it's some other underground structures. We all know vaults are coming out later anyways, would be nice to have more underground stuff, the game is really lacking in that.
---
Haven't tried at vendors but I am having trouble inspecting my own gear in my inventory. Something's wrong
---
10k junk???? Really??
---
Damage has been nerfed quite significantly. I don't know if it was supposed to give you up to 95% more damage at 5% health or not but if I go that low, I used to do 1800 damage with a bloodied Black Powder Rifle. Now it's 1000. If I stay at around 19% for Nerd Rage to kick in, I go from 550 damage on my Bloddied Lever Action Rifle to 450. The 100 damage nerf sucks but you can still 1-shoot charred ghouls without sneaking.  
---
Not worth it going below 19% health anymore.
---
I was just as hyped. Too bad that plate didn't get fixed. Still good
---
Lmao my god here we go, now because I lift so much I must be doing steroids! Dude you’re literally the exact type of jealous envious sorry bastard that just hates on everyone that’s doing better than you, and chalks it all up to “they must be cheating somehow!”. You’re a fucking sorry piece of shit man, improve yourself.
---
Are you using the mod Save Everything? If so, try temporarily disabling it.
---
It doesn't.  Especially after that change to workshops (challenge from anywhere?  Really, Bethesda Austin?) that put things so badly in the favor of griefers.  I don't even bother for the workshop plans anymore, unless I see zero bounties on the map.
---
I had a 3 star glowing deathclaw (lvl 91) at WS during a nuke that dropped nothing... I was in disbelief, and I still mourn the loss of what could have been.
---
If they put Slocum's Joe stuff in and don't give us the ability to craft or even buy donuts with caps we riot ok
---
sick bastard i had ballistic fiber XD
---
you ever modified your ini files?
---
I'm pretty sure I saw deep pocketed something in a vendor list but it was like, trapper. I've read (on reddit) that you can't scrap stuff that has plans.  So, if it's on the list of plans, you supposedly can't scrap it. I've scrapped hundreds of combat armor arms and still am only 1/3 on ultralight mod and I don't think I've seen deep pocketed yet. I 've server hopped and farmed for dozens of hours and never seen a BoS mod plan.  I don't actually go for Deep pocketed though because I'm a stealth build and I'm focused on Ultralight for the extra sneak.
---
At this point the sunk cost for me is colossal and I am really looking for clarity from reps like u/Valseek (Thanks for the reply!) to determine whether I'm investing lots of game time in something that just isn't possible or is broken.
---
And now, a haiku:
---
Read before you post
---
New topic's not needed, son
---
Question's been answered
---
The Ultracite Prototype Excavator paint looks like Bumblebee from Transformers.
---
Is there really any blue light coming off a green pipboy though?
---
Is this also true for herd mentality and empath that dont display correctly?
---
How would the player perceive that they were being stalked, and how would they learn about the trigger (e.g. that it was attracted by spoiled meat)? Having clever mechanics doesn't enhance the player's experience if they cannot perceive the cause and effect. It would just feel arbitrary, or feel like a bug. Those mechanics can be disclosed in-game (e.g. via holotape) or out-of-game (e.g. popup tips like seen at low-level). The need for player understanding is even more acute for creatures like Scorchbeasts that roam widely.
---
Check Bethesda's reply. Apparently they are monitoring it
---
Almost missed the sarcasm there, you narrowly avoided a mild-mannered rebuttal ;-)
---
nah i mean getting killed , dropping your junk and then the server crashes or an infinite loading screen
---
No worries, was just surprised at the ingenuity to use a radio for clipping!!  LOL

It's 10**.**0, they just really like empty decimals

Same. ~500 hrs in.  Check everytime I login or logout of a server.
---
Yup, found it on Perk Loadout Manager page! Note that Better Inventory is not compatible yet.
---
I will add that I dont want to spoil the discovery aspect of the game, but the loot pools are so wide that there's almost no information available anywhere about what event/area/vendor I should be focused on to score specific types of plans. We're over 100 days in and gear progression is still really confusing to me.
---
Bagpack has not been added yet.
---
woah, that is insanely hostile for someone who hasn't provided any sources. I am totally willing to say "hey i'm wrong about that" but i'm also not going to find sources for your argument you need to do that. I'm not out here trying to "perpetuate bullshit" I'm out here trying to have a conversation about it. If i'm wrong, prove it with sources, I'll accept. However, right now you look like a huge idiot baby in my eyes. If there's other things going on in your life that you'd like to talk about I'd like to help you out. just send me a DM
---
What a coincidence I have been collecting Plans to get Caps, If you're on Xbox we should meet, I'm cheaper than the vendors.
---
Heyo, is it normal now that you go from 1.8k damage to 1k when @5% hp?  
---
Was it Adrenal Reaction applying twice?   
---
Thank you if you're gonna clarify that.
---
 Here is further examples to shop I have some access. 
---
Super fucked.
---
where is this file? imn in my /data folder can not find a custom ini or a place to put this string.
---
I have my issues with "live service", but I'm coming around to the change because it's where the industry is heading, and when done right, it can make for a better game. Granted, Bethesda got off to a very shaky start, to put it extremely mildly. Today's patch put me a bit at ease, they are putting in content, and they are addressing a lot of issues (which should have been addresses from the start, but yea, what's done is done). Time will tell if they are doing it right and if they game will be better for it, but it looks good so far.
---
Sorry for the tangent, but otherwise, yea, I don't see how exclusivity, especially for purchasable time-exclusive decorations/skins, benefits the game, or community as a whole.
---
Your never going to get away from that. Older MMO's like everquest have become primarily a solo game because eveyone boxxes an extra account or 5 so they don't have to group with other people. If there is a way for people to pay to win a game thats not designed that way either by extra accounts, buying items off ebay etc they will. Quite a few people see paying money as saving time, and if they make enough money in rl to justify it they have no problem paying to save said time.
---
Exactly right. Play the game and not the player.
---
I play on Pc, how can Customer Support know if the player reported for harassment or threats is guilty or not?  
---
Is voice chat recorded or something like that?
---
I havent heard of those happing much any more at all, but yeah that would kinda suck.
---
Seems the running theme.
---
Last patch some guy was demanding bethesda fix the perk loadout mod because it stopped working after the patch so they clearly have a responsibility to change the patch and make the mod work.
---
You know those little messages that pop up and say things like you are thirsty or you are feeling tired etc?
---
\*The smell of spoiled meat begins to exude from your bag\*
---
\*All the extra junk in your bag bustles about noisily\* 
---
little immersion cues like when the prompt for the booby trapped body on the raider quest
---
I think I can live without 2-3 star wooden armor legendarys.
---
I would rather being playing Fallout than being here at work. Oh, responsibilities!!
---
Odd that there are a variety of different experiences involving the SBQ. I too have killed her with just 6 of us .. and have killed her with 15 people. Have had the opposite happen as well as we watch her sail off into the sky.  I get that he Buff depends on how many people are there .. but strange to have so many different results with the same MOB ..
---
All I want to know is what the limitations are. It would be nice to know that before building something and having to tear it down because I didn’t know. Do you have a link? It’s is the inside the vault blog or whatever?
---
Have you submitted a bug report?
---
For you specifically, since you won't use vats, I recommend carrying a gamma gun for sentinel users. Throw a barrage of shots at them, swap to your rifle, and peg them as they try and dodge the shots. It completely throws them into a panic. 
---
Without vats, the biggest damage boost you will get is from sneak attack related perks. I imagine your special will look like 15 perception and agility. Use something with a silencer and you can grab the mister sandman perk for 50% more sneak attack damage at night. A well placed headshot at night should be multiplying your damage by six times.
---
You have had some mods installed in the past and you deleted them but haven't fixed the files. Do that. There are tons of articles telling what you should do. Don't say it's the problem with the game. It's the mods
---
It’s a mod you’re running
---
Wow. I have been waiting for that!!
---
Was the BoS combat armor plans availability addressed in this patch?  I didn't see that explicitly addressed, so I'm guessing not.
---
so.... you weren't for this catastrophe?
---

Shhhhh .. Not so Loud they gonna hear you .. "Cough" Cough " Next nerf ... what ?

Nah, they need to add temporary events so they can create demand for a small pool of content to then add for sale in the atom shop.
---
That's on them, if they even bothered to report him.
---
If everyone who threatened to sue someone *actually* filed a lawsuit, everyone in the world would be a lawyer.  Thankfully, threats are worth as much as the paper they're written on.

Bunch of other topics on the same subject, incompatibility with certain mods and custom .ini might be causing the issue.
---
/slowclap
---
Agreed. Death to mules. Good job Bethesda!
---
Ok. Thanks! I'll shut the mods down and try again. Thank you for your answere! :-)
---
How does someone acquire all of that legitimately when your can't run anywhere, are slowed down every 10 seconds and can't far travel anywhere?
---
You buy another copy of the game and use it to make characters which hold your extra stuff. Since it's a different account, you can have them both online to trade with each other
---
I always imagined that she's 20, was born in the Vault, mother died at birth and her father had to raise her. He was a young scientist shortly before the war and was trying to teach her basic medical training. He left the Vault before her and I role play that he's still somewhere out there.
---
You won't happen to be on Xbox would you?  I desperatly need someone to paint my t6
---
Ugh no mods installed but I got the missing textures thing last time. It has to do with my files being locked and not easily changed by launcher or something.
---
I never played it, so I don't know exactly what it's qualifiers are. But it's entirely possible, yes. It's fairly common for browser games to make the mistake of calling themselves an MMO simply because the server can hold 2,000 players simultaneously, and yet only 2-4 people can play together. That's partially what I was talking about, when I said people have been playing fast and loose with the term "MMO" for so long that it's almost completely diluted now.
---
Originally it meant a massive amount of people, playing together, in the same place, at the same time. Some MMOs delivered on it, many non-MMOs couldn't, but still insisted on calling themselves that.
---
I've got 2 of these, one i made before i finished the BoS quests where i got a second.
---
Not jealous.
---
That's an impressive lift. Especially if you are drug free.
---
According to EXRX your squat has you in the elite category. You should be competing as a power lifter. I know 250+ pound muscle heads who can't even squat 405 past parallel. Assuming you are breaking parallel that is extremely impressive.
---
I have an Instigating Ultracite laser pistol with +50 Vats crit damage and faster crit refill. Thinking it wants to get turned into a rifle. Do you have a trade list somewhere and are you active on the market76 Reddit/discord?
---
Please learn how to identify a typo as a typo and not a misspelling, you presumptuous troll.  Since I clearly don't know HOW to spell the word 'please'.  I saw it after I hit submit and didn't bother editing it because only a petty, bitter little loser would try to invalidate my comment because I have fat thumbs.  I was mistaken it seems.
---
I probably spent an hour searching the entire bunker for a stash box.  I refused to believe they didnt place one down there and of course i always sold what i had on me at Whitespring before making my way to the enclave.  It was only a minor inconvenience, but not anymore!!  Woohoo!  Thanks!
---
The game is still unplayable for all you haters though.
---
New unarmed weapon? Some sort of skull?
---
Easily... I met a player last night on ps4 who didn’t even know the stash box existed
---
I can to the thread for help in addressing an issue and now being labeled as someone bashing the game.  I can only again repeat the I have never modded Fallout 76 at any point in my play time EVER.  The only game on my PC with any mods is Civilization 6.  I would doubt that is my conflict.  If you have a link to any of these articles please share so I can try to address my issue and get back to enjoying this game.
---
50 is max level but Intelligence and some perk cards allow for higher durability weapons to be made
---
Do you have low health? Also make sure to use nerd rage at low health.
---
Yeah. Those sorts of immersive messages sound good to me. I still don't think a global enemy would be wise, but the Mire could use something freaky like that. I think there would need to be an intermittent audio clue as well. Dev notes are good, but I don't think you can assume many players keep up with all the patch notes.
---
Yes. Inspecting your own gear I noticed is very inconsistent. Sometimes there's no specs. Sometimes the specs are wrong -- mods aren't showing up, damage is for the base model not the modded one. But sometimes it's fine.
---
Pretty much all mod users should make it a habit to check the sResourceArchive2List =  line in their Fallout76.ini and make sure it's the same in their Fallout76Custom.ini
---
Great PSA, also Bethesda, get your damn act together.
---
I have not modified the ini files ever.
---
They have marked new areas as "not buildable". If you were in this zone. You can move your camp free. If you used glitches to make the camp. Tough luck. Rebuild. 
---
I also carry 3, max carry weight excavator, t51 nuka cola with the jet pack for everyday use, and my still not modified the way i want X-01 for nuke zones. My X-01 is in the vault tech scheme so i have a 1 out of 2 chance of getting the one i want from the other 2.
---
Nope. No mods. Base game as is from Bethesda on PC since the Beta.
---
I appreciate you providing a video showing that I am wrong. Is it possible me or someone on my team had PvP turned on at the time and that caused me and my teammate to die? Because now, I have more questions about that moment. I wish I was quick to take videos then as I am now. 
---
TL;DR: I'M WRONG Y'ALL. LIKE, MAD WRONG. 
---
I just wanna know if my adrenal is working. I know i have to use nerd rage etc. my health is at 20%. is 380 dmg too low? I guess so
---
ANTHEM bricks ps4s. Youtubers dont make the mistakes, game publishers do. They just talk about it. Also its their job to be on top of it.
---
I've heard a way of displaying things in your stash is coming. hopefully displaying armor/power armor is one of them.
---
I tried a nuke shine, blacked out and ended up at an unmarked spot halfway across the map with a scorch beast attacking me.
---
Best drink in game by far.
---
No it's not meant to be a global enemy thing it's more of an extra layer of random encounter based on a players personal condition. Like for example a lvl 14 in the forest isn't going to get a deathclaw spawned on him vs a lvl 50 in the mire would you know?
---
It hasn't been released yet.
---
Oh man, I am so close to playing this game.
---
&gt; Legendary Creatures: Now always drop a legendary item on death.
---
Thank FSM
---
Fucking boat on time?
---
Thanks for keeping up the hard work. So many welcome changes and fixes at once! The invisible team mates one was a pain! I'm going to spend some real money in the atomic shop tonight to show my appreciation.
---
The ini file has never been altered.  How do I possibly correct this issue?
---
You sure you're not missing? It will still display the critical hit message if you miss, but will still queue the crit for the next hit and display the msg again. Very difficult to notice on high HP targets like SBQ where you can hardly see if you hit or not.
---
Your comment is already invalid since you saw the 3/4th was already a losing battle, so you got triggered that I told you learn how to spell. So I go again, learn how to spell, and argue.
---
Oh absolutely.  At the end of the day someone can just buy a third account if they really want to circumvent this.  I just meant that mules don't seem to be the intended way to play the game given the update.  And this update did at least hurt them somewhat, so for me that's a bonus.
---
This is caused by a mod, either Save Everything or Better Inventory. Disable them and wait for an update.
---
I'm not using any mods currently. It's just weird...
---
Yeah... 380 damage is low for a Bloodied explosive gatling gun, I do more then that with a tse.
---
Hold On .. I am not so Sure it's a waste .. he has a valid Point .. we are not going to kill her every time .. Don't Take it like he is attacking you. This poster is just saying it as it is .. And his Point of Build  a bridge and get over it .. Is advice telling you that you hit an impasse ... So fix it so you can get passed it.
---
 I was with you up till this point. Now I gotta say Whats with the "GTFO" ? hahah reddit/Internet as a whole is a strange bag .. You post something and we assume people are attacking us when they reply with a different POV .. but its all words on a screen with no Context .. I read his reply to you in a totally different way and you came in at a 100 when he was at a 10 .. ?
---
I think i yelled with excitement at too much of this
---
Maybe you shouldn't have cheated...
---
Dude I started playing like 5 days ago, I had no idea mods would affect the game like this, don't be rude
---
You KNEW they were duped. 
---
As I said before... buying coke cheap, and then selling it for a markup, doesn't make you innocent.
---
Thanks.  👍
---
Nope. Difference between a lvl 50 and a lvl 450 is legendaries. Welcome to the hunt.
---
terrible patch for breaking mods
---
Todd says you were doing it wrong. Sorry. 
---
Ive managed to keep all my stuff on one toon and a never have to farm either. Let me know if you need inventory management tips. Here is a few:
---
Junk you use: keep 16 BULK max
---
Ballistic fiber: 300 max
---
Junk you rarely use: 10 BULK max
---
White knight when repairing. 
---
Your camp can grow all the food/water/dirty water for a day. I make about 30 corn soups when i log in. No need to ever stash food/water. 
---
Buy whisky/buff meds from players who run bars when you meet them. Clear them out. 
---
Keep no more than 100 meds of your choice. Stimpaks and wisky for me. 
---
You never need more than 40 radaway, radx diluted etc.  I just carry them.
---
Sorry to break it to you. But you are a hoarder. Hoarders are gross. Its a bad habit lol.
---
Ive considered making a mule for all the 3 star legendarys im aquiring but i havent done so yet. 
---
I dont use any weight perks or gear. No QOL perks at all on my build.
---
My bloodied gatlin is non explosive and it's at 405 with 30% hp, two 3 level cards and 1 one level card. My bloodied gatlin plasma is at 201 (also not explosive) and my instigating explosive is at 295 with no demolitions expert. I have all three of those primed as well.
---
I didn’t use any glitches. I am talking about they changed how far away from a foundation you can build floor or assume that’s what happened. It says I can’t place my camp because items are floating. I’m just trying to figure out what the new limitations are without wasting time figuring them out on my own so I can plan accordingly before I attempt to rebuild my camp. Building my camp is probably my favor part of the game so it’s frustrating when they change aspects of it without nothing the changes.
---
Holy good lord batman. I've been absent since December and this alone will bring me back for a bit.
---
Wow, if only there was a way you could have avoided getting banned! Can't believe Bethesda can get away with forcing people to exploit, they should be taken to task!
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Currently addicted to Warframe, not a MMO as far as I can tell but the chat window is not a fun place there either.
---
Help!  I violated the TOS I agreed to and now I'm banned and it's their fault
---
Assuming no other damage boosters like chems and bobble heads active - I’d say yes.  Even with maxed out heavy gunner perks and bloody mess on non bloodied/adrenal my damage is 168 on a prime Gatling pre patch so it would seem you’re getting the bloodied and adrenal benefits to get to your number.
---
should i try to re-apply my adrenal?
---
Bethesda don't make the mods.
---
Oh from what I had seen it is in the game but the mission surrounding it isn’t yet
---
It's a good thing my main exploring armor has a blood filtering mod.
---
I saw a bunch of new players online last night. I think word is spreading but really hope the servers can keep us with the influx.
---
No it comes out like may 9
---
So as long as we keep mules under 1500 we're good?
---
1 cap
---
depends on what you mean by "buggy mess". i don't have server crashes at all anymore, but i sometimes have to back out to the main menu just to accept team invites. they won't work while in-game for some reason. not a big deal to me, but hey some people would call that a dealbreaker. plus, my experiences aren't the standard. everyone has different issues. but personally, i've been playing since the BETA and honestly this is the smoothest it's ever run.
---
Am I the only one enjoying this. Just love the salt XD 
---
I mean he's right, maybe not 3/4th but a good 1/2 of the population that played the 1st day is gone and probably won't come back
---
I've tried interacting with him several times since completing the "main" quest and he doesn't offer any new quests to learn more recipes.
---
Enjoy you 1* mutant slayer wooden leg 
---
here we go .
---
If you already had the base built it's grandfathered in and won't be removed you just can't build them anymore
---
No shit, Sherlock?!
---
so what perk cards and mutations are you using exactly?
---
TLDR
---
STAY TUNED ON MY PAID VIDEOS ON WHY MY BAN IS BETHESDA'S FAULT
---
Whenever your Wanted level exceeds your caps, you are forced into passive mode. Zero damage to players, zero damage to camps, cannot capture a workshop. Passive will automatically turn off as soon as you acquire the caps or your wanted bounty drops below your cap stash.
---
Maybe the scorchbeasts missed you alot and showing their affection to you and your CAMP.  Well i havent been on yet after the patch so.. 
---
You should check out the Shrouded Mod that you can apply to wood armor because it would actually be best-in-slot for stealth-based builds if it could have three stars!
---

---
Thanks, I deleted my mods but didn't think to edit or remove the custom.ini.
---
The Streets of Laredo -- a tale of tragedy and he smiles the whole time is performing it, gotta love it.
---
Nah... dude killed you for your bounty. If you don't have the caps... then he gets your gear, starting with the most valuable (at ridiculous marked down vendor pricing), at a total of bounty value.
---
Look at it as "he looted your corpse".
---
IF the player is stashing all his gear and caps when he gets a bounty? Then take if from his account.
---
People have been making the assumption that because that first panel in the roadmap mentions it that it is in today. Like I said above, it was just a summary panel. In hindsight, beth should've left it out as it has been causing some slight confusion.
---
Just logged in and checked, if you already built stacked foundations they're still there. You just can't feel them anymore. So anyone with the base your grandfathered in. Just don't ever try move your base
---
What does it do?
---
Yeah I use my PS4 controller with my laptop when I'm transferring items to my mule account.
---
 Are you using the mod Save Everything? If so, try temporarily disabling it.
---
&gt;...also Bethesda, get your damn act together.
---
Sorry, bud, but it's not Bethesda's job to make sure their updates don't cause problems with third-party mods.
---
Why do so many people play stupid? Bethesda warned everyone about mod compatibility yet when they fuck around and find out they start crying and blaming BGS to clean up their mess.
---
I can't interact with him at all. My quest is stuck 
---
the issue is with support. so you mean to tell me . if someone stole your card info . bought a bunch of bethesda shit . and you were trying to get in touch with support to fix the situation . and no one was available to help you . that you wouldn't be the slightest bit upset. ya right
---
What system are you on and have you tried to fully close out and reopen the game?
---
Anyone that had already stacked foundations, they are still there. You just can't restock them so don't move your camp if you want to keep them the way they are
---
Seriously, the characters / faux npcs / cursed all the time.  Raiders in FO4 three the f Bomb out like candy. 
---
I don't use bloodied build anyway, it is just focused on mutations. The twisted muscles and talons make unarmed great, despite my strength only being 3.
---
I use berserker weapons.
---
It's now 414dmg with demolition rank 5. I have 3 heavy cards rank 1 thats it
---
To he'll with that, I want a Mr. Handy with weedwacker attachment.
---
Hurrah. One more place to farm the endless cycle of converting lead into death.
---
Thanks for the follow up.
---
Agreed 100%. NV dead money taught me to Let Go. 
---
People can still trade and carry. Just stop hoarding. 
---
At the time it was my 3 best level 45 weapons. All done up to the hilt. However in the end I eventually got better ones, but I was very pissed off at the time.
---
With all the crap we had to endure in this wasteland... I mean those scorchbeasts alone would drive a person to drinking.. and without drinking.. one only goes mad.  
---
I'd rather be a drunk than a mad man.
---
BALLS! Thanks for the reply :)
---
Np

"useful"
---
mmhhmm

Xbox here, we don't get to fix the game, only play it lol
---
This is Post # 51 about the issue in the last two hours.
---
The person who posts a new thread about it for the 76th time wins 7600 Atoms!
---
wait what?
---
IF ONLY !!! 
---
Cool. I bought it for 5k caps 2 days ago.
---
Np man I'm just as hyped for the vendor to lol
---
You just had to be SUPER bloodied. With Aderenal
---
it's in my documents/my games/fallout 76 usually i think.
---
It means never
---
Mods, can we get this stickied?
---
#HEAVEN
---
Does this really happen?
---
I had only used the GP for a while when I first got it, but it seemed like you keep the cores, they just need to be reloaded when you switch to it? . I'm almost certain you don't lose an entire core every time. 
---
It kinda was, the problem was you weren't dropping combat for it to kick in. Now that they've "fixed stealth" you should be able to get out of combat and healing factor should kick on.
---
Floating objects don't have anything to do with distance from a foundation. For instance. You can use glitches to make round walls. Those wall are floating objects. I have to use a glitch to stack prebuilt stairs. If I were to movey camp the entire thing wouldn't place because of those stairs. This isn't anything new. 
---
Its gonna stay that way too now, I don't think that damage was intended but it sure as hell was nice. 
---
thanks.
---
A the budget buffs were massive, man. I logged out yesterday with a maxed out CAMP budget. Logged in today to see more than a third of it cleared up. Worth noting is I only have about 5 lights and exactly 4 turrets. 
---
Hot wheel is still broken, you can’t have two similar items on it or one of them will disappear.
---
Just fought two dozen gutsy’s at a AWOL event, the legendary three star boss dropped a one-star leg armor valued at 41 caps, just enough to cover the travel. The ‘legendary’ loot is still very poor just like before. 
---
Theyre excruciatingly rare tbh. Gotta save up and get the plans but yeah.
---
Glad they fixed the reload.
---
Blimey right. Some people really do go deep in don’t they lol.
---
No they fucking didn’t.
---
Why did you respond to your own post? You do know that you can just edit the post, right?
---
"Here we go" what?
---
Ty sir, it was the first time happening to me even if I've mod installed since a bit.
---
Did something bad happen?
---
The comment section honestly wasn’t that bad, better than it was before 
---
I just want to play the game is all.  You mentioned articles with information involving something around this.  Do you have any access to those?  If something is on my machine I would love some knowledge to address the matter.  Even the scan and repair tool has not worked.
---
It's part of the quest.
---
Probleay the only option you have lmao, I bought 5 before patch just incase something like this happend. 
---
I'm on PC but thank you for the offer
---
What is that exploit? I have not heard of or encountered this exploit before. Please share the impact. You don't need to share how to cause it though.
---
Im also interested if this means all the turrent camps outside WS have finally been dealt with?
---
I suggest re-reading the [roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019) to refresh your memory
---
Is the .50 cal damage increased?  Or still the same?
---
I suspect they forgot to account for barrel changes when they modified the gatling laser.  I wonder how much the 273 standard barrel was reduced to.
---
I got killed by a cheater .everyone that was banned is a cheater .and fuck them all to hell 
---
I didn’t use a glitch though and I had replaced my camp before the patch no problem. So I don’t understand why suddenly I can’t? I think it has to be due to a new limitation place on floors away from the foundation. Of course I don’t really know and nothing in the patch notes gives me any clarity 
---
Sorry friend, quest spoiler haahaa!
---
It comes down to preference, I didn't like the barn set anywhere near as much as I thought I might and the brick... I much prefer the steel walls, mixed in with a little warehouse and concrete defences, looks the dogs proverbial bollocks 😁
---
Nothing says I love you like spewing a toxic cloud on those you love.
---
Yea mods, soon as i changed the ini file all was right with the world
---
I spawned in a world where someone took my camp spot near huntersville, so I investigated being curious.  
---
It was a full on concrete bunker with the only way in was by removing a block via camp building. 
---
At least now every camp will have to have one proper entrance **somewhere**
---
That seems reasonable. 
---
If I see one more “why can’t I romance the Assaultrons?” post, it’ll be another day.

Pretty sure u can see it in any train station.

**The official website also has all of this included in todays patch, but the patch NOTES do not mention any of this. So is this stuff in the patch or not?**
---
This has happened to me twice now and since it's THE spawn point for everybody joining the server at Whitesprings my junk was up for grabs, too. Very frustrating.
---
ya i know . nice name btw . not even being funny when i say that . 
---
It seems to me the longer my camp is in one location, the more often my "housemates" show up.  I recently moved my camp like 15 feet and poof, didnt see mob for a week or so...now they're back.
---
I always expect to see about 4 ghouls or robots when i return home, dont have a problem with that...i dont like having dead bodies laying around my house though.  Its gross, and smelly, and utterly unsanitary.  Wish i could drag them outside by the ankle and toss em in the river and throw the river into the sun.  Other than that, it has no effect whatsoever on my gameplay.  A dead scorch beast in my house would be slightly annoying however...glad that doesn't happen.
---
you can't beat Deezer's lemonade!
---
I've encountered this issue several times, and it usually involves multiple players working together to grief a High level player in hopes of getting a big Payoff.
---
I don't fully understand how the Damage nerf works for someone without enough Caps, but I would recommend a 100% PvP damage nerf on anyone with under 250 caps, period, and not just after they are killed for doing 400 damage to someone's CAMP. I also believe anyone who doesn't have the Caps to pay their bounty should become Lootable by the player the bounty is owed to.
---
If Bethesda ever truly fixes &amp; balances the PvP system, I would actively engage PvP on a regular basis, but as it is currently, there are simply too many ways for players to exploit the system, and tip the scales heavily in their favor while risking nothing.
---
I was led to believe the damage from Adrenal would actually INCREASE as they kept saying it was bugged and everybody was complaining about the damage nerf. Now they dropped it? This is going to be a headache and a half
---
It is in the Atomic Shop as a free item, or in various places in the world like train stations and around Morgantown.
---
blame the booze!!
---
I'm sorry. The whole thing with Reddit is new to me, and I got a bit frustrated about the game not working, so I didn't think about searching for topics first. But now I know. Thanks.
---
There's the shooting range near grafton,  that could become a central hub for weapon testing builds. I'd prefer that than eating into CAMP space. 
---
1 cap, a nuka cola bottle and maybe a bubblegum bear.
---
Shhhh it should be more to your liking now.
---
And thats garbage. Cause the 900 damage i eas at like 10hp. Anyways, my friend and i had the same bloodied lever rifle and his was still 150 more than mine.  So. Ya, i vote broken.  
---
From what I've read, any train station, vtu campus, and possibly the atom shop
---
Now i have 414 dmg with adrenal, 3 rank 1 heavy perks and demolition rank 5. what do you think? working or not?
---
Player reporting is about to get misused like crazy. 
---
It’s imagine thats what they were trying to address. 
---
MAY 23 according to the road map.
---
Well, I'd get ahold of my credit card company... not the vendor that sold the shit the thief bought... they can't do a damn thing for me.
---
You're one of, how many... 1000s? of dupers and exploiters that are currently salivating and rationalizing why you got banned, and hoping to get back into a game... to... what, exactly? Try and find new exploits? Take out your anger on other players? 
---
I'm genuinely curious... what's the end goal here? You gonna log in and start playing by the rules?
---
NV dlc was best dlc
---
I feel like rape happens in that room....carbonated rape...
---
So from the last time you moved your camp to now, you never moved or altered anything? That's what you are saying? 
---
Hey, chill dude, I didn't know, I'm a new player, I didn't even know they warned about it till now, no need to be an ass
---
Get it free from the Atomic shop or fast travel to Vault-Tec University
---
Patch*
---
Are they really going to allow sloths and behemoths to spawn in the forest? That's what the trailer implies. That's pretty extreme even for events. RIP newbs. 
---
No, he’s just one of those people.
---
Probably will see extra people for a while because the Nukashine Quest posters are supposedly around the University (based on what Bethesda has said, haven't actually logged on yet). Although they're also buildable as Camp objects so lotsa people might do it from Camp 🤷 but still, might explain a higher presence there for a while
---
Upcoming patches will give you the ability to decorate your camp with junk from your stash, so I would imagine placeable gnomes are in the near future.  I know the devs also have said they are working on the ability to re-name your PA.
---
Exactly 
---
So excited!
---
Doesn't the damage increase provide more armor penetration? I thought that was the benefit of raising it.
---
Except, you didn’t understand a god damn thing. Ignorance is bliss, I guess. 
---
Now you've confused me entirely.
---
You got banned for being killed by a cheater? But everyone that was banned is a cheater? I'm confused.
---
There is a whole lot of difference between mods not working and causing anyone with a custom ini-file to auto-die and loose their junk (which could be a very substantial setback to someone).
---
So, _bud_, with all due respect, I beg to differ.
---
Perk cards: level 1 master heavy gunner, level 3 heavy gunner, level 3 expert gunner. Level 1 nerd rage. Level 3 stabilized. Level 4 adrenaline (numbers given are with no kills). Level 3 bloodied mess. Level 3 one gun army. That's all the cards pertaining to my heavy gun. 
---
Mutations: adrenal reaction, carnivore, healing factor, marsupial, scaly skin, speed demon, twisted muscles. 
---
I also have a furious non explosive gatlin that I don't have primed and it's damage is 197. 
---
The looter In me still has nightmares from that dlc
---
That's why they added a new control for radios "in the world"...
---
Been watching his stuff for a while! Hes very entertaining. The grenade launcher video had laughing pretty good. 
---
now is a good time to hop in as content is coming in every week or 2 weeks, look up the roadmap for exact dates
---
I wait until they land and hit them with mini nukes. Killing them in-flight is very difficult, especially for lower level folk.
---
THE BEAST? HE HAUNTS THESE WOODS
---
I just gave up two weeks ago because of bugs. Maybe I’ll give it one last try. I mean, it was only 2 months of my life last time...
---
Almost exactly my experience.  I posted just last week detailing my woes and frustrations in detail (I KNEW THEY WERE MORE THAN A MYTH).  Long story short , I too, found 2 shocks within a couple hours of each other after 135+ levels of everyday grinding.  
---
I really don’t get the issue here. Can someone explain?
---
I wonder if those are the raids that were discussed in the road map?  I'm thinking specifically of the other Vaults.
---
If you look below I listed what all I'm using with mine. I don't use demo expert. And when I do I only use 1 rank of it. 
---
They have more perk cards to choose from lol
---
Thanks I know how to play the game, what I choose to keep is up to me and what you choose is up to you.  Am not a lemming lol  I play my way, you play yours.  Thanks for your personal suggestion.
---
All4Catastrophe
---
so i guess my adrenal is working. what do you say?
---
And I haven't read anything about limitations on floors. Where did you read this? Can you copy it over? 
---
PvP targets! Always in excavator armor too!
---
Ive killed plenty of players at a workshops with 1000+ lbs of junk. 
---
Why??? Just why!?!
---
Now i gotta sell this shit to vendors! Thanks for the 3000 caps but jeez its a bit of a chore! I usually pull in players from  my guild to travel with me on a selling spree when we hit the PvP jackpot like that. 
---
It happens more than you would think. Once or twice a week at least. 
---
Why u need 700 cloth????
---
Haven't been called son for over 35 years now. I'm 53 this year. :-D
---
Good to know!
---
Tbh I dont think so since the vaults were confirmed for the next batch of dlc not the wild apalachia, these seem to be like the tunnels that we see in the train places, idk I wonder if there will be bosses or something, I see a mirelurk queen in the video
---
I was going to grow a few crops and try herbivore.   Maybe I'll wait until I eat all my dog food first though. 
---
Is there a download file for the patch today?
---
That sucks. The way it *should* work is to mark the whole team hostile when one of them contests / damages your workshop. There are lots of problems with hostile / wanted status in this game.
---
I would say so. If you really wanna test it, unequip all damage buff cards. Remove your rads to full health. Then rad back up checking damage. Do that on a non bloodied weapon tho. 
---
I didn’t read anything. I’m assuming that’s the case because I couldn’t replace my camp due to floating objects. I never used any exploits or anything to build it. 
---
I’ve been loving it since the beta. Ps. This content is getting released a couple parts each week not at once
---
And how do I actually place it in my camp? I couldn’t find it there
---
Where's my lunch box that got data mined?
---
That water purifer...that lever action skin...that power armor skins...\*heavy breathing\*
---
RadX will suppress mutations temporarily, check your effects to see if that’s it...
---
Fuck MODUS?
---
...and that's how the game got rated "M"...
---
There’s nothing in the notes so that what I’m trying to figure out.
---
I'm having to validate my game files.    
---
No mods. Game is up to date and the patch/DLC is downloaded. Upon logging in, my char takes a few steps and starts falling through the game world. Dying and re spawning at various places doesn't fix it. Aside from Vault 76 and my CAMP within a limited area something is amiss.
---
Still, you would do more damage against most targets after patch. It's not about dps. It's about how hard you hit per shot
---
Agreed, it really Pisses me off when Mole Rats come right up in the middle of my Living room floor, though Concrete &amp; Linoleum and leave a mound on my bearskin rug. I have returned to my CAMP many times to find my Tinker's Bench destroyed inside my fully intact house.
---
I've been thinking of buying a second account to serve as a mule and here's my 3 main motivations behind it:
---
* I don't always have a friend online to use as a server anchor. (Join session with them, drop item in box / give it to them, re-join their session from second character and retrieve items from box / them). And I don't want to rely on randoms or really risk random server crashes or resets interrupting it.
---
* I'm a hoarder. I really really really want to keep "anything I might ever have a use for." That includes the random outfits that I might wear at some point, or the stack of consumables I might just need at some point. So I'd like to keep that without taking up space for stuff I definitely will be using sooner.
---
* I can feel better about making several characters with wildly different builds and not feeling like I lost a great random drop if I get something good on the wrong character.
---
I love the challenge tracker, whoever thought of that should get a Nuka Cola. 
---
I feel you. But you have to start downsizing your amounts. Yes trading is fun. Join a shop guild and work with them to sell. 
---
I want to craft a jukebox that doesn't just play classical!  Seriously, Bethesda?
---
Yup. I found two in the wild applachia dlc spots
---
???
---
i remember that the "2 favorite item, one disappear" thing was also in skyrim ...
---
i could fix this bug in skyrim using the item with different soul trap levels ... unfortunately we dont have soul traps in fallout.
---
Exit the CAMP crafting and go back in, not sure what causes it but that's a fix for now. 
---
Well it is obviously not Bethesda's fault when you use an unapproved modification to the game and shit happens.
---
Shit... shit... shit agai.... Wait, what, excavator armor skin?!
---
Nice, where is that?
---
no i was banned. but everyone thinks if you got banned you are a cheater by default .
---
Once purchased, I couldn’t see it under posters when building.
---
Same... 
---
Thank you 👍
---
Yeah... it's the only way I can really get into a game. 
---
This is currently undergoing an update/re-write but it works for now...
---

---
I feel ya. Part of me didn’t even care about the gold. I just wanted the weapons and armour. 
---
Since foundation stacking is removed, am I required to tear down my camp to prevent a ban? I have mine floating 50 ft in the air.
---
you still get to see what you owns even if it was limited
---
Does humor offend you? Clearly it does. I forgot, you're supposed to have a serious business like username on here, aren't you? You can't possibly have any soul and pick a silly username. 
---
Filthy casuals is good, but they are nothing more than an echo chamber. They won't allow any complaints, criticism, or anything other than positive praise for the game and Good vibes. That's really not any better because if you're striving for free speech, that's the exact opposite...
---
Standard one is at 182 RoF now. I logged out and in... Now it's 73/78 on charged... 44 on normal. 
---
well that's the million dollar question. I don't think there's an obvious meta, except of course anti-armor and/or furious.
---
Those damn things pop up when I least expect it. I ran halfway through a mine shaft and they followed me the whole way!
---
Tis a shame. I wasn't powerful enough to do Whitesprings runs until just recently and I still get some decent EXP but nothing close to what it was.
---
Would have been funnier if you actually linked a photo of some puppies. I'm a little disappointed
---
Laid down like 25 more candles. 
---
Some creatures are bigger bullet sponges than others 
---
I've changed my perspective over the years. I don't see it anymore as "we used to provide x+y+z, let's see if we can get away with providing only x, then do y and z later, and charge them more/extra for it". I see the industry changing, part of a function as new gamers grew up with mobile, unlike older gamers like myself. There's a generation that didn't grow up with standalone single player games. They instead grew up with always online/free to play/pay for time/convenience/etc. Another part of it, the bigger the game, the easier it is to fail, so to mitigate it, they do less up front, and "end load" development, or develop as you go, having the customer pay along the way. I see it as growing pains for people like me who are used to standalone games.
---
That doesn't mean we shouldn't be vocal. We know how it used to be, we know if you give an inch, they take a mile, so to speak. But I know games aren't made anymore for those who grew up with standalone games. They're made for a new audience that has a different background of gaming. That, I don't see changing.
---
FO76 is Bethesda's attempt to "keep up with the times" so to speak. The growing pains are trying to keep the older fallout fans happy while also trying to appeal to new fans. So far, other than the over-priced launch, I think the atom shop is pretty fair. I'm surprised you can earn so many atoms without spending a cent. I just hope they don't take advantage of that. That's when I'm sure you, me, or others will speak up loudly! ;)
---
Use the Nukes and Dragons website.  
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=)  
---
If you haven't already, make a bookmark Folder "Fallout 76". In it, you should put the FO76 subreddit and this website at a minimum. It was small during the beta and only about a month later was it in full.    
---
There's also a level-by-level perk planner and it shows you which perks you should take in priority. You don't have to, but rather suggestions for progressing.
---
No...like under which heading...I can't find it 
---
It's just beside the terminal. It's called Vintage Nukashine.
---
I still have this bug, the pipboy and atomic shop
---
I also use perkloadout manager addon only
---
I second this
---
Beg to differ all you want. If you have a custom INI it's your responsibility to check for changes in updates that may need to be transferred to your custom setup. Not Bethesda's.
---
That's a legendary cup. Very rare
---
I'd prefer a limerick...
---
Go to any train station. Activate the poster to start the quest. I found them in the house it took me too
---
Always a pleasure talking heavy guns. Lol. I'm super happy with the buff. Especially with durability on energy weapons. That gatlin plasma I have is awesome and I rarely used it cuz it would break so fast. 
---
I got mine from taking over the Tyler speedway
---
I’m going to miss the mutt chops glitch.
---
mine didn't was at 800, still at 800. Id start looking for what might be missing if I was you...
---
Haha.  Damn, son.
---
I'm 46.  Old farts unite!
---
Did you check your build menu to find it?  Tons of places for it to hide there.
---
Probably because of the dreams.
---
I feel like you should be doing more BE gatling guns are good, you have bloody mess 3 star?
---
I can't use stabilized 'cause im using unyielding sentinel set and no pa sadly
---
Well... walks like a duck, talks like a duck.
---
Maybe you're 100% innocent, only you know the truth. 
---
That's a pretty drastic ROF decrease.  This is why I wish Bethesda would be far more detailed in their patch notes and not leave us guessing - like they have something to hide about what changed.
---
It’s pretty bad to just drop the bomb like that. Bethesda need to communicate better on this kind of total play style change patch. 
---
I don't know. My damage increased to 73 on regular and 78 TS primed gatlings... 
---
Found it  :)  was looking for nukashine in my inventory but it's  vintage nukashine 
---
According to an earlier post and response by a BGS employee, there is a FREE poster in the Atom Shop or you can find it at any Railroad station. Apparently, that starts the quest. The only  thing that popped up for me was the pict-graph announcing the DLC was here when you login.    
---
I'm having to validate my files (reasons) before I continue.
---
Sure. But Bethesda wants to sell us those emotes for atoms.
---
Yeah, that's definitely one of those missed opportunities.  Kind of crazy that someone added a quest about finding paper targets, but didn't think "Hey, why don't we use the shooting range as an actual shooting range?"
---
Yes, it is like that... Always has been. 
---
Make a post about that!
---
Well if you never trade then you don’t have to worry about it. At least your attitude fits the post apocalyptic world our characters are in, still tho.. the games better with a little trust and sense of community imo 
---
No melee pvp nerf? Good to know survival mode will be dead on arrival
---
FYI, the Knight paint dropped for me today after the big patch during one of my technical data runs. 
---
Lol yeah they garnish your wages until the debt is payed off, and you have to pay interest. Thatd be good. 
---
Looks like imma have to wait 2 months till I’m back home for summer so I can have WiFi. I really wish this game had an offline mode.
---
The. 50 cal damage and rof is the same for me.
---
But if I turn that volume down... how will I find the ones I need to turn off?
---
Healing factor was I think actually mostly related to the stealth bug.
---
It only works "out of combat" and there was a bug where you'd always be in "Caution" so you wouldn't register as out of combat the vast majority of the time.
---
Xbox 1, and it's an on and off thing. Sometimes when I click the thumb stick on a piece of armor or a weapon in my inventory, I can see the stats, other times, it's a blank box. 
---
For the vendor, I can't view my 3 star perks or see any of the other two on pieces for sale. I have not closed the game though, but will try later on. 
---
Before the patch that caused this, my fallout76custom.ini just had the [archive] section.
---
To fix this, I had to copy the entire fallout76.ini into fallout76custom, and add the mods to the [archive] section of that.
---
Hope that helps!
---
Anyone who read the roadmap Wild Appalachia is a staggered release throughout spring. This is a trailer for Wild Appalachia, which will come out in pieces throughout spring. I hope no one will be upset at what should be obvious.
---
Thanks for letting me know I never knew that. 
---
Oh god, the people that say things like "I literally forgot about this game" not thinking about something is not forgetting it. Did they say Fallout 76 and you replied, "What's that?"
---
But I could be wrong, try maxing all heavy gunner cards youll do atleast 600.
---
If you already bought it why would you buy it again?
---
Can you possibly add more songs to the radio station? I absolutely love it but i would love to hear some more golden oldies. They are awesome and totally make the game for me.
---
My character, Mae Lee Dayton, was the only Chinese-American member of Vault 76 and was born months after the bombs fell. She is barely 25 when she emerges into Appalachia.
---
Her back story is one I add to a little each night as I’m going to sleep, so it’s kind-of in depth. I’ll add it here in case anyone is interested.
---
Mae Lee’s mother Deborah May Dayton (later, in the vault, she would be known as Professor Dayton) went to Vault Tec University in West Virginia a couple years before the Overseer attended and majored in Chinese culture and political science, with a minor in philosophy. Not only was she classically beautiful by American standards, but was considered brilliant and fiercely patriotic. She secured her place in Vault 76 early on. After graduating with honors, she joined the army and used her expertise to help America push the Chinese Liberation Army out of Alaska. Though she normally was stationed and gave advice remotely from Washington, she was stationed in Anchorage at the end of the battle in 2076/early 2077 in order to be on the front-lines to help with the final expulsion of the Chinese from American soil. During the course of her service here she made her first and only professional misstep - she fell in love with one of her Chinese contacts.
---
Li Wei was at least equally as brilliant as Deborah, with a high degree in chemistry and a successful military track record. He was a quiet and deeply thoughtful man who, after seeing the direction the world was heading towards, abandoned his station as a Demolitions Expert in the Chinese Liberation Army in order to help Deborah, and America,  reclaim the Canadian region. Though he loved his country, he saw a dark future for all people on earth if war continued - and hoped that his actions may help America and China reach an unsteady equilibrium that would help delay or avoid a nuclear holocaust. Though his number one priority was saving the planet from mutually assured destruction, Li Wei soon found another reason to continue helping the American army - Deborah. Despite what Lei Wei had been told about Americans, Deborah was smart, and thoughtful, and empathetic. Deborah’s mediocre grasp of his language soon became fluency as the two talked more and more, and before either one could consider the repercussions of such a relationship they had fallen in love.
---
After the Chinese Liberation Army was expelled, in large part due to Li Wei’s insights, Deborah - being a pragmatist - knew she and Li Wei couldn’t have a successful future in either of their home countries, especially given America’s treatment of Chinese Americans during the most recent battles. She also did not want to give up her illustrious career to move to a third country with him, since her involvement in Anchorage had just won her many accolades and the promise of more successes to come. She broke things off with Li Wei despite their deep emotional and philosophical connection, and headed back to West Virginia for a brief home visit before her next assignment. She was incredibly lucky to be home and close to the vault when the Great War began, and barely made it inside before it was sealed. She never found out what happened to Li Wei, but assumed he died when the bombs fell. Deborah would always mourn her decision to leave and not be with Li Wei at the end of the world, but soon after that fateful day she discovered a part of him lived on. She was several months pregnant with Mae Lee, who would go on to be the only person in Vault 76 to have Chinese origins.
---
Mae Lee’s birth was somewhat of a scandal. Despite the Overseer’s insistence that Mae Lee be treated with the respect of any other American inside the vault, other children in Vault 76 often teased and harassed her behind the adults’ backs. To be fair, many of the adults also let their racism and biases show on occasion - after all, the Chinese Liberation Army had been considered the primary enemy of any patriotic American for a long time. Many adults had already internalized the government propaganda, and it was difficult to overcome their carefully cultured biases - especially since it was common knowledge that it was the Chinese government who had dropped the first bombs. Though logically everyone in the vault knew the Great War was not Mae Lee’s fault, many of their fears and frustrations were unfairly applied to her because of her origins.
---
Mae Lee internalized this overt and covert racism in complex ways. Though she was fascinated by Chinese culture, her father, and the Great War, she hid her interests while in public. During her early childhood, Mae Lee tried to prove to the Vault Dwellers that she was the most American of them all. She wore the right hairdos, sang the most traditional songs, crowed America’s praises, and decried China and communism whenever she could, and would frequently get into fist fights with other children who pointed out her Chinese origins. However, when alone at home with Deborah, she would eat up as much information about her father, and his country, as her mother could remember. During this time she cultivated her interest in chemistry, taking after her father, and learned Mandarin from her mother. Deborah called it their “secret language,” and they spoke primarily Mandarin while at home.
---
This double-life soon took its toll on Mae Lee’s psychology, and her anger issues grew. She got into more and more fights during her early teens and, despite clearly being an intelligent student, was considered a disturbance in and out of the classroom. This only isolated her more, and Deborah grew increasingly worried about her daughter’s place in the Vault. Though all children were encouraged to be fiercely independent, Mae Lee was putting her own education and future well-being in jeopardy. Eventually, Deborah decided the best course of action was to lean into Mae Lee’s natural aggression and started training her in kick boxing. Mae Lee took to it immediately, and the physical outlet both made her calmer and more confident. Deborah was also pleased that Mae Lee would start her physical training a decade before leaving the vault, giving her a leg-up in surviving the harsh world outside. Mae Lee was finally able to control her anger and avoid physical altercations, but still struggled to fit in with the other teenagers - that is, until she discovered alcohol. Whereas kickboxing made her stronger and calmer, alcohol allowed Mae Lee to let loose and be sociable in a way she had never been able to figure out before. By the time she was 17, Mae Lee was drinking regularly. This would continue outside the vault.
---
Whereas her teens were about finding ways to fit in better in the vault culture, Mae Lee’s early twenties consisted of her embracing her individuality. When Mae Lee was 19, her mother died suddenly from a brain aneurism. Mae Lee’s final connection to both her American and Chinese heritage had been severed, and it sent her into a tail spin. She began drinking more, and pushed people away again - though this time instead of using fighting as an emotional outlet, she dove into preparation for when she would leave the vault. She soon abandoned the traditional American clothes, hairstyles, and music she had picked up as a defense mechanism in her childhood in favor of finding styles and creative outlets that encompassed who she was as a whole person. She dived into her study of chemistry, and was soon the go-to expert in the vault. Other young people came to her to learn as much as they could about the craft, particularly demolition and pharmaceutical knowledge, so they could utilize this information after leaving the vault. The residents of the vault soon began using her mother’s title in reference to Mae Lee: Professor Dayton. Mae Lee, despite finding some popularity in her teens and respect in her twenties, realized those around her would always keep her at arms length due to her heritage, so she pushed them away as well. Though she remained friendly with the other vault dwellers, she knew the second she was able to explore Appalachia that she would do so on her own - and strike her own path forward, one where her heritage did not mean anything.
---
She stuck to this plan. After leaving Vault 76, Mae Lee kept to herself. She built a beautiful home where she further developed her demolition expertise for distance attacks on wasteland creatures, while utilizing her kickboxing training for close-up altercations. She still uses alcohol as a crutch, though it seems to only make her melee attacks that much stronger. She has a beautiful, private home on the water near a junk extraction site, and has a Brahmin to keep her supply of fertilizer in good standing so she can build her grenades. Overall, life is good. She is friendly with other vault dwellers when she comes across them, but she is comfortable on her own - and has found a kind of peace and wild beauty in post-apocalypse Appalachia.
---
If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading my insanely detailed inner world concerning my video game character. It’s kind of silly how much time I’ve spent thinking about the background of Mae Lee, but its fun to come up with these details and think about what’d she do as I’m roaming around Appalachia. I hope you all are still having as much fun as I am with Fallout 76, happy gaming!
---
Fellow blacksmith here. This is to to inform you that you have now been enlisted in the great legendary loot hunt. 
---
So up til now every 5/10 levels you went to your workbench and crafted all new weapons and armor and modded them to the max and switched in all the right perk cards to make sure you maximized durability and minimized asset cost, right? And that felt good because it was yours and you made it exactly the way you wanted.
---
But not any more.
---
Because all your matching level 50 armor and your custom built weapons are garbage. Why? Because they're not legendary. You need (NEED) 2\* and 3\* of whatever mismatched garbage you find because now it's all about combining legendary effects to become the best unstoppable badass you can be.
---
Where do you get legendaries? Good question. There's the SBQ fight for one, tough those seem to be waning in popularity (not to mention bugged to hell). And it's no secret that most folks like to nuke Whitespring because every third level 58 glowing bloated one carries legendary weapons and armor.
---
West Tek will usually have 1 or 2 legendary mutants but they can be a bit of a handful. Uranium fever will have legendary mole miners even if they're only level 40. In fact there are many, many other places and events that will reliably spawn legedaries but you'll just have to find them on your own.
---
That being said, at the end of May there is a Legendary Vendor a comin' and while details are thin it appears he will be able to scrap your legendary items and I'm hoping those blacksmith skills will become useful again and I (and you) can make all our own custom weapons and armor built exactly the way we want. (And maybe sell them too for a tidy little profit!)
---
I ended up rebuilding just a bit north of where I was.  Better view there anyway.
---
&gt; I'm almost certain you don't lose an entire core every time.  
---
If that's the case then I shouldn't be complaining, but whenever I stopped playing months and months ago waiting for them to fix the entire heavy weapon class it would waste a core any time I absentmindedly switched weapons before it was depleted. 
---
I guess it's clean...
---
Is it a 2-shot weapon? Those are horrible for VATS. I switched from a TSE handmade to a BE one, and the difference is like night and day. 
---
Also, it takes a split second to auto-aim the weapon after opening VATS, and also each time it recoils. So, even with a 95% chance, you will consistently miss shots of you don't wait until the aim is stabilized.
---
Read the patch notes
---
Players with offensive names on PS4 can’t change their names; PS4 does not yet have a gamer tag change feature. What is your proposed recourse for this issue, Bethesda?
---
His my new fuel for the game. Found him after dropping juice. 
---
Educational (never knew that sandman should go first before covert ops)  Funny, fair. 
---
Yeah he rips on the game but it’s never toxic or don’t buy the game.  Best choice ever. 
---
You're missing out man. Makes a huge difference imo. I wear unyielding too. Just to use the stat boosts for crafting, dismantling and vendor selling. Since I don't really melee (and I use bloodied melees when I do) the strength boost isn't really necessary. The +5 from radicool is all I really need. Usually a fury puts my my polehook high enough to shot almost things. But I'm not a pvp person either. So if you're into pvp I can deffo see why you wouldn't want to be in PA. 
---
Definitely a possibility.  There's a lot more detail in that scene than we can accomplish in our CAMPs, like all the dirt on the floor.
---
I hope so. After the damage numbers changed after I logged out and in again, it's a 4.5% decrease still. 
---
Ok thanks my G
---
It's a must!
---
be still my heart
---
Have Bethesda played their own game?  Releasing heavy weapons in such an obviously unbalanced state to begin with suggests that they did not.  
---
Depends on how many microtransacions you buy.
---
Seriously, between new game sales and other paid transactions, as long as the game is making enough money to keep the servers running and the people running/programming it paid, there's little reason to think they'll stop any time soon.
---
If the sales tank, for whatever reason, the plug will be pulled when it's a bad business decision to keep spending money on it.
---
Wastelanders will include a totally new line of main quests, i believe probably with NPCs and robot companions, but are just speculations. I believe that new main quests means not Nuclear Silos to not be functioning, but to give everyone the opportunity to enjoy this new questline, and seeing that just a little percentuage of people completed the actual main quest, ending with "I am become death", people who didn't completed the actual questline won't be able to finish it but will directly jump in the new quests
---
That handprint on that bloodied combat armor skin. Todd Howard you did it again.
---
That prepper gear looks amazing for my free states character
---
Something to do with the scout update perhaps?
---
"Journey to the **deepest** reaches of the woods"...?
---
shockingly the comments seemed pretty tame just now.  Mostly along the lines of "at least they are trying to make the game better" or variations thereof...
---
Follow/Like/Subscribe to his Youtube channel to keep up to date!
---
I only had enough room to place the new items. 
---
I actually did a complete sweep twice. There’s plenty of ways to find it in the world which is great, but can’t find the camp approach.
---
ahh okay ill try this out
---
New questline revolving around brewing and distilling (including new crafting stuff for camps)  
---
Couple new camp items (RADIOS)
---
People have reported new random encounters such a lemonade bot.
---
You'd need to read patch notes for the more technical stuff
---
This is actually old. I believe this is how players glitched into vaults 
---
The “I’m new and ignorant” bs story is so old around here. 
---
After seeing several posts exactly like yours I stopped on a random one and asked a general question to the people all included on the post. 
---
I am not sorry if that offended you. 
---
New player or not, we all read the shit when installing.
---
Or at least you had the opportunity to read and be informed. Same opportunity as the rest of us. 
---
Maybe next time you’ll think before you leave a comment accusing someone else of being an ass when it turns out your misplaced frustrations stem from your own negligence.
---
False. The vaults are not part of wild appalachia and would not be in the wild appalachia trailer.
---
But there is still a trophy you get with "I am become death" so maybe my speculation is very wrong
---
My radio isn't playing music. Is anyone else having this problem?
---
Always appreciate these dumps... thank you!
---
&gt; what's the end goal here
---
&gt;*****If you keep up with me on you tube i will be ...
---
That :)
---
Playing your way doesn't include exploits that impact performance for everyone else on the server. You knew there was a limit, you ignored the opportunity to remedy your transgression, and now that it's being strictly enforced you're paying the price. Serves you right. It's too bad there's no penalty for signing every comment like a douchecanoe.
---
Sounds like this is coming in the beginning of April.  Havent heard if it will be an enclosed area or a separate instance like whitespring tho.  That would be sweet.  I'm afraid it will attract scammers, but i dont do a lot of pvp trading anyway.  Hopefully they will implement something to deter scammers or make impossible to just run off with other players stuff without paying.  Its a survival game, and player pvp interactions are a lot of fun, but i dont think the developers want to turn it into Rust (no offense) or have specific character builds that cater to scammers.  Just a thought.  Im excited for some new content and cant wait for all the good stuff coming this year!
---
For really real
---
I've lost all productivity for the next 2 hours.
---
So, so, very old. In fact, it was old and I switched to classical radio about 5 days in. Waiting for the “you are listening to minuteman radio. All is clear”  I dunno how much trouble it would be to add 50 new tracks. 
---
That's true. 
---
To me, stealing is stealing. No matter how much effort you put in/didn't, if someone steals (or in the case of GTAO - destroys) what belongs to you, it's a dick move nonetheless.
---
For some reason, your comment looked to me like you were making an excuse to steal drops (lol). My mistake.
---
There once was a game from Bethesda
---
With weapons like rifles by Tesla
---
When falling, players won't do
---
A sensible "Sort by New"
---
This is not a good end - it's Chuck Testa
---
Was it's name Bowerick Wowbagger?
---
Same three i carry. I like your style
---
The only thing coming today is brewing. This trailer is for the entire spring update season.
---
Use excavator armor for the ore bonus and run through the Lucky Hole mine. You'll have lead for days. It can take a while to find all of the ore spots though since some are hard to see, like one is on the ceiling. I believe the ore is instanced too since me and a friend were both able to get ore from the same spots.
---
Once I started doing this I've never needed to pick up lead from anywhere else. Lead ore is a lot lighter than weights too and you won't get over-encumbered from it either.
---
It's also not like Devan is a developer. She probably thought it was cool...but it's not like she necessarily understood the issue it was causing and why it needed to be eliminated
---
Dude, no. Raiders are a *game mechanic*. They don't run around after you calling you a pussy while attacking when you *leave their area*. You *can* leave an engagement area for mobs. You *can't* leave an engagement area when someone decides they want to be a douche and stalk you around the map.  Mobs are leveled for your zone and/or level. You're not going to suddenly be curb stomped in a newbie area by a mob 100 levels or more higher than you. If a level 126 player decides to play cat with a level 6 mouse just because at level 5 PvP becomes a thing, that's a douche move.
---
*Plenty* of people want to play PvP. There's no reason to harass people who are looking for a *co-op* experience out of the game instead of an aggressive experience against other players.
---
I've been searching myself. 
---
Meh, I'll take it. Have an updoot
---
Oh really? I wasn't aware of that. Thanks for letting me know.
---
yes bloodied,explosive,weight reduced. 414 damage now. will get like 80% more with more perk cards but i have to farm levels like hell
---
Damn that's amazing, but a bit scary. Would love to see it in person though.
---
Consoles still have connection issues. However, most of these issues are not Bethesda's fault. Most are console issues staying connected to wifi router and can be solved by modifying the router settings or bypassed by using a wired connection.
---
Reports vary. I see a lot of posts about PS4 disconnects, but they've been decreasing fairly consistently. Most of the game breakers are gone. There's an occasional minor annoyance, but nothing as tremendously silly as it was at launch. Now would probably be a good time to give it a go.
---
Not really. I would say it's actually ideal for a stealth sniper. You can just irradiate yourself to 9-29% (depending on how ballsy you are, I usually pick 29%) for a high damage bonus, and never get hit which means there is basically no drawback, unless you are fighting a scorchbeast or something.
---
I would also recommend stacking Healing Factor with it, it will keep you at that magic number when out of combat, and the reduced healing from stimpacks basically does nothing since when you need one it's enough to heal you missing 20% anyway... 
---
you’re joking right?
---
*squee* love it. 
---
Passive pvp fix?
---
that wouldn't be pacifism that would be invulnerability. 
---
Not even slightly
---
My GOAL is to play a game i payed good money for. Im sorry if cheaters have been ruining your game experience . but not everyone that was banned cheated and not everyone that cheated was banned.
---
Thanks for the tip - I'll try scopes on my lasers. Have you had a chance to try your lasers after Patch 7 (I'm still at work so can't do anything until tonight)? Any noticeable difference?
---
Your whole entitled “Bethesda. Fix the problem I caused when ignoring your warnings because I’m entitled and important” is laughable.
---
You chose to fuck your game up and you demand they fix it. 
---
Who is being the ass here? Omegalulz
---
I have. Nothing missing that I can tell. I don't have many extra weapons or armor, aid is pretty much magazines and bobbleheads.aybe I'm mistaken but I don't think so.
---
I'm not offended but you seem to have missed the point that just as you consider those posts to be "toxic" some people may consider your username "offensive".
---
It is kind of weird that you're complaining about the toxic posts, but accusing a forum that doesn't allow them citing "freedom of speech". I swear I have seen posts about problems and bugs in filthucasuals, mostly PSA, workarounds and discussions. They ban bashing other players or Bethesda and complaining, but not all discussions or questions. 
---
You can't have it both ways, if you want freedom of speech, you accept that some people are asshats. They're generally easy enough to ignore and once you block/ignore them, you never see their garbage again. 
---
I guess you have the porridge too hot forum and the porridge too cold forum, wishing you luck finding the medium porridge forum you seem to seek.
---
Personally I find fo76 IS the medium porridge compared to Fallout which is ultra-toxic.
---
4 months of progress wiped? That's gonna be the death of fallout 76. It's too late for that
---
The presidential bunker at least
---
My character was 20 when the bombs hit making him 45 now. Pre war he was a chef but in the vault no one cared for his luxury dishes and instead opted for whatever the mr. Handys made. This drove him insane and he is now a cannibal trying to teach the world the ways of fine cooking. 
---
No disagreements from me on that. 
---
Why would they notify you that your exploit is no longer exploitable?
---
Music to my ears 🎶
---
No problem 
---
Thanks for the details. I have done the nuked Whitesprings scramble only a couple of times. My legendary items have been few and far between. 
---
Will start ramping up for the chaotic scramble 
---
You can also interact with pretty much any chair/bench etc thru windows.
---
Depending on exact locations, players can also just spawn inside your camp, walk thru items that haven't loaded yet, etc.
---
"Secure" isn't really a thing with CAMPS, unless it's locked resource items.
---
So does the radio part mean that we can make a Jukebox that plays Appalachia Radio? Would be nice to pick the station on the Jukebox since.... the animation is already there.
---
Its your own fault if you havent taken part in the in-game economy. Sure some items are inflated, but if you work hard enough you'll make some caps and a level 50 could afford a set of sentassin armor its still an expensive set. How do you know that level 50 isnt starting a new account and has just as many hours if not more logged than you do? 
---
Probably of all the camp glitches this one was the least kosher... mostly because foundations can't be destroyed. I hope in general they stay away from making these "fixes" because ultimately the glitches are adding a lot of versatility to the C.A.M.P. system that isn't there presently.
---
A development that although still under construction is very welcome ☺️
---
Try scrolling left from the mothman poster. 
---
LOL no. I worked my ass to get where I am in the game. If it was wiped I'd outrage and immediately quit.
---
Bold opinion my dude. Get ready for the storm that's a coming. 
---
If you mean the CAMP poster. You buy it in the atom shop first.  Then it's under wall decor. Mine was under the Mothman poster, since I own that, rather than having it's own slot, so it was a little hard to find.
---
I mean you are not wrong and if they add expansions even ones that cost I would be down for it
---
Yeah.  Corn is also in plentiful supply at the General's Steakhouse too, if you're closer to that side of the map for some reason.  I used to grow all these things at my CAMP, but I got really tired of the Mole-Rat nonsense, so now I just go out to other locations and harvest them as I need them.
---
Please give me link.
---
that's what i was thinking. it is kind of a stretch, but considering context, if what they told us is all we're getting i think that is the most likely one. not just for the "deepest" part of the woods, but just the fact that it is in the woods at all. the entire area is scaled to low level players. imo it would be silly to add the new content to the low level area, keeping everything low level. short of adjusting the preexisting scaling in certain areas of the map, their best bet would be a completely separate area. though, an alternative location for this quest might be the empty space on the far west of the map, across the river. i think that area is still technically considered the woods. guess we'll see.
---
exciting stuff!

4 months.  This took 4 months.  Known since day 1.

Who do you want looking at your complaint?

this post was to help provide information to those who have been wrongly banned . to save them time from calling zenimax .

The plan for the whole year is out there, first up is brewing in March

Yeah I saw that on YouTube

I'm with you on this one fellow wasteland wanderer. No more annoying grass pieces in my living room!

Sell to vendor? Surely any offers you receive aren't going to be so much better that this is worth your time?

Good find !

---
It might be an item locked behind Biv's daily quests... so... that would make this daily challenge undoable... unfortunate. 
---
Yeah...its starting to be a trend on other games too.
---
I don’t like limited timed events. It force you to play on schedule or to pay for it in the shop.
---
I know that you can farm atoms for free with challenges. But still this concept is still awkward to me or others who have a job, married and have kids.
---
I made a post similar to this previously and while I can't speak to P2P trading, vendor inspection is nonexistent and individual item inspection, while available, is inconsistent. Inspecting you own item will sometimes show nothing, or it'll show the wrong thing (base model instead of modded) or it'll be fine. (Also the item rotation in 3d space seems... off?)
---
(For the record: This is on PC with no mods or ini file changes or anything. Just base BGS FO76.)
---
You are totally correct, but unfortunately the game does not reveal that to you, and instead makes it an objective to capture a workshop.
---
At level 32, I captured the Gorge Junkyard to farm Back Titanium to build the Excavator PA, I was enjoying the afternoon, dealing with the waves of enemies, and harvesting Junk when suddenly 3 higher level players appeared, 1 stayed off in the distance while the other 2 approached, the first immediately started attacking my workshop to draw fire from the turrets, and the other (level  121) came straight to me  and OHK'd me with a Bladed Bat, I never even drew a weapon.
---
After killing me the third player killed the other 2 (removing their bounties and claimed the workshop, I was dumbfounded and helpless to do anything but move on, as all the Turrets I had built were now hostile to me.
---
Now at level 150+ I enjoy helping lower level players hold a workshop by Hiding &amp; head shooting the A$$hats that try to grief low level players.
---
Yeah that change cannot come soon enough.  I have no interest in pvp especially as Im low level and do not have the time to play frequently enough to deal with repairing my armor and base constantly because of an aspect of the game I have no interest in. 
---
No, all the items that the other player has, so if I find something interesting I can ask for a price, and I don’t have to ask for perks of every single item! 
---
My damage didn't seem to change at all although I don't have exact pre-patch numbers to compare. 
---
I feel so stupid, thank you so much guys!
---
Wait until the 19th.  When it's "activated".
---
No prob. I'm assuming it's not something that's easy to fix or top priority.
---
If you leave the train station heading toward the quarantine area behind the airport, its on the immediate left past the first red cargo containers
---
all my videos are 10 minutes long and have 5 adds per video !!! i also have some fake beef with another youtuber. 
---
No. It's stickied to the top of this sub.
---
I cannot recall off top the exact verbiage Todd used when announcing the game, but it was not “forever” but something more along the lines of “for years to come”.
---
I imagine this is all completely dependent on player population and more importantly, micro transactions.
---
Ammo for gatling plasma/laser loads up with the number of rounds equal to the number of cores you have. example 11/11 being 11 round loaded into weapon and 11 cores.
---
Saving more than one weapon of the same type to the quick menu doesn't save after leaving game. Reloading results in only one of each weapon type being in quick menu.
---
Still looks like you need to wait for them to fully regen. 
---
really good trailer. 
---
I'm saddened by how real this comment is.
---
Of course, they only care about the clicks, and well what can I say... Shit sells unfortunately.
---
No worries /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ **your true fans** appreciate the loyalty and work you've put into this beloved series.
---
I’ve been playing fallout 4. Kind of want to give 76 another try now, I was hoping it’d improve :)
---
That info is very outdated, the numbers have been nerfed since then. I believe it is now 10% damage for every 10% health missing starting at 60% health.
---
ie. 
---
50% HP gain 10% damage. 
---
Through to
---
10% HP gain 50% damage.

Rip vtu jacket economy hopefully hats are still pricy

first visual teaser. the roadmap was technically the teaser. it mentions discovering cryptids, specifically a "mythical beast" and a questline called *Sheer* Terror. people (accurately it seems now) predicted that there was a mutant sheep cryptid coming, based on the clues in the roadmap.
---
I have a non-hostile SB grief me by attacking my CAMP and totally ignoring me every day. It won’t land no matter how many wings I cripple. 
---
Thanks for the warning... looks like I'll be waiting more months to have internet access.
---
One of them came at me while I was picking Cranberries at Macs Farm. The Mirelurk Queen that likes to spawn their made him regret his behaviour pretty much immediately. 
---
Sold lots before to the people that use it I don’t care what they go for just accumulate them playing the game naturally so if someone gets them that actually uses them I’m all for it not like I’m grinding looking for the stuff 
---
Expanding my farm and building a brewing shack. Its awesome i went from full budget to room to expand
---
If the shop gives them enough revenue they might continue adding content.
---
But honestly i think we are good for this year and next year.
---
They might maybe adding season passes or any form of add-on content if the shop isn’t enough.
---
Hey, I take you're playing on PC? German guy here too, higher level with some characters, but if you need something or just company, let me know. IGN is Vingarius. I'm just not much online during the next week \^\^
---
Fair enough
---
I’ve found 3 pieces of sentinel Assasins armor and a TSE and BE rifle so maybe you just have bad luck my dude. This game encourages trading and not every piece you buy is duped. If you want to play it your way that’s fine but it’s obvious BGS can’t tell what’s duped or not and they’re not gonna wipe everyone’s characters, this is a dumb post.
---
Thank you fam.
---
I don't know that anyone else is having an issue.
---
It's obviously a bug and if more topics about this will pop up they might inform the devs about it.
---
Seriously now, how does something like this even go past QA? This shit's hilarious.
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Un1RgulTEsKklcU5-DZpaeOQkx2o7_mUfuNlfNCz90Q/edit?usp=drivesdk that's my shop I was an active trader for months I took a week or two break hoping betheda would wipe everything before this dlc, but they refused. So to say I didn't participate is beyond stupid. I just didn't want to risk my account so I avoided shady deals and farmed my own gear.
---
Because it's full bos combat armour with perfect perks even with thousands of hours mathematically it would be highly unlikely that anyone would have it legit
---
It's free.  I dunno if it's out yet, servers are in downtime (or were a bit ago)
---
I LOVE THIS TRAILER! 😍
---
I'm not going to Google that but I bet there is Assaultron Porn.
---
I don't think Beth has said anything or confirmed that their current rarity or non-existence is actually a bug/problem yet. I hope they've acknowledged this as a bug, but I just haven't seen that indication yet.
---
Get real you clearly do not play the game and if you do you must walk past all loot and never pick anything up.  If you did you would know you can acquire thousands of pounds of loot a day EASY just from game play. Just because this is the path you choose to play as does not give you the right to tell others how to play.  I choose to keep my stuff and share with people who need things.  That's my business.  You a right to your opinion and I have a right to play my way and in NO way have I every cheated.. thanks .. but no thanks.
---
Accross the river is Ohio so I'm not too sure, I guess we'll find out in May
---
It already will be if they do nothing.
---
bug reports behind walled gardens are not optimal. maybe some people reported that stealth is broken, but none added the information that multi faction fights are impacted either. if all of this is communicated behind walled gardens, then no one with that information could intervene. if you make the bug discussion in a public forum then multiple parties can add their information to the report.
---
and i expect that the CM's communicate with the designers and developers.
---
Same for me. Made a new thread about this earlier. I find it funny that things like this go right past their QA team...
---
Time boat fucking
---
...is that some kind of time travel machine/boat?
---
I still dont know...thats why im agrivated they havent responded to my tickets . i see some on here getting response emails within days saying somthing along the lines of " you got banned for having this much WHATEVERR" and i havent gotten anything like that .I wanted to know because i record all my play sessions and i was going to attempt to disprove any false claims they had against me . but here we are . 
---
Fucking time boat
---
I'm well aware but it honestly needs said in my opinion
---
I agreed or at least given me some to time to get of discord ad let people have some of my loot or let me get my damn PA sets off my mule first.
---
Prefer radio than jukebox! 
---
I knew about that after I took water out of one my purifiers and scrapped some things before.
---
That's kind of a bummer. I don't mind people using my facilities, but with the PVP servers near, I don't know if I want anyone in my CAMP. 
---
I may have to adjust. 
---
If your on ps4 i will play with you.my psn is stangfangmike67.add me.
---
Looting builds and AP builds
---
Sounds more like an episode from the next season of Future Man
---
I wonder if this might be our first foray into non-robot npcs. Perhaps ghoulified scouts who were led into the caves by their protectron scout master in order to hide from the bombs?
---
It's almost like they're being punished...
---
Still no fix for the audio bug when not using headphones. Was hoping that would be fixed :(
---
oh..
---
I saw somewhere they were aware of the issue and were working on a remedy. Was hoping it was in patch 7. Just haft to wait and be patient I suppose. 
---
Same here. I'd sometimes get a 1\* legendary but it'd be the wrong kind of thing for my play style and so I'd just sell it. But now every time I go legendary hunting I'll get like a half dozen things and yeah most of them are garbage but sometimes (SOMEtimes) I'll get something that's _perfect_ for me. I'm sure you'll be the same. 
---
Two caps.
---
It's more than I deserve, danke.
---
I did join a guild and I told them I have lots stuff if anyone needs, I was going to starts handing stuff out in bulk to the members the other day but, a friend just died and I been MIA because of it so did not give any stuff away now this patch .. sigh.
---
A guy told me that he found the hat too in a couple hops

You may have but most didn't and that's where the issue is, honestly I'd be happy if they just deleted all the assassin's sentinel and bloodied weapons that would litterally leave me weaponless but I would find a way to manage oh and out 2 peices of sentinel gear I farmed.
---
Stash limit is 800 on console. Also, I don’t know what was previously wrong with the Energy plant. 
---
I just one-shot a 3\* and got a 3\* legendary drop (will post video if desired). I think this has been disproven a while back.
---
When have you last played? Mine is still working the same way that this chart says it is as of today
---
I squat to parallel. I’ve always lifted like a power lifter, so I’ve gotten more strong and tone than giant and bulky. And I chalk it up to good genes, I have friends all the time that can’t believe what I lift for my size. 
---
Games help me grow actually because I have to eat 5k calories a day and burn as little as possible to gain any mass. So I lift 4 days a week and mostly sit on my ass the rest of it, eating like an obese person, and still somehow have 6% body fat. But honestly forcing yourself to eat 5k calories a day every day isn’t that fun, even if I’m not super particular about the quality of the food, still tough.
---
The critical hit portion of the damage calculation should be ignoring sentinel resistances. Critical hit damage is based on your unmodified gun. It does not care what you pipboy is telling you. Sneak attack damage is separate and added to the critical. You are likely over estimating your damage. Still, a Gauss critical should have taken maybe 100-200 health off the opponent.
---
I suggest you grab a gamma gun before demanding a full character wipe. Throw a barrage of radiation blasts towards the opponent, then swap to your Gauss rifle. They will be forced to either lose maximum health points, which is terrifying for a bloodied character, or move disabling sentinel gear. These people are not invincible, you just have to be clever.
---
I missed out on it for the most part since I didn't start playing till early December and it was patched a couple weeks later.
---
Now at 150+ I rack up levels quickly and don't even need them, I think I have about 8 unused levels available right now.
---
You only need it for nuke zones, I never use it outside of that
---
Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I went back to him and the computer several times over the past 2 hours and nothing new popped up.
---
Yeah, okay bud.
---
Waaaaaaaaaaaah!!!! bethesda I lost all my junk because YOU didnt take into account the fact I modified my game files and adjust YOUR patches accordingly waaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!! Thats what you sound like.
---
My Ultracite Laser is showing increased damage.
---
also the atom shop
---
It's your opinion tho man. It's not a fact. And I highly doubt it's something the majority of the playerbase would accept as a viable solution therefore killing the game. A huge portion of the playerbase would just quit. 
---
One of the comments from valseek in the patch notes threads said it was still being worked on.
---

---
I'm not your *bud*, pal.
---
do nothing=slow death. Wipe=insta death. Don't get me wrong. I do think that duped items should be wiped. But it's WAAAAYY too late to do that now. If it is gonna happen, it should have happened before christmas
---
It's fun to save like 5-6 mintues not having to play the "repair the pipes" game again heh. But yeah, not really "fun" so much as "nice".
---
Sorry for the loss.  
---
You’ll figure something out. 
---
I've 2 legitly farmed assassin's sentinel and a few explosive but no top tier(2 or 3 star) weapons of any kind so I would lose here aswell.
---
I was just searching for a link. Thank you! 
---
Have you really played this game...? You can switch perk cards whenever you want. That build you have on now? Take all the perk card off and you're a newborn.
---
My fondest memories in a survival game were in Ark.  We smashed 3 tribes in a huge 7 hour raid, switching teams in the process.  We got reported as cheaters and griefers, but we legit kicked all their asses.  Who's in the wrong?  Nobody.  It comes with the territory in survival games.
---
Even if I like that, I don't think there will be this kind of NPC before the last update this year (the one after Nuclear Winter)
---
Never purchased, picked up, or sold large amounts of items, never took advantage of an exploit... just, total random assassination?
---
Well, good luck then. Sorry to hear it. 
---
Must be a MASSIVE amount of data storage you have to record all your game sessions, though. You got it online anywhere?
---
well that was fast :D i wouldnt mind if id only have to use it in those spots.
---
Nah they moved on to Anthem. In a few months they'll move on to bitching about something else. 
---
Yep same here only in nuke zones
---
It told me my camp at alpha was a no go but I’m rebuilding even closer than I was before.
---
The "Known" issues sticky from before Patch 6 had it mentioned (That it was being looked into).  But that is buried now.  No new "Known Issues" sticky has been created.
---
It seems to be a bug/oversight.  BOS aren't the only ones MIA.  Marine Deep Pocketed limbs is available always from vendors.  But marine Deep Pocketed Torso appears to not be.  Combat Armor Deep Pocketed are not available, and Combat Armor BOS are not available.
---
They all used to be randomly available from Vendors before the Vendor change.  Meaning that prior to the change, the players had a pretty good advantage compared to those now.
---
So other than a "Looking into it" nothing further discussed or mentioned.
---
So I did a logout login cycle. I have 3x lvl1 heavy gunner perks. For whatever reason damage shown changed... 
---
Charged barrel with 30 RoF does :
---
- 68 standard = 2040
---
- 73 primed = 2190
---
- 78 primed TS = 2340
---
Before it was 45 RoF and:
---
- 48 standard = 2160
---
- 51 primed = 2295
---
- 54 primed TS = 2430
---
So it's a drop between 5.5% and 3.5%. I guess that will be compensated with better ER penetration due to higher per shot damage. But still... 
---
I also have this problem and even tried deleting and completely reinstalling the game /u/Ladydevann any idea what else we could try?
---
Here is some legal advice from a non-legal expert. Don't post the audio. In quite a few states it is ILLEGAL to record audio of a conversation without the other persons permission BEFORE recording.
---
phrasing.
---
What if you relegate PVP entirely to its own server, and leave the current adventure mode server as a PVE server?
---
It's a little better than the usual "someone beat me in pvp so they are obviously cheating " post. I'll give you that much...
---
It's never too late hell even a targeted wipe removing all bloodied and all unyeild and assassin's gear would wipe the majority, the other option is do what they did with tse and Nerf everything into the ground so nothing is good
---
I dont like it because it removes my armor, and my armor has a higher resistance than any power armor. Its also super weak in pvp, one shot and power armor is done in pvp
---
Nuke zones. Whitesprings run (negates ghoul rad damage).  And sometimes events because the enemies spawn all over. 
---
Required? No. Helpful? I would say yes. 
---
I too eventually acquired natural drops of BE, AAE and the other E’s. I also have found sentinel and cavalier assassin pieces. Not everything everyone has is duped. 
---
Just ask her nice mate.
---
If it's anything like Fallout 4 you get +2% VATS hit chance per point.
---
Note each body part has different base hit chance, which this bonus is added to. For example I believe heads are 55%. So with 15 Perception it would be 85%, and if you got another +10 perception through items (bringing it to 25) you should have 95% VATS for a headshot.
---
This calculation is modified depending on your weapon range. Not the Listed range is just the max range before you damage drops off, I think your VATS "sweet spot" is about half of that Max range.
---
Also obviously thing like cover and terrain. ie. Tall grass, bushes, ramparts etc. 
---
I had a guy shooting at me in the wild with a quad TSE powder rifle (pre-nerf) and did not die. Pretty sure it work as intended.
---
On one hand, I can see the point of view for those who have way too much free time time and for the last 30 days or so put an insane amount of effort into farming legitimately farming Legendaries for the upcoming legendary vendors.  
---
On the other hand... hahahahahhahaha fuck dupers.
---
Yes with calibrated shocks it’s nice
---
Bug reports behind a walled garden is industry standard, for a good reason.  That doesn't change the ability to discuss in public, they're not mutually exclusive.
---
CMs do talk to the devs, and if 1) they're good at communicating, 2) do a thorough job of reporting what they've read or directly relay the info verbatim, and 3) understand enough about the development process and the game to interpret the community discussions in a way that they can accurately explain the bugs, then everything is golden.  If any of that isn't 100% true, there will be holes.
---
It's a fucking bug report, if you can't bother to copy paste info into a website, stop wasting our time whining about it.
---
Assuming anything you display becomes part of the Camp budget I don't see why this would be a problem?  If it's something you can currently pick up and have it be removed from the world, why would it be hard to put it down?
---
Well shit at least i only paid 1k for it when the game first came out
---
Sometimes i destroy a player camp to build up a 500 cap bounty. 
---
So i can have high level bounty hunters come after me.
---
Reportable? 
---
Sometimes i dress up as a moon man and semand players give me their science. I am from the moon. I demand science!
---
I break their camp if they dont give me science! For the moon! 
---
Reportable?
---
Sometimes i dress as a greaser and threatwn to break down someones camp if they dont gimme some junk! Gimme some rubber and ill bounce!
---
 Reportable?
---
Sometimes i dress like a building inspector and say the house isnt up to code but maybe if they give me some whisky ill lool the other way! Otherwise the county is gonna have to tear it down!
---
Reportable?????
---
there are no weights in eastern regional penintentiary!
---
The option to Inspect items is gone from Vendors, inspecting items in your inventory sometimes works, shows nothing or the wrong info, Scorchbeasts attacks appear to be back to rapid fire without a pause, you can pick up Scorched Ashes (which are a Misc item although there is no info on what it does). the damage bug when multiple factions are fighting each other is still not fixed, 3\* Ghouls still drop Drills or Coffee Cups as their only loot.
---
Well, so far that's it but I'm sure there's more to come. Seriously, someone at Bethesda needs to wake the hell up and put someone in charge of the Devs who actually supervises them and forces them to test their stuff before it gets released into the wild. How some of these bugs get even passed basic QA is miles beyond me.
---
See I rebuilt too, no issues. Logged back in and gave me the same message. Aggravating to say the least. Bethesda define where the no build areas are.
---
Name checks out btw.
---
I’d like a “look down” or a “down arrow” one for the times I drop poop bags for people and I’d like them to...well... look down... instead of pointing a gun and jumping up and down. That sometimes gets interpreted as “ this lady is so aggressive!!”
---
I just feel like I wasted all my time playing since release lol I mean everything I earned I no longer have.  So much time invested for not.  At this point I cannot even help others out either with my earnings. They should of looted at accounts to see who cheated and who did not, blocked those that did cheat from dropping and let those of us whom did not some time to reclaim our earnings, then add that to us too after given the chance to use it.  Or even read my damn recipes I fricken collected!!
---
It baffles me how many people didn’t actually read the roadmap
---
Yes this is one thing that I don't like and don't want to use my psn in any game I just want my character name to be used
---
I take time when killing legendaries with stars. Heard insta killing them funks up their loot. I hit them with low damage weapons and let them regen to full health and then finally kill them. 
---
Unless you are running around with Calibrated Shocks or Excavator Armor, the carry weight bonus is negligible at best. My sniper build only hops into power armor when going into nuke zones. It all depends on your play style. 
---
The whole quest took me 20 minutes in total...
---
sounds like someone is having a hard time understanding what "limited time" means. i missed a few and enjoy coming across people that have them, but i don't have the "what about me, this isn't fair" attitude. play often, get rewarded with unique items. it's not fair to those that got the limited time items when they were available just to see them on sale again.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
Player Vending is coming April 9th.  Legendary Vendor on May 23rd.
---
Try to be more gentle 
---
And? We really don’t care. People who actually play the game will enjoy this update. 
---
Where's the door though?
---
As a person who was an active trader I assure you the vast majority of good armour and weapons are still weapons that were duped and have just been passed around with time, watching the go from 20k to 3k in a single day was mind blowing watching people give away full sets of perfect armour for random bobbleheads so they could dupe those as well 
---
&gt; but with the PVP servers near, I don't know if I want anyone in my CAMP. 
---
But... they can just blow up your door/wall and get you anyway.  I'd imagine you won't get "Wanted" for tearing down a wall on the PVP mode servers, and a person isn't going to be all "Oh damn, there's a wall there and a door with a level 3 lock?  Guess I ain't gonna kill that person hiding in there."
---
much appreciated.
---
Yes and furious takes longer to hit bonus cap... Damage is similar when the improved ER is considered. So it's not really a buff. Durability is better. So the gun just breaks slower. Still can't hold a candle vs ballistic. With the ammo bug still around it is quite discouraging... 
---
thats why i give them the whole "for quality service this call may be recorded or monitored"
---
Pop it when the SBQ lands and basically instakill her with unarmed bloodied
---
Only suggestion I can give is contacting Bethesda requesting they consider those mods. Otherwise the game will act strangely or not at all.
---
I never bought the plans just figured I’d scrap combat armor pieces and learn them myself. Hindsight is 20/20. 
---
Yeah once you get all the perk cards your damage will be higher for sure
---
Bethesda didn’t make the mods. They don’t support those mods. Why blame them for user-created mods not working correctly?
---
It's never too late because you got nothing to lose. 
---
It’s very useful in nuke zones, otherwise I use unyielding. 
---
It kinda is fact though they are talking about adding raids and PvP world's if they don't fix this PvP world's will be dead on arrival and raids will be a joke as most players will be in perfect gear thanks to market saturation 
---
The only time I use PA is in nuke zones and queen fights (which are usually in or near nuke zones).
---
And in fact since I have so many legendary effects on my regular armor that reduce weapon and chem weights and enhance my resistances and SPECIALs, I'm more likely to be overencumbered in power armor and do less damage to boot. (Plus you can't hardly do anything in it anyway.)
---
As I've said before, Power Armor is the tuxedo of Fallout -- yes it looks great but it's extremely impractical and best saved for special occassions.
---
Why would they notify someone who posted their camp using this exploit that they thought their camp was cool? To me, it's about communication, not about whether an exploit should be used or not.
---
At a deeper level, there exists a question about whether any of the exploits to the snapping system should be used. Jug uses doorways to complete his circular base builds because they can be moved with a foundation and walls can't. That's an exploit, right? It also leads to some really cool bases. 
---
You need a Delorean and Christopher Lloyd
---
Have you messed with your falloutcustom.ini? If so you need to add something to get it to work. If not, just try backing that up somewhere and restarting. 
---
I need the excavator skin in my life
---
No it doesn't. Are you insane? I found my Bloodied Power Fist and my Bloodied Handmade through farming, there is no way I'll keep playing this game if they wipe them just because someone whined loud enough.
---
Give us Fallout 76 Classic servers, Bethesda!
---
I bought Gears of War 4 the other day. 117GB.
---
ESAD
---
Expect to generate a great massive pile of legendary crap. Yes, you can sell some of these great legendaries for 5-30 caps to a robot, or sell a select few for a few 1000 caps to another loot hunter, but mostly you will leave great big mounds of shitty legendaries in ice coolers, suitcases, and paper bags on the sidewalk.
---
When that player is putting out thousands of dps at range and is immortal effectively it's kinda hard to get them to do anything but oneshot you. 
---
don't use a glitch and assume they wont just because they thought it was cool. it was a glitch and was not intended. of course they fixed it
---
It happens after the quest as well. I just drank a vintage nukashine, blacked out, and woke up in an unmarked cabin a bit north of the mountainside B&amp;B.
---
bet you its an atom store skin for the deathclaw gauntlet.  
---
Actually I think I'm wrong on the damage percentages but I do think it increases further when you go below 10%
---
I picked up an account for a friend who had zero interest in playing back when the game was hugely discounted. I store hundreds of pounds of junk, legendaries, etc on that account, and that stash flexibility has honestly greatly increased my gameplay fun. I have other friends who play and I can pretty much kit out anyone who joins in a set of legendaries now, and never need to worry about dumping an item because of stash limits etc. 
---
Funny thing is I rarely lose in PvP stealth sniper is broken as hell as they cannot find me most the time
---
I like my character and camp exactly the same BUT I’m really excited to see other people wearing these and the new camp possibilities!
---
Saving 5-6 minutes is the "efficiency" I'm talking about ;)
---
I'm excited and never lost faith in the game. 
---
I've just logged out for today but if you head towards the VTU building you'll notice an undiscovered building on your compass. Called Al's Ink or something. It's right there.
---
Sorry to dredge this old post up,
---
If you continue and cross the next bridge, do you come back to the Charleston station, or is there another place where it will possibly spawn
---
Fair enough. I have been pretty fortunate.
---
I just found it, thanks
---
This is why pacifist players should have pacifist carry over to their camp so when people like you show up we can politely wave and heart emote as you make your demands. To target people's camps that legit want nothing to do with pvp just so YOU can have fun is just a dickhead move on my part. You're literally ruining someone's good time to further your own. 
---
Also make it so you have to turn pacifist off to claim a workshop. Or have the claim workshop prompt tell you "pacifist mode will be disabled until you no longer own this workshop". Or something along those lines. I knew this game would be full of shitheads like you ruining people's fun for their own benefit. But it's still a fun game. And honestly, since I've switched to pc, I've only come across 1 asshole. 
---
Hhhhhrrrrrrnnngggghhhh my friend I usually play with can’t get on Xbox for a couple days and I promised that I would wait for him before I started the new content but this is really testing now 
---
Wait so you can buy bos stuff that’s kinda boring what’s the point of technical data?
---
Lol wtf at your comment. 
---
How am i wrong? I said "or less pretty sure" so i knew there was loose ends. The damage isn't really noticeable till under 50%. I never listed any numbers.  
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
I like how it is titled:"Now available" on Beth site and trailer showing things that isn't even inside the game.
---
Its becuase the game tries to put effects on them but it cant, i think the fix was for when they didnt even drop a syringer or drill, just nothing
---
Yoooo, I saw that I unlocked the fermenter but for the life of me cannot find it in my build menu. Should it be under crafrting somewhere?
---
A shitty game that had an excellent housing system, Shroud of the Avatar, actually did this.  It wasn't a feature at first, and they added items in batches, but eventually almost every single item in the game (and there were many) was displayable in your house, placed damn near anywhere in any angle you want.  Seemed impossible but they did it.
---
Don't count it out...
---
Stuff and bugs
---
I disagree. It’s neither my responsibility, not theirs to asure compatibility. (How could they?)
---
I have, as such, no problem with the failure _per se_, but rather with the _mode of failure_. 
---
But I suppose it has more to do with the basic design of FO76, than anything else. If I can mod my client to glitch through the floor, I suppose someone with skills could make a mod to glitch through anywhere. 
---
And if the _always trust client_ design is the reason for all of this, the Bethesda and only Bethesda is responsible for _that decision_.
---
I remain solely responsible for choosing to mod my game client. 
---
That, however does not disculpate Bethesda for making extremely bad design decisions. 
---
Yeah my TSE laser isn't. Which is funny. Here I ease thinking I'd have a super rare awesome gun, and I wonder if Beth just decided to make the increase not apply to TSE Laser, because they never wanted these guns to be a thing. =(
---
I’m pretty sure he’s right because I tested with only one plasma core and it used 1 shot, and then reloaded to a full one as expected. 
---
No.  I like my over powered weapons.  Learn to live with it.
---
The one time my camp was truly attacked the guy had a 550 cap bounty on him by the time I could get back there.  I saw the notification as it came up and still had a majority trashed camp.
---
It's not obvious though. Consider I'm a casual gamer who didn't see the road map. I see this hype trailer with all these new features with "PLAY TODAY" at the end of it. I naturally assume I can play all the content in the trailer today. Big misstep by the marketing team IMO
---
You have to scroll left on the mothman poster
---
hoping for some faction themed items someday (I.E classic elder uniform, brotherhood battlecoat, etc)
---
but these are really cool new things! definetly a fan of the lever action skin!
---
I haven't seen this yet.  Now I'm jealous.
---
Yeah, that's true. Pretty much the same weather as we had. I got more confetti on me because of the wind rather then what was thrown towards me.
---
Truth. You can find it around campus. I'll sell ya one for 5k 😜
---
i dont . thats why i said . I WAS. i have since deleted it after i didnt get a response from them after 2 weeks as i play other games and need space for clips to edit . because 1. doesnt matter what i post . if i was banned no one cares cause . im a duper by default .and 2 because . i PERSONALLY felt i was banned wrongly . and therefor do not care to support a game by making videos on it .if i feel like the publishers are treating me unfairly . i do have the slightest suspicion what i was banned for . or suspended .still dont know my state of it either . but i felt like i may have been report by somone that i killed while taking there workshop . back in january before i recieved a ban. i was killing people who had taken over workshops to gain caps and resources . its good caps. and sometimes you hit the mother load with resources. not sure if its been patched since . dont really care . its not an exploit . you take a workshop somone can kill you and take it .WATCH YOU BACK. i see people bitching saying its an exploit cause they got killed. like they cant defend themselves . its sad and i see alot of flak coming from just me mentioning that but idc . if your mad over it . your probably a casual. 
---
There is always one in a shower stall in one of the white springs cabins
---
K. Your reading comprehensions could use an upgrade. Maybe you could serverhop and look for a mod?
---
Technically, a jukebox is not a radio, despite them working like a radio in game.  
---
Just the mods and plans for the armor. 
---
Yeah, it's in the crafting section, all the way at the bottom. Only requires 2 steel and 2 wood, but like I said you can only build 1 of them.
---
It’s already annoying to have to change servers when your camp can’t load, this would make that worse. 
---
Not in a meaningful amount. It sucks the ammo dow n
---
They will need to fix their stability and performance issues first.
---
I would not let than 40-50 players/world
---
Woah, underground location seems interesting and I didn't know about that before. That trailer was cool and it looked like we are getting a place-able picture frame for our photos, maybe?
---
Sounds like you intentionally under geared your character on purpose and still expect to be equal? And since you can't you want all accounts wiped? I can't tell if this is a troll or you need to put the pipe down.
---
I hope so, I've been waiting for them to address this for months now.
---
Probably related to the sheepsquatch coming April 9
---
I do nuke zones, scorchbeast battles, and nuke bunker runs, plus I keep a set in my pocket as an express elevator for getting down cliffs, nothing else. When I was \~ level 40, I'd also wear it in the mire and cranberry bog. One thing I like about this game I'd never noticed in previous Fallouts is how claustrophobic power armor feels and how badly it limits your perception (waypoint markers aren't nearly as clear which are close and which are far). IMO, the game experience itself discourages you from wearing power armor all the time.
---
I just hope they drop two shot exploding Rolling Pins.
---
True but still...
---
Well Excuse me! I don't follow their twitter. My bad. 
---
I'll check back in a little while and see if you're still alone with this opinion. At the end of the day, majority rules. 
---
Can you please use character names instead of account names?! Its the reason why you name your character!
---
Change server? I'm totally down for new building sets don't get me wrong, but how on earth are you being griefed to the extent that this is a big issue for you?
---
Your not the only one who's be wiped I would without batting an eye be wiped to let those that actually farmed thier gear shine through ATM very few players are using legit gear due to duped saturating the market pre deletion which left one. 
---
So those like myself who wanted to play legit and grinded my ass off for it are still at a disadvantage due to how many people got duped gear and weren't punished for it.
---
&gt;Found it, it's behind the tattoo parlor
---
Come on man! Spoilers!
---
Not sure a notice is the same thing as permission. Then again, I am just am arm chair non-legal expert armed with google and a keyboard.
---
You won't get banned, but you will definitely block the vendor. It's your game, do what you want, but coming from someone who spent hours server hopping for that fucker, please consider another spot.
---
I dont think you can buy it there till april
---
You aren’t aloud to build in be world 
---
This is pretty petty stuff bud
---
I have no problem with mods not working. I have a real problem with the _mode of failure_ though. 
---
Sounds like someone got wise to your duped nocturnal rolling pin racket, cheater.
---
Nice, now I constantly fall through the world when running around Whitespring.
---
Explain the coffee cup then. It's isn't a weapon... That I'm aware of.. 
---
Alchestbreach hated that
---
i have some video i cobbled together the night before i got banned .showcasing some raider action that i had been taking part of the last week or so before acquiring my ban .
---
No they don't. 
---
Nukashine? Did I miss something 
---
Ah i didnt see that part, guess its still broken then
---
A simple pointing in one direction would be great. 
---
I've done a bit of testing with my anti armour Gatling laser and stabilised perk, and I don't think it does :(
---
Sorry, but I did use the spoiler flair
---
It may of been closer to 10k but I was on my glass cannon melee which is kinda op for bounty hunting as I allways get the first swing.
---
No mmo is ever finished and wow like most mmos was also a broken mess on release, you can't predict what will happen when a game is released or how to fix the issues without breaking the game more, any rational and semi smart person understands that.
---
What happened will 76 and most likely will happen in the future happens will all online games that is constantly being worked on. Simple as that.
---
I did the Cold Case quest and got a legendary 10mm Submachine gun.
---
Quest giver is a ms nanny robot (cant remember her name) but I found her up in that waterpark in the most north part of the map.
---
Also forgot to mention Herd mentality. Sorry.
---
Level 220 and I never bother with it unless I fight the queen. For all other Nuke Zones I just wear the Hazmat suit. If they ever change PA so I can use my Power Fist in it I'll reconsider but until that time I see no real benefit in PA.
---
Dammit thanks though
---
it is a touchy topic . lots of variables .
---
I'm down for maybe 36 max, but even then this could prove super annoying. I already get annoyed with the amount of times someone else is farming West Tek, Sugar Grove, Golf Course etc.
---
They're such garbage.  Don't waste your time/ammo/resources, just relog to a different server.  They drop trash and are nothing but bullet spongy, cancer pissing headaches.
---
Changing servers is accepting defeat. Defeat is a facet of grief.
---
Ik im talking about the next few years. Brewing is out today with a fun quest involved check it out :)
---
aint a quest spoiler cuz every nukashine does that
---
Or a sedative and an IV drip to sleep through the next week. Forward time travel doesn't require a flux capacitor, just patience.
---
4 turrets is a *lot* of turrets.
---
I'm not saying I'm intitled, I thought it was a legit issue because this game is buggy af and I don't mod at all on any games I play this is my first time modding, my friend that plays fallout a lot puts a lot of of mods in his game, and I thought I could too, you are really blowing this out of proportion.
---
Petty? Man I'd love for this game to succeed, but after the whole false advertisement canvas bag debacle you'd think they would be more careful about this stuff. It is 100% misleading. 
---
I have an extra torso plan for the BoS Combat Armor. 
---
Fair enough lol
---
When your busy doing a event you dont always have chance to return to your camp to stop the childish idiots who just go around destroying camps and who always switch servers whenever you show up 
---
I'm all for PvP but this is just stupidly annoying having to deal with idiots who have nothing else better to do 
---
I have actually fairly good gear even one "perfect" all of which I farmed for so I'm nowhere near undergeared I'm just not a person who willingly traded with dupers to get full assassin's sentinel for 1k caps (litterally was the price on a trade discord) and because of that I'm gimped for playing legit and not buying from vendors
---
Too many people on the server would get way too crowded. This isn't a full planet map like WoW. It's a very small map compared to pretty much any regular MMO. Small server populations are needed for this.
---
I mean, just look how crowded Whitesprings can be on a day to day basis. Imagine there being not 4-5 people there, but dozens.
---
Dude, that is so insensitive and demeaning.  I smoke pot all the time and have never had an opinion that stupid. 
---
No it isn't. The solution is easy to see but you're just being prideful and whining instead
---
I know I was just jerkin your chain.
---
um...false.
---
Lmao go beat off to Rush some more you fucking nerd. 
---
While you do have a point, one of the most common complaints is the endgame boss won't leave any loot, and when it does it's not worth the effort. I guess that's how I feel at this point, not worth the effort.
---
When I first started playing I thought that you could do this using the PO Workstations like in Fo 4. 
---
It should definitely be a feature. Maybe when the “Display items from stash” feature is added? 
---
I haven't played this game in a few months. One of my "last straws" was kind of a silly thing (Not the only thing, but a memorable one) and I'm wondering if anyone can comment on whether this patch (or any previous patch) might have addressed it:
---
I found myself taking 10+ minutes just to find a way to rotate and move my CAMP (which included concrete floors to try to solve this problem, to no avail) to get it into place in a new location. It was incredibly frustrating: seemingly flat or very low grade incline ground would still prevent me from placing down the blueprint. 
---
On several occasions I had to pay the movement fee a second or even third time in a row because there was just no way to get the blueprint to play nice with the piece of land I had selected. Can anyone comment on whether this process has gotten any easier?
---
Like yourself?
---
Ever consider it might be.... I don't know, just you?
---
I appreciate it but that’s 1 I actually have learned. Should bring a pretty penny or trade though . Thanks! 
---
The ole power fist, quick in and out with the ole ultraviolence eh?
---
I'm so happy.  That trailer is top notch
---
My efforts to cure your ignorance have failed. They are not immortal. They are reducing your paper damage (the pipboy damage) to zero, but critical hits are a separate part of the hit that is applied to your shots. That half of the calculation ignores sentinel armor.
---
I reiterate, grab a gamma gun. Radiation damage does not care about sentinel armor. Be smarter than they are. Throw a barrage of radiation towards them and swap weapons. Shoot them as they dodge or watch them die to radiation.
---
There are a ton of counters to sentinel gear. Take advantage of them before you demand deleting everyone's progress.
---
sometimes it doesn't load right away. they always have one when i come back to it or wait a bit.
---
Chances say I won't get any backing too many people care more for thier overpowered weapons than where the game will be in a few months.
---
Yeah but it's a slow cook. 
---
If so then they definitely need to make the game more tolerant of momentary disconnects. Most people have the default router provided by their ISP (which are usually crap), and most people also don't have the technical expertise to do the things you suggest. The game should "just work" to quote Todd, even if I have to wait for the game to get a fresh pipe opened.
---
I killed 3 star legendary and it give me 3 legendary all of them was 3 star But still I GOT DAMN METAL LEFT LEGS 
---
I  GOT A LOT OF LEFT LEGS I DON'T NEED ANYMORE
---
Damn, looks like energy weapons are still subpar compared to ballistic weapons despite today's patch.
---
Man, you guys must have the worst luck. I have a max budget camp in a reasonably popular area and I get loads of passers-by. All so far have been friendly.
---
I want the feared chancla to drop
---
it starts when the next song begins
---
Someones been getting spicy with the nukes latley
---
The underlying issue being the lack of things to do. They might spend the next two days brewing things along with everyone else before the mass boredom returns for another couple of months.
---
I do. That’s why I call this one a griefer. I’m playing a bloodied unarmed build, so they die in a couple hits if they land. This one never does and I’ve given up on knocking him down because he flies away when he gets too hurt. It’s bizarre. 
---
Someone already did.
---
In the patch notes.
---
Seriously, just go read them.
---
Makes sense. Thanks for working this out. I'm finally going move points to max out luck.
---
Blah blah blah. Mr white knight no fun over here. Sorry about your 200 wood. I guess you can take 8 minutes to go farm more...
---
Its not "ppl like me" its the design of the game.
---
I also run a roleplay guild that gives out quests. Not sure what we will do when we cant introduce drama anymore. Most likely move to survival or ill turn the guild into a raiding pvp thing and drop the roleplay pve side all togther because the carebears ruined quest giving with the pacifist changes. I cant give quests that involve any danger or drama anymore....
---
Ive talked to you on other reddit troll accts of mine. I know u. Entitled. Wrong. Boring. 
---
U notice all of my examples have a "way out" give me "science, wisky, or junk" and i dont break your shit (unless i wanna be bounty hunted. But thats todds design)
---
Some people roleplay. Oh no mr fun police here to talk about feelings in my videogame time. 
---
No one carea about your opinion. Ima keep playing the way i do. I was asking a dev what constitutes harrassment. Your in the way. Go away. 
---
I think you're reaching.
---
Thousands of DPS?
---
With the Nerf, my legit found explosive Harpoon gun is only 250....
---
Fast travel gambling :-D.  I drank some in Harper's Ferry and woke up on the opposite side of the  map. 
---
&gt;	vintage nukashine grants +100% unarmed damage, -50% sprint AP cost, and +50% AP regen, and may cause you to blackout which triggers a load screen and you "wake up" in a random unmarked location.
---
Oh my god, I love this idea. I can’t wait to see where I wake up. 
---
I felt bad to see you got negative votes. You're probably right. I want it free but I'll spend some atoms on it if I have to. 
---
 I didnt look at your past comments so I hope you're not one of those haters I hear about 
---
149 hour cooldown time for Silos. I haven't been on in a week. Same things keep happening with different hour cooldowns with other players. Please advise
---
Is the game hangs/crashes on exit fixed yet? Haven't played in a long time.
---
You might be fine with it, others will most definitely not be fine with it. 
---
That includes people like me who got their gear the legit way. Farm, kill, loot.
---
I've not spend 200+ levels in this game to get my shit wiped just because Bethesda isn't capable of developing tools that actually let them trace a players database. 
---
Plus, I don't like PVP in this game. It bores me and I never do it, so why should I be punished for something that I a) didn't do and b) doesn't affect me at all?
---
i dont know you, but i dont like you
---
blocked
---
The grasses poking through floors were annoying.
---
my wallet is waiting....
---
not if you miss
---
I wouldn't mind new characters for survival mode, which would solve this problem quite nicely.
---
Hunter's golf clubs, actually.
---
the poster to initiate the new quest is free. no player vending yet
---
I had Deep Pocketed Combat Torso, BOS Combat Arms, and BOS Combat Torso before the patch.  I had to find a player seller for BOS Legs and Deep Pocketed Limbs after the patch, took a while to find someone who not only had them, but was willing to sell them for Caps.
---
You can also milk graham. Definitely a new feature
---
&gt; 76 is a MMO, not a single player RPG
---
It's literally advertised as neither. It's a multi-player RPG. 
---
I got excited for a second when  I saw that as well
---
Yes they will
---
Fuck that shit. I love this games despite all it's problems, but a wipe would ensure I never play again. So fuck that.
---
Destroy option on heavy weight is awesome!
---
Oh no XD, Bethesda didn't specify in the trailer some of these things are coming a month or two down the line (Legendary Vendor, Myths from Monsters quest). They should have put dates to go with the updates themselves. You damn well know a lot of gullible people didn't read the roadmap. Lets wait and see if the usual suspects don't come out claiming the trailer falsely advertises all of this stuff as being released today and not in increments over the next couple months.
---
No, somebody offered them the codes from the dev room, but they already had them. 
---
I actually watched them crack the codes for Alpha and Charlie this week, and it’s exactly the brute-force you imagine, they generate the full list of possibles and then split it up and test until someone gets it. It’s really only limited by the number of key-cards but now they have a week to re-stock.  
---
Seems my damage output is lacking... anyone else?
---
Nah according to my good friend it looks and tastes like piss
---
Right? I ended up going through all my menus seeing if anything appeared!
---
Umm, I don't think that's milk...
---
It's probably the best time to come back since the severs are more stable, less lag and crashes and they started to roll out free dlc
---
Can only be built at camp. Makes sense. 
---
As stated above. It’s May, May 23rd. Not trying to be rude, just don’t want the same people saying something when it doesn’t hit in April either :P
---
Mine is, but it doesn't seem like I can put anymore foundations down. So I doubt I'll be moving anytime soon.
---
Your solution is trash tho.. there are lots of people who have grinded to get the gear they want so to say something like wipe everybody is just stupid. I’m really not trying to be offensive but I gotta believe you’re just trollin with posts like this. 
---
There are lots of game mechanics that could be introduced to encourage grinding for new gear. 
---
I'm counting crits it's real easy to make a weapon do tons and tons of damage using iether bloodied guns or str stack on melee
---
Looool
---
Ah, I see, we're going to move the goalposts.
---
Did you try uninstalling and reinstalling? Had a similar issue and this fixed it for me. I went in and deleted the ini files etc as well before reinstalling. 
---
I'm noticing a lot of positive improvements not mentioned in the patch notes (or I missed them) like firecracker berries being much easier to see, my unstable isotope mutation not graphic-glitch purpling-out my screen when it fires, and so on. Also my CAMP budget is greatly freed up, I'm surprised how much. So thanks!
---
I have an issue when running events like uranium fever, when the legendary spawns, it automatically takes me out of hidden into danger - is this intended or a bug? Same happens with scorch beasts. Running a sneak/vats build wearing chameleon armors.
---
No worries, so many dates. Can't keep up with all of them.
---
The update we were all
---
Waiting for 
---
At your camp.  Can't build them at  workshops, which is too bad, cause I had billings claimed and put down a brewing station, bunch of goodies for people who would be there soon. :\
---
I think I did.  
---
Not sure how to get the original. I'm checking the files again b/c EVERY character now clips through the world. WTF BGS. Fallout 3 never had this problem to this extent.
---
Try travelling near one? Hit Whitesprings and then just walk across the street to the station?
---
Also thanks for the heads up that fuckin sucks
---
Stealth crits definitely don't ignore sentinel as that's what I hit him with he was standing still on a work bench
---
New CAMP items released in today's patch. Apparently the new event will award them.
---
&gt;Tullamore DEW 
---
You have good tastes!
---
Thanks for the explanation AJ.    It makes sense to me now.
---
The keypad works now!
---
If ur on Xbox, i have 3 leg plans for 2k each for sale.
---
I have (twice now) become an involuntary duper of missile turrets.
---
I moved my camp and broke down the blueprint since it wouldn't snap to the new site. I noticed I had an additional missile turret stored, but I couldn't be 100% sure I hadn't created one and forgotten about.
---
Then I moved my camp again a week later. Same deal. Couldn't snap, so I broke the blueprint down. Then I was suddenly unable to place anything due to being over budget. "Oh well," I thought. "I won't be using as many walls and foundations at the new site, so I'll just scrap them."
---
Didn't help. Still way, way over budget.
---
That's when I realized I now had double the previous number of missile turrets. WTF. 
---
I don't know what I did, but I did something.
---
I have indeed. It does not work either. The area around the stations (rocks, grass, rails, stairs etc) are non collided and you will meet the same fate. Tried this with 4 different train stations.
---
I found the plan in the wild for Deep Pocketed Combat Torso sitting in the church at Harper's Ferry by the Armor bench.
---
The issue is specific spawns are so very hard to find because the pool of available plans is so large.  So not only does the plan have to spawn (It seems very rare at the church in Harper's Ferry), it would have to spawn as it, and not say... Ivory Grip...
---
Nothing I hate more than getting that damned Ivory Grip mod plan to spawn in some high level rare area plan spawn.  That and the Barbed Walking Cane loose mod.  It's like picking up a syringer off a level 80 *** Legendary Monster.
---
Built a Brewing Station &amp; Fermenteer, and planted a bunch more corn and razorgrain for starters. Beyond that, I'm not sure.
---
I do see your point, and perhaps there is wishful thinking on my part at work.
---
But.. I have a keypad entry at my front door and powered one way door at the rear upstairs. My CAMP by all intentions will be secure, minus destroying it of course.
---
I guess the idea of glitching through my walls bothers me and as such, will force me to adjust a bit.
---
I was just unaware of this glitch being so well known.
---
K.....
---
I have yet to get smashed like that....
---
Maybe stop getting into PVP?
---
On the Tinkerers bench, Bulk has been replaced with LUCK and there is another category that says Modern Fireplace
---
Well may want to tell that player who survives it, or my buddy who has full assassin's sentinel and can do the same thing
---
I don’t want people raising their sell prices or lowering their buy prices because they see a TSE in my inventory, so they assume I’m rich. That just fuels trading through alts, which I’ve tried to avoid. You don’t show your cards early in poker. 
---
I'm Level 152 at the moment.  I usually help defend workshops if I'm nearby and spot an opportunity to.  It's a little XP and a few freebies. 
---
That isn't milk...
---
Yeah but let him play and find out. It was funny to see it firsthand. 
---
It would have if the mod loading worked the same way (I know you aren’t using mods)
---
But yeah just change that one line and you’ll be back in business 
---
Just delete the current one entirely and start the game - it'll generate a default-settings replacement
---
That was an interesting read! Just happy to see so much creativity:D
---
Jesus, wonderful. Oh well, I'm in the process of moving and can't play anyway, I hope they put out a hotfix before I'm set up at the new place.
---
Damn, stopped playing after month 2 and game was still in shambles. This update really seems like they are headed in the right direction. Just wish they had released a full working game with all of these changes, instead of delivering an unfinished mess at release. I love fallout, but I cannot in good conscience pick this game back up no matter how many wonderful changes they have made. Please just take the extra 5 months next time to make sure your game is polished. 
---
Also depends on your playstyle. Without legendary drops, power armor is hands down the best protection you can get, with the trade off of not having legendary variants and requiring fusion cores. I'd also say it's easier to repair, as you don't need ballistic fiber, which is far to rare in this game. 
---
I personally generally run with a legendary set of armor, I have a mixed power armor set with t-60 legs (the cheapest to repair, and the legs at least for me, take the most damage) a t-51 torso, and x-01 arms and head. (This gives me a good mix of radiation and physical/energy resistance).  This is my go-to for nuke zones, but it's also there if I can't afford to repair my non-powered armor as an "emergency backup".
---
I also run around with a full excavator suit with calibrated shocks for that +200 carry weight. 
---
This has been a random issue prior to this patch.  I have had it happen.  I had to hard restart the game.
---
I murder a lot of players, but you low level dudes are safe from me. Don't get me wrong, I totally use you guys as workshop bait for the players who actually want to harass low levels. But still, I have given away many surplus plans to new players.
---
People are mostly friendly... Mostly. Congrats on a fun experience. 
---
No i haven't been able to test the latest patch, im also working for another 4 hours or so. Been looking forward to it all day though! Couldnt of done anything but help. The devs still need to fix ignore armor perks and effects to impact energy defense as well though, but with a splitter and multiple guns I don't think ill have too much of a problem using these guns. They should still be better though, they're end game rolls and should output the best damage in the game.
---
It's happening on consoles as well, so it's not a PC/mod issue.
---
This is a terrible, terrible idea.  All duped items/weapons that are currently floating around will be obsolete in the near future anyways.  Games like this always add in stronger and stronger weapons and armor, and I'd be willing to bet we'll be seeing our first 4- or 5-star gear when the new raids come in a few months. Suggesting that you wipe the literally hundreds of thousands of hours of progress people cumulatively have in this game to alleviate a minor, temporary problem that a lot of people don't even notice is insane.
---
What about tank killer on energy rifles?
---
Experiencing as well possibly adrenal reaction as well. 
---
Yes and I'm one of those people that grinded, it would wipe me aswell, hell even a strategic wipe removing all assassin's and unyeilding armour and all bloodied weapons would solve this for the most part as those are the big three.
---
Worth mentioning this would leave me armour and weaponless.
---
LOL... thanks.  Maybe this new patch will let us brew it?  Here's wishing...
---

I have no mods installed except a map mod. so this is definetly not the issue
---
Thank you anyways
---
&gt;having 9 points (picklock, hacker, the barter one) of special points allocated to perks you don't always use is just silly,
---
Don't forget all the Ammo/Gun/Armor/Pipe Smith perks, CAMP perks. Super Duper, Power Armor/non Power Armor perks
---
Don't think that works never tried though
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUtSazFb5qM
---
Shocker lol
---
I've restarted the game and my computer. Made sure ports were open. Did all the things. No fix yet. 
---
Your friend ain't the only one with full sentinel's gear you know :) 
---
Get rid of your mods and custom .ini files and repair the game files via the launcher. This is your problem, not theirs.
---
The sneak attack portion does not, but the critical portion of your shot should. If it did not, it must have bugged out.
---
Does this extend to the camp Brahmin? (The fertilizer producer under resources)
---
I will absolutely put mine back in my camp if that's how it works.
---
Too bad it’s not all about you man, but you had to learn that at some point I guess. Have a good day!
---
Who the hell cares about PVP?  Probably doing you a favor trying to get you do something more productive.
---
That never happen to me, but in case it will sucks.
---
So it should be better to just inspect items offered, it makes sense! 
---
There will be some who'll try to kill you, destroy your camp or murder your dog but that's a minority. 
---
The rest of us will either try to help the new players or just don't want to engage with them at all. We might leave you gifts, we might tag along to help you level up, we might even build something in your camp if we team up with you. Why? Because there is not much else to do at higher levels and we chose to not be savages who trample on the small guys. :)
---
I got one Calibrated Shock for my X-01 in the Whitesprings bunker after Patch 6. As about 5 days ago actually. I've been hoping to get another one so I can have that sweet sweet +100 carry weight, but thus far, nothing.
---
Sorry you are having this issue.  It is frustrating I am sure.  I just know this is not a new bug, and not related to the patch.
---
I third this.
---
I have wondered about this too, I dont even have doors for my camp. I have a 7-story, 3x3 tower, no doors. Yet mobs spawn in on the 3rd floor sometimes, and I ALWAYS think its a player sneaking at first, then go downstairs to find mongrels, protectrons, etc. How did they get in? Its not game-breaking, and is definitely hilarious every time.
---
Welcome to online games where on occasion if no better solution is found even "innocent" people may get hit by a needed solution to fix something they didn't even participate in
---
I’m still waiting to be able to duel wield as  shown in the first trailer
---
Gives carry weight and defense bonuses. Go figure.
---
I would say it's hands down better until you get a full set of decent legendary armor. 
---
Thanks for the response though. 
---
There's a ton of posts about this, Bethesda even [replied to some](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0onex/might_have_wanted_this_to_brew_more/eig2ecx/?context=1000). It's worth trying to turn off your mods and get rid of your custom ini. 
---
Well, it's as I thought. You aren't going to know if you got reported. Nothing came up that said, You've been reported. Yes, your friend probably was.   
---
But it like I figured it would be, Bethesda will investigate. You know, because in general, that's how these things work. You don't know you've been reported until after it's been looked into, and someone makes a decision.   
---
So all your complaining and worry and being upset over the new reporting system was kind of for nothing. 
---
Unless of course, you and your friend are exploiting and harassing and using offensive language. Which, both sides did. So I guess both sides need a temp ban. I mean, offensive language is just that. And you friend used it. 
---
I'm not sure if your trying to say I'm the only legit player or the only player it wouldn't bother.
---
Wait. What?
---
Amen brother. Preach
---
I can unlock my account for Bethesda as a whole now, password works, but am still banned from the game. 
---
So, they’ll let me BUY other games on the account but not access FO76. Yea, ok. 
---
I was helped a lot when I was a young pup and I try to pay it forward when I can. Why make the game miserable for new players? 
---
That’s not as bad
---
I appreciate all the updates and bug fixes, but why can't you guys fix anything without breaking something else? As of this patch, you can no longer "inspect" vendor items to see what the 2nd or 3rd star is on a legendary item.  
---
How the fuck could you break this???
---
I didn't realize there were limitations about the number of floors built away from foundations. I thought the patch addressed the concrete foundation fortresses. I hope there isn't any sort of limitation otherwise, because my CAMP is built so the bottom floor is surrounded by walls on bare ground (to protect my water, resources, power, and food) and the top floor is where I place the rest of my stuff. It looks kind of nice, like having a really unfinished basement, but it requires only one foundation for the entire house.
---
You realize a full inventory wipe would kill the game entirely right? No one would continue playing after that. The way they handled it was probably their best option to prevent major backlash. Going forward I think they need to raise the level cap and maybe add the 4 and 5 star drops so that the duped gear starts to become obsolete rather than delete it all. But none of this matters until they fix the ability for people to dupe in the first place and lets face it they aren’t there yet. 
---
I tried that and it didn't work for me
---
I wonder what the actual operational costs for the servers are. Virtualization has changed how servers are run quite a bit. IE Guild Wars 1 is pretty much never going to be shut down regardless of player count because it costs almost nothing to run.
---
Fallout 76 is designed to spin up world instances as needed, so even with low player counts, the cost to operate shouldn't be too high really.
---
I’d absolutely love to be wrong about this one. I think that the limitations will be more severe on FO76 because of the engine limitations and resulting server strain. It’s an ooooold engine and wasn’t designed with being an MMO in mind, whereas even games like Shroud of the Avatar were developed with multiplayer in mind from the start. 
---
Again, I wanna be wrong so badly. I’d love to have a fully customized house that feels *alive* and lived in. 
---
The map mod will still cause it... 
---
Das Spiel ist sau geil weiter so Bethesda! Es geht doch ich warte jetzt nur noch auf diesen Pvp Modus. 
---
Does anybody have issues fast traveling to Harper's ferry? Every time I fast travel their, I load in to a black screen. I can hear everything and see my compass and everything on the that goes with it. But the rest of the screen is black and I have to close the application. This has been going on for a couple weeks. (PS4 pro) 
---
...Well that's a kick in the teeth. Why is it that they only know how to nerf things? Can someone sit the bethesda balance team down and explain the difference between "balance changes" and "flat out nerfing the only good affects"? 
---
Well, your friend said the word fuck. That's a word that is on the no list. So the video he made showing how he was unfairly reported, (Which he doesn't know), shows him violating the code so if he gets a temp ban, it's his own fault, since he provided proof he used offensive language.   
---
And before you go down the road of what is offensive language, you don't consider fuck an offensive word. That ain't your call. 
---
sounds like a bad internet
---
/u/actuallygarry Same thing happened to me, deleted my custom ini that i used to enable mods, and it worked.
---
Going to make sure I can still put things back but will rebuild as well... going to take all night and be so aggravating. It was perfect. 
---
Thank you, having a backstory makes the game more engaging for me so I’ve really enjoyed it.
---
Lmao aww did someone have a server disconnect at whitesprings?
---
Then let's extend this idea, relegate all current charecters to servers made for them and force a new adventure mode servers that require a fresh restart(same level just no gear transferred), so the people who bought duped gear can keep thier duped gear but people who want to play on a legit server can.
---
Literally everybody knows that workshops are PvP… 
---
Silos have their own timers they have never been tied to individual players. You have to listen to the silo holo tse to find out their timers on each server.
---
It is the issue, i deleted my ini and game was fixed. 
---
Why, for a distillery of course!
---
What about the issue with stranger in numbers, where it seems to have the opposite affect? 
---
I'm saying you're the only one experiencing as whippings like this.....
---
Want them so bad
---
are you SPECIAL?
---
Itl be a shame when PvP servers arrive and they are dead on arrival due to this mindset, even worse when they release raids and they are a joke as everyone is in perfect gear.
---
Not everyone who was banned was a cheater or a duper, I got banned, never cheated or duped or used one single exploit. Don't give a flying fuck if you believe me or not. Actual innocent people was banned. I know, I know, Bethesda, make a mistake, like make bugged software, that has literally never happened hu.
---
Ummm is this real life? If so, move over Lon Lon Milk there’s a new utter in town.
---
Let him dream.
---
It definitely didn't or it would of killed him.
---
In 2000 I went to the one in Luzern. Canon blast at 5am, people already drinking, marching bands. I had a blast.
---
Couldn't disagree with you more. I'd be happier if people like you quit tbh then have all my character progression reset.
---
Of course, Bethesda should track down every mod made by every modder across every mod-page, de-code these and then upgrade their own game with all those different mods made in dozens of different ways in mind. That should give us quick and good updates.
---
No, I think I understand what the problem is perfectly.
---
I’ve yet to run into a quest breaking bug, I’m level 83 and have another character at level 32. It sounds like you had a bad install 
---
Im hoping my tse flamer will be viable since it isnt actually bad it just cost to much to shoot
---
Agreed! 💯
---
We’re more towards placing them, in the first place. But I agree - we can propably both spend our time better than arguing on the internet. A good night to you, too. 
---
I suppose it's better than being the sheep who wants to limit themselves.
---
You're given a problem (not enough space) and you come up with a solution that gives you additional space (a mule). 
---
This just changes "scrounging for lead" to "scrounging for acid". 
---
Have the timers ever been over 200 hours?
---
If a silo timer were the problem, would I have been able to launch from a silo that rejected my friends' attempts?
---
Hoping the first listed item under Bug Fixes: Quests will fix my issue with Heart of the Enemy. I'll find out when I log in shortly I guess.
---
So avoid large potions of a game I bought because it's filled with duped gear? That's alot like don't look at the dog crap we just sweep it under the carpet
---
The first time I got slapped to death, my character was standing in Whitesprings and my girlfriend decided to get frisky. When I came back to the game, two dudes were slapping my character to death. For some reason I didn't care. Lol.
---
Someone confirm please!
---
Is it each individual letter? Havent gotten online yet to check. Does it work like the signs and letters one?
---
u/valseek
---
We may see 4 star yes but chances say it will be another minor stat not a major meaning the op things will still be op
---
And one hand vs 2 hand! The ski sword looks like a 2 hander.. but time can't tell

"But what's in it?.."
---
Why would Zenimax, the parent company of Bethesda, handle your support ticket for your ban? This is the most whiny cringy post I've seen today. I hope you don't get sued for posting audio of you harassing some front desk person. Maybe be a little less entitled and this whole thing could have been avoided.
---
Ur so salty bro, as has been said before get gud or get out. 
---
Wait they buffed stealth!?!!?  /s
---
Chances say it would be a minor not a major stat which would solve nothing
---
Look, I get it, I played fallout 4, I probably had a metric ton of shit in my workshop before I hit level 15 too. But. And this is critical, this isn't your home PC. 
---
This is a server, which you share with other people, and your metric tons of carry weight actively affect everyone else's ability to play on a stable server. 
---
Especially if you're shifting metric tons from one account or character to another. 
---
In short...yeah, no, you're playing the game wrong. 
---
Oh sorry forgot ps4
---
HA! HA!!  they DID change the budget limit.  it was increased.  looks like you were wrong.  lots of free space, where as i had none.  goes to show what you know!
---
I did see this! And that is cool. But not quite the same as what I’m asking. 
---
Today's brewing update
---
Most of the community is awesome. My experience in the first 60 hours of play has been 98% positive. with 2% asshole for seasoning. 
---
Never played a MP online game with a  similar ratio before. Lovin' it.
---
I'm hoping for chocolate... Not really a vanilla fan
---
Go to a train station and read the poster on the bulletin board. 
---
Certainly not the most buggy game I’ve ever played. Some early Sims games were real doozies.
---
poster at VTU, any train station, or get it from the atom shop (free)
---
BOATUS

Furious explosive minigun and my furious plasma gat
---
Not to forget my ol standby the vampires laser 
---
Loved them to begin with hop they are even better now 
---
Nice, you linked Perk Loadout Mod!
---
Such an **essential** QoL mod.
---
How do you get it? I haven’t gotten a chance to play yet.
---
So ruin everything for EVERYONE because of a select few, yup sound fair!
---
Performance improvement. Could be a sick way of saying they increased the the performance of the negative effects.
---
Hey fellow shotgunner. I have been considering making a post on this but I reeeeally didn't want to give away my sources for tons of plastic. Here goes anyway.
---
One tour of Whitespring can net close to 200. How, you ask? Start at the golf club, enjoy the free rads and ghoulies. Take the shopping baskets and golf clubs from the store downstairs, then head upstairs to grab golf balls and golf clubs in the display cases. From there, you've got a few more golf balls in the big room as well as a pool table and a cigarette machine. Go toward the rear of the building and hop in the trash can to grab all that sweet sweet plastic cutlery, and grab the golf balls from the blue bin on the shelf. Then head out front, where a basket of golf balls awaits in the back of a truck near the bus by the tennis court. Speaking of the tennis court, don't forget to grab the stack of Nuka Cola cups at the water dispensers. Alright, so now it's off to the pool. Life preservers, pack of cigarettes, stack of cups, various plastic cutlery. From there, head through the hole in the wall down to the putting greens where you find a bunch of golf clubs and balls between the little room and the greens. If you still need more plastic, go around the back of the resort where you'll find tons of balls and clubs strewn about. Now head to the parking lot where you'll find a few enamel buckets, some golf balls in the laundry room, and possibly a few pieces in the washers and dryers so don't forget to check there. Last stop is inside the resort, the salon has six hairbrushes and a globe. And hit the hampers/trash cans in the spa, I usually get lucky and find at least one piece of plastic.
---
There you have it. I generally have thousands of regular and Ultracite shells on me at any given time thanks to this method. Plastic is actually quite plentiful if you take the time to look for it. 
---
Oh and don't forget Sugar Grove! Thank goodness they were chainsmokers down there, plenty of smokes to be had.
---
Why is the absolute limit 1500 lbs above a players carry weight? Are mules supposed to be punished, because giving useful weapons that I could never hold on my main account makes it a good feature. Now, with no warning we are unable to even transfer these items to another account or trade them, but rather MUST destroy them. 
---
I don’t even understand how the 1500 lbs was came to, you can easily rack up 1500 lbs just by playing the game like normal. Having this addition only hurts mules who have slightly above 1500 lbs, where if someone was actually duping they would have 20-30k lbs plus. 
---
Would it be possible that this is changed back to the way it was? 
---
Was there a confirmation? I haven’t seen to many ask this specific question. Couldn’t find it when searched.
---
No , but the usually nerf stuff without informing, meant it was a buff if we have a stash in bunker 😂 know were it is?
---
I brought this up and the OP just wants drama not solutions. 
---
Not sure but I would think so. Could scroll through the whole alphabet, just like signs and letters etc.
---
they actually TELL you how to start the quest.  how did you miss that?
---
the "party poster"?
---
I love it! Was it a "server disconnect while trying to re-claim a death bag" loss? Was it a "You got killed by invisible enemies that are doing damage even though they haven't rendered in yet" multiple times loss? 
---
maybe it was a "It was grabbed by someone else who died near where you died and didn't know it wasn't their bag because the game almost never gives waypoints" loss?
---
Definitely not the problem huh? Lol
---
Just cuz your at 500 hours and bloated with stuff doesnt mean everyone else is. 
---
We need two camps. One... a permanent-ish structure.
---
Another... mobile. 1x1 only. 
---
I am DYING to set up a restaurant... though that would require better preservation techniques, but a man can dream.
---
Maybe a bar instead.
---
Wait how do you come to that conclusion?
---
First you compare duping to mules, which is hilarious.
---
Duping is creating an item through a means that was never intended and LITERALLY breaking the game.
---
A mule is a second character who has items in their stash. Allowing them to store items that they acquired fairly. Sometimes this required you to buy an additional copy of the game.
---
Also VERY few games have policies against mules. 
---
You choose to put yourself in that position and lose...
---
Duped gear is next to useless after the patch.
---
If there's perk/bobble/magazine exploits (which there are) that's a different story..
---
Then you try to rally people to clear the whole board.....
---
GTFOH with that nonsense...
---
You are addressing the wrong problem.
---
Why do people keep saying this absolutely moronic thing? I'm not modded. I fall through the world every day. 
---
I swear, every time there's a game breaking bug, some idiot goes "omg, you must use mods". No, this game's just shit. 
---
Wrongfully suspended I can wholly sympathize with.  Rightfully convicted I can't sympathize with too much. However; it seems to me a simple thing to unlock players who have been suspended until now.  Obviously with all of their characters deleted before allowing them back in.
---
With Dromedary and whichever one it is that removes rads from food and drink, inert flux is an excellent beverage. It fills ~47% thirst for me with no disease chance and a bit of disease resist. And now it's lighter than a pound!
---
You have a good one, as well.
---
I have had it happen that slap dmg was significantly higher than 5hp per- Which I understand is the threshold for slap dmg, yes? Yesterday in watoga dude ate through about 20-30% of my healthbar with 3-5 hits, in spite of my not having claimed a public workshop, I was in passive, and was wearing PA. 
---
Now I'm not claiming that the "I got 1 shot" stories are true, never had that happen. I did have several "claim workshop (x)" quests (walking in the vicinity seems to start these) going that I wasn't pursuing. Now I do not claim to be all up on the details of this game, so if it's supposed to be 5% of my total hp per hit = correct slap damage, then I agree- Its working correctly. 
---
 Thoughts? 
---
several of the quests are bugged.  they have removed several, but i know of 2 that are bugged and uncompletable.
---
Try looking for dlc map for 2019. if you cant find it on google try bethesdas instagram
---
I'm blind
---
It honestly is very misleading. A large group of gamers likely didn't see the roadmap and are just now learning about this update with the video. Nowhere does it say staggered release and it even goes as far as to say play now at the end which is just going to make people assume all of it is available now. 
---
yeah
---
What are you talking about? You can easily reach 1500 lbs just by playing normally. My two mules have 1600 lbs each and that will managing junk and only keeping good 3 star Weapons. 
---
Yes, this was the first thing I noticed in my camp
---
So the only thing actually available from this trailer is Nukashine right?
---
The more clothing, underarmour, hats, and outfits the better, in my opinion. 
---
Potato modem
---
There’s gonna be higher lvl gear at some point guaranteed. And honestly I kill people in assassins sentinel all day, sounds like you just suk at PvP. That’s cool man you’re salty cause you got killed, just admit it and stick to PvE. 
---
Here’s your L
---
I hope you steam your rage as you destroy your hoarded items on your mules, it would bring me so much joy.
---
but if you deal no damage who cares if you are invulnerable to other players?  those are the ones opting out of PvP
---
Bloodied explosive definitely
---
I'm pretty sure he needs a pistol from your inventory. 
---
Never played Conan Exiles, huh?
---
Well, friend... sit, and stay awhile...
---
I’ve seen the roadmap. The only thing I was seeing for sure on there was the new factions maybe having clothes.  
---
Really? I thot they would be irrelevant after their nerf
---
so they fixed adrenal mutation but my damage dropped??? how does this make sense. did they nerf melee/bloodied and not mention it?
---
It was a joke...about when people got confused about the term "stealth nerf", and people thought....ah...nevermind.
---
Really hoping my furious LMG is now worth the ammo cost. It's so cool to fire till you realize you just burned 3k rounds of .308 clearing Harper's Ferry because most of the damage was soaked up by armor.
---
1. Stay on the West side of the map for a while, East side is deadly.
---
2. Explore, gather, Craft, &amp; save, till your Stash Box is Full of all the things you need to survive.
---
3. Partake of the events as frequently as possible, good rewards &amp; XP to be had there.
---
4. Ignore the Main Quest line until level 45 for the best Long term experience.
---
   1. Several Parts of the Main and other Side Quest lines complete with a reward of Weapons &amp; Armor, which are awarded at your current level, many of these are great End Game weapons, if Acquired at max level.
---
5. Turn on you Mic, and talk to other players, most will be very helpful, and many will give you items to aid you in conquering the wasteland.
---
6. Before Taking ownership of a Public Workshop, consider recruiting a high level player to team up &amp; provide protection.
---
Because theres a new bug in this version that only happens if you have a modded ini file that causes you to constantly fall through the floor, and i dont know of anyone who has fallen through the floor without mods
---
Commie whackers 
---
Ahhh I see
---
.45 Lever Action, Shotgun and Zealot Grognak's Axe.  And a Grenade Machine Gun for the heavies 😀
---
Well before I get too into it and give something away, have you played today? There was a new update that added two new crafting stations and a new quest line. You can initiate this quest line by going to any train station and looking for a poster which is a hand written invitation to a frat party. Nukashine is involved with that 
---
You have a long wait because am not.
---
still not work.
---
is the Ultracite PA not T-51?
---
But if it wasn't for our bitching and you guys doing the jobs their beta testers should be doing we would never have had these changes in the first place.
---
This wtf
---
I was escorting him thru the cranberry bog the other day and was absolutely swarmed by scorched. I figure I'll kill them all then fix him. He went slow...I looked at the mission timer and watched it tick away while looking at the map wondering where his end point could be. No other enemy after that got close to him. At about 5 min left of the timer I just see mission failed and he commits seppuku. I just looked at my game and could only say wtf 
---
oh lol
---
Yep, looks like it was intended.
---
Does the issue happen if you have a custom ini, but no mods?
---
Fair enough... SOTA was Unity, by the way...
---
Yeah...I'm kinda in the "I probably won't buy any of that limited time crap" because it's an exploitative mechanic aimed at forcing people with compulsive disorders to dump insane amounts of cash on skins. 
---
Finally, the milk of human kindness!
---
&gt; Read something on this sub a while back saying other players can access our inventories during a trade
---
That was proven to be an unfounded rumor which was passed off as gospel truth by a lot of people for some reason.
---
either / or based on beth's earlier response. to be safe just get rid of all of them
---
Were they sitting around or quest rewards? If so, where do mods spawn in Camp Venture?
---
Two-sided brick wall will be great. I don’t like this dirty white side
---
Mules literally store an item through a means never intended.  Why can't we make infinite characters on our current accounts and transfer items to them?  Why is there now a cap on the items kept?  Why should someone with money unfairly be allowed to store more than someone else?  I compared it to duping because you're making the same argument that it's okay because you're able to do it.
---
I agree that’s why I’m asking. I’ve played since beta and have everything but the 2 or 3 super rare outfits that people want 20k for. I only wear 2 or 3 different outfits. Just haven’t found anything that really stands out yet. 
---
Mainly looking for my character to be unique, and not look like everyone else. 
---
What if combat perks didn't compete with non-combat perks?
---
We'd all be running the exact same builds, welcome to Clone Wars. Quality of Life and utility are choices in perks, these have always been choices in Fallout games. People however don't want to have anything less than MAX damage while also having ALL the utility.
---
Boring, copy-paste builds, is the only outcome of such a system. Just remove lockpicking, hacking, rads from food/water and many more such mechanics.
---
No, they should make changing perks much harder. Only near Stashboxes for instance. Make people actually think about and stick to a build for more than 5 minutes.
---
Aaah 😂 sry im a little of with high fever 
---
My suggestion is always to try a wired connection and see if that fixes all your issues. If so you know that the problem is on your end.
---
Yea no, and though they locked our carry weight I had not yet had a chance to get items off her because prior to ALL patch's this was in my way a rule of sorts so all my belongings are on her still.  Had I had more warning I could of giving more away faster.   Thus I did not so it is as it is.  And BTW I am not playing wrong Bethesda is making games wrong. Period.
---
I would love to know the effects of the other vintage items. Also, that is great the fermenter can hold 10 of them, that means I can stockpile that firecracker whiskey and maintain a semi-permanent blackout as I set the world on fire
---
I would really enjoy being able to view items’ details while I do business with vendor bots. Now its broken (PS4). I can see there’s a three-star item but won’t know what the details are because R3 button no longer works. 
---
👎👎👎
---
Because it's locked for Everyone not just you.
---
If you then unlock it someone else can loot it.
---
You can milk anything with nipples...
---
O you're good I was about to suggest my 3* bolstering heavy 1 endurance weapon weight 
---
If you watched video you would see it.
---
I don't run mods, but I did modify my INI file because your mothman update completely broke my game, making it so items I purchased from creation club didn't appear. The fix for modded players also worked for non-modded players, and your company never addressed that issue. 
---
if I delete my .ini file, I go back to not being able to use the content I purchased.

Powering up rewards are not Random, you will get Large Generator, Windmill, Fusion generator in that order as long as you learn each one, if not you will continue to recieve the highest level one you haven't yet learned.

I have nipples, can you milk me? 
---
This whole bullshit post is an ad for his garbage YouTube channel.
---
Removed all mods, still happening to me. What else can I do to fix this? I died twice and lost all of my junk. Which was to say almost every thing I had to my name, so now I own no materials at all, thank you Todd.
---
Funny thing is I rarely lose in PvP even rarer when I have the element of surprise as I did here it's just getting to be a beyond royal pain as all the legit grinders appear to be falling off while the people who duped gear or bought duped gear appear here to stay
---
GOOD SHIT.
---
Yeah, it's tough. I'm only level 15 with my "Sandy the clown" character, and I have literally gifted 5 greaser outfits, about 6 ranger hats, and three t-shirt and jeans to other players. It'd be nice to find other stuff... in these games, character customization is KING to me.
---
Damn that would have been great but thx anyway 
---
Loses fight.  Gets on Reddit.  Asks for the game to be wiped.
---
I'm sure they'll get right on that.
---
Either 24 hours from your last quest with him or same time as the daily challenges are both safe bets
---
u/ladydevann, can you give us a definitive answer on this?

Yep I have it too

Pretty sure its a recipe from the daily quest, so its currently unavailable 
---
sorry... what 2 or 3 are those? Just curious to have an idea.
---
I'd say it's worth having with any build that isn't a high HP direct combat non-bloody build. If you're a sneak build, the loss in HP won't matter that much, and any boost in damage, even a few percent, is a good thing. 
---
So be it suppose. I guess AA and full health it is.  
---
Truth, it is just ignorance of the system.
---
TSE 50 cal shreds and melts 👌
---
Duped armour and bloodied weapons were never addressed so wtf are you talking about useless?
---
this person has lived the pain i have and im glad its an issue to multiple people , RIP my ballistic fiber , i still miss you 
---
I would probably do this because it does feel cheap that duped items made everyone overpowered. I kind of like how when you organically play your characters are kind of a mess because it is almost impossible to find everything you need for just the right build
---
The white strand lights from the atom shop gave off a soft glow and would blink or twinkle or just stay light up. In this recent patch, these lights now flash the nuka cola icon and it isn’t what we paid for, for those who have bought the light strands, as they don’t give off that nice glow anymore. 
---
That's pretty much the only place in the entirety of the end game it's worth it for though, unfortunately. I put on hacker 3 and lockpick 3 for launching the nuke.. then take it off and put something more useful on, like glow sight / nerd rage
---

1) **Coming to Fruition** has vanished from my quest log as of this update. How do I get the quest back? I was stuck at the point where I had to load the Master Holotape and now that's gone from inventory, and going to Abbie's Bunker doesn't re-trigger the quest. It seems like this update fixed the issue with the quest but also made it impossible to finish the Free States' quest line.
---
2) **Prototypical Problems** had the same tape loading bug as Coming to Fruition for me (it would never load the holotape no matter what I did). Is this a known issue?
---
OwO
---
Well there is nut milk, for example almonds. So you can milk nuts.
---
interesting. u/valseek
---
Also, can you take a screenshot?
---
I bet it'll be limited time for 24hrs and I'll miss it. And I'll have to wait for it to never come back, just like the other blackbird PA paint. 
---
I've lost so much ballistic fiber, and steel, and lead, and plastic that way...
---
Can you send me a DM with your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) name, character name and system? (I'm assuming xbox from the icons on the screenshot, but asking for verification in case you're using a controller on PC.)
---
What console are you on? I'll buy it if your ps4
---
I mean, the pointy end of the almond is clearly the nipple. So therefore, my original statement stands.
---
Is it harassment tho?
---
I just want legit answers to understand if my playstyle is bannable. 
---
...that is an argument in favor of Bethesda. Not sure where you are going at this point. 
---
For the last 2 months ive been rocking a 2 shot gaitling gun that can do 197 damage with perk cards. And i also now rock a double ammo capacity 50 cal that holds 500 bullets. My third weapon is a quad barrel double pump shotty. 
---
SO SICK :)
---
AWESOME!  I think we were always supposed to be able to get knight, elder plans etc through the rewards but it was bugged.  
---
My zealot's gatling seems to be good n' chunky since the update but I guess with the week long nuke lockout it'll be a while before I can use it on the queen.
---
All my heavy weapons do a lot more damage. My minigun went from like 15 to 25. Its at 35 with Adrenal Reaction. Bloodied Mini-Gun is like 55ish damage. Crazy. The fire rate is very slow though. So less for the server to keep track of. 
---
Its not really damage buffs we got. Just server performance changes to high rate of fire weapons. 
---
Yea. Noticed it as well. Ammo in gun goes to 000 and need to reload.
---
The likelihood of a spot being a no go is directly proportional to how fun it would be to camp there.
---
Yes because "get gud" is a solid response to when someone has a legit issue with how something is being handled.
---
Youre wrong because the person asked a question that has a correct answer and you gave them the wrong answer
---
Just noticed this too
---
Wait, were they using a bloodied build? They probably used Serendipity from the luck tree to outright evade the entire attack.
---
Otherwise damage bugged out. It has happened to me. And if not a bug, you are overestimating your damage during a critical hit. Activating a critical adds an extra hit based on your unmodified weapon damage. You may do 1000 damage with your rifle, but the critical aspect only cares about your damage before all those buffs.
---
I'm on Xbox, not sure if I want to sell it lol
---
See what? That he got reported? I watched the video. I didn't see anything that came up saying, You've Been Reported. Are you claiming that happened? Cause you've said in this thread several times, you won't know if you are actually reported. 
---
Face it. You're just trying to make a mountain out of nothing. Bethesda said if people are just honestly PvPing, they have nothing to worry about. The system isn't automated, so you aren't going to have some program just tallying up times you've been reported. 
---
What I saw was 3 players, who are a certain type of games, all of which are the kind of gamers that put to much self esteem into how good they are at games, and then cry a lot when someone is better than them. Who use offensive language, which all three in that video need to temp ban, because they broke the rules of the game. 
---
I've seen posts talking about knight and paladin paint, always assumed people were full of shit - even Google image search only turned up pics of initiate paint. Maybe they were there before and got fixed, or maybe I've just had bad luck in the month I've been playing.
---
it's under wall decor, try scrolling through all categories. for example, one user posted earlier that they had to go to the mothman poster and scroll to the right to find it.
---
Will you submit a ticket for me and send me that ticket number in a DM? https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10 
---
As a heavy weapons build, that's one of a few reasons I dropped my TSE for Furious Explosive. Can't say I've regretted a minute of it, either. 
---
/u/ladydevann
---
Uhoh your 2 cap bid is looking good so far might get the cheapest high ever 
---
No, you're hoarding crap you will never use. You're getting mad that you can't transfer that hoarded crap to other characters. 
---
Play ANY other multi-player game. MMO's? Stash size is VERY limited.  Bank vaults, charicter inventory, it's a few slots. 
---
RUST types? You're limited to a small personal inventory and whatever you can shove in chests. 
---
So yeah, that they ever allowed you to put yourself in this position by launching without a capped inventory was a mistake. I'll agree that part of this issue is on bethesda.
---
Oh shoot, you’re totally right. I initially thought it was a Vault but those totally don’t come until Summer- i wonder what these new underground locales are and when we get them? I didnt see them mentioned on the roadmap...
---
Goodluck! People have been saying the same lol they don't know what to do with it. 
---
r/whoosh
---
Dam I only got tse shotguns n shit

Blanket fixes aren’t the answer but you seem all to fond of hyperboles and generalizations so I wouldn’t expect you to understand that. You sound so salty rn and I hope you can just enjoy the game instead of whining about not being the top dog. I wish you luck!
---
&gt; Removed all mods, still happening to me. What else can I do to fix this? I died twice and lost all of my junk. Which was to say almost every thing I had to my name, so now I own no materials at all 
---
The game has an M rating. Idt curse words count. Racist, bigoted, derogatory words I can see. But an M rated game saying fuck or shit I'm not wrry would constitute temp ban. Unless it was used like "ima fuck your mom's dead body".
---
Stealth not vats crit and they were max hp or near enough
---
Two-shot was the previous king of primary effect damage boosts. Now that it's nerfed to hell, Bloodied is one of the most powerful (assuming you are comfortable with a build keeping you below 20% health at all times). So that part got swapped from "min-max" builds.
---
But explosive, is a secondary perk and as such I don't think there are any others that give a better damage boost, even following the nerf, so it still is the best 2nd perk for a 2+ star ranged weapon.
---
Sadly, no, but I'm just gonna make a post about it, seems like the thing to do lol
---
I have not played but now I’m excited lol 
---
 Removed all mods, still happening to me. What else can I do to fix this? I died twice and lost all of my junk. Which was to say almost every thing I had to my name, so now I own no materials at all 
---
Honestly I don't think we talk enough about the importance of a good team. I have a strictly melee buddy who gives me all his plastic, in exchange I save any good legendary melee weapons I find for him. If you've got a good team with various builds (shotgun, sniper, melee) and everyone looks out for each other, you'll be swimming in supplies.
---
...Have you submitted a bug report?
---
which is a MMO.  MMORPG = Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game.  Out of curiosity I decided to google Multiplayer Role Playing Game just in case there was a subset I wasn't aware of.  You can do the same, it literally directs you to MMO.
---
even if its just an atom shop item.
---
And srynger.....
---
Black excavator and silver handmade. I'm in.  
---
Seems they're listening and adding more wasteland-y stuff and paint for other PAs. &lt;3 
---
Your solutions are not legit at all, your issue is very muddied. Do you have a problem with duping or just people beating you in PvP, it’s hard to tell..?
---
I'm not honestly overly concerned they are patching exploits that let people build wildly unrealistic camps. I know that workarounds make some really cool camps, but whenever you do something you know is not intended in the game you can't get all pissy when it gets fixed. If you don't enjoy building camps, then don't do it. If you enjoy it, then look at this as an opportunity to create something else fun that you like. 
---
This is all pretty small-potatoes stuff friend.
---
Confirmed, this is exactly what I did.
---
There's a Nuke Status holotape you can use, it shows you the cooldown status of all nuke silos in the server you're on so you can avoid having this happen again.
---
Pretty sure it’ll be Protectrons. There’s a camp near Whitesprings that has a terminal talking about how the Pioneer scouts started using robotic scoutmasters shortly before the war.
---
This isn't a new bug. I fell through the ground every time I logged in at my base in the last patch. 
---
You don't have to run mods to have a custom.ini. There were a custom .INI flags that were needed to force the game to load creation club content, even for non-modded players, after the mothman patch. 
---
As others have stated, if you've altered your ini files or installed mods, delete those and then scan and repair the game. If that doesn't work from there, [submit a ticket for me here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10), please!
---
It's been pretty decent lately. 
---
I keep seeing these "raiders" claiming it's okay to destroy other peoples work and time in the game because "its a part of the game".  But if that were true, then Bethesda would not be CHANGING the mechanics.  "Duping" was "part of the game" too, at release.  Sorry, but your logic is faulty.  Just because you can do certain things in game, doesn't mean that was what was intended, or how they intended it to work.  Which is why they are setting up the survival mode, making pacifists and their camps take zero damage, and implemented an in-game reporting system.
---
Imagine that.
---
Your arguments fall flat.  You are simply using them as an excuse for crummy behavior.
---
Real Life allows you to go up to a person and demand money in return for not taking a baseball bat to their car.  But it's still ILLEGAL to do so, with serious repercussions.  Just because you want an excuse to go around in-game and extorting people doesn't make it right, nor should other players have their time squandered by it.  You want to roleplay as a raider?  Run up to people begging them to help you get out of Appalachia before you get the Scorched Plague.  That's what happened to many of them.  The rest either killed each other in petty squabbles (there's a few holotapes about this in-game) or got killed by all the other monstrosities.  Roleplaying a raider?  Not in my opinion, you aren't.   You're roleplaying a psychopath that should have been dealt with back in Vault 76 before reclamation day arrived but somehow managed to keep it under wraps for a long time, at best.
---
Yeah I’ve got about 350 rn if you wanna trade 
---
He asked if its worth it. What i stated answers that fine. 
---
I think you need to learn a bit more about the exploits in this game.
---
I'm done with your crying.
---
I run solo and if you don't look for a fight.... You won't get one.
---
You're like the guy who walked up to the biggest guy in prison and tried to fight him. Then got his ass whipped and is crying over having to give up the booty.....
---
Looks like my adhesive farm just turned into a whiskey farm
---
Cap'n Stabbin'?
---
I thought this same thing it gives me hope for more radio songs 
---
For real, a bunker set is totally necessary. I would pay real money for it
---
that's part of the problem - the entire rest of the game, lockpicking/hacking just isn't worth it, especially if you couldn't hot swap perk cards in the wild. If they were to make it so you couldn't swap perk cards in the wild, they need to make lockpicking/hacking much more worth it.
---
RIP Drackar39's junk in the past , you happy todd , you slick yet amazing bastard , does this put a smile to your face 
---
I'm curious too.  Still at work though.  But I wouldn't be surprised if it was "No".  Since I think killing the Brahmin doesn't yield any drops, no meat or leather, since I assume they didn't want people to farm Leather and meat with a Fertilizer and Razorgrain.
---
But, it is a slightly different situation since I assume milking cows is a resource that needs to replenish like plants and nodes, so it wouldn't be a monster drop that would always be there upon death.
---
That's good news; I just don't think they applied the damage increase to TSE Laser guns.
---
It works on any Brahmin, even the ones in your camp
---
I see you've commented on here that you're not using mods or altered ini files. Have you tried to scan and repair the game from the launcher yet?
---
if you commented about it on reddit, it might have been you that I saw post it.
---
Spent 18k plus plans and a trade to get an assassin/cavalier right arm that I needed.  Quit complaining,  adapt and overcome.  Even with the best gear it's still kill and get killed,  no one is invincible. 
---
See, knew it. Curse words don't count, because I think they don't count. Man the only person having a real problem with this is you. 
---
Seriously, lighten up and give it up. If you aren't doing anything wrong, if you aren't griefing, using offensive language, and harassing people, you have nothing to worry about. 
---
I have to say, all your arguments, make me feel that you and your friends have probably used exploits and cheated in the past. Maybe not on a regular basis. But probably enough. Maybe even duped. 
---
I have no proof. I'm just basing it on how upset you are on how easy it is to be reported. I mean, seriously, why so upset? Unless you feel that being reported is going to get your account looked at a little to closely for you and your friends comfort. 
---
My damage went up reasonably with the adrenal fix and seems OK. I had kept the original mutation and didn't bother with the remove/re-apply stuff from the previous patch. I'm melee/bloodied. I'm not using Strange in Numbers, if that matters.
---
I mainly use the winter jacket and jeans with gray knit cap, the brown cowboy had and drifter outfit, and the union uniform and hat. 
---
Looking forward to the new prepper outfits from the atomic shop which is what made me wonder about them just adding new clothes.
---
You would wear sports equipment and pieces of tires in an actual apocalypse?
---
That could lead to unintended issues with players destroying items so others cannot have or use them.  Eg I destroy every fusion core I see so others cannot power their PA or laser gatling. 
---
Yes!! The Great vibes coming from that thing is just awesome :D 
---
If the bugs and crashes were the reason you didn’t like the game, I would say give it another shot. 
---
If you didn’t like the game because of the style of content or lack there of, not much has changed.
---
I think the Whitesprings bots outside, should behave the same as the Watoga bots after the "Mayor For A Day" quest, so if you do actually shoot them, it's just the one bot that attacks or just doesn't attack at all.
---
What's worse is the people who duped and admit they did so but still claim they were unfairly banned because they weren't specifically told they weren't allowed to do it.
---
I personally enjoy PvE with a fully upgraded scoped rifle, a .44 and a combat knife.
---
\*runs to finally go get razorgrain to try this\*
---
###GONNA DIG URANIUM HIGH ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP
---
I had Strange In Numbers completely remove the Adrenal Reaction effect. I was hoping for a fix, but instead I got a +- 50% damage nerf. Hah.
---
since I don't have any legendaries, an armor-piercing handmade.
---
You're missing the entire point of the post. There's no way to tell if he got reported, I get that. However I'm sure that the guy DID report. The issue is WHY did he report? Because he LOST. Due to that he reported someone for NO REASON. If people keep reporting people for NO REASON the  issues arise. Knowing people in this game my concern  is this will happen often. Bethesda replied and said this was not the case, so I will have to believe them at this point. Hope this clears up what i was saying cuz you def did not get it.
---
That's it, I'm re-installing the game, this is adorable
---
haven't played yet today due to work so  haven't seen the music box but your post has me very interested.
---
That’s about how it started for me and my wife. I think the griefers have largely moved on, so if you see a high level chances are they’re just another wanderer. It also seems to be a thing to go back to the beginning and drop supplies down for newbs. The only intentional griefing came later about level 35 when a super high level came up in a clown outfit and a chainsaw. So at least it was in fallout fashion. 
---
*I've played all versions of Fallout since 1998, and every Character is started and developed with a Backstory in mind.*
---
My Main Character was a New CIA operative recruited from an Elite Military Infiltration team.
---
Nobody from the vault knows my background, since I was there as part of an official mission, they believe I'm a Mechanic.
---
Oh Crap! now I have to kill all of you to protect my cover.
---
Upvoted for balancing. 
---
Most likely a banned scrub
---
*sigh...*
---
Have you read the patch notes?
---
Yes LMG is a heavy weapon,  if I am not mistaken 
---
My character CAME with a back story. Mine is Gordon Freeman, the right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world. So far, the world has a lot less screws and springs in it. Mission accomplished.
---
I don’t think it does... doesn’t seem to affect hunger or health in my testings
---
oh rly? but you still don't get screws I assume.
---
Still, I'm always running out of steel...
---
.45 for me.
---
I likes ta VATS snipe. 
---
That would be awesome! But to have that jukebox in my new brewery, The possibilities :) 
---
I grew up close to Freiburg (Germany, not the Swiss one). So I had Fasnacht (Fasnet, to be more correct) in Baden and a week later Morgestraich. It was always great.
---
Did you play Nuka World? I have a feeling you're going to hugely disappointed based on their cost. You do you though.
---
Unless it's the mire getting the new caves. Underground spooky shit would be dope 
---
/u/ladydevann ; /u/lonevaultwander
---
You won't be dissapointed! It's absolutley awesome! :) 
---
Fun detected. Reported.
---
I think they adjusted the weight of flux, maybe that is what did this
---
As someone who purposefully kills others, do you look for leveled players? Being level 40 and getting attacked by a 130 is absurdly unbalanced
---
Or just destroy them as was intended.
---
My damage was at 1900 last night with bloodied dcg +1 str and would go as high as 3k+ with about 5%. Now it’s at 1600 and only goes up to 1700 with 5% health after patch. Something is either off, or the dmg I had at 20% and the increase I got as my health dropped was a glitch with patch 6 and broken adrenal mutation.  Bummer surprise for something they claim to have fixed 
---
Nice.  Just yesterday I finally got the BOS Knight Underarmor Plan to spawn in the Watoga Traincar.  So many of the other two, and finally 1 Knight.
---
I know it's not the same, but since it's BOS it just made me remember it.
---
Looking forward to getting all the Paints from Tech Data.  I have a half a dozen Initiates, no Knight or Paladin.  Kind of wish they could be applied to other power armors though.
---
So true it hurts.
---
PSA: If you are above the max carry weight and can only destroy items, you probably cheated to get those items and deserve to have them destroyed.
---
Oh I understand it now you are right there are sewers I wonder what is it 
---
I'm just imagining momsters showing up at your camp... "have you eaten yet?"  "You should bring a sweater when you go out scavenging"
---
Naw wasn’t me, just backing up your info :)
---
That's not too difficult since you don't really need all that much acid for ore. If I need some fast I server hop at Toxic Larry's Meat and Go. There's usually 3 snallygasters right at the spawn point.
---
Otherwise as you're out and about, pick up bug and animal parts (bloodbug proboscis, stingwing gland, wendigo teeth, etc.), abraxo and chlorine. I have acid marked in my junk list and haven't needed to deliberately farm it in a while.
---
i thought the patch notes said the damage bonus was returned to what it was previously
---
But that would defeat the purpose of forcing people to destroy the items...
---
I separated my mule out across 5 characters on that account (I have a second Xbox right next to my main one). Shouldn't have had to but I predicted something stupid like this would happen
---
I haven't been told specifically that I can't pour molten lead down your throat, but I have a feeling that most people would understand a bit of punishment if I did.
---
That logic is stupid and not worth considering.  They knew better, they just didn't think they'd get caught.  Playing innocent is the only excuse they have left, and that's already worn thin.  Plus, if there *were* people innocently caught up in this, *their* issue is being watered down by the dupers trying to not look bad.
---
Part of it is server stability. When you have 100,000 items on you, the server has to keep track of it all. 
---
I'll be your.... nevermind, i won't go there, lol
---
Wonder if they fixed the invisibility glitch
---
Yeah, the other players in the game are much friendlier than your usual multi-player survival folks. However, the assholes and griefers are still here, they come with the territory on these games. 
---
Man somebody forgot about a time when save states weren’t even a thing, and might’ve even missed out on memory cards.  
---
It’s a video game. A digital piece of entertainment. Nothing you do/build/create is forever.  
---
Heck man, I bet you’ve never had to experience the emotions that come with being 90% of the way through the second half/play through of Super Ghost’n’Ghouls only to have someone trip over the power cable and lose a dozen hours of fun, but stressful and grueling play. How my mom didn’t kill baby me then nobody knows lmao.  
---
Whether intentional or not, loss and rebuilding/replaying in games is and will always be a thing. It definitely sucks to have spend your free time choosing to either rebuild that, or move on if you can’t see yourself getting any more enjoyment out of the the rebuilding and/or the final project, but it’s a choice you are inevitably going to have to make in some games you love.  
---
Hey there, have you [submitted a ticket](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) for this yet? 
---
Has this been set up yet and is there a discord. 
---
But my Blackbird skin is all I have in my life of any worth, I’m such a worthless person that this one skin I bought at a premium is actually of enough importance that I want to prevent anyone else from every getting their hands on it just so I can feel validated in a video game:)
---
Oh no. I've been bulking everything
---
Glorious.
---
I'm hoping this will be a thing once we get the option to display stuff from our Stash box, as I'd love to put my Nuka-Cola T51b PA on display, with my other Nuka Cola merch. I'm a big fan of in game branding such as Corvega, Giddy Up Buttercup and Nuka Cola. Would be sweet to have a "collectors" room in my home of Appalachia.
---
They say nothing about trades though
---
I'm not really opposed to having harsher negatives for speed demon
---
So... you built a dick.
---
and you're mad you have to rebuild your dick?
---
Dude... just build a better dick. Get a bag of Cheetos, crack a beer, put on some tunes, and spend your evening doing an arbitrary activity in a video game, that really, when dissected, is no different than any other arbitrary button pushing activity in a video game. 
---
Not from vendors, no.  They are still "looking into it".
---
Possibly still available as rare drops from Maps and/or Events though.
---
Buying from vendors, they removed the inspect feature and now we can’t see legendary effects beyond what it shows on screen for multi star items!!! What the fak
---
They may have patched the thirst/hunger bar mechanic. I was seeing wildly different values for Adrenal Reaction based upon my health, thirst, and hunger bars pre-patch.
---
Additionally, the old values for adrenal reaction did not change the upper value of the buff. Old vs New was always a max 50% buff to damage. The difference between old vs newvs old again was in the amount of HP you had to have to get a certain damage increase. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asqh1x/confirmed\_adrenal\_reaction\_scales\_its\_damage\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asqh1x/confirmed_adrenal_reaction_scales_its_damage_with/) (scroll down for Happycampers table)
---
what about the top of the monorail elevator?
---
like, bethesda stated that the bans were people with an exceptional amount of rare items in their inventory. Anyone playing innocent is just being deceitful and pathetic. You broke the rules, own up to it.
---
ladydevann the community manager also made a comment last week that these players should not be purchasing new accounts to circumvent these bans either, and apparently implied that they know who has and aren't too happy about it.
---
It's the same with wow, you have a chance to get loot, and then you can trade with people who might have gotten anything they don't want or need. I don't really see the issue because you are not supposed to be guaranteed a drop.
---
1500 LB's is pretty easily filled if you never got rid of any items. For a lot of legitimate players its just easier to dump all the extra stuff on a mule. 
---
I do agree that any items that are duped should be destroyed, but this is going to catch a lot of non-duped mules.
---
Most looters do a full reset every few months for this reason
---
Yes, but I have yet to run into any situation in game where it  informs gamplay at all. I act like the character in game, but there are so many players who don't even attempt RP  in general that playing to the backstory always feels pretty one sided.
---
I... I thought nut milk was a different thing...
---
Accept it 
---
I gave up. I have both perk cards maxed with 7 charisma and never get the tame option for any animal. Only pacify/ pacify
---
Fake news, no bricks caused by Anthem, just people who didn't know how to restart their consoles.
---
Yeah....  I can see staying away from chainsaw wielding clowns.
---
So instead of server hopping at a spot that will get you lead, you server hop at a spot that gets you acid. 
---
What you described is my pattern for gathering lead, only with toys and other things that contain lead, instead of things that produce acid to process lead that I had to farm in a separate step. 
---
There's nothing WRONG with your way, but it's decidedly not "superior" to my mind. It's just a different grind. 
---
Then every would hit a wall in about a week and complain for more content.  They couldn't win either way.
---
I’ve already reported you like 15 times,  oh damn, 16, don’t like your name, it offended me. Bethesda!!!!! Take’em away!!!!!
---
I'm not one of those people, but I think the logic might be:
---
&gt;Base game is okay for them
---
&gt;Game exploit makes game more fun for user
---
&gt;User would still play game without exploit, just would rather exploit if possible
---
That said, it seems like you might only want an answer from the people who only found fun with duping and such.
---
Wasn't uncommon before the patch, I noticed it last couple days.  Not usually 0, but often lower than I remember it being.
---
I had in mind to experiment with it to see if I could figure out what was going on.
---
&gt; Still, I'm always running out of steel...
---
Same.  But it's not like "oh no, I'm out of steel!  Damn it!"  it's more like "dang, out of steel, guess I gotta go spend 10 minutes and get 1000 more".
---
This is great. Now I can make the perfect white russian
---
Same here. Unlock it in atom shop. Get to my camp. And cant find poster... 
---
Yes, but that wasn't more damage. The old values just change how much HP you have to have to get a certain damage buff. It has always been a 50% buff at max.
---
It's due to using Mods and/or Custome INI files on the PC.  Check the numerous topics about it since the update for a solution.
---
There is a new quest line and next week there will be a limited time event 
---
From what I saw on Oxhorn's stream today, it  doesn't seem to affect jukeboxes in the world, can you verify this?
---
I heard this is because of mods.  You need to modify custom ini file.  There's other threads about this.  I'm not on PC so I can't help further.
---
More to the point, they _could_ have chosen a design that wouldn’t allow mods OR a design that wouldn’t load incompatible mods. 
---
Or they could have designed a game around the -inevitable- fact that a Bethesda game is going to (needs to?) be modded to hell and back. 
---
But they released a game that allows my client to modify how the game interprets my movement. 
---
If it can make me fall through the world, it can also allow someone with skills to create a mod that cheats. 
---
It’s bad design. Basically, and that’s the point I was reaching to make, and that I believe you may have missed. 
---
2 load outs would be amazing if just the bare minimum, but I think it would be really cool to be able to unlock more with a limit of something like 4. 4 would match up with the whole card theme with each load out acting like a different suit. 
---
Depends on the content of the source.
---
 Some file type have a very high compression rate, some grow when compressed. ( Graphics like JPGs actually get bigger when they are compressed, as the native format is already compressed)  text files can compress into the 90% range. bins and exe anywhere in between. 
---
Ex: many compressed Microsoft installers are 1/3 of their expanded size.
---
13gb download + (13\*3) expansion space = 13 X 4 = 52gb + 50 gb backup = 102gb required.
---
So there is a boost even at full health?
---
&gt; Why should someone with money unfairly be allowed to store more than someone else? 
---
So this isn't ok, but paying $$$ for microtransactions are because the devs want you to spend that money?
---
Literally makes no sense.
---
It's not even the most buggy Bethesda game I've played.
---
I hear that. I'm 5'10" 160 at about 8-10% body fat and I won't gain a pound unless I eat at least 4,000 calories a day. I was cursed with long legs and a short torso so I'll never be able to put up huge squat numbers. 
---
I'm tiny and I still get accused of being on steroids sometimes. The way I see it that's a compliment.
---
oh wow, it removes rads, weighs almost nothing, and decreases thirst and hunger. That is excellent because suppressing mutations with radaway was not working for me, and farming radshield was a pain.
---
He will spawn right at the end of the second bridge with his entourage behind you
---
What outfits are you missing ?
---
Well, first hand answers would be preferred to speculation, but speculation can make for interesting discussion, too.
---
What trailer?
---
I have \*tried\* yes, but nothing sticks, because nothing except "being in the military" makes sense with my character who can now shoot all the things and fight giant monsters... and i don't want that as a backstory. ;\_; WOMP WOMP  
---
Then again "being stuck in a Vault her entire adult life" kinda precludes any other backstories, so maybe i should stop trying.
---
I'm level 70 something I believe, just waiting on the game to update for me right now. Should be cool to hop on again. Hopefully it doesn't consume all my free time again ahha
---
Fair point, maybe you can only fast load out while in a CAMP?
---
Already my 2nd char on lvl 130, annoying to lvl up lmao
---
The Meliés mask! I need it. Badly. 
---
That's my point, there was no settings to stop me from collecting my stuff now that I have.  It changes now wanting me destroy what I collected.  Had these rules been set in place from the get go me and many others like me would not be in this jacked up position.  And hello I played all other FO's I know you CAN store more loot, in dressers, desks, cabinets etc they are not a SHARED stash like in Fo76 they knew coming into this MMO that they were adding tons of loot and items to collect, they KNEW storage would be a problem, and it's not like this was their first time launching a MMO either Skyrim, TES etc.  So they had full knowledge how it would behave on their systems and servers yes they made no effort in advance to combat that, rather let the servers all lag out crash go to shit then delete your process as if it was your fault for taking what they put in the game.  If I wanted a linear game I would play something else but, Bethesda hyped the "Play the way you want to play" as if that would actually be a thing yet patch after patch more gets taken away so we are playing more their way then our way.  Mistake #1 Bethesda going Online with a FO game.  That's my opinion.
---
Not yet, figured I'd try to get some help over here before throwing more support tickets at y'all. That's my next step though, for sure.
---
You need to complete the questline that gives the daisycutter first
---
cool thanks for this. hopefully it'll make my hopping more efficient.
---
even with the positives reduced? I just get so bored of eating all the time hehe!
---
Oh, I'm sure. 
---
Contrary to popular opinion I haven't really been disappointed yet. The only reason I took a break for the last month/month and a half was that I got ac origins and ac odyssey on sale and since that series is my all time favorite I was compelled to play them
---
I really wanted a stealth play-through but the pop in made it impossible. Spawning in front of me was rough. I'm waiting and so far it's looking good. I watch a lot of MATN and his recent FO76 video was in line with my thinking. 
---
I'll be interested to see how things change in 76 over the year. 
---
Well said.
---
What questline is that and how do I activate it?
---
Im doing pvp all the time actually
---
It's not just 1500 lbs though, it's 1500 lbs ontop of your carry weight.  So for me, 1960 with Excavator.
---
Then of course, you can no longer pick up once you get that high.  So it's not like you are going to legitimately get to 5000 lbs and have to destroy 3500 lbs worth of stuff before you can drop stuff again.
---
Cant remeber the name, but you start it at the terminal in ellas bunker
---
If they released all of it, people would hit a wall within a week or two then complain for more.  They really couldn't win either way.  I'm fine with slow drip feed of content.  Plus I play other games to fill in the gaps.
---
Time for some milk steak
---
Yea game development is quick and easy
---
You know they told us this was being delivered over several months. So not really a valid complaint. 
---
So if you didn't know that, now you do. 
---
Did you really just say duping was apart of the game... lolllll
---
I see. That's interesting. 
---
I'm pretty sure I was never having my hunger/thirst below 50% since I've got a farm and some purifiers. Also using Lead Belly.
---
As far as I understand, it's supposed to give you a maximum of +50% damage and nothing more then? I don't know what the hell bugged out then for me. lmao
---
I think this applies to it now then, right?

Dildo bat is horrid.
---
But black Excavator is cool, pretty cool...
---
Should look good enough together. I'll probably respec from lasminigun T51 to dildobat Excavator.
---
Had no mic and I hit him to grab his attention. Did the follow me emote and walked his slow ass to the nearest workshop placed a stash box down and then he msg me saying omg thank you. I traded with him before all this and I mean he literally had everything in his inv. All his junk weapons and armor. It was crazy. He had a bounty which made me find him. Killed him and I was like why tf am I overweight rn I have nothing in my inv. Checked my junk had over a 100 each of almost every junk material. 
---
Some people just don’t know. 
---
Yeah the lack of awareness in the post you replied to is astounding.
---
I have an excavator with calibrated shocks and emergency protocols for Whitespring runs.
---
To show off I have T-51b with nuka cola paint and a jet pack.
---
For the SBQ I have x-01 with calibrated shocks and emergency protocols and arms that reduce ap cost of power attacks.
---
Otherwise I run around in a full set of unyielding. But I'm still squishy that way, can't really farm caps from supermutants in that.
---
I don't do pvp, not my thing. I did it in Destiny but never got to the point where I was actively \*enjoying\* it. Got good enough that I could do pvp quests and that was it.
---
And what are the super rare ones? 
---
Myself, depends on character. 
---
For my "realistic character", I like the farmhand clothing and newsboy hat, with goggles and camo bandana.
---
For my addict-trash character... anything that looks like she slept in it for months. Radstag gear works.
---
For Sandy? He's worn that damn party hat since he left the vault, and refuses to remove the clown suit. Not super original I know... but for some reason, he is hands down the most fun to play.
---
Where is it dropped?  Ontop of your head?  Behind your ears?
---
This has always been an issue.. nothing new.
---
He should love the new quest line and crafting then. :D 
---
I understand that.
---
I don't see any current practicality, but it's something I noticed when I reset my security door. Maybe this is something that could be used for lengthy DLC quests in the future that might require PIN codes.
---
What happened?  Is it vanishing again?
---
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
---
NO.
---
We all know why. 
---
Me either! I haven’t completely that quest either 
---
Your game, your CAMP, you play whatever you want. :)
---
If you have a file named "Fallout76Custom.ini" in your Documents/games/fallout76 folder, then you still have (remnants of) mod(s) being referenced upon game startup.  You should try renaming the file so it doesn't load at game startup and see if that resolves the issue.  Chances are you have some missing information in this file that needs to be added to get things working for you (with mods) again.
---
Same, which trailer? I absolutely fell in love with the first one. And the live action one is good, but a little deceiving
---
Hey there! Can you DM me some info? [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) name, character name and system you play on, please and thank you!
---
you've missed a couple patches. Also, have you read the [roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)
---
Many thanks for this information, helped me
---
U-ranium U-ranium 
---
Yes i have done scan and repair and found the same result. Then uninstall and redownload for same result. Now i am in the process of removing all possible files on my PC for Fallout76. At present i am reinstalling the game to test a third possible fix. Any other information to help resolve this would be great.
---
So what happens
---
Organic solution quest in the mire. Find Ellas bunker ...
---
In the Fallout universe, hell yes!
---
Don't forget the bat :3 Female characters need these often nowadays :3
---
Fucking hell. What a pain.
---
A giant Todd head in the sky eats it
---
Bingo! And while most of us who haven't played in a bit will hit the wall quickly due to level, it will tide us over for a few weeks.
---
I haven't altered any files and I've tried both repair and uninstalling the game completely and reinstalling... Also submitted a ticket and they asked me to unplug my gamepads/controllers (???) which I don't have any of. 
---

Yeah okay, but increments of 2 weeks for content that will take probably 5 hours to finish is terrible. Even on their website, on average people play 4 hours a day. This content will be dry after a day and a half? And isn't their ultimate goal here intended to bring back a bunch of people? People won't join just so they can build new stuff in their camp. 
---
Eh... it could be "fixed" before this patch by manually doing it.  And even at 5 charges the damage was crap.  Plus it gave +49 rads for firing fully charged (apparently legendary versions did not give rads).
---
I'm not sure if this is a "bug" or just people realizing the weapon is a joke even when working :)

The most expensive I’ve seen are the traveling leather coat (hooded), leather coat, and tattered field jacket. Seen each sell at 20k caps a few times.
---
Yea. I can understand why you don't wanna be in power armor then. I just can't get on the pvp train with fallout. Didn't buy it with pvp in mind. 
---
You're the best. 
---
What's a "legit mule"?
---
Asking because... well... I have no idea.
---
No idea, I'm looking for the same info.  
---
Which machine?
---
that's understandable, I haven't yet considered the whole chain of command thing. Thanks. 
---
I am having the exact problem too. Plus i believe you were on my friends list. 2nd time facing this exact problem
---
Salt is a way of life down here
---
“Legit muling” Lmfao
---
Problem has been resolved. Thank you Bethesda. 
---
Complaining and bitching until you get what you want is how 8 year olds accomplish their goals.  Us adults make compromises and accept that life is not perfect, and neither are video games.  I find this game to be superbly fun and awesome and am excited for whats to come.  You do your thing Bethesda, ill keep paying and playing. 
---
The damage doesn't change when you charge it. Thats what im trying to get fixed. 
---
Legendarys dont give you rads. Thats true. 
---
Probably in an actual apocalypse. 
---
Not in this one where combat armor is lying everywhere. 
---
I didn't know the order was fixed.  But I do know that I had a dry spell where I didn't learn any plans for a few events before I finally got the fusion generator, so whether or not anything drops at all is random.
---
What about customized graphics settings? Are PC players going to be forced to play the game with defaults?
---
Hey, that's pretty cool. If it was just a bug, I'm fine with it. I'd rather they fix it and stuff, eventhough I think it'd make sense if you went very low to make more damage.
---
Like this, we can stay at 19% health with Nerd Rage and get our normal damage.
---
Was fixed with a firewall exception. Not sure what they changed on their end. But fix the firewall. 
---
Can do.
---
the said they patched the constant caution problem. so to be tested.
---
Where did she say this? I don't see why they would care if the duplication glitch is gone.. I get it they want to put people in time out but they will always find a way around it.... Also no one got "banned" they were all temporarily suspended
---
Now we just need some cheese to go with it. Lots and lots of cheese.
---
because hoarding I guess, idk
---
I’m asking because I have not played since like week 3 or 4. I was thinking this might be a good time to jump back in. 
---
From what I gathered is the Brahmin from the fertiliser resource can be milked as long as it is not dead, I got 3 from mine and I’ll check back my camp later to see how long it takes between each ‘milk’ action
---
Same.  Maybe mine is glitched.  
---
Have started a new char. He goes by redemption. He awoken in the vault without his memory only.  unknown what has happend or where he is. He ventured out in search of what happend to him. Finding nothing but bodys so far and these holo tapes about an overseer hoping she may have the answers to who he is
---
Bear skull gauntlet... yes and now please 
---
ttyyyy -had this problem too-
---
No. I don't feel that. Seriously, I'm not saying that as some automatic take the opposite stance. 
---
I'm not disappointed. 
---
I don't know, I'm not digging through a week's worth of a community manager's comments.
---
You got everything else ?
---
Like the Fireman and Responder Fireman stuff ?
---
TY 🙌🙌
---
ya thats about it
---
Not at all. Bethesda is not unaware that PC players fix their gtx settings this way. 
---
Well, keeping in mind that they gave an inexperienced team the task of converting the entire engine to multiplayer.  A task that I'm sure was nothing short of your worst nightmare.
---
YES, nice plan of Content coming to us for sure. :)
---
I know!
---
Yeah I suppose I was pretty accusational in my post, but I guess i, which was my fault, overhyped it for myself. 
---
I want my character yes I spent 5-6  hours customizing him to look like me I would like to keep all my atom shop purchases but you could delete his entire inventory as well as my alts if need be it would suck I have 600 hours in but if I could at least keep his face and 213 levels that I earned I'd be happy 
---
Winner for 2 caps add shoe0320 I’ll be on later this evening put Psycho in your friend request 
---
1400 every day.  So you have at least that many.
---
Don’t worry it’s anthems month we’re ok this month 
---
Plus remember for all these things even if its robots, they have to hire voice actors, create scripts, brainstorm, create and scrap designs, then implement it all. Ik its an annoying wait but yea
---
I'm a chef in real life and that would be a dream come true! 
---
I could really see most of these ideas happening in the years to come :)
---
Wow you must be a blast at parties. 
---
Did you have to do anything? Or it fix by itself. Did the exception for the firewall. But didnt fix the problem
---
it's a missing texture, try repairing your game files.
---
That analogy would only work if I showed up with no weapon he has a m2 and the guards say nothing
---
Right next to the brewing crafting thing theres a note pinned to the side of the table with an instant fermenter (looks like a smallish metal barrel) below it
---
u/srsly_dang 
---
Not too shabby. 
---
I did it. But I had to make an exception in a couple different places. If you're still having problems, make a ticket and run a diagnostic report. That helped me  
---
Someone really should pin the solution at the top of the board, this is getting ridiculous lol
---
There are a bunch of people posting about this issue, just fyi
---
I've tried server hopping for weights and rarely find them. They're not instanced so once someone gets them, they're gone. Ore is instanced so you will always find it first try. 
---
For me it's a whole lot faster to collect ore. I always have plenty of acid since I pick it up as I'm traveling around.
---
I would be so happy if any of these things happened to me. Aside from what I took to be your first example where you destroy some random camp just so you get a bounty. If you just meant that as part of the other encounters you described I'm fully in.
---
Wait, there are people who don't use mules to hang onto items worth more than a vendor is paying? 
---
I bought the blue one off someone early on. But, no I don’t have all the different variants of it. Not really a fan of how it looks though.
---
Mules are for bitches who can't even play the game!  Tired of you people not just playing!  You ruin this game for everybody!
---
I want my character yes I spent 5-6 hours customizing him to look like me I would like to keep all my atom shop purchases but you could delete his entire inventory as well as my alts if need be it would suck I have 600 hours in but if I could at least keep his face and 213 levels that I earned I'd be happy.
---
No biggie.   I have a few friends that are underwhelmed as well.  I'm sure this decision was made to minimize new bugs and increase player engagement overall.  
---
I literally got on just to check out the new camp stuff and the brewing and distilling. Lol. Love my camp. Feel like it's an extension of my actual home. 
---
Multiple falling through the world bugs near Top of the World (the first of which cost me 270 lbs of bundled junk, which spawned underneath the world so I couldn't retrieve it). Bethesda truly is such a fantastic game developer, rolling out patches without a play test server. Bravo! 
---
Lots of good additions and bugfixes today and over coming months.  Servers are up hop on in!
---
Did they add mods? Because I can’t seem to get any plans
---
Seems they are on the PC, so it could be mod/ini related issues.  Last patch made a lot of things show up wrong for pc users with mods.  This patch made the users fall thru the map if they had mods.
---
Can confirm this is a random encounter. Vendor was not at this location today. 
---
Who's gonna be the first to milk a yao-guai?
---
What are your resistances?
---
I have to check that out :D 
---
I said something similar to this a few months ago. I hope it becomes a thing. 🤷‍♂️
---
No it does happen it's also annoying that if I reload the weapon,  search to a different gun then switch back ....I have to reload it again.
---
Ah, ok

Many have mules because their lives are trash as fuck, so they have two Xboxes to make FAKE money in a fucking video game!  It's sad, really!  Like.... Really really REALLY sad!!
---
\* What platform you're playing on
---
Non that I read. Only damage increase. I think 10 percent 
---
If you played Black Flag, it's that but in ancient greece. Naval combat plays a huge role and the setting is fantastic.
---
A new quest with some new quest locations, completing which unlocks a two new crafting tables and several recipes for alcoholic beverages. Also unlocks a new series of daily quests, which unlock new recipes everyday. Also, possibly new but unconfimed: a new event called Irrational Fear. I saw the event happening and don't remember ever seeing it before, but I don't know for sure if it was added today.
---
The quest is good. It's short but has some fun treasure type parts. The dialogue lines added for the new quest givers are A+ writing, though, humour-wise.
---
Surprise surprise another stealth Nerf. This time in end game content
---
Yeah, I've been working F&amp;B for 32 years. My ESO character (the Fat Friar) is solely a food and drink crafter... I'd love the option to set up a roadside wasteland street-food vendor in this game.
---
A nice stew made with strange meat, perhaps? Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies, Now eat up!
---
I'm just thrilled that, apparently, now my turrets will actually shoot stuff!
---
My character was old enough to learn how to shoot a crossbow (which I learned at 12) so that makes him 36-40. He was an accomplished hunter, a skill taught by his Grandfather who did not get accepted into the vault. He studied horticulture in the vault but had to adapt to the bizarre plants of the wasteland. He now resides at the top of the Seneca Rocks and continues to work on his plants hoping to crossbreed them to remove radiation from the fruits and veggies.... it is not going well.
---
Can't wait for everyone to report you over and over Haha
---
I was really hoping the grounded mutation would have been fixed this patch to be affected by the class freak perk.  Is this bug on the dev teams radar?
---
Yeah, and honestly that's the players' own fault. Beth has made a bunch of mis-steps but mods breakign after updates are a whole lotta not their problem.
---
Revert to the original ini.. beth have tweeted/communicated about this
---
They tried to make people stay within +1500 of their carry limits.  People did not.  So now they took steps further to force it.  They don't want your mules at more than +1500 either.
---
Possibly mod conflicts.
---
Your mods/custom ini are causing it. 
---
Disable or update your addons, the ini file you needed to use addons is causing the issue.
---
Idc if I lose, shit happens but I care about how broken the current state of loot is due to duping
---
You're caught in a temporal causality loop.
---
What is this pepsquick you mention ? 
---
I wish. Not yet
---
Scroll the sub, has been asked 100 times in the last hour. You have to uninstall mods and update your ini file
---
Is it under the tattoo parlor, or in one of the frat houses?
---
Found it.  
---
I got one yesterday too
---
I'm always down to craft arms for mats+tip on xbox. I need one more level in armorer to make dense chests
---
Oh, thank you so much!
---
Now we need a 1 in 100 chance to contract lactose intolerance. 
---
I am on Xbox... and if that was you, thanks!  If it wasn't you... thanks anyway for giving the new players a reason to log back in.  I realize that last weekend may very well have been a fluke, but I'm hoping on average there are nicer folks than not in the community.  I'm sure I'll lose it the first time someone levels my CAMP for lolz, but if it's something I don't have to regularly deal with, I'll stick around.
---
I'm a bit upset by this change, as I had a single vendor Character before the weight limits we imposed.
---
After the patch that added the weight limit, I created 4 new characters; (Weapons, Armor, Plans/Magazines, and Aid), Each of them is at or near their max limit (1650 +/-), The original Character is still slightly over 10,000, with mostly Junk, ammo, &amp; Aid, that I Gathered, Crafted, or Traded for legitimately in the game.
---
I have played over 600 hours, and never been involved in Duping, or any real exploit for that matter, and tried to avoid trading with known dupers, I do not have any excessive amount of any one thing other than more than 10,000 Diluted Stimpaks, that were crafted from Farmed Water &amp; Stimpaks using normal game mechanics (that mostly still exist today) to increase production.
---
This Change has me a bit peeved, as I've lost many things to game glitches and took it in stride, but this was a poorly calculated move on Bethesda's part that will affect a great number of honest, avid players in a very negative way.
---
I'd drop some serious atom points on a Lustron home style. 
---
You need to go back to Biv. He'll give you one daily quest every day that will unlock a new recipe. I dunno if the recipes are randomly given, though, in which case, you may not be able to complete today's daily.
---
Jesus Christ the entitlement of this post...
---
Well from your description it was obvious that Adrenal Reaction was not working as Bethesda intended. You described a 111% increase in damage on your black powder rifle when dropping from 19% to 5 % hp. This SHOULD have netted you only a 10% increase (from 40% to 50%).
---
Took me a hot second to realize the icon was pointing at the note.
---
New quest from Rose.
---
Ooh like the Teletubbies sun baby?
---
Are the bumps to energy weapons significant enough to finally get to making a character built around it? 
---
Where do you start the quest?
---
Was hoping for a 'fix' or 'change' where progress in the 'Belly of the Beast' quest was saved.  Tried it a few times and have been interrupted (hey, life gets in the way!), and have had to start again.
---
And a side of your finest jelly beans, raw.

---
Why no melee nerf? Why a Tse nerf when Melee can do over 3k and even 6 k that I've seen? Plz nerf melee especially with ignore 75 percent armour card already too strong as it is. 
---
His guy reads.
---
&gt;mode of failure
---
What? You mean mods not being compatible with the game? That’s not Bethesda’s fault. If anything, that’s both the mod creator and mod user’s problem. 
---
I don't think it's a possible challenge today. Can't get recipes until the day after you finish the quest, and it's not even guaranteed that you'll get THAT recipe or that you'll even GET a recipe...
---
Although someone spotted a new random encounters vendor that sells Hard Lemonade Recipes, so maybe a vendor somewhere has some recipes?
---
If you would’ve said something about making new characters for survival mode then I would’ve somewhat agreed with you, but instead you propose the single worst thing for this game. Just stop bro, your idea is trash and it will never happen because everyone besides you knows it’s trash. Get gud or go home with your ball.
---
You see, somebody could pick them up already!
---
No idea.
---
cool, just trying to help.
---
Yeah, well no duh you did not do any damage. You did not actually use a critical hit like you claimed.
---
You keep reaching for that point, because you are still not making it. It is a game that has clearly stated it has no mod support for now. If they say that and people then end up with problems when they mod anyway, well, then exactly zero of the problems belongs to Bethesda. 
---
I myself mod the game, but I check the archive file compability after a big update, and thus have no problem. Just check the files you change and there is no problem. On either side. You mod it. You check it. It works.

---
Purple syrup storage
---
There's always posts looking for friends to team up with on the r/fo76FilthyCasuals reddit as well! :) 
---
You can't do the new daily to unlock recipes more than once a day, and there are around 10 or so new recipes, so you'll not finish the new content before the next one drops.
---
I do wish you could tell a true new player apart from somebody's alt or mule.  I usually dump my extras with low level players, but would seek out the truly new if I could.
---
If its just as broken as ever.
---
I called it.
---
Just want dibs on that one. Otherwise here's hoping for the best.
---
Oh I didnt even know about that! Thanks for the help!
---
It takes like 20 minutes to log in to your main, trade some items to a friend, log into your mule and accept the items from said friend, and that's with multiple mules on my part.
---
It's essentially inventory management on a larger scale. Nothing too laborious about it, but to each their own. My stash box on my main is full of items for crafting so I can play without having to grind everytime I find someone that needs an item made or mods put on their gear. It's a quality of life thing that allows me to fulfill my desired playstyle.
---
Muling is obviously not some sort of taboo game mechanic, so I am not sure why you are attempting to stigmatize it.

---
After more research found this thread, I didn't know that there are also configs in Documents\My Games\Fallout76 as well. I deleted the Fallout76Custom.ini file from there (I never made one so I'm not sure where that one came from) and now everything is working.
---
No worries! I appreciate it :)
---
Update: Sometimes when I choose a respawn location it actually spawns me someplace completely different. Example I asked for Vault 76 and appeared in Cliffwatch. I chose Bolton Greens and appeared in Twin Pines Cabins. Not consistent but 4 out of ~10 respawns so far. 
---
Still falling through map. Even tried rebooting my computer and checking for driver updates and whatnot. 
---
Indeed, but I can eat more I guess. The real highlight of the patch is that radium suppressor fix! 
---
Played around with gatling laser/minigun/gatling plasma.
---
Charged barrels are not great, otherwise mows just about anything not level 80.
---
Minigun is fun with explosive, but the weakest of the three also chews ammo in the thousands.
---
Gatling plasma is a better gatling laser for the most part.
---
Whever i get my hands to cryolator will have to check if it is any better. 
---
No problem! :)
---
Who needs that much stuff?! The limits are reasonable for most people. It's only the excessive hoarders, and maaaybe traders who will be affected (besides the people the limit is aimed at like dupers).
---
After all, the limits are there mostly to preserve server stability. The people who are hoarding massive amounts of shit on their mules are hurting everyone else's experience. 
---
Video games aren't like that now though. It's about the drip feed.
---
That wasn't specifically mentioned in the patch notes, so for all we know, automatics could still be absolute shite, until someone does some testing with them, or we hear a formal response from BGS
---
Wow, so get downvoted for asking if anyone else has this bug or making people aware of it. I know I have done the Tourism quest but it says I have not completed it. I know I have done many different events and daily too... but they are not registering and this is preventing me to unlocking other quests 
---
I loved sailing around having the crew singing :) 
---
No problem, chuck a Nuka Cola Machine, an Ice Machine, maybe a cooking stove or two and a TV behind the bar. Forgot to mention these, but they really help complete the look.
---
STOP USING MODS THEN. If you haven’t figured out already, this has been the 100th time (over estimate maybe) that this type of post about the “falling through the map on pc glitch” has been made. 
---
Haha I knew you would be excited as I was about the the radium silencer fix.

There's a new poster that you can unlock from the atom shop or find on the walls of train stations. Read that and it'll set you on your way.  Most of the quest takes place in and around Morgantown, with a detour to the nuka cola plant.
---
Oh im not a dick like that lol the walls are concrete but the front is a normal metal siding with a door. 
---
Yes!  I did too at first launch.  It got attacked by mirelurks though, and when I reloaded it didn't respawn.
---
shut you're where mouth. I love my spawns in camp. just gotta find better mob spawns
---
They just gotta make all Energy weapons work with Armor Piercing Perks. If your using a two-shot laser rifle with the beam splitter mod, it should break in 20 minutes. 
---
I'm not... I just don't get it... which is why I asked the question.
---
Maybe the internet has conditioned you to see salt where there is none... 
---
See that wouldn't solve the issue as legit players would then be forced to play PvP centric servers, the best solution I've seen on here is let them keep thier gear but open a new wave of adventure servers you can transfer too and keep levels but no gear so legit players can play legit without PvP focus and those that want to keep thier guns can. 
---
It would divide the player base but it would also let them have a simple solution to new dupe bugs just change all the new servers in with the old ones and open new ones for the players who wish to avoid the dupes.
---
Hook it to my veiiiiinnnnsss!
---
they sing in this one too. Some very catchy greek songs
---
I was about to go do that myself. Hopefully it is just a bug and not a new feature
---
"We don't have a cow, we have a bull..."
---
Will do I’ll make sure to check it out once I get past this update failed to install error 😂
---
I used a stealth crit.
---
Fallout 4 ..
---
You got a marsupial left for me good man? 
---
Irrational fear is not new
---
i'm not sure anyone can be as pleased as i am with it! 
---
Is that what the daisycutter is for?! I've just been admiring it in my stash....
---
Yeah, that's sweet.
---
I don't think they have the capacity to tell if foundations were force placed using a campfire so I expect that existing builds will be fine. I tend to rebuild from scratch every 30 levels or so and I just hope my next camp doesn't have to be a huge compromise in placement. Although the grass clipping thing will open up a lot of options for me. I'm actually curious to see if the huge tree that I have my power lines attached to is going to evaporate when I log in because it currently clips into my roof and I have a section of my upstairs blocked out to hide it.
---
Which places?
---
Same i literally jsut made a thread about this. I got a doe in my house. 
---
What kind of playstyle you into? Role playing? Grinding? 
---
Nah its just something else you can do when you finish the quest, i just couldnt remember the quest name. The daisycutter is literally just a 1 star fat man
---
Me neither bought it because im here since fallout 1( 1+2 are actually my favorites) but i stayed for the griefing
---
Exactly same experience at a quick lunch run after the patch 
---
I have a base with a junk extractor, so combined with the cows, I have infinite grenades
---
You can also milk Chally the Moo-Moo, Grahm's brahmin. 
---
Scanned thru, great. Lots of fixes and what not. Why is it still so god damn buggy to start a party? The only way I’ve been successful is through the main screen. Never been able to trade with nobody... 
---
I actually go to the bunker more than the resort so this is great news 
---
I'll help if I'm able to get online. Sounds like fun - squintmanatee42
---
I would like the tree that hangs into my garage to disappear. Everything else around it was bulldozed just fine.
---
Noticed that as well on PC, it's really annoying as I saw some cool 3* weapons I would potentially have bought but wasn't going to drop a ton of caps on a weapon with crap. This needs a hotfix.
---
What I came to realize is that I have yet to not enjoy a bethesda game. All the controversy at the start was alarming but me out of all people should realize sometimes people/companies do some stupid shit. Then I saw the inside the vault detailing all the goodies were getting this year and I bought it. It's a decent game, and has the potential to be so much better. Like GTA online for example, the start of it there was nothing, but over the years they turned it into a gem (even if it was for a short while before they ruined it pretty much)
---
Stop complaining about complaining about PVP!
---
5 is the limit :(
---
Thanks. 
---
You can also have multiple accounts, I run 2 Xboxes, and currently have 7 characters (2/5), but have 4 other Xbox accounts I could also use, or create even more, since as far as i can tell MS only limits you to your available Bandwidth for running multiple accounts, and a Gold Account is good for everyone as long as it originates from the same IP Address.
---
Most Dupers (On Xbox) were back to playing (and Duping) with new accounts the day after being banned, I have met some that asked me to help them power level new characters in exchange for duplicating items for me, I refused.
---
Ah yes. Let’s just help the duper’s by telling them how to bypass something. Great job, OP. Really helping the community by fucking it over with this. 
---
**Passive Perks:** Let us have some perks work all the time, like lock picking, hacking or general crafting things....It would just simply eliminate the hassle of perk swapping to open a box or a door, or fixing my armour....stuff that doesn't really affect gameplay at all and is more of an annoyance. 
---
**Add some CAMP building components:**  Give use  half vertical walls, quarter floors and half floors. Add some different texture roof options to the Brick, metal and barn building sets. Give use some interior walls as well. and maybe trusses for peaked roofs, to let us put lights on them.
---
**Dismantle Legendaries**: Let us dismantle legendaries, for a chance at getting the mod from it to put on another weapon....I've come across some epic 3 star Legendary gear, but it's all dropped at level 15 from the Horde events....would be nice to scrap to get maybe one of the perks from it...
---
**Sellable Plans:** Let us resell known plans. Although, this might be come possible when we get the player vendor DLC.
---
**Scrap Ammo:** Can we scrap ammo, or let us turn it into ammo we actually use? the amount of .38 I find is astounding but I've no use for it, as I use .45, 5.56 and .50. Maybe you need X amount of .38 to convert it to X amount of 5.56 ammo or something.
---
You're being passive aggress, and rather transparently so. A rhetorical question followed by a dismissal is a full serving of salt.
---
Anyway, if that was a real question (see: it wasn't; you're just a piss poor troll) then it's been answered and you have one less hole in your life to fill with shit posting contrarian opinions.
---
+ Karma
---
I see. I had never seen it before and someone else also reported seeing it for the first time. It could be that the rate at which Irrational Fear triggers has been upped, or resetting the servers caused it  to trigger on many servers together.
---
Any chance you can message me this I’m tired of buying overpriced weapons and I have brotherhood troops who need weapons 
---
Aye, as a pve player I would dearly love to know if this would let us eventually banish the raider/griefers to their own mad max style hell scape...
---
why zealot ont he grognak's axe i wonder?
---
+30% damage to Scorched... does that mean the SBQ also? is that why you say its popular?
---
It’s broken. I hope they know. 
---
Very nice. From here on i promise you : **it ***will*** go downhill**
---
I haven't had a chance to read the patch notes in full, but if you had lights and turrets, your budget may not have increased technically as those things had their budget costs lowered and would have thus freed up space in your budget. 
---
Lights are near 1% each iirc. I used to have 20 plus lights set up. Had to drop em, as it wasn't budget friendly 
---
This. There is literally no reason to use energy weapons - still. The patch put a band aid on a gaping chest wound.
---
It was sweet! I also want that Nuka-Cola lamp in the frat house!
---
No ones upset. I'm more concerned of getting reported due to ppl being upset they cant kill me. Which has happened many many times. But hey according to you I've duped and have cheated. You're the perfect example  of someone who would be reporting someone just cause.
---
Any chance you can tell me this  I missed out 
---
Thanks for the angry response. Made me realize Reddit was showing the Top posts and not the most recent. For the record I did scroll the sub before posting but apparently this issue is not a “Top Post”. 
---
I will see if I am using mods
---
I found him right by Charleston Station
---
i thought it may have been a server issue or something. i had the same problem on a few dropped legendaries since the patch. the boxes are there, theyre just blank
---
I suppose that's fair.
---
I just see it like everything else in life. If X doesn't have enough space (Hard drive/Storage/anything) you just buy another one.
---
The Devs set a limit on a per character basis. If they were concerned about mules, they'd say something like "1 game copy per person". But that's stupid because they like money.
---
Folks who abuse max storage and not moving on their mules got their just deserts, but I don't understand why you think it's cheating.
---
Did a wes tec run and there was 1 legendary. 
---
No talking shit?  Downvote for sure lol 
---
Am I the only one who would kinda like this to happen?  My brahmin is very lonely...
---
Can you pm me this method I missed out 
---
Doesn't killing it dismiss it? 
---
Hopefully. I suck at searching reddit but I browsed a little bit of the newest posts to see if anyone had mentioned this before I made a post and I didn't see any.
---
No idea what it is
---
Can you message me this I missed it 
---
no its like a very weak radaway
---
Adrenal Reaction was only ever a max 50% bonus to damage. If you were getting more than that it was probably because of a thirst/hunger glitch that added a weird multiplier effect. I think they patched the glitch and now you are getting your 150 damage bonus witch sounds like a reasonable 50% boost for a nice rifle.
---
May be different on xbox but I've only failed killing the queen once out of the last 20 or so times. The problem I've always seen is people not putting out enough damage. One group I've done the queen with many times regularly has 12+ people and we often finish her in less than 10 minutes. Weapons on build make a huge difference but it's always been easier for me with larger groups. I think the issue you all most likely encountered was pulling her outside of her leash zone. I've never had the damage bug issue fighting her at Drop Site 9 with the nuke zone just south of it. 
---
Can you message me this method please 
---
Why can't I find info on the survival mode in the patch notes? 
---
Ever heard of Anthem or the Division?
---
There's no way they'd give us a challenge we cant complete, right? 
---
I said sweet because I was glad something was going to be done about it 
---
How much? I'll buy it
---
Mule characters need to be banned 
---
Ahh that sucks thx for your time 
---
PC? Xbox? Nintendo? If it's PC could be mods.
---
Hacking really speeds up launching nukes as you can disable turrets and turn on the decontamination hallway
---
I'm in silo Charlie with the same problem: [https://i.imgur.com/O63F03L.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/O63F03L.jpg)
---
system is telling me i need to wait for 274 hours and 24min before i can launch again.
---
just a little bit too long in my opinion... xD
---
With multiple content drops in March it's to be assumed they would spread them out a bit.
---
Yeah, that’s not the problem.  Also, they stated: “Silos are ready to launch.”
---
Yay, its March and they are fixing the bugs finally. I'm totally going to play this game now!!!
---
It's happened before...
---
Nope, you just go into the negatives. I believe you get some restrictions on spending etc until you get back into positive caps
---
As a sneak/sniper build I love the instigating rifles with a silencer, doing double damage on first hit with additional 3.5x damage tacked on. I can one shot almost anything with a homemade. Now, if I could just get an instating EM rifle with a silencer...
---
Gun Smith does effect laser guns though.
---
Thank you for this pasta
---
Ok so you admit your idea of wiping everyone progress is complete trash, that’s good. 
---
Your train of thought is so mixed up I can’t even follow your argument so please state it clearly. 
---
No one would be forced to play PvP servers, but if you wanted to you could start a new character. 
---
I for one am against this idea because I worked too hard for my gear to have some cry baby like you demand a restart when the options of trading and grinding harder for gear is right in front of you. 
---
How bout you delete your character and the problems solved!
---
I hope it’s fixed quickly. I don’t want to waste caps on crap 
---
The joke is that after the first patch when the patch notes sucked people complained about "stealth nerfs" that Bethesda never told anyone about. Idiots read it as "nerfs to stealth " and started thread after thread crying about how they felt like stealth was broken and screaming at Bethesda about it. 
---
Oof, reminds me of that one shack in 4 you can run into on the way to Diamond City, the one with all the radios and the dirt mound that turns into a rad scorpion jump scare when you get close enough 
---
&gt; They aren't going to put every one in the camp menu. It's just impractical.
---
I think you have a wrong idea of how decoration should work. The proper method would be to show **your** items and let you mark them as decoration, not all possible items. 
---
Time to take a long break, I guess lol. Sucks, tbh.
---
I tried a nuka grenade and 50 shots, no damage. need a player to kill it but who wants a bounty.
---
WHAT?? I CAN'T HERE YOU, THERE IS THIS WILD PARTY DOWN AT VTU I HEARD THEY GOT THIS JUICE THAT MAKES YOU SEE PURPLE 
---
I did a whitespring run and found a 3star legendary that dropped a 3star left leg.
---
Don't lie OP, that coffee cup is a legend in its own rught
---
At least having 4 means I can finally play Zaireeka correctly
---
Xbox
---
I have been kicked in under an hour 5 times since the update, just stopped playing after that.
---
Only scaly skin and grounded.
---
You guys REALLY need to change the way updates work. I just had to delete two games because of the damn 18GB update size even though it won't actually need that much more space and I had like 11 open.
---
I'm up to 150 now on my second character while my first is only level 50 something.  I don't feel like my higher level is significantly more powerful, just more versatile.  He's got perks for melee or shotgun, can go ironclad or fireproof.  But the impracticality of switching perks in a firefight makes that largely irrelevant.  I guess higher level might have better gear, but many of those level 40s are someone's alt and might have better gear than I do.  
---
You never know what the levels mean is how I play it, at least for anyone close to lvl 50
---
My radios don’t seem to be playing any music. 
---
Other games I play, mules are seen as cheating. Not sure why this doesn’t apply to fallout. The stash limit is part of the game and to keep the playing field fair everyone “should” adhere to that. People with multiple PlayStations/characters/stashes have an obvious advantage over stash limit following gamers. 
---
This is my biggest concern. The way the community throws the word griefer around I know there is going to be abuse of this system.
---
maybe you can get someone with the same problem and "pvp" eachother them run and kill eachothers pets
---
I think you should have to painstakingly choose which items to destroy for hours and hours. It could be as simple as dumping the first items you see, or it could be as fun as trawling through pages and pages of menus for similar sounding items that look like they COULD MAYBE be really interesting in the right circumstances if I find the right buyer....
---
Some people are saying relogging fixes it. Have you tried that?
---
I get that, just thought they might come out the gates a bit stronger. Especially with more build space for people, what better time to get their money. 
---
I am also disappointed and agree with you. The amount of bug fixes was great but a lot were things they broke themselves and patching from their own mistakes.
---
The main problem is where you set your expectations not with the company and devs. When a company feeds you nothing but garbage and broken nonsense for months on end you can't expect them to overdeliver. You can't really expect them to consistently normally deliver. Had you set your expectations at the lowest possible level like I had you will find the new update came close to meeting my exceedingly low expectations. The road map for the next YEAR has about as much content coming as I could PERSONALLY create in half the time. Thank CHRIST The Division 2 finally came out. 76 serves much better as backup game when you're bored of your main than the other way around. 
---
This is all coming from someone with over 700 hours logged who has some interest in the new content, but have dropped from about 50 hours per week to about 10.
---
Its fun.  I have a guild on PC (sorry we dont recruit on reddit) we pvp and pve roleplay. The pvp feeds into the pvp stuff.
---
We run them into a questline we built too. (If enough members are online)
---
So we have a castle with a king. And run pve focused quests with rewards and stuff. Alot of comedy and improv but there is interraction with us, the NPCs. Something this game lacks. 
---
We give choice, drama , and an element of danger! As well as humor. We manipulate the workshop, team, wanted and bounty system to allow the npc players to turn red for someone doing our quests. Allowing that person to DECIDE to attack or not. 
---
Heres an example. 
---
We do the greaser bit. And you play along. And give us 10 rubber so we bounce or 11 gears so we turn out. Or some adhesive so we dont STICK around. ( lots of puns lol)
---
Then we call you a square and mention you would fit right in at the kingdom (my castle camp).tell u where it is. 
---
If you go there we play some royal fanfare over the mic and change into our kingly outfits. We send you on the first quest. 
---
Claim the nearby workshop for our kingdom. 
---
U do it. And come back
---
We only sent u there so we can tag it while teamed with an npc on a later quest. Allowing you to CHOOSE to attack us. 
---
Ok. Next u meet the king cause you proved your strength by taking the workshop for our kingdom. 
---
He says some greasers are in the outskirts of town. They are misled youths. They miss their dads. They aren't so bad but we suspect they have been stealing junk from the kingdom. Go investigate!. We tell u where their hideout is. 
---
We change outfits and get to the hidout first. Or other  guildies play the greasers. 
---
You meet the greasers and their plan is yo fix up their bikes and head east. They need gears. Special gears from the kingdom. 
---
Now u own the workshop so the king stays back. When your questioning the youths if things get agressive the king tags the workshop! The greasers are now red!. 
---
What do you do? The king said they are just misled youths. The greasers are trying to get you to steal from the king for them. Join the greaser gang? Stay loyal to the king? Kill the greasers?
---
Thats just a taste.
---
The changes to pacifist will force us to do our pve roleplay on survival mode tho... *gulp*
---
I for one am a bit sad they are changing pacifist. Players LOVE doing these quests. Big laughs, compliments, "i totally misjudged you guys" . "this is the most fun ive ever had in a game" "this is more RP than ive seen anywhere" glowing reviews. 
---
Its all coming to an end tho. With no pvp there is no drama for quest givers. I cant be a "bossfight" anymore.
---
End of an era!
---
For the griefing? Lol. I'm not sure I'll ever understand the appeal. Can't wait till they make my house pacifist with me so I don't have to log out when somebody decides to start hacking away at my camp. 
---
Just wandering and having fun. Not really into roleplaying.
---
Right now I'm just exploring doing random quests if I feel like it.
---
Yes !! :)
---
Likely a combo of bloodied gun, unyielding armor, playing serendipity and or nerd rage.
---
You can add me in 76 under the name TheSilenceFalls. I'll try to get on tonight, and get you discord info and we can talk about what you would want to do and stuff. 
---
Shouldn't have to do that. Shouldn't have to be solo, walking from Vault 76 to Overseer and have some punk knife me over an over. Shouldn't have to keep using Stims and go away. I wasn't in a group in PvP and wasn't near or had claimed a Workshop. It's the only part of the game I don't care about really. If I'm in a Workshop, that is different or if I log into Survival later, that's different.
---
Man, that's nice :D
---
Can confirm.  Found on dead scientist body near Overseer camp (random encounter location)
---
So thats the green stuff hes always talking about
---
I made a post on it about 15-20 minutes after the servers went up. I'm on PC (unmodded for those who care, if that matters) and it appears the whole inspect mechanic is slightly broken. Items esp. 2/3\* legendaries can't be inspected at all at vendors (making sales risky) and when viewing items between stash/storage/containers or just within your pipboy the stats are either missing or just plain wrong. Also items appear not to be rotating correctly within 3d space (their center seems off). 
---
In addition it appears (tho I haven't tried it yet) that P2P trading seems to be slightly broken and items can't be inpected in the trading menu either. But again, I have not personally seen that.
---
I guess it will be a reward for the new daily quests
---
Looks like foundation stacking cannot be done anymore. Another thing is looks like campfire's no longer classify as dirt. 
---
I hope Bethesda learns from this and adds more "unbreakable structures". Like an entire bunker/igloo looking building where only the front-door can be broken. Something more balanced. I want someone to raid my base and have to clear room by room, not just destroy the entire thing. 
---
Ithink its safe to say that this opinion is flawed based on every one of your comments being burried in downvotes . A full character wipe would be detrimental to servers and 76 would lose about half its player base. 
---
Looks like they are still trying to fix the game. I would wait.
---
Has this been in game for awhile? Never knew that
---
I would be glad to purchase one of those. Gt EggLoPan
---
Its Adrenal they "Fixxed" it.
---
Absolutely. I genuinely thought that we'd get plans for it after finishing the quest. But it'll possibly come to the Atom shop later.
---
I know this is old, but wanted to put this here in case anyone searches on this topic. 
---
I don't think Marsupial is good for this because the second to the last obstacle that requires you to jump over logs requires you to hit the ground in between each. If not, even if you get to the end before time is up, it will fail you. That's what happened to me anyway.
---
I struggled with this quest and just completed it at level 34. I do have Marsupial, but I ended up taking full strength Rad-X to suppress it and the course felt better without it. The extra air time wastes time. Although I do think it wasn't suppressed on my completed run because I ran out of Rad-X. I had to control the jump so I didn’t miss a log. Better to not have to worry about jumping too high in the first place.
---
I found first person to work best. Though I wish they'd make the centering dot bigger and brighter or a contrasting color to the background. I really can't see it well. Aim the dot over the wire and logs to stay straight on them.
---
Stoop down then sprint through the toxic sludge pit. Sprint up and down the A-frame. You don't have to jump at all. Sprint across the tires, but I had to jump up on them first. Sprint between each obstacle as it shaves off precious seconds. If you run past a button, if you're not too far past it, you can turn your view towards it without moving your feet and still pickup the button prompt.
---
For the weapons test, I did use Marsupial. After exiting the terminal, I quickly jumped on top of the roof and shot from there. There's a clear view of all targets. Also, I used my explosive combat rifle (the explosive effects were pretty cool). Lol. It loads 20 bullets at a time.
---
I also used Marsupial and my explosive weapon for the live fire exercise. I just jumped on top of the roof and shot everything from there. Almost shot one of the friendly robots as my VATS picked him up when I was targeting the boss. But I could swear the friendly also helped me take out the boss.
---
They really do need to add more time to the tests. And I think each test should be checkpointed. 
---
After I completed all three initial tests and was headed over to the live fire test, there was a server disconnect. Came back, even the dirty helmet was gone. Had to do the whole thing all over again and hope for no disconnects. Some checkpoints would be nice.
---
It seems to be brand new since the patch
---
Had other problems. Scope sighting not working. Falling thru the ground. Seems an altered ini will cause the game to go beserk on you.
---
Having same issue on ps4
---
Is this out? At the end of the video it stays "play now".
---
It is the single most frustrating mechanic in the game. I wish it would go away. 
---
estimated time remaining:22 hours
---
Ok. I upvoted your post so it becomes more visible.
---
I use a bloodied lever and a stalker's explosive lever for my sneaky vats build. Bloodied explosives are too rare and too expensive, but it isn't hard to find a nice second tier gun for cheap that you like
---
It's not purple, it's magenta, the default color when a mod interferes with a texture load.
---
It probably yields a lot of adhesive
---
Guess Mines not getting bigger. Base of my pyramid was on 6x6. 
---
Not sure if it's just me but, the whole game seems smoother and better looking today. Maybe all the bug fixes. Maybe I'm seeing it through rosey lenses because I'm happy about new content. Who's to say? 
---
It's easy to find as it's marked with the Atom shop logo.
---
You might want to get checked for a stroke too

Radawy (Diluted) - Cures 150 rads, weighs .25, and increases hunger and thirst.
---
Brahnin Milk - Cures 25 rads, wights .03, and reduces hunger and thirst.
---
So even if you consider you must consume 6 milk to get the same effect, it only weights .18 and you would get 18% foot + 48% thirst reduction. The only advantage Radaway would have is the increased disease resistance.
---
was forced to relog 5 times before I just gave up playing, kept dropping me from the server. Maybe it will vanish be later today and I can get my stream back up.
---
I was just about to post this. Removing this couldn’t have been intended. 
---
Is this affecting everyone with a custom ini or just people using mods?
---
This happens to me quite often w/ all humanoid type spawns at my base.  It  is right on the edge of a high cliff and the spawn point is just below.  Usually they will all spawn below, but once in awhile 1-3 will appear inside the base and immediately go for the generator.  I have regular doors for the most part and can get in, but it is a pain.  I have had a Radrat issue getting entangled w/ the foundation and I had to quit server to get rid of it.
---
I was a vault baby wooooo!
---
Knowing Bethesda, it's likely a bug. 
---
A big, stinky, coderoach-looking bug.
---
Wait 1 or 2 minutes, it will launch !
---
Missing on PS4 also. R3 to inspect legendary effects is gone when buying from vendors
---
good idea, I'm on PC if anyone wants to help in an hour or so.
---
I love the new door, wish we could use it at our camp (I've been vague to let others discover it for themselves).
---
Wish there were more things like this for us to build with. 
---
Since patch, I can no longer inspect anything from vendors.
---
I'd say the statement is TRUE, they might have been one shot killed in pacifist mode. Pacifist just means your not going to damage somebody else. I was trying to defend a workshop being contested and was in pacifist mode and FORGOT! Couldn't figure out at first why I wasn't doing any damage and next thing I know I was blown up. Buy hey, the game is working... right? :)
---
I've tried moving it, turning it, so kinds of ways. I still always spawn in the and catch parasites before I can move.
---
I play a VATS sniper in chameleon armor as my alt character. Yesterday I went to AWOL armaments and crouched. Some other player ran over and started shouting in mic "No! Fuck you! Fuck you! No one shot legendary!" and then did slap damage into my back. 
---
Would I report that? Probably not, too much hassle for such a minor encounter, but I'm glad I have the option now. 
---
The one three star I encountered dropped a 3 star cryolator
---
I also had two crashes today. Once while I was walking towards VTU amd not doing anything : sudden crash. I relaunch : the loading screen finishes and the world just appears: crash again. The next time I loaded properly but it messed up my Nukashine quest. Biv wouldn't talk to me and the Nukashine instructions didn't appear in my inventory, although the quest asked me to read it. Another log in later, everything was fixed.
---
I have probably not seen so many issues in my entire time playing the game.
---
I think it has something to do with the latest update to the game... but I dont know.
---
Not the author of comment above, but I also ‘purposefully kill others’ as part of my regular gameplay. 
---
As far as I’m concerned, anyone with a bounty is fair game. 
---
With workshop PVP, I’ll only actively contest anyone above level 50, because levels don’t matter after that point. 40+ if it’s ammo factory or Poseidon. 
---
It’s no fun curb stomping people that don’t stand a chance. 
---
As for bounty hunting, I snipe for bounties, so that’s never gonna be a consideration. You red? You dead. 
---
Eh I've done it both ways I'll take the XP killing everything since it hasn't significant changed my experience. 
---
Every patch has been a disaster. New bugs introduced with every one. I seriously think they don't test anything before release. Was considering checking out Rage 2. But with the bug infested releases of Fallout all Bethesda games are on hold. I cannot justifying spending my hard earned money on such poor work.
---
I had time to do a quick watoga run and a quick whitespring run and while I did get a 2\* legendary in the Watoga EMS building I only found one legendary bot and no legendary ghouls. Certainly not enough data to be conclusive but I am concerned Beth turned down the dial on legendary spawn rates.
---
I had crashes on relogging too today.
---
Its possibly your connection, my sbq fights have been super good. No lag or frames dropping. I'm on xb1
---
So, then "yes, I have been conditioned to see salt where there is none"
---
There is nothing passive aggressive at all. To me, the notion of spending that much time to stash items seems like work, which I phrased in a way to make it seem light hearted.
---
Take care.
---
Running around at low health and doing 1k+ damage base is absurd. 
---
You can still get a sneaky crit headshot for a lot of damage though...
---
Games doing a lot better for me as well, though it could be my excitement for the new content clouding my brain.
---
I am trying to play the new content on the PC
---
Once I login to one of my new characters. It continually falls through the floor and eventually kills me due to fall damage. I do not have power armor on this character. Has anyone else seen this?
---
GT same as reddit name.
---
I prefer if there isn't much difference between higher and lower level characters other than skills and equipment. 
---
I used to play Planetside 2, and granted it is much more in the shooter than rpg camp, but every character has the exact same hit points for example, some equipment offers damage reduction from specific sources and certain things unlock as you level.
---
The player's experience of a high level character and their gear already makes enough of a difference than to have huge stat bonuses too.
---
With the silo issues I wonder if anyone has been able to try 
---
I personally don't see it as fully cheating (I'm not the person who said it felt like cheating as a heads up), I just see it in the same vein as buying bank space in an MMO for real money.  Especially since carry weight is directly tied to a stat and isn't intended to be past a certain value.  At the end of the day I don't hate people who mule or anything like that, I'd just prefer my game to not contain mules in the same way that I'd be unhappy if I could pay $30 for 1500 extra stash space.
---
While I’m sure it’s fun to mindlessly play like a naive 8 year old, don’t talk down to the bitchy 8 year olds because without them our servers would still be crashing every time we pulled up our maps or pip-boys.
---
Now let's work on 3 stars dropping 3 star, etc...
---
Would love it to be my connection but I've run test and it doesn't happen any other time in game 
---
I hate to rain on parades, but....
---
Just had a 3* Mutey not drop a legendary (literally 1 minute ago). I didn't have shadow play (I'm on PC) turned on unfortunately :/
---
Outside West-Tek, and it was the Super Mutant Suicider on the way in. He exploded on me before I killed him, so maybe that was it. Still left a corpse I could loot, but it only had radioactive material and (I think) a Pelvis (ew).
---
Could be isolated because of the suicide-mechanism, I guess.
---
I get that, but my hunting rifle doing 900 damage at 5% health makes sense to me. Now its 5% health and around 450
---
It's just how I picked it up I think, I haven't modified it or anything.
---
I am serious. (And don't call me Shirley? 😁)
---
There has been lots of mention, including by community managers, of pacifist being extended to protect your camp so hopefully won't be a problem for long.
---
That said, I really want to be able to build underground bunkers :) 
---
Making actual verbal threats or derogatory comments over the mic would seem to warrant harassment but other than that?  Hey we’ve all had our camp blown up or ganked or one shotted for no good reason.  Maybe you’ve returned the favor.  I know I have.  I’m usually not the instigator but the game is the game.  Not sure how you can interpret “bullying” in the context of a PVP setting? 
---
Nah, if you gave up two weeks ago please give it three months. Don't come back for the brewing alone. Come back to a fully fledged DLC! 
---
Nerfing damage outputs into the thousands is a fix...
---
Up to 50 matters because of Special points more than perk cards. It’s definitely possible to have a mostly optimal build at level 45 (handmade and gauss max at 45, for example). 
---
45+ is my ‘I’m gonna bag ya’ zone. 
---
When I was young... pretty sure it was roughly 21 years ago. I had too much Tullamore Dew. Too. Much.
---
Can't drink it anymore. At. All.
---
I love whiskey, big fan. But can't touch the dew...
---
I haven't ever gotten instigating or furious on ranged weapons. Every once in a while I will get a good prefix on a melee, but the weapon itself will be trash. There's no reason to keep a legendary baton unless you are roleplaying lol. 
---
The first fraction of it is out. 
---
They're probably just hiding out. Kind of like cocka roaches Eh? ... As soon as the lights come on they hide , once the coast is clear they come back out -  The Patch was the light coming on .. HAHAHAH .. I kid , I kid .. I find it funny That they have not buffed some more places in the game. I am so tired of running the same circles at white springs.  Not only that but Shit is soooo crowded anymore and you've got the Spawn campers now who sit there  till you spawn in and they one shot all  the kills before you can fully load in ..  makes me a sad panda 
---
I fought the queen three times last week and it went fine.
---
Relieved I never refreshed adrenal redaction
---
I was disappointed not to see any beards.  I gotta get my mountain man on, people!
---
I saw plans last nite before the update at Watoga plaza. The BOS vendor had them for sale.
---
My mind IMMEDIATELY went to the Jersey Devil!
---
Yes now this is some good fucking content!! 
---
Props to Bethesda, I know it's so they can make more money rah rah rah but they've obviously listened to the community here. Very original designs that suit Fallout down to a T. 
---
I got legs last night from a treasure map, so I can confirm that is one way to get them. It's not for sale. 
---
Stop complaining about complaining about complaining about PvP!
---
There are perks that block addictions.
---
Those are called sneak attacks. They are different from the actual critical mechanic in the game. A stealth critical implies you performed a sneak attack during an activation of a critical hit.
---
Dang, sorry dude. What system are you on?
---
Stimpacks were drugs in the original fallouts
---
Guess its time to bust out my TSE .50 cal and the 45k rounds of ammo i no lifed crafting that takes up half my carry weight again now that i havent used sense the tse nerf.
---
Great jiggawatts marty!!
---
Nope still an event drop I have one for sale if intrested 
---
Yes, during the first weeks of the game anything you stored at your camp was duplicated each time your camp moved. To get this to happen you needed to 1) create specific storage items in your camp, 2) put things into storage and then 3) move your camp. 
---
Duping was a part of the game. Not intentionally put in the game, obviously, but at no point did you need to go out of your way to dupe.
---
Eventually this was patched to be harder and harder to do, obviously.
---
It's unclear from the wording if this is actually a PSA or a feature request. "you should be able to" doesn't indicate certainty that it's a working solution, and could be interpreted as an indignant demand.
---
I find mine in the Wall Decor section next to the Moth Man poster with the atomic shop logo on it.
---
It's in the wall decorations part of the camp menu.
---
Release a offline single player campaign with proper NPC’s already.
---
Truly,  it is my worst fear. One that keeps me awake at night shivering in a cold sweat with mind pondering the myriad punishments that await me at the hands of our Bethesda overlords.
---
This doesn’t answer my question. I don’t post on this sub to hear little bitches cry about how they don’t like the game. Don’t comment if you’re just gonna be a useless crybaby, ok?
---
Found it, Thank you!
---
And three times as deadly!
---
Also a home brewer, just wish they’d allow us to mix different ingredients (like Skyrim potions) and see what we could create.
---
Addicted to having limbs
---
It’s not you. Something is broken 
---
Good, I thought I was crazy when I was seeing this.
---
Wait, why is this so disliked? Is the ''hate bethesda'' trend still foing on?
---
Hm?
---
Addictol and perks can help 
---
The capitalization is a nice touch,  almost as if you truly laughed aloud in response to reading my post. More people should show such enthusiasm in their online interactions.  
---
You're not very good at gaslighting. 
---
Oh yes
---
No Problem :)
---
Iiiiiiiis that the fallout 3 super sledge?
---
Not lore friendly
---
NEW SKULL GAUNLENT
---
900 base damage at 5% health is still pretty outrageous. That is like 9x the base damage. When you stack on bloodied, sneak multipliers, and crits, it is even more outrageous. There are not a lot of consequences from dying, so even if you die a lot there is still a lot of incentive to just run around one-shotting everything. I'm glad they fixed this before survival dropped honestly.
---
Nukacola factory, whitesprings nuka vendor. Around whitesprings resort. 
---
What locations are you hitting? I've had success taming a variety of animals at the random encounter location in the far northeast (almost due north of Abby's Bunker), as well as the one where the train trestle crosses the road south of Harper's Ferry.
---
It's not in this patch.
---
Arms and legs are overrated.  Just roll everywhere and fire with your teeth.
---
Sounds like it's a feature 
---
The buff we needed but didn’t deserve
---
Is this to scale all the youtubers away?
---
just checked after your comment, it doesnt remove mutations
---
Didn't know that's how to check. Thanks for that.
---
&gt; Lots of dislikes from people that probably haven’t played in a while so go give it some love!
---
From people who never played it
---
“War never changes”
---
/u/ladydevann this is a pretty major issue introduced with this patch. Can you report this to the team and hopefully push for a hotfix?
---
me! you don't see correct names of object and quest
---
I hope it stays that way 
---
radaway diluted fux w ur mutes
---
There are a couple posts below. Bethesda is trying to figure out why
---
Yes!!! I've wanted them for so long. No more bloody jukebox 
---
It's a sheepsquatch
---
Oh Jesus 😡
---
Where is the nuka cola factory?
---
I’m super glad to hear it. 
---
Thanks to the team for all the hard work fixing bugs to date. I’m excited to get home and see how this patch improves my VATS pistol build gameplay!
---
Same problem, buying a legendary from vendor became a gamble suddenly.
---
They are laser and plasma guns ffs... They should be an advanced upgrade to ballistic weapons, instead they’re underwhelming and still pretty useless. 
---
wow Wow WoW WOW
---
Are you claiming that duping wasn't in the game prior to them FIXING that exploit?  Hmm....I seem to recall them even suspending players and such that had too many items from duping exploits.  But then those exploits must have been IN THE GAME.
---
Again, JUST because you can do something in the game, doesn't mean that it was intended or expected.
---
The fact you laugh about it shows you don't get it.  You just want to be abusive to other players without repercussions.  Bet you've got a like-minded friend or two so when you get a big bounty you can just have them kill you and split the caps.  Go ahead and deny it.....
---
Heh, I've had days where there are no legendary at all  RNGesus occasionally flips you the bird. A day or two later, all is good in Appalachia, flick over to Blackwater mine and see if the miners are going, then come back to golf clubhouse, usually ling enough to reset  it.
---
Dude.. you can make ALL the assumptions you want about what I "meant". Doesn't make you right. I have zero fuckin' reason to lie to some random dude on the internet. 
---
if it makes you feel better to tell me what I really mean, then hey, feel good.
---
but you're wrong. So, again... take care. 
---
Wait I will.  I'm really in no rush to play but I am looking forward to when the game is complete.
---
Yeah the few areas added look great and biv's place would make a great hangout.
---
Many people who were banned never got an email stating why, and almost all the tickets relating to it have gone unanswered. It's not surprising people are getting desperate to play the game they bloody paid for.
---
I commented on a guys post and said he'd offer 2k if you can top it it's your rn
---
Don't do this with anything!! well of importance anyway .. I never trust it .. They got me once .. I don't care if they say they fixed it .. They will never get me again .. I always trade. If dropping like ammo or something for a friend ?.. always drop a test bag with 1 ammo in it and then transfer the rest to the bag. Hell No will I let the virtual abyss ever get another valuable item from me again.   
---
Lol. Fuck that game. 
---
Threatening in game stuff is ok tho right? Do x or i will break your camp. 
---
Thats pvp roleplay imo!
---
In game is okay. This sub might be though
---
Luck/agility.
---
On my first load in I fell through the ground and died. I spawned near my camp and fell through the ground again.
---
Restarted the game and it continues to happen. I tried fast traveling, tried loading in different spots. Always just fall through the world until I die.
---
The moon fan hat looks awesomely freaky
---
Can't not have a golden ak47
---
The forest
---
The deathclaw statue is nice but yeah the rest seems pretty trash
---
You’re right that is an excellent trailer, I’d do a whole other post and try to get the video to the top of Hot.
---
I got kicked once earlier mid work shop defense workshop seems to trigger rewards often
---
“Patches, patches never change “
---
I fought the queen before the most recent patch. She's kill-able you just need  more then 8 people who know how to dps. 
---
A bad man. He touched me right where VATS says is the torso. 
---
I suppose you're right.  Now they have to cater the game to an audience that isn't even in their target demographic.  Ie. ESRB rating of M.  (17+)
---
Really doesn't feel like it.
---
 broken how,  sometimes after killing a legendary the body will.dissapear for me tho
---
I’m so annoyed! I hope they fix this quickly. Didn’t see the posts below so thank you! 
---
unfortunately i've deleted all the mods files and custom ini but is stilla affecting me, i'm trying to figure it out why 
---
It's called the Sheepsquatch
---
I never saw a single post on this sub asking for a stash box in the enclave bunker.
---
Goddamit forgot to build my radio. First thing I do on next login.
---
/u/Valseek /u/LoneVaultWanderer /u/BethesdaGameStudios
---
We need this hotfixed ASAP.
---
like i can't get the glowing ones to spawn at all, even a first wave doesn't show up
---
Lol ur funny
---
PC? I've got extras
---
Yeah Jesus Christ I paid $80, Jesus Christ.
---
Your replies betray your lies haha 
---
Ps4
---
It’s a new feature.
---
The shape is hard to describe but I’m over it. I just don’t understand why I have to rebuild it and it took a minute to built the first time. I guess I’ll probably just build a simple 3 story tower with 10 rocket turrets on it this time so I don’t waste to much time. 
---
Tremendous post.
---
Keep schooling these kids.
---
Can't say anything there really interests me. It's a shame because there really isn't anything that great in the atomic shop as it is. 
---
Ya'll need to make the report system a little less annoying. A "back" button, or better yet, a single page with drop down trees? Having to re-open the report system when I can't find the appropriate sub-heading is irksome. 
---
I'd have thought this would go under "technical support"- windows-something, but I'm not finding anything even remotely right. 
---
Any suggestions? Where exactly would I put "I can't play the game because my character falls through the floor to their death every time I fast travel or try to re-spawn"? 
---
you mean after its been.nuked?
---
Only thing I care about is my explosive plasma gat that is essentially an automatic explosive shotgun, just replace explosive with a different projectile effect so I can use it as I like
---
Where do we start the new brewing quest? 
---
I sent you a message on xbox
---
Ok black is nice. I'd like to see pure colors on all of them though.
---
Bwahahahahahahaha....
---
signed,
---
SBQ
---
I don’t know. It’s making rebuild mine which is a drag. The good thing is though you can build 10 rocket turrets now so I’m stoked about that.
---
Nice touch.
---
it didnt let me in ffs
---
Same with me for lead. Different experiences, not exactly shocking in this game. 
---
I would not drop anything off yet .. wait till this patch cools down .. If I lost My X-01 or or PA's because some dumb new patch glitch/bug .. I think I might stop playing for a while - every patch brings fear something else is gonna go wrong .. and I hear they don't replace jack Shit. 
---
Also .. I am seeing a lot of Post about weird stuff happening post patch.
---
Try a scan and repair now.
---
you only get 2 glowing ones that i know of at whitesprings..and if they didnt spawn when you got there maybe they just spawned before you got there and were killed?  dunno
---
Yes because everyone who was banned was completely justified. Especially those who are still scratching their head as to why (many of those who just picked up stuff in a game that encourages you to be a hoarder). And have yet to get an email/ticket response etc.
---
But Can't argue with that logic of All Banned/Suspended players are cheaters here, or you get downvoted to hell. And Sanctimonious posts like this will be continue to poor in. 
---
Go back to the original ini. It’s to do with mods
---
I thought so as well! It’s nice to see these updates really seamlessly moving into the existing world. 
---
I ended up respawning at Vault 76 and I seem to be above ground. Whew.
---
Kotaku would like to know your location
---
Nice!
---
I didn’t use any exploits to build it. I just spend a lot of time on it so it sucks to have to redo it but it’s whatever. I’ll just build a new one.
---
Touché
---
Yup same, but the two I saw were 3* for 200-400 caps so I bought em anyhow.
---
Junk, naturally, but this bug probably won't change my hoarding habits :P
---
What's your graphics card? Mine had drivers I had to constantly update but never told me they needed to be updated
---
People still talk about mass effect Andromeda having bad animations while the couple that were an actual issue were fixed very quickly
---
A surprise to be sure but a radio one.
---
It doesn't matter if you have pacifist on or off, slap damage works the same either way. Most likely someone on your team had claimed a workshop.
---
&gt; If they wanted this they would have added the ability to transfer between characters.
---
I wish we had that ability though. Like a very small stash box that maybe holds 40-50  pounds.    Basically only big enough to transfer one item from one character to another.   You can have up to five characters in this game, and your characters will likely have different builds. A great legendary melee is useless for your rifleman character should he find one. 
---
If would be great if there was a simple way to transfer it. 
---
I think they give you one for the quest when you try to craft it. I didn't have any, but there was one in my inventory when I tried to craft the Nukashine.
---
Hi! I know this wasn't addressed in today's patch, but we are looking into this one. Will let you know as soon as I have any other details to share.
---
Mods? 
---
If you wanted to play in a world with 0 duped gear you'd need to play a PvP world.
---
I still think this is the best option to prevent a player base split.
---
See that's the thing hundreds of hours of grinding and I'm not even close to what the dupers got to keep and if I want to play as legit as possible I have to avoid buying gear
---
You looking for the Black Sabbath or the Iron Maiden plans? LOL
---
Use these options;
---
In-game support &gt; I Need Help With My Character &gt; My Character is Stuck &gt; Not Helpful   
---
That will let you submit more information
---
It's a mod conflict issue.
---
The original trailer showed them there too so, who knows
---
Has anyone figured out how to make nukashine ferment faster 
---
So it is an even better option if you are going the old way and farming mutations instead of buying the serum.
---
Doesn't exist for FO76, it's amazing for fo4 though
---
I mean, yes. This doesn't play like older fallout games, the lack of being able to store every bit of scrap is a change from 4. (and only 4... you didn't hoard giant piles of every can and lightbulb you see in other fallout games, the original games didn't even have the option). 
---
But this isn't those. You're not clogging up terabytes of your OWN hard drive, you're clogging up terabytes of rented server space. For garbage. 
---
Well, non-redundant saves probably means hundreds of megabytes, but that shit adds up between characters and accounts. 
---
you're comprehension needs work, if Ultracite is it's own thing I would not be correct, as that is not what I said, and even if in the game it's a separate craftable, not just an upgrade, it's still model T-51
---
the scorchbeast cant go through the entrance of the cave where it is located in, just lure it there and then enjoy a SB on the ground, that at best can only scream at you (you can dodge by taking cover easily) and cant get close enough for melee.
---
Yes they are aware and investigating this.
---
Stimpacks are still chems. But even in Fallout 1 and 2, you couldn't get addicted to Stimpacks.
---
No, but radiation removed sections count, and it's easy to knock yourself down to, say, half health, and get a decent boost. 
---
Oh shit, that sucks then damn.
---
hope its broken for good
---
Yeah it would be nice to have non-druggie, non-mutant options that were as good as the others. Right now the advantages of alcohol, drugs and mutations are just too good and overbalance the trade-offs.
---
I had this happen to me a few times in the past 2 weeks. In one case, ghouls never spawned. The radroaches and radstags would respawn every time, but never the ghouls. Other times I would hop out and in to respawn the ghouls and it wouldn't work. Tried 3 times in a row with nothing coming back, being very careful to make sure no ghouls had survived the first pass. My teammate did it and they appeared. Found no real solution for this problem. Just went to a new server and dropped another nuke when it got too frustrating and they wouldn't respawn for anyone. I think it may have something to do with a ghoul surviving by being glitches into a wall where it cannot be found. I've found a ghouls stuck in the ceiling where they drop down from.
---
Thank you kindly. I'll get that ticket in a DM soon. 
---
You are cool and edgy
---
This has been happening since launch.Ive brought it up before and was told I was crazy,but it’s very annoying.
---
So, we can get rid of individual mutations? How does that work?
---
Nah man everyone's legal drinking age here.
---
*Hit me.*
---
But, sir, you have twent...
---
*I SAID HIT ME*
---
Thank you very much! 
---
Wow this sub, honest advice, Don't bother asking anything relating to bans here. You're just gonna get trolled/flamed/downvoted. Most people here aren't willing to help you.
---
The Dude role Play when?
---
it doest fux just checked
---
I got 3, 3 star legendary super mutants at pleasant valley. Was, pardon the pun pleasantly surprised.
---
I hear ya, " Even you must surely agree that a miscellaneous quest and a few camp items after waiting 4 months is disappointing " that's not the only thing though, they've been working on other things. They tweaked/fixed a bunch of stuff. Granted I would like to see more coming out too .. As I am tired of the Rainbow Bright/Sesame Street items that have been coming out with .. BUT I want stuff fixed and stable before they flood us with more broken things. 
---
IMO once everything is in good working condition .. they are gonna flood us with cool and new stuff .. Just have patience. 
---
You cant select which ones you remove. I just took a radaway and got lucky that it removed the one I wanted gone first
---
Issue with your ini file. Beth have tweeted about this.
---
Ffs haha :D
---
Instigating Power Fist, Vampire's Mole Miner Gauntlet, Bloodied Mole Miner Gauntlet, Bloodied Explosive Handmade 
---
I always told myself it sort of made since because the bunker is so secure. But secretly to myself, I would say screw that lol
---
Wow alot of good fixes here!
---
I had to go to the factory to get one
---
[Strong loved that]
---
My current character is a (level 55) punching weapons specialist and thusly doesn't use it. It makes me a little fragile in nuke zones since I can't wear armor and hazmat suit at the same time, but as long as I play with a little care, I still have a high level of survivability. In standard armor, when outside a nuke zone, I'm more than tanky enough to take on most foes up close.
---
What does Op mean in this context?
---
Naw, it was meant to be difficult. What they should do is fix it so it actually is as difficult as they initially intended.
---
So maybe I guess I did have a Quantum in my inventory. 
---
This. And acid is worse to scrounge for imo.
---
r/ladydevann
---
What?  I don't understand your comment.  Ultracite power armor is not t-51 power armor... I must be missing something here
---
RX 480
---
Yeah there is a drop but a decent rig won't go slideshow mode, nothing server side should affect client fps in anyway but could be some anti cheat stuff restricting your rof if the server is struggling.
---
Ooh, thanks!  My favorite word that all the hip kids use:  *edgy*.  Please call me cringey too, senpai.
---
People just look up the code. I have never seen anyone do it the legitimate way.
---
Seems like that one can't be done.
---
I only am mentioning this because I played ARK for over a year exclusively. I loved that game right up until I hated it and would never play it again.  I believe it to be worse than Rust when it comes to trolling, griefing and outright bad behavior mayhem.  5 of my group took out a bully group that had dominated the server for months called The Whitewalkers , in one night through treacherous infiltration by our single female player.  I have posted in similar threads that most players don't understand what griefing is unless they played that game. 
---
It's a reward from the daily as far as I've seen. I've yet to see anyone either with or offering the recipe.. 
---
now? hasn't it always?
---
There have been a shitload of posts on this very thing this afternoon.
---
"looks around" .. thats the average? .. WTF am I doing playing 8 .. God I need to get out .. HAHAHA  jking
---
This is a great post, thanks.
---
Hi! If you've already got one of these helmets, or traded for it, we're not going to penalize you. However, since it wasn't originally intended to be available in-game, we reserve the right to potentially remove or otherwise modify access to this item in the future. 
---
Fantastic idea! Sometimes i'll sit down and forget to turn the radio off to hear my jukebox
---
They are meant to explode. If they do the second you kill them that means another legendary has spawned nearby to replace them. The remains are easy to track. Just listen for crashes to see where they flew off too. And if not they are still on the ground as piles. 
---
I thought the same thing. I had to go back and re-read the patch notes cuz I thought the legendary vendor had been put in already.
---
I got the arms from a spawn in black water mine about a week ago, I think they’re just really rare but they definitely still exist. 
---
Click! Noice.
---
damn.. well i'll keep checking around for science
---
Again not true I do use my stuff however I seem gain more in daily play then I can even consume, I never said I was not hoarder hell yes I like my stuff I looted it why wouldn't I? lol I do scrap lvl tier weapons but, everything is unlocked for everything now, I do not need to resources cause I got somewhere between 50k - 60k lbs of which I use, to claim workshops etc I use her loot to build them.  And I can't sell extra recipes and plans I find I like to keep them so when I make a new char POOF they can make everything! Or I give to player to trade or gift.  Honestly really none of this matters point is all my in game work is gone from launch.  That's really all that matters.
---
I would be totally cool with this of we could lock items so they couldn't accidentally be dropped, sold, or destroyed
---
Yes, it has always.
---
Dang, idk man. I'd email support and see if its some type of setting. 
---
Duping was a glitch that exploited unintended problems in the code.   PVP and destroying bases is part of the game intentionally.  Your logic makes no sense.  If Bethesda didn't want there to be PVP, explain the 2 achievements that require you to kill other players.
---
Now, Bethesda can take player feedback into account and change things - which is what they seem to be doing - but don't equate people who out and out cheat with people who are playing the game within the rules.  You may not like the way they are playing, but they are not cheating.
---
I personally liked it the way it was.  Having 2 different game modes, one that encourages PVP and one that completely prevents it, seems lame to me.  I didn't engage in PVP myself, but the threat of it added something to the experience.  I don't want to play a mode that actively encourages PVP, but at the same time removing it just takes something away.  I solo, so maybe I'm missing something with the cooperative nature of the game, but Fallout 76 without the threat of some PVP just seems like a glitchier version of Fallout 4, without NPCs.
---
I have a 1 star Grognaks Axe you can have, whats your PSN?
---
So I put my camp basically where I had it. I build my little cardboard standee on the station side of the tracks and put some foundations back where I had them and logged out and back in and it didn't say I couldn't building there. So now should I fear placing something in my camp that will make my camp unbuildable ? Would REALLLLLLY like to know this one. So far it loaded it back in.. surprised to see so many people in that spot now. 
---
Turn off your mods, others are saying that is the cause of this glitch.
---
I've got perks in everything that increases durability and repair on hit. I haven't repaired anything in weeks. Sometimes I repair stuff just to clear out some junk.
---
already done, nothing happened. I tried also to delete most of the files that could have been changed but it's still there. I guess i have to delete everything and download that again, even if it doesn't make any sense
---
That's what I love about this game. You didn't know you needed an Alpine Horn, but now you know you need an Alpine Horn.
---
Mods. It’s the fucking mods. 
---
It always has...
---
If you want a normal one without perks check the antique store regularly(server hop). There's a melee weapon spawn upstairs on a table next to a vanity.
---
If you're searching for a legendary I've had good luck with melee drops in watoga.
---
If you'd like to purchase one I'm also on Ps4 and I have a couple in my stash, varied stars/perks 
---
Was wondering the same thing 
---
Pm’ed it to you!
---
 I would love to see this in the future.
---
Goodluck! If ya do figure it out post. Cheers 
---
if its not has been changend in the last patch: pistol grip = gunslinger / rifle stock = rifleman!
---
Are you supposed to black out and end up in a random location after doing a Vintage Nukashine? Damn that was wild. Ended up in Cranberry Bog.
---
What do you have?
---
Unfortunately, I don't generally play with sound on...
---
But more to the point, I've killed a LOT of legendary Robbies the Robot and even when I've seen multiple legendaries near each other, none have shown this sort of instant self immolation.
---
GOLDEN AK!
---
Nuka Cola, water, and that’s really all that I can think of. 
---
Whats your cpu and ram
---
No! My mods! My beautiful, beautiful mods!
---
yes
---
OK yea l looked at the roadmap that quest is out in April 
---
I can't imagine my game without perk loadouts and better inventory...
---
thank you very much for a official answer! 
---
Great, my CAMP doesn't believe in violence or hurting others now...
---
Finally got too many rads and sacrificed my marsupial mutation last night! Man I wish this was a thing then...
---
It’s random. I’ve killed some that didn’t for a few minutes and other that blow up the instant my bullet hit them. Others are somewhere between. 
---
How have you made it in the wasteland this long?
---
Hmm I didnt know I wanted to brew, but I do so who woulda thought it!
---
They hated him for he told the truth.
---
It's basically a slow reloading shotgun, you're not missing out

&gt;Carry Weight Limit: A new “Destroy” option will now appear in place of the “Drop” option when a player who has exceeded the absolute maximum weight limit of 1,500 pounds plus the character’s current carry weight views items in their inventory. 
---
This just completely fucked over all the hoarders and shop owners
---
not noted in the patch notes soooo NOPE we flamer kids stay at a highly cost playstyle -,-
---
Thanks a lot Fernando I appreaciate your reply very much !!! 
---
This dub in a nutshell...smh
---
Mod conflict issue. 
---
That makes me feel a bit better.
---
It always did ya idiot 
---
Was I the only one grabbing every Nuka Cola I came across only to drink it immediately exactly because they gave you caps?
---
Any idea What the new quests are? Thought there was one thay gets you a mask??
---
good
---
Oh god. Please enlighten me with what you find acceptable music. 
---
just keep killing or trade with someone. i still don't get grog axe's to drop very often.
---
a handmade rifle with a prime receiver isn't something different just because it fires ultracite rounds, it's still a handmade rifle, just like Ultracite PA is T-51 modded with ultracite.  the only reason I can think you can't upgrade T-51 to ultracite, like you can with the handmade, is because Ultracite PA is kinda OP and upgrading it would make it too easy to get.
---
never had that happen to me
---
You should seek help from a doctor or a Buddhist monk or something, you're very angry 
---
That's on the 17th
---
Great notes! 
---
Any word on the ash/goo pile Bu where if an enemy is disintegrated/melted from a distance, you get infinite loot loading screen and nothing drops? 
---
From the patch notes.

"New Seasonal Event Quest – Fasnacht ParadeThis repeatable, limited-time event will be available for one week, from March 19 - 26." 
---
There is another but its limited time.
---
8700k 4.7Ghz DDR4 3200
---
...So apparently, a full system re-start AFTER removing the .ini and "scan and repair" in the launcher actually fixed my issues. Should I still submit that report for data?
---
Don’t blame you. I haven’t been able to kill the queen in weeks and wanted to try again soon. 
---
I can't answer for this game, but I can for a different one long ago.
---
I cheated to try something different, to experiment and see what I can reveal in the process. Reach places I could not, see things I should not.
---
I enjoyed the base game, and still wanted to play it. Had to start over with a new account. Lesson learned.
---
I see how you want it to work.  What I'm saying is that the code they have for placing camp items doesn't support that approach.  There are two possibilities right now.  They could use the code they already have for building a camp, including the menus, the icons, and (optionally) the plans.  Or they could write an entirely new system just for placing decorative camp items that has to work with the existing system.  One of these possibilities includes a lot more development and testing effort than the other.  I just don't think it's likely they will develop an entirely new way to place camp items just for decorations.  I may be wrong.  I don't work for Bethesda.  But I do write software for a living and I think it makes sense to use the code they already have. 
---
Unlock the new poster (for free) from the atom shop and build it in your camp, or find one at a train station and read it.
---
This is a great idea, I’d have loved to submit an image of my balcony bar overlooking the savage divide’s valley of trees, But sadly the camp system glitched on me and I just can’t build it
---
&gt;Flux maybe?  Was a note they messed with weight
---
I think the head is from the tricentennial edition
---
There’s gonna be duping in survival mode I guarantee it, unfortunately BGS doesn’t know how to stop it and I doubt they ever will. 
---
You just got a bad roll on your character or something because lots of people have found the gear they want without even trading. I hope you find better loot, what system are you on?
---
For those who also use a Bloodied weapon with Adrenal Reaction, some reports of Bloodied no longer stacking with Adrenal Reaction.
---
Wooooooooooooo! I just started last week, and I'm already excited about making booze and doing seasonal events.
---
Ta duck. Imagination is running wild at the moment. I enjoy trying "unoptimal" builds to add a layer of difficulty, so I think split laser pistol only guy is my next play.
---
Huh... you think they'll tag you with wanted for turning other people's radios off or only if we destroy them? 😂😂
---
I’ve been having the same problem pal. Haven’t seen her go under half a bar health either! I’m hoping they have fixed it. Just got to wait for the nuke silos to be fixed now.
---
Psn? Lol 
---
Ty 
---
You on Xbox by any chance?  I'd love to have Knight paint instead of initiate
---
ahm better u stay on melee (is atm the strongest/easyiest aviable)
---
aaaaaand this short update todays is... dont know how to say...  A sack of rice fell over in China... yes that would discribe it realy good i would say... sry that brewer thing is... \*shake head\*
---
You can also get the poster to put in your camp for free from the atom shop although I couldn't find it in the camp build menu (Didn't look too hard though, just logged on briefly to check out the new patch). 
---
That is awesome. After finishing the questline the first thing I did was head back to my base and build my own little moonshiner shack out back so I could have one of my own.
---
Yeah this is a dumb idea. I am going to get reported a lot. I curse on open mic. Im not racist or horrible but I shouldnt have to watch my mouth or be a nice guy to play the game
---
Yeah they just totally screwed over all the hoarders, traders, and shop owners. No idea why they thought this was a good idea.
---
Just leave him to do as he pleases to your camp, while you go do the same to other players as Bethesda intended.
---
That's because he probably didn't have any caps at all. It sucks, but it happens.
---
Thank you 
---
I got one 3-4 days ago. 
---
No I'm on Xbox. I'm fairly high level and extremely well geared but killing him gave me none of his bounty and he just kept destroying everything. 
---
No one needs your flak
---
It was just a question, chill
---
Haikus, really? 5th grade?
---
And your cringey as well but something tells me you hear that a lot w your haiku insults.
---
woAh wHAt a gREaT rEveLatiON
---
Hooray energy weapons have gotten some much needed improvements, now I can unleash my inner mad scientist with less hassle than before! Keep it up!
---
lol fair enough man. Im just kinda interested with what else they are gonna add :)
---
Seems like it 
---
I didn't even get that far. It tasked me with drinking Nukashine... I had just picked up a "Bottle of vintage Nukashine" but then it wasn't anywhere in my inventory =(
---
No I don't support cheating
---
What exactly is nerfed?
---
My 3* dropped a drill. Hooray?
---
It's a risk I'm willing to take!
---
What? 
---
I was sure, but you guys have me questioning it now. I noticed it more with mobs, I could’ve sworn I’ve used a crit, then had gun fu bring me to the next target and already had another crit. It’s totally possible I imagined it 
---
Damn
---
How do you define "passive"? 15% rifle damage bonus is a passive effect, and will be objectively better for rifle users out in the wild. This doesn't really change the problem, it'll still be lots of swapping between the ones you need when you need them.
---
I have a buddy with a character he used to role play as a trader, he was well overweight with no duped items, he now has to destroy the majority of his items.
---
I’m not arguing it not a bug,I’m just telling you it’s not that hard to complete if you just follow the instructions given.Mainly for other people that may be having issues and for consideration on other quests in the game.Basically for the most part quests are a bug riddled mess and it’s best to just follow the instructions given and don’t try to “game” the damn quests.
---
thanks will do!
---
Didn’t see anything about fixing Daily Quest to actually be repeatable? Hopefully that was fixed? 
---
thx u
---
To be very clear, as I used a big brush, obviously not everyone who published a negative article or video is toxic. Initially the few publications were not copies of each other, and they were just in game sites and such. When December came it was simply out of control copies of bad reviews, videos of people saying how much they hate it that they won't even try it if that makes sense... I feel you, I used a big brush, I obviously didn't mean everyone who gave it a bad review. Just today I experienced some new bugs for me, that people have talked about, like that magical Alpha Dog :-)
---
Yeah this one was a horrible idea.
---
Hoarding was a huge draw to a lot of players in previous fallout games and with the stash limit, people who enjoyed that aspect were forced to use mules.
---
Also, anyone who enjoys trading or running a shop in MMOs had to use mules to do this.
---
Beth basically just said "fuck you" to anyone who enjoys playing this way.
---
High strength &amp; perception (12ish)
---
Low Endurance. (1-3)
---
Charisma 9
---
Intelligence 5-8
---
Agility 4
---
Luck 5
---
My main character has 15s/12p/3e/9c/8i/4a/5l
---
I plan to sacrifice intelligence for agility. It’s perfect for heavy/melee/rifles, so pretty much everything.
---
My cowboy is something like 12s/9p/1e/9c/5i/15a/5l
---
Also strong with pretty much everything. This time with specialty in pistols too.
---
&gt; I'm still falling through the game world even after deleting all mods, deleting the custom.ini and also deleting the base Fallout76.ini file then doing a scan &amp; repair to get a fresh copy of the Fallout76.ini file. 
---
Adrenaline was def borked in patch 6. The “fix” reduced damage for most people. It was fun while it lasted!
---
The bloodied melee build is the meta at the moment. My primary characters is built this way, and he pumps out a crazy amount of damage.
---
That said, for my second character I made (or rather, am in the process of building) a VATS-Stealth-Sniper, and it has been a fantastic change of pace, being almost the polar opposite to my first character. Whereas with my melee build, I simply run head first into every engagement, stomping around loudly in my power armor, with my sniper I stealth up to every new area, survey the situation, and do my best to find a good vantage point before initiating the fight.
---
So if you're looking for something different from melee, I would recommend a sniper build.
---
Ok, those posters are awesome. I need that sheepsquatch one. 
---
:( mine was a 8 hr download 93min to go lol
---
Was going to post but you beat me to it. I'm also hearing you can no longer do the thing where you stand on the crates in that first long hallway and use your power armor to bypass 80 percent of the silo
---
People still play?
---
Every trader and shop owner is in the same situation as you are. They have literally made the game unplayable for this entire portion of their playerbase.
---
So...he just has free reign to fuck my shit up with no repercussions?
---
Looks like an underground forest.
---
For most people? 
---
Everyone. Poor word choice. 
---
&gt; They’re going to think “I hate I missed out and that I don’t have it”.
---
This right here is EXACTLY why they do it, and will probably never re-add those to the game, now every time a new limited time thing goes up your much more inclined to buy it now, since you know it will never come back and what if, someday, you do want it?  if they ever re-add something it will break that mind-set as there is no coming back from it.
---
You say useful weapons that your main account couldn't hold....
---
So useless weapons? Or rather, weapons you won't ever use? Why do you need them?
---
I used to suffer from this too. Thankfully, 76 brought me out of it and now I actually sell things even in my singleplayer games. It's so liberating.
---
Believe me, those weapons aren't actually useful. Because you will never use them.
---
Were you prevented from placing it today? Cause the devs removed a bunch of buildable areas from the world in preparation of new content. I got hit by that as well, though I had planned to rebuild the place today anyway. xD
---
do you have the grounded mutation? if so that could be why
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
I used to be part of a group called The Gentlemen.  We owned official server 72 for a few years.  I remember we started our long raid by moving 9-10 rexs on rafts and came in behind the first base.  Most fun I've ever had in raiding.  This Reddit would lose their shit if that existed in 76.
---
My boyfriend and I keep turning invisible after we've left a building to go back to Appalachia. Like, he either can't see me or I can't see him. And it is really annoying, I thought they had fixed that already.
---
I'd hold onto the ones you can since the Purveyor update may allow us to do something with them...
---
Am I crazy or wasn't it exactly ten turrets before the patch too?
---
To be honest I don't know what they have decided either, but I get where you come from. 
---
Did you test today's patch? In the... ripening container (I don't know the name in English), the beverages you place can be "marked for decoration" and you can put alcohol in there as long as you have stash room left but you are allowed *10 decoration beverages* max. That's why I think they are making a new system. It's already partly in, although not functional. 
---
I honestly don’t know, the glitch hit me some time in February and I haven’t played since because Building was all I did
---
Ooooh, can't wait for the legendary vendor. Don't know how it's gonna work yet, but I've been filling my stash with legendaries ever since the roadmap. Also, I'm hitting the new stash limit again already, so he'd better get here fast :p
---
"I seem gain more in daily play than I can even consume" this is my point.  This is pretty much my entire point, baring the affect accounts like yours have on the rest of us. 
---
When you're clogging up your own hard drive, that's not an issue. Hoard as much as you like, no harm done. When you're gaining more than you use every day you just eat up more and more and more rented server space. 
---
This increases the cost (by fractions a penny, but you're not the only person who's doing this, it adds up) and decreases performance for other players (again, not by much, but if there are multiple hoarder accounts, again, this can add up). 
---
You're one self centered bastard. This makes it a little more annoying for you. "More shit than I'll ever need can't be accessed". 
---
Meanwhile, the vast majority of people affected by this are duper asshats, and the reality is, this will have positive affects on the in-game economy when the shops come out, the out-of game economy now, and server stability and performance in general. 
---
But no, you don't want to drop fifty metric tons of wood scraps. 
---
This just in.. Water is wet... 
---
I could've sworn you could in the 1st one.  My memory is terrible lol
---
I don't think there was any limit pre-patch. They added the limits this patch.
---
Okay cheers man, i was thinking of trying a stealth sniper build; seems like good fun.
---
One thing I have been thinking about as well is shotguns/heavy weapons, but im not sure how viable they are (due to ammo with heavy weapons and i heard about nerfs or something with shotguns). 
---
This may be my favorite thread of the day. I'm gonna change my character into The Dude now and ask players if they take checks over caps..
---
Never knew you could do that. Wouldn’t try it though, bit dodgy and like you said.. also cheesy! 
---
Yes me too! I had been looking to see if anyone else had this issue.
---
It's acting like it was a pet that you tamed, yet I haven't ever tamed a Radstag and the last creature I tamed was months ago! Since it's owned by your character you can't kill it or get rid of it either.
---
I really wish I could get him out of my C.A.M.P.
---
He switched his caps to another account or simply has none, specifically so he can do this without any real risk. 
---
I'm selling a furious grognak axe
---
Not with TSE shotgun!
---
What level?
---
Players who are quick to report others are typically the people who need reporting. Many times in many online and mmo games have i seen some annoying little fuck get butt hurt when their griefing (using the term loosely) attempts go awry and get all his little pals to send in reports as some form of revenge. Reports are a crapshoot.
---
I noticed today when messing around with my camp that I had a figure under lights, something like 42/50. Curious, I built a few more oil lamp posts to try and reach 50. Once I did, it told me I had reached the limit. Apparently this figure is shared among all lighting (not sure if neon counts as well, I didn't look).
---
So 50. At least for me.
---
If that fixed it then no need! I'll let the team know that those steps fixed you up.
---
Buy it from a vendor
---
If Rick Sanchez says it, I believe it.
---
Pretty sure op means with the new brewing system. As far as the base game, multiple varieties of nuka cola, water, about a million different juices and teas, canned coffee.
---
Huh, I'm limited to 50 lights, not 60.
---
You mean the click bait trailer
---
Why does drama mean contoversy or outrage?  Looks words up, man.
---
Do you have the numbers now that the patch is out if heavy gunners received a DPS gain or loss?
---
If you feel so triggered, step back, play something else for a bit, and return after more of the content drops in. You don’t really have to play it if you don’t want to
---
In the Nuka Cola dome at Black Mountain Ordnance Works... if you've run around to find the keys.
---
&gt; Not sure if it's just me but, the whole game seems smoother and better looking today.
---
I cant get past 20 fps when i used to have around 60 :(
---
"drama"
---
Ok I think I typed the wrong number.
---
Why not give him the haiku??
---
Where is the legendary vendor located?
---
I don't mean passionate, I mean dramatic.  Like the difference between "I'm excited about the new version!" and "Hark, the new version cometh but what of the old that has been so bountiful!  WHAT OF THE OLD!  Huzzah to you, my dear old version, and to you huzzah!"
---
See, dramatic. heh
---
I think they want you to brew up alcohol with the new brewing bench.
---
I like it :)
---
Very relevant with the booze patch!
---
Okay.
---
I did.  Glad it came off that way.  It honestly is something I would say, so I can relate.
---
Woooooooooo! I can't wait to make appalachia radio for my bedside table. Got the free nixie clock, and I'm working on gathering materials to make a cool house. 
---
No, PS4
---
Maaan I've dropped like three in the last week alone. Try checking Artisans Corner during an active nuke, same with Watoga station. 
---
My issue was always the cool down between obtaining mutations, which necessitated server hopping. Did they change that?
---
Haha yup.  First thing I checked when I started falling to my death over and over again.  Keretus was all over it :)
---
&gt;Edit: I am blind. There is a note you have to read first, and then you can use it.
---
its under age "Vintage Nukashine"
---
I manually searched and removed any file or folder that had to do my second reinstall. I will indeed check for and delete that file if i can find it. Also plan to run the scan and repair before trying again. Plan on testing shortly amd will update the post.
---
lol i guess f y'all
---
Honestly, looking back at some of my early twenties experiences, it's pretty true to life :P
---
Isnit worth the lower resistances?
---
All good. Thanks tho
---
It doesn't mean only those things, but it does mean mostly those things when we're talking about these boards and drama. Look up context, man. 
---
Yeah I gave up on yesterday's collect 2 bobble heads as my play time was limited. I had found one but several spawn locations I know of someone had already looted. 
---
I most likely won't have time 
---
At one point I had four ginormous water purifiers. I can't build them yet. Don't know where they came from. I had to scrap three of them so I could build a roof.
---
It’s not hard. Read the last two lines and you’ve got it
---
Ah weird. Well hopefully that gets sorted for ya.
---
I use a gatling gun so I don't have to make as much ammo as those using mini and machine guns. I found a sweet mini gun but the ammo usage was out of control, so I went back to the gat. I never need to carry more than 2k ammo with the gat, but that runs out way too fast with the mini. I'm sure my experience would change if I was using more ammo.
---
wow those handmade and lever skins are niiiice! can we please get some shotguns skins next please
---
Probably just your flux turning.
---
At lvl 160 yes I know what’s useful and why isn’t. I like to change play styles to keep the game interested. Idk if you have noticed that heavy weapons weight 20-30 a piece and rifles 12-24 lbs(heavy weapons have reduction perks, but have to have them enabled, but that takes away from other perks being used in the specific play style). My mules only have valuable junk that is bulked(which doesn’t really matter) and the rest is good 3 star Weapons and armor. I have assassin sentinel sets and vanguard sets and unyielding sets, they all have a lot of weight. Like I said it is extremely easy to get up to the imposed limit. I was fine with the those restrictions that didn’t allow you to trade, etc from being overweight on my mule. However, the new change where if i am above a certain weight limit I am unable to drop anything or trade anything but must DESTROY it unnecessary. 
---
The argument that it stops duper’s is outrageous. Duper’s have over 15000 lbs, while players who play the game regularly can get up to 2-3k easily. Why they didn’t set the limit higher is beyond stupid. It’s an attack on mules, which is perfectly fair game. The other argument that this helps servers also doesn’t make sense. If I’m using an alt it’s for a few mins to transfer weapons and ammo, that doesn’t even impact the server since my character isn’t moving about and causing harm to other(which hasn’t even been confirmed, but said by everyone on the circle jerk sub). 
---
Ah. Okay. 
---
If anyone has Knight /paladin/sentinel paints on Xbox please let me know 
---
Why do you clowns still hang around the sub for a game you claim not to be interested in?
---
nitpick nitpick nitpick
---
Check if your game is running on your Integrated Graphics instead of your GPU.
---
Also, check if your graphics drivers are updated. Also, if the issues started after a recent update, roll back to a previous driver. (I once had this issue where updating my driver caused all games to run at 20ish fps; a rollback fixed it and was patched later.)
---
To the best of my knowledge, you can still only get one mutation per login, and have to server hop to get another. 
---
I just placed the radio and activated it, it doesn't work. Ps4.
---
All of the content DLC will be free, its only the cosmetics that cost additional money. 
---
That’s my problem. I think if you don’t have caps, you have a negative score
---
I’m waiting for the patch notes that say it’s gone and then I’ll finally build my Bed n Breakfast
---
MuH nPcS
---

---
This is my main char: mainly a power armor 2hand melee BUT can also be a Heavy Weapon or Shotgun Guy
---
Because its a Bloody build it can everything Good, not extreme like pure builds but i can handle everything alone, only the Queen is a group thing but who cares the queen anymore \^\^
---
I’ve had the game for 4 days now... and I thought, based on the video that this was all coming out today which btw, made me feel less annoyed at another 19GB download over PSN after downloading 50GB the first time I tried to play. 
---
Have you got any evidence of this such as pictures? 
---
Shenanigans is wtf ;)  I wound up on the opposite side of the map.  
---
Do you have Adrenal Reaction by chance?
---
Block him and/or jump servers.
---
Haha get ready for some main page posts about how Bethesda has ruined the game.
---
^this
---
Didn’t you actually read the roadmap though? It was outlined exactly this way. I’m sorry you didn’t properly read it and got yourself excited.
---
I mean i get why it was done, to basically auto delete all the dupers stashes, but this also means that we cant use secondary characters as stand-still mules to hold stuff that doesnt fit in the stash.
---
I get why it was done, but im still not a fan of it, why not make it only for super excessive stuff like a 5k upwards weight and then everything has to be kept or destroyed.
---
I obviously would rather see decent carry weight and stash limits so mule characters wouldnt be a thing at all, but here we are...
---
I think it drops you at random places. I ended underground in the Cranberry Bog.
---
Should add me sometime, I'd love to initiate new people into our culI mean the Brotherhood of Steel.
---
How does a mule player work? Do you need two consoles?
---
Yeah saw this as well and was like I wonder what that does....
---
Soon my lovely robot models will live again on a shelf
---
I did that for the 4th time after yet another cunt came and harassed me unprovoked. What the fuck is this community now?
---
I didn’t try to “game” the quest. I already had the required items. **That’s why it is optional to search for the voucher**.  
---
Because **you are supposed to be able to complete the quest line without doing that if you already have Fatigues.**
---
I followed exactly the instructions the quest gave me. Equip Fatigues. Equip Army Helmet. 
---
I didn’t try to cheese or game anything. 
---
In the future try to read, because I have said many times already I gave stuff to people all time. At the fact you do some juvenile crap like calling someone names because you disagree with how they play shows the lvl of respect you have for anyone.  So do not preach to me about how I do things when you lack simple respect to another human.  
---
Were you in a team with strange in numbers? 
---
Someone once told me scrapping a flamer yields 50 fuel. If true, it may be better to craft the weapon or fuel.
---
Honestly the drip feed keeps the game alive, not like your paying for free content, you already got your 60 (for some people 80) bucks worth with the base game.
---
So one quest which takes 5 minutes and an event that last a week. 
---
not out yet 
---
You dont need a new account, thats complete bullshit, just have a friend switch it over to a new characters.
---
Buying a whole new game just so you can trade with yourself is rather excessive...
---
Working on it as we speak. I'm on console so its kinda funky
---
Someone requested this in a thread the other day. They will be pleased!
---
Don't know, it's never happened to me at all, maybe the update brought back all the salty players that quit after the first few weeks.
---
Logging in shortly, though my base is in the boonies, so they'd have to work to even get to me :P
---
For those two challenges, I would complete them by playing the game normally while wearing a beer hat and looting booze. Five quests is kind of a lot, but you can just hop to different events and check those off while at the same time farming for rare loot!
---
also the fact that you can't bulk craft things kinda sucks, I tend to 'mass produce' alot of things at once so I can spend time farming the mats then making a ton of said item, also, for some reason the 'jerky' you can make spoils in a few in game days...despite being jerky
---
New after Update 7:

---
Thanks. That was much clearer than that other explanation.
---
I just love novelty weapons lol, when the challenge to kill robots with a protest sign came up I had a real laugh so setting myself the self imposed challenge of killing stuff with a paddle ball should keep me entertained for an hour or two lol
---
Levels equals cap rewards so I usually do mental calculations on kill rewards vs cosr for fast travel and contesting workshop.
---
Thanks. Are there quests that grand those plans? Or places to find them?
---
It's under crafting, right at the bottom. You don't get plans, you can directly start crafting them.
---
And if you drink Nukashine again you end up in a different location. 
---
Both times for me were close to Watoga, and since I needed to visit the vendors there, but was over encumbered it saved me a trip. :) 
---
u/ladydevann u/kindofsquishy this is still broken as of the latest patch.
---
Let me also point out that I don't approve of griefing in any form.  If you want to roleplay that's one thing, but just antagonizing other players for the sake of lulz is garbage.  My point is that I wish Bethesda would work harder on a 'fix' to the PVP issues, rather than divide the game into pure PVP and pure PVE.  The wanted mechanic is not working, I agree, but maybe FIX it instead of just going the path of least resistance and flipping a switch that says "this group plays over here, and this other group plays over there".
---
The interesting thing (to me) is that before I started playing, I agreed with you.  I just wanted a switch that turned PVP off completely.  But the more I've played the game, the more I liked the tension that *possible* PVP brings.  That cautious approach of "is this guy trying to be nice to me, or is he going to try to kill me" added something that I now enjoy.  Flipping a switch to PVE only mode and having every interaction with other players be cheery greetings and bags of goodies is a little too Pollyanna for a post-apocalyptic game for me.  Then again, I don't want to play a game where I can't even start a mission without 3 gangs trying to kill me for fun, which is what the Survival mode is going to degrade into.
---
So basically I just wish Bethesda would fix the original concept, and make killing another player a calculated risk with real consequences, as opposed to just giving up and completely changing the original concept.
---
imagine invisible cazador swarms :3
---
Same here, mate! My C.A.M.P got removed, and I had to place it elsewhere. Since then, I've had the exact same message pop up, even though it shows green when placing the C.A.M.P I built over a period of hours. 
---
Do you have the adrenaline perk in agility
---
Is it level 50
---
Their physiology all changes to be identical, so, it would make sense that they'd have near identical voices.  Not to mention it is a 'secondary' characteristic but FEV was originally a thing to make super soldiers IIRC, thus, but musclebound testosterone factories makes sense
---
Watching it now it really looks like the northern vault - the one with all the vegetation around it and in the entry area
---
What possible justification could there be for that?
---
LOL. Epic asset flipping, and a quick online overlay over a half-finished standalone game. Time spent by the team doesn't equate quality.
---
Technical data counts as a quick one for quest completions.  
---
No sorry it's lvl 30
---
It's under decorations.
---
It is quite rare tho
---
i was pretty excited for it but damn you worded this so dramatically im pretty sad about it now tbh
---
yeah, but some people rely completely on the internet to get what they want and have no fun whatsoever actually finding that thing. just providing for.. them
---
Cool. more funny parts!
---
IF you find him again (and if your on Xbox) let me know.... I would love to visit and get any  recipes off Mr Squeeze
---
Not really, I just play games legitimately.  I don't need to hack, mod, cheat or find some way to screw over the game.  I don't exploit, dupe or use a fake fucking character to carry my "useless shit".  You are SAD if you have to use a mule or something to that effect!  You can't figure out the actual game?  You HAVE to use something outside regular game play?  Dude, seriously... Especially if you're buying a second copy!  Holy fuck!  Get a life bro!
---
Any pics of the sten gun
---
I use perk loadouts and it's fine.  You need to add some entries to your Fallout76Custom.ini file.  Check the mod page, Keretus posted it.  
---
why not just use starched genes?
---
I roleplay The Dude. Robe, goatee, and all. Even have a rug that ties the room together. 
---
Raiders are borne of people becoming druggies and looking for an escape, much like junkies IRL, they've turned to doing whatever they can to get their next high so they can escape the shit hole that is the wasteland.
---
The Mystress of Mystery is just another member of The Expendables which includes The Silver Shroud, and iirc, even Grognak is a member of that group.  If you've played the quest line, you'd know it was to do good and let people with nothing, no future, be able to help make the world a little bit better but fell apart due to 'raisins'
---
I'm in a pretty...well it isn't the boonies but it's not somewhere players ever visit for any particular reason. I'm just trying to run my nice little brewery here and it's like everyone is super upset 
---
What does that mean 😂😂😂
---
Really pathetic people are bandwagon down voting this trailer even though it's awesome. God YouTube is a cesspool of brain dead lemmings.
---
This update is going to make me reinstall after not playing since December. Well done.
---
Never was addressed. 
---
You can alternatively buy 100 fuel for 200 caps at multiple vendors. You can have a base ontop of an oil or acid resource collector to help stock up. Ammo perk with super duper yeilds 9 / 18 (super duper proc) fuel per bundle. 
---
Scrapping Flamers does yield 50 fuel. I dunno what it takes to craft it though. 
---
My brother has been farming fuel since the start of the game, never threw it away. I was pretty happy when he gave me all 2,500 of it. :) 
---
Just audio, and images to blurry to be of use. I can't run the video on full resolution but I think one of the people in the underground scenes has it. 
---
Oh, they could do alot with it, honestly, it feels like 76 in it's 'release' implementation was designed to try and get on that battle royalle band wagon, but now that they realize that's not what the players want they are working on content more in line with what most fallouters were hoping for
---
That doesn’t sound fixed to me
---
And why in the world would you want to do that? Take me back to a time in the late 90s early 2000s where you actually had to use critical thinking and problem solving to solve in game puzzles. TAKE ME BACK NOW
---
That was brilliant!
---
I'm looking at the vault right now
---
Where is it located in the bunker?
---
No new boss ? any new map ? Nothing new to loot. ? No its not a dlc its  nothing 0 value berk
---
I would imagine when the bigger updates drop with new game modes like survival and such, new trophies will show up.
---
They posted something about that saying it wasn't a bug.  "Bulk items that are scrapped in the character’s inventory after using the “Scrap All” option is currently working correctly based on the original design of the scrapping system. Changing the system so that it prevents an item from being autoscrapped in players’ inventories through “Scrap All”, but still allows autoscrapping for crafting, would be new functionality that we’d implement specifically for this purpose.
---
We felt it was important to quickly address bulk items needing to be manually scrapped in our hotfix on Thursday, but making further adjustments to prevent Scrap All from autoscrapping bulk in the inventory will take additional time. We’re also currently discussing an idea that would allow players to mark specific items to stop them from being autoscrapped. We’ll let you know as soon as we have something in place to address this. In the meantime, you can place bulk items in your stash to prevent Scrap All from breaking them up."
---
I didn't get the recipe from the new quest :/ I tried checking the Moonshine shack. No luck.
---
Here is a build I'm working toward with the new brewing in place!
---

---
Correct, that bug is still here.
---
Adrenal used to be a lot stronger before this patch, they changed the values cause it was putting out absurd damage.
---
Heavy weapons can be pretty difficult to manage at lower levels, as it can be difficult to find enough ammo. At higher levels it shouldn't be a problem however.
---
As for shotguns, I do believe there was a nerf, but they are still great, the Enforcer perk, found under Agility, makes sure of that. My only issue with shotguns is that, generally, in almost any situation where I could be using said shotgun, I could also be using my All Rise (a legendary super sledge) and dealing out way more damage. 
---
It all depends on what you want to do, but my feeling is, a melee build likely won't have any issue getting the perks for shotguns and/or heavy weapons, as they are all strength based. So you could turn your melee character into a shotgun or heavy weapons character, with the ability to switch back to melee by simply changing out the active perk cards, and then make a second character who relys on something other than strength.
---
Again, it's all up to you, just my two cents.
---
It's there. https://imgur.com/a/66QU6ya
---
Yeah mate You already said all of that in an equally aggressive way earlier on and I actually agree with you for the most part but my comment was about you personally
---
That's a combat perk. What I'm talking about wouldn't apply to any perks that are combat related. Passive would be you equip it but it doesn't consume any special point slots. But it to equip a "passive ability" there would be special point requirements. 
---
Example: if I want to equip lock picking in my passive ability slot (3 levels) I would have to have X amount of perception to do so. That way I still have to choose on passive abilities but I don't have to unequip my combat perks to do so. 
---
New character. Only in the low 20s. So don't have it yet. 
---
We need cap dept. Cant touch workshop items unless you have positive caps. 
---
You're throwing a temper tantrum over scrap. And you're saying I'm being juvenile. The irony is fucking palpable. 
---
Thought you were lying but I checked for myself it's legit! Must be part of those new areas that they showed on the dlc trailer I reckon. 
---
Ty
---
This fucks over all the legit shop owners and traders too. Anyone who was playing this way before the hard weight limit patch are going to be forced to delete legit items.
---
It was fucking incredible. 
---
Yeah, high rate of fire automatic weapons do change the game a bit, and that's why I don't ever bother with heavy weapons...the damage to scrounge ratio just is to damn low. 
---
Can confirm 244 hrs 12 mins here. 
---
Maybe it's your settings on tv. Sometimes at nighttime in game i go to my camp for inventory management because i cant see anything due to darkness. 
---
At this point you’re going to have to sort by value/weight and destroy from the least valuable up, but first I’d dump any and every non legendary weapon and armor piece. You can recreate any of them at workbenches. Next, start bulking. Bulk the most valuable ones first. Copper, leather, oil, etc. once you run out of plastic, drop all the 0 value scrap (keep springs and screws)
---
The next thing to go is the water. It’s easily replaced. 
---
At this point you should be down to costumes, plans, chems, bulk and valuable scrap. 
---
Now it’s a numbers game. Get rid of the lowest value per lb, even if it’s stimpacks or bulk. 
---
Scrap 1 star legendaries if necessary. 
---
Save the springs, screws, outfits (0.1 lbs each) and no more than 10 copies of each plan
---
Stop when you’ve destroyed enough. 
---
Good luck. 
---
What’s up with the Goatman? Isn’t that a Maryland thing?
---
#Almostheaven
---
anti armor explosive or bloodied explosive are the main meta these days.
---
People with that many items were already banned. This literally only fucks over legit traders and shop owners.
---
I noticed this when I went on my routine caps runs, and I’m not even ashamed I squealed like a little kid when I saw it. So happy.
---
OHFUCK FINALLY
---
It's almost like they've never seen a mod in their life. This was already fixed for Fallout 4.
---
Just reading about this patch makes me very happy. Thanks Bethesda for showing us you have been hard at work. 
---
I cant see a damn thing in the mire at night, I think its pretty dark as it is.
---
Why disable the ability to stack foundations? It makes for some really interesting structural opportunities.
---
How did you get inside, OP?
---
I never used VATS because of this, glad they fixed it.
---
Odd, my budget dropped by almost half. I have 4 turrets
---
Lots of trial and error. As well as firepits and cooking stations
---
Yup, several threads on it. New bug.
---
Don't bother uninstalling and reinstalling, it's the same for everyone.
---
At least now you can "cry" in private knowing that you're not going to potentially be discovered at any minute.
---
Can it not be created anew from the terminal from earlier?
---
I'm always looking for other players on Xbox,  anyone here play add me Gearsofnavarone, my friends abandoned this game and I'm in love with it. 
---
10 turrets. I had max budget with 6 turrets down. Logged in after update had half budget! Put down 4 more turrets just because i can and barely at 2/3 budget. 3 thumbs up for this update
---
Not exactly true.  This patch (P7) they restored the damage values to what it was before they tried changing it last patch (P6).  P6 is the one where they tried changing it and then in some cases, the damage was being modified by things other than your health.
---
So Adrenal is back to the way it was before they changed anything.
---
Negative. Further once the quest is done we can not go back in. 
---
Wow. Mine barely changed. Although now that you mention, I did add the two new crafting stations...
---
you gotta do what you gotta do
---
Aw
---
&gt;Dev Note: As part of our ongoing quest to improve the game’s overall economy, performance, and address items created as a result of exploit abuse, we’ve decided to implement a “Destroy” option for players who have surpassed the absolute weight limit. This should also help reduce cases of excessive item hoarding, as well as prevent duped items from being dropped and making their way into unsuspecting players’ hands.
---
This is an excellent idea. Well done, team.
---
I don't know what random copy and pasted stuff people are putting in those ini files but it's certainly not an issue for *everyone*
---
This is horrible. If I can't build somewhere, don't let me put my damn camp there. Period. I am now rebuilding steps from my last spot that got the unbuildable message. I have placed several items and tried logging out and back in to make sure it's still building it. It did twice now and I am half rebuilt and still loading it in. Can we get some kind of confirmation as to how this is being determined?? I beg and plead. Am I going to need to be worried every time I log on that one of the items I places last time is out of the zone ? This is insanity ! 
---
It's great! The upcoming releasesv make me even more excited!
---
Hasnt it always been that way? 
---
On xbox, RS in the trade window is different than RS in the pipboy.
---
Does "two shot" still have awful vats accuracy?
---
They actually decreased nighttime darkness in a past update. I agree that I liked it more when it was darker but it was *really* dark.
---
I added some lights and rugs, two brewing stations and a fermenter, a ton of razor grain and corn, and I’m still at 75%. I was maxed out before the patch. I can’t for the life of me figure out how that works 🙄
---
Shouldn't it be "Shear Terror"?
---
Sweet. Another asset flip. This game sure is turning around.
---
There's been a few threads on this so far today and no, you're not alone.
---
We know it's a problem on PC and PS4 and probably Xbox too. And you can't inspect items from vendors or P2P trading. No, it doesn't matter if you modded your ini file. And, yes, the inspect function is messed up even if you're not trading when viewing your item in your PipBoy as it is frequently blank or incorrect. Also the 3d Tustin seems to be a little messed up too.
---

---
Yeah, I don't know what to do. I'm thinking just keep placing my camp and nothing else. Then server hop until it's safe, maybe?
---
Likewise... 
---
No I have the tesla rifle with semi auto and have no increased damage. I don't think the patch worked properly. My plasma rifle is also unchanged. 😔
---
I'm sure on release it was darker, they did some changes during an early patch that made it lighter.
---
Now the mire is the only dark place at night and even tgen some spots aren't that dark.
---
Can anyone check if the brahmin that comes with the fertilizer producer is milkable? And does anyone know how much budget it happens to take up? 
---
You think you could grab some pics? I know you said it's pretty boring but there might be clues.
---
Ye I get what you mean in terms of DPS; ill probs try a rifle build since its quite different to what I normally played.
---
I was gonna ask one quick question about being a stealth rifle character. (if you have done it) Have you had any problems with fighting the scorchbeast queen? I normally used to do it quite a bit on my melee character but if i decided to do it on my rifle character, could it hinder my potential DPS due to the stealth perks? I suppose i could swap out cards for it but im not too sure.
---
Suddenly having college flashbacks 😂
---
Yeah, thing is; They never wrote anywhere what the actual percentage is, right? Not even the Wiki has the numbers, except the reddit post (which I found today after making this post).
---
I feel like this shouldn't have been in the update?
---
Strange. I was slightly over half before patch and still am.
---
Apropos of nothing, but that's a seriously gorgeous base you have there :)
---
Wow man that looks great for what i would kinda do! Thx a lot :D
---
Still at work at the moment (in the US) but I'll get to it this evening.  Maybe they're adding something like Do It YourShelf from FO4, where shelves have snap points for specific decorative items.  Who knows.  
---
Whoa, great. Gotta look into it. Time to make yet anoher normal Hardened Lever Action Rifle to test things out.
---
The skull of a fish?
---
How much for the AAE lever or handmade or the bloodied vats handmade/lever?
---
Damn you right fam thanks
---
Looking into this, thank you for the report and the video!
---
Why advertise survival mode if its not in the patch?
---
I hope the are no trophies for survival mode....I already hate growing in PVP. If im forced into it I'll pass.
---
As night approaches, the game gets darker. It's keeps getting darker and darker, suddenly becoming completely black.
---
Then the screen begins to brighten again, slowly.
---
"Hey you, you're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border right?" 
---
Sorry, I didn't see them. I'm on xb1. Thank you for the help.
---
I think that's the point, the vintage nukashine offers massive buffs, adding the time to make it evens it out. Expect people to be selling all the new drinks soon
---
I think the most telling part of this whole kerfuffle (such as it is) is that we honestly had little reason to believe it would be fixed... because it's been a bug since FO4!
---
They are in the game, I learned chest and legs. No idea what I did to please RNGesus that day.
---
I have no idea why you got downvoted for this. I can only assume it's because you're the filler in a troll sandwich. Agree that testing seems sub-par. Have an updoot, for what it's worth.
---
Ah nice.  Already a decent source of lead thanks to the can chimes all over the place.  When super mutants spawn you can get plenty of gunpowder and steel from the weapons.  
---
This was already a "one stop shop" spot for me to go craft ammo, with this change it will just be better.
---
Hell yes! I'll be one in 8 hours, it's okay if that's too late :)
---
Maybe you're just a pussy?  When I feel things, I actually allow them to be out, I don't hold in.  And if you think my ORIGINAL statement means I need to seek mental help... More likely you need to, because something I said offended you and you probably wouldn't be allowed to contribute to our social economical system because you're such a bitch 😘 my original statement was "quit using mules you suck for cheating".  I don't need help for that.  What's needed help for, is a bunch of bitch ass pussies who needed to cheat in games, or try to tell others who actually play correctly they need to seek anger management, when OBVIOUSLY everything I've said has been satirical and an incredible over exaggeration!  You, personally, should probably grow a pair, get out your skinny jeans and just take that cock out of your mouth, cuz you support cheaters in video games!
---
And I can't believe you even READ all that.  Fucking moron 😘😜🤣
---
You on ps4?
---
Shut up and take my Atoms for the Excavator Black, Handmade and Lever rifle skins.
---
Have the tesla rifle and plasma rifle both with semi auto and theu didn't get any increase in damage at all as stated.
---
I can 100% confirm, ore is instanced, it seems to have about a 20-24 hour cooldown. Do as you please obviously, but I pull in 400 lead ore in about 20 mins, which = about 3,000 lead scraps. Then I get like 900 iron ore. The bitch is indeed acid, although I always take hemlock holes on my alt account and then do the same snallygaster farm as the other guy. I was finally able to use up all of my violet flux to craft ultracite .50 cal ammo doing this over several days. Currently sitting at 35K .50 cal ultracite ammo, and I'm wondering if I should keep going or not because, at least according to the 900 hour guy, at 100K BGS will ban you lol.
---
No. You couldn't inspect when trading player to player, but you were able to inspect in trade window with npc vendors. I am on xb1.
---
Hahaha, this looks a lot better than the one I had for my first character XD Might try to respec him with some of your perks. Thx for the help dude :)
---
b-but I got my 3, 765, 800 ultracite 2mm legitimately!
---
There is a PVP emote, it's in the shop.
---
True. They never do though. Everything we know about the mechanics of the game is through people testing the mechanics or delving into the code.
---
Okay, sorry I didn't see the other threads. Thank you for your help.
---
My budget was full before the update and now it is at half. They did good tweaking the budget!
---
Jug posted a youtube video of CAMP building tips last week. Fixing &amp; removing undeletable floating items was part of it. Look it up

i just made a wall around my lot with the concrete foundations. Makes a nice little perimiter.

It's a conflict caused by mods. There have been a bunch of posts about it already.
---
I saw that too, havent installed the patch yet.
---
(If they only did what they said); Come on Beth, you fixed the least important thing!
---
One of the items listed, i guess!
---
Bethesda's problem has never been marketing. The real issue is whether or not they deliver on the hype. So far cautiously optimistic. Very cautiously.
---
No one is forcing you to play survival mode,  you just won’t get all the trophies.  You should have fun playing games,  don’t let some arbitrary checklist make you do something you don’t enjoy.
---
Agreed. Loved how fallout 3 had so many trophies with all dlc ones in it.
---
No problem. Good find! There's a handful of other small, unmarked locations scattered about that area but I'm not sure if they're new or not. Nothing too exciting but it's new stuff to explore. https://imgur.com/a/naDgkwa
---
Yeah, all I can do is check how it is in Fallout 4. Been making mods for 3 years but I've got no idea what the hell they've changed in FO76. lol  
---
The bloodied effect alone which you can find here from Fallout 4 seems to be a bit different:  
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary\_weapon\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_weapon_effects)  
---
But nevermind all that. Thanks for confirming that Adrenal Reaction is working now. 50% max. when @20% or lower health. That's great information.
---
I'm pretty happy with the gat. It's a two-shot non-explosive and does more damage over time than the other heavy guns I've tried. Being non-explosive means I can use the heavy gunner perks on it. 
---
Some bullets will miss due to spread but the reticle doesn't move so much, so for me it's no worse than the other guns that tend to move around a lot. 
---
What's the limit for number of lights/turrets?
---
I don't have one at my camp, but I milked Chally Moo Moo when I bumped into Graham a bit ago.
---
This game does not intend for cross character sharing. Thus they dont care about your mule complaints. 
---
Yeah, it was a really well thought out change, the system feels a lot more realistic in terms of how much things should cost!
---
Right on.  I'm definitely setting up a brahmin pen now.
---
If the fixes are as described without creating a bunch more issues, I have to think they brought in some help.
---
50 lights, 10 turrets mate.
---
Heck yeah. Care for a rhododendron rauchbier with this radscorpion filet, or this steeped strangler stout with some Mole rat chunks? 
---
Ahh right, thanks for the info!
---
Amusingly, I started with FO76 mods just yesterday.
---
Ahh thanks.
---
Lol but yea that’ll be a little late for me I’m est United States but I’ll hold them for you go ahead and send friend request and put Psycho in it and we’ll catch up with each other 
---
Really? Cool. Thanks for the help, man!
---
If I wasn't a lazy bastard, I would make 75 alt accounts and upvote this to the moon to make sure this got more traction. 
---
Yeah but things can climb over it
---
I run the gatling gun for most enemies - with 19% HP and bloodied build, I one shot level 68 super mutants, so if I'm farming West Tek it's great for that. The .50 Cal is waaay better for sustained dps though, no doubt about it. Half the damage per shot but shoots 8-9x faster. With the buffs... I think .50 cal is the new handmade. It's seriously impressive.
---
Maybe all the banned jerkoffs started new profiles just to "payback" Bethesda
---
I tried that, it's not there:  
---

This right here would be awesome.
---
"Normal" stuff like whiskey only takes about 20 minutes. Turning nukashine into vintage takes roughly 3 hours, No, there's no way to speed it up other than sticking it in the fermenter.
---
Good question. No one killed me, but I didn't get any daily quests after completing it either.  
---
I lost a Legendary Weapon after this patch. I'm unsure when it happened, but I suspect it was during relog to server jump for tameable pets. I tried to equip my TS Submachine but a short un-modded assault rifle was equipped instead. Looked in my inventory, it was not there, FT'ed back to base, not in my stash either. The short rifle was even "fav'ed" in the Submachine spot.
---
When this happens, I’ve had to hard reset my console. 
---
 thats exactly what the change was intended to stop.... So good luck with your request. 
---
Well it feels lackluster but it’s no big deal 
---
What are the underground areas they showed in the trailer? I can't find any info on this
---
Is it vault 93?
---
A child can tell that it's a trailer to show what's in the entire season not in 1 update 
---
There are a few places with static spawns for them. You can get another, they're all around the low level areas.
---
I want to make this my only method of fast travel. "So where are we going? Ok, well it might take me a minuet I have to see if my magical liquor that alters time and space agrees with your decision \*sip\* Nope, it put me at the Fissure Prime." 
---
Same. I will build a small part and load a new world. build and load until I find out what the issue was. Are you by Whitesprings station too?
---
* Your [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Account name

* The email address associated with your [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Account

* The name of the character where this occurred 
---
The risk of being banned for a single instance of any particular non-Development Room item is negligible.  
---
Nope, NW corner.
---
It was poor phrasing, meant to say that this is possible. not should be.
---
No. 
---
Agreed. Not sure why I’m being downvoted just passing along info. I’d fix it if I could.
---
anti-armor is still useless on my heavy energy weapons. 
---
Damn, I would have bought it if it's 50
---
I'm in the same boat. I haven't played it a while and I just switch over to Xbox and got this game for a good deal. I actually missed this game and forgot about the update until today. 
---
I never had a bad experence while playing this game, it was better than I thought it would be, to be honest. I'm sure this game will get better as time goes on, just like in The Elder Scrolls Online.
---
I do, but I'm on max health. 
---
Sorry I cant say for sure, it was forever ago, patch 3 or 4. 
---
Not a boatman, a sheepsquatch 
---
That's for non-legendary armor
---
I do at 3/5. But the buff isn't active. 
---
if you can, place a wall/halfwall towards the ground connected to it. then place a foundation connected to that. then delete the floor-&gt;wall-&gt;foundation
---
That's what I do on my main already lol. But, just so you know bulk does not change weight of everything it does not reduce lot's of stuff like wood is one of them.  Which ought to be changed otherwise bulking is just a way to waste plastic.
---
The PvP in this game is so incredibly broken. 
---
Higher level weapons are locked until you reach the level of the Weapon yet it’s ok for a level 30 to abuse Serums/Mutations? 
---
Was playing last week with my brother and claimed an unowned Workshop. Shorty after a level 30 comes and tries to claim the workshop after trying to trade with me. Then he keeps one hitting us with a Deathclaw Gauntlet when we try to stop him. I was level 60 at the time and was wearing X-01 power armour. I don’t know why this is possible but it’s incredibly unfair. I ended up just leaving the server. People like that ruin the game. 
---
Yeah one of my favorite places still has to be the crazy cat ladies house. Get like 30 plastic just for stopping by.
---
Oooh ok no worries but thanks letting me know they do exist
---
Assume they're talking about the Vaults opening for high level raids. It was annouced in the blueprint as coming in the nuclear winter mode, but perhaps they're pushing them forward
---
Ooh, that makes sense, the rs was "see offers" . I guess I never inspected anything at a vendor.
---
Same :(
---
Nope. My base is by Vault 96, to be a support station for the upcoming raids. Well, that's the goal, we'll see what happens.
---
I use severe because I am always trying to use crits and VATS as much as possible. I don't know how much damage it does, or how it balances out against hardened over the long term, but I feel that an increased multiplier to crit damage helps.
---
Someone help me on PS4,  drodri420 
---
Check the civil war museum in Helvetia. There's pretty good odds one will spawn in one of the display cases.
---
No actually I spoke about how I felt about it, the rest was replies to people talking about it.  Clearly I am going to respond if spoken to.  Here is a idea stop talking to me therefore I can stop responding to you? *Wink*
---
You wont be banned for that lol
---
OMG A SPEAKEASY I AM VERY EXCITED.
---
1. Aluminum and lead get lighter when bulked
---
2. You’re going to destroy the plastic anyway. 
---
It's a common mistake,  I've been there.
---
All "dlc" content in this game is free and there are no lootboxes you dingus, try playing the game before you smirch it
---
The legs, arms, and torso are different plans. You can also get the plan for the BOS combat helmet skin. It's only cosmetic though
---
Yea I knew it the vault raids were coming in nuclear winter so I was confused when that's what it looked like in the wild Appalachia update..maybe they are pushing up on one 
---
I'll be on later tonight, I'm down. GT is Kaise7en
---
Yeah that is true
---
Hi, thanks for the report and sorry you've been having trouble. Can you please send me a private message with the following info so we can investigate this more thoroughly?
---
* Your [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Account name or Xbox gamertag
---
* The name of the character where this occurred
---
Small price to pay for good gear... am i right 😏
---
256 damage per shot with a high rate of fire weapon is still pretty OP....
---
What about all the generators and purifiers that ive lost due to them sometimes not getting saved when moving 
---
50

It's your mods in the custom.ini file overwriting the variable that loads skins and meshes.   for patch 1.1.0.8:  paste this at the beginning  of "sResourceArchive2List=" under \[Archive\] in your Fallout76custom.ini.

Well I thought they came in plans since it didn’t say you unlocked the brewing! Maybe keep those incentive comments to yourself
---
No problem, sorry I couldnt help you out more. The metal plans are impossibly rare, besides those two plans ive never seen them again (been looking for the arms too). Ive never seen any sturdy metal plans either.
---
Nuka grape next time 
---
Once I'm on later tonight I'll buy it just to gift to a random. GT is Kaise7en. 
---
Happy cake day
---
Yeah but the fire rate is only 60 now with the storm barrel mod. 
---
Mods breaking is acceptable, mods breaking in a way that makes you *fall through the ground* is unacceptable (and poor error-case handling on Bethesda's end)
---
Man, I totally didn't realize there were dates in the graphic. Thanks so much!
---
lol ur fine, although I spend like 1 hour a day during weekdays I play a solid 14-15 hours a day on weeknds.
---
I was on a billboard in the ash heap

Thanks so much!

When is bethesda going to reinstate temp banned players?!? There’s been 2 patches since the ban wave and everyone that was temp banned is still unable to login.
---
Yeah been looking for quite a while now but  i hope they bring them into the vendor's inventory
---
I was wondering this, I don't think so as it's an example, I reckon what you get is just what the mannequin shows
---
 Nice!! Whats your favorite brew that you make yourself IRL?
---
This feature caught me by surprise, cause a lvl 83 didn't deal that much damage to me when I took the Munitions factory, but it was too much to be "slap". I realized this, and decided to leave because he had a friend that looked like a bloodied melee build (he did too, but his damage output was too low). So I decided to scrap all my structures, take my 5.56 ammo, and leave, but his lvl 65 friend sprinted to me and knifed my head by the time I scrapped a medium generator and insta-killed me, and broke my excavator helmet too. Moral of the story is, the moment you see contested on your screen, and a vault dweller with only about a third of his health, you're on borrowed time.
---
Oookay buddy. 
---
That's pretty dang crappy. If you need help rebuilding just let me know. 
---
Try turning the radio on and off again in your pip boy. This has been an issue before 76.
---
I’ve got a fully fledged BOS build dedicated to no mutations or chems! 
---
YES. THAT DOOR IS AMAZING I LOVE IT SO. 
---
Pics. 
---
The grass and bush auto-paving in CAMPs is undesireable for me. Is there any way to toggle the feature off and have it not delete all my grass and make the CAMP look terribly sparse? I know some people wanted it but this was a wilderness CAMP and I liked my grass and bushes.
---
Bruh we cant even see the votes before an hour
---
Learn reading comprehension, I am bitching about unhealthy trends in gaming.
---
Seriously? 🙄 I really don't get it, they produce some pretty awesome content on one side, then do *this* in the same patch? What's going on?
---
The music does a lot of the work, been that way for a lot of Beth's trailers. Not knocking the trailers for 3 or 4, or even Skyrim's, because they are great, but this one? Meh. 
---
Great song though.
---
Every time you, and people like you, log in with an overburdened mule you're flooding the server and causing stability problems for everyone else. That's not just "your business". You can't expect to play in a social environment and behave any way you please. It's not my opinion, it's Bethesda's. It doesn't bother me because I know how to manage my inventory and I didn't swear to carry your burdens. You're the one who has to learn how to let go of things that don't really matter.
---
And bitching about it isn't new either.
---
Pretty cool but I liked the first one better with o/~ Wouldnt it be nice... with the live actors.
---
such a sick tune! At the beginning when you got em chanting

"U-ranium, U-ranium.."

Then it cuts out leading to the

Gimme that black and gold handmade rifle! Hopefully it looks more gold in-game tho..

this homogeneous physiology just  leads me to procreation questions etc...

You can get the quests from Biv once per day. He will give you a quest tomorrow. 
---
The sheer volume of acid you NEED for that much ore is nuts, though. Doing it WITHOUT a workshop (which I will never fucking do, that's just pure griefer bait) is pretty much a non-starter. 
---
People have crafted a pretty crazy volume of ammo in this game without issue. 
---
I had that happen on PC 5 times in a 3 hr stream this morning, just to the main screen due to server not responding issue. It had nothing to do with my internet, I am on a 10g ethernet using cat6 cable and was barely peaking over 500mb transfer overall.
---
Long cool down times being reported 
---
Under wall decorations. Cycle threw the mothman poster
---
Yeah I got a Vampires Gatling Plasma I've been wanting to use. Only used it once but broke after like 1 core. But the health regen, fire rate and dmg was good though.
---
Jesus Christ, superstar...
---
It's free though so....
---
Rusty Pick, for sure
---
Don't believe 99% of the "rumors". **No game actively looks in your pc for cheat programs.** **On the other hand,** if you run CheatEngine/other cheat and connect it to Fo76, and attempt to change anything theres a decent chance you will eventual get the Hammer. I've had Cheat Engine on all my pc's for years, i play several MMOs/Sh'mups/ect never had any issue.
---
If you are talking about the optional speed up the process.. read the note on the fermenting machine where the drunk bot is. Note is hard to see but it's on the machine.
---
I’m just making sure. I’ve put in a lot of time and effort into my character, and don’t want to be fucked over by some duper. I wouldn’t buy from any of the people I’ve met today because they are way over-pricing their goods!
---
Look, we have combinations like Unyielding/Sentinel, and so far as we know people can move to this mode with fully geared toons.
---
It'll be shite.
---
Tbh I’m glad they fixed this. Now griefers are as vulnerable as everyone else. 
---
I'm getting "phantom damage" while hanging out in my camp or walking around the wasteland. My screen will bloody up and my character will go "OOF!" Wasn't this fixed already?
---
i platinum trophied this game, but abandoned it when the gutted my build for the second time.  
---
im what you’d call a realist now.  
---
Just had this happen to me. When I traveled there it was just super mutants. Gonna keep letting my workshops get overrun and see what happens!
---
What is that?!
---
About 80% of the stuff sold by players is duped, things like TSE’s that everyone has etc. Also when bethesda removed dupes not too long ago, they let everyone keep one of each thing
---
I got the golden skin for the 44 pistol and still make use of a couple of legendary 44s I have, but I agree that skins for things like walking canes and sledgehammers is a pretty bizarre thing for them to have decided to try to sell, early on. 
---
Had to go to work so didn't get to play after update today. Hoping I can place more lights and stuff when I get home. Also more turrets is a good thing to. Just unlocked missles turrets and wanted to see how they are.
---
No mention of fixing the bug/issue that the excavator power armor loses it's carry weight increase buff when you exit the armor and re-enter it? 
---
Not to mention the pip-boy bug that makes it look like I'm always wearing power armor when I'm viewing my pip-boy?
---
It could be something to do with the Wastelanders update, the artwork for it showed a Vault door.
---
I mainly make IPAs as I love hops. The hoppier the better. I've done a stout, an oatmeal pale ale, a rye IPA, and a pumpkin beer though.

It’s always an emotional experience...

On xbox, I can make you the arms for mats+tip. Would LOVE if that tip could be a few Violet Flux cause Daddy needs Calibrated Shocks

PM sent thank you!

I was thinking the same thing! I drank one on Morgantown and ended up by Harper’s Ferry!
---
Voila.
---
Cest francais 
---
Yeah, that has a nicely rough and scrappy Fallout-y feel to it, doesn't it? I'm definitely into that.
---
I'm sharing the railroad with the trainstation. Have seen many people rebuilding there now. I placed an object as close as it could get to the station and it loaded in. I'm thinking there is either an issue moving to close to Blackwater as the event is there.. or maybe the green box has allot to do with it. Have you tried moving the green box around the build area since you placed it?
---
Ur welcome
---
They can be a wild drop. But your best bet would be to goto i think one of the Raider faction shops? If i remember right the harness counts as Raider Underarmor.
---
Its people who have added mods.  Typically we're adding ba files to reference the mod files.  So yeah, not everyone, but a good number of people :)
---
It's super easy
---
wasn't this posted already
---
&gt;If you have the time to even find 25 alcoholic beverages on one day then god bless,

It took me about 20 minutes at Silva Homestead to gather 100+corn and razorgrain, and another 20-30 minutes to brew and ferment a bunch of whiskey.  While I was waiting for the fermenting to finish I just wandered around and drank every beer I could find. All told, it took about 2 hours to get that passively while doing other stuff.
---
&gt;doing 5 quests while wearing a beer hat is what I would consider a weekly.
---
Claiming a workshop counts as a "quest", as does the defense mission that pops up a couple minutes later. I claimed 2 workshops, ran Fertile Soil, and knocked that out while waiting for my whiskey to ferment.
---
&gt;Rad Ant recipe not even possible to acquire yet so that's 20 atoms none of us will ever see.
---
That one's fucked, I'll give you that.
---
&gt;Trade with a player, sure even though nobody ever accepts a trade request.
---
I sent someone a message asking them to trade so we'd both get credit for the mission. I sold him a stimpack for 1 cap. If you're on PC with no mic (and have no friends) this might be tough, but otherwise it shouldn't be too hard.
---
Tattoo parlor 
---
I had a lot of fun with stacking foundations but I always expected it to get fixed eventually. I haven’t tried the stairs stacking trick yet, did they fix that too? It was very handy.
---
I got banned for accumulating 100k 5.56 ammo in less than a month. 
---
As a commando build that only plays this game for pvp, I go through A LOT of ammo. I made it or traded for this ammo all legit, but still got the ban hammer. 
---
At one point I spent countless hours farming the queen for some really good gear. None duped at all. 
---
I just want my gear and guns back. And I don’t want to be penalized for using too much ammo.

A bunch of changes to blueprints happened trying to make certain troublesome items place properly. My bet is one of those changes impacted your camp somehow, whether a new bug or an adjustment to what's allowed.
---
As much as that sucks, blueprints have really been pretty unreliable from the start when doing entire structures. If your base isn't simple and standing on foundations, it's best to assume your structure isnt coming with you in its original form, even put in the same place. 
---
It can be frustrating losing your masterpiece. Trust me though, you have more awesome builds ahead of you. 
---
Don’t drink it in the bog...woke up in the middle of a scorchbeast orgy...
---
I got back almost 15% of my budget, so hell yeah, thanks so much for that.
---
I don't think this is new.
---
There was a variant of this (I am struggling to find the thread) where someone's PA fell halfway into the floor when they got out, and they had similar results to yours when they got back in.
---
I don't know what came of that. Might be worth searching for that thread though....I can't help much as I can't find it myself. Perhaps someone will link it?
---
My base has no turrets. The entire base allowance has been used. 
---
I'd assume I gain nothing extra from this update?
---
I am bitching about studios giving paying customers the shaft. You are allowed to talk about a game's quality and how it's developer is hurting the customers and industry similar to other tactics from other companies.
---
author can but that's besides the point 
---
Find a “statue”
---
As does claiming a workshop. If you don't want to get griefed just claim a few and then server hop.
---
HMMMMMM that is odd..... Maybe try server hopping and see if its there again?  Second thing I would try is starting the quest over.  Just some ideas, not sure
---
The riddle is basically a step by step guide to the location. To the right of VTU there's a tattoo parlour a little ways away. Go through the back door of the shop and you'll find a room. Activate the Nuka Cola fridge to open the secret door to the speakeasy. 
---
You have the exact same priorities as me. Those are all day-one must-haves for me, and the things which jumped out at me from this selection the most. 
---
(Well, aside from the Excavator skin set. How long we've waited!) 
---
Oh Christ, please let this be true. PLEASE.
---
That’s a point I hadn’t thought of. 
---
That would be nice. Although I always vendor assault rifles. They give you more caps selling than most legendaries lol.
---
good man
---
The game can be anything you want! Just ignore facts, close your eyes and ears and enjoy the glitch ride!
---
I do, but I can’t get on until 1 AM EST.
---
I have my CAMP set up next to Morgantown Train Station, near the airport. As this is a very early quest area, I get a load of low level players coming into the area. Whenever I have spare supplies, I'll run up to them, help them out with the Scorched in the area (I remember how scary the airport was for me when I first got there as a low level), drop the supplies, make sure they seem them then go on my way.
---
Other times, I'll see a low level player on the map and fast travel to them to give them random supplies.
---
I'm melee, I don't use ammo, but I always pick it up so I always have lots of ammo. And I claim workshops a lot so I always have spare plans. Being next to the airport and having Pharma Farmer, I always have plenty of medical supplies. I just drop spare stuff off for low level players because I don't need all this stuff, maybe they could use it.
---
\*Stares from the shadows\*
---
A friend used to keep her camp there since it was away from trafficked areas,  they must have added a bunch of spots.
---
Okay. I’m just making sure. Like I stated in my other comment, I still wouldn’t buy from the people I came across because they wanted 10k+ caps for one thing. They also turned rather aggressive, ie attacking me (but doing little to none damage) when I refused them. 
---
Idk I just saw it today and it only had 90 views so I thought Id share it...
---
Same! I drank my second and woke up at some outhouse deep in the Mire. This update is just the best 
---
This has summed up the vast majority of my experience with other players too, and as a proud Responder I regularly return the favor! 
---
You do look at your Pip Boy when others see you. However, I think it doesn't work if you use the Quickboy interface.
---
Yes it does. Because of the way DR works in both 76 and FO4 large hits but slower does do far more damage than many weak hits quickly.  The difference with Miniguns etc.. should balance out damage wise and at the same time save some ammo.
---
Legendary Robots (any variety) Have always exploded on death, the timer is randomish
---
There's like 50...
---
Thanks. Added your reply to the main post in case people don't scroll :)
---
I really liked it to be dark. Nights are dark without lights and it makes the Pip-Boy flashlight more useful
---
You can just make another one for free, there are plenty of people on r/Market76 that will do the transfer for dirt cheap, myself included. Just pick someone with a decent amount of karma (not reddit karma, transaction karma) and youre good.  
---
Theres even a guy who does that as a service and has set prices and everything. 
---
Any idea where we get more recipes? And the plans for the frat house symbols... I wanna have the omega symbol...
---
The clubhouse alone has 40 ghoul spawns 
---
Thank you! 
---
That is what im referring to. I consider that the 1st-person pip-boy view. I use both 3rd-person views. 
---
I'd like the Quick-boy view to showcase me looking at my pip-boy as well. 
---
Open up your My Documents\Games\Fallout 76 and take a screenshot of the contents of that folder please.
---
Sheepsquatch is supposed to be added in Shear Terror. I think there was a mess up in the internal names.
---
This is all new information to me. What should I search to find them?!
---
Unfortunately we don’t have them. 
---
Yeah and it gave the nighttime off-path exploration a real sense of danger that felt realistic and scary.
---
I got the game as a rental over the weekend, thinking the same thing that I'd never play this game. Next thing I know I'm playing in teams of people and having a great time whether it be competing in events or completing missions. After this weekend I have definitely decided it's my favorite game this year.
---
Ok Bethesda, I dropped my first 10E on the Atom shop. I've promised myself to support the game with such purchases if the support of the game gets great. And in my book, this patch is great. The new content is fine. the fixes are great and the balance changes are great as well. There's much much more in this patch than I expected and I'm quite impressed. If the rest of the Wild Appalachia addons follows the same trend I'll spend more. It's quite simple actually - support this game with fixes, content and balance and I'll support you with money.
---
Now, if I could "buy" some attention with that money, I'd like to get the discovery challenges fixed. The completionist in me is sad at the sight of 2/5, 3/5 ot 4/5 locations discovered while sitting on a completely explored map.
---
I think the only way to prevent that would be to have caps currency account based instead of character based.
---
It syncs with the server radio when the next track comes on.
---
Literally every summer camp I have been to had a goatman tale, and I've been to camps in colorado, texas, and oklahoma. Maryland is nowhere close to being unique with this tired tale
---
Ha! That's a lucky break. The first time I ended up near Berkley Springs, and the second one I drank put me in an unmarked cabin in the middle of nowhere north of the B&amp;B.
---
No it's new. You can milk any Brahmin now.
---
[Here](https://youtu.be/vy0b0eqelFs) is a small video.
---
Is that a thing if you have a fertilizer pen?
---
We didn’t go to the place to see them, got kicked before, so not sure if they were there or not 
---
I wish I could agree with you guys, but I cannot.
---
You see, I came home to a power outage, and thus no update. :-(
---
FU electric company
---
yeh im talking about non nuked..he didmt state it was a nuke zone till after i posted
---
I don't think they consider it a bug
---
Looks like Warcraft in Year 2006, very nice!
---
The quality of life for the game, it’s off the charts now! What a random update haha I thought I was going crazy.
---
I could only assume that. But I couldn’t just ignore my curiosity with something like that :)
---
Oh damn, sucks, but if anything happens and they do pop up that’d be pretty cool 
---
Yeah I was super salty not gonna lie. 
---
You’re still wrong, those ghoul spawns are there regardless. It’s the level and type that changes when nuked. 
---
I didn't notice any problems with the box. Six attempts later, and I think I'm safe. *Fingers crossed*
---
For a final update, i will still say this is a potential bug as i have never modded any game files or added game mods.
---
I uninstalled the game. Then manually searched and removed any remaining fallout files from my PC. This includes crash reports, screenshots, and folders. I re downloaded and installed a second time. Had to manually reassign to allow folder access to fallout in my windows defender. I hope i have included all steps and actions. This seems to have corrected to issue at first glance. So not sure what action truly corrected things.
---
Delete custom ini file
---
Thanks dude! Luckily I still had the materials to rebuild a few times and get my Brewery back up and running. 
---
No, you dont have an understanding of how the games mechanics work and they do. That's the short answer. Read up on pvp builds and counters for the long answer. 
---
FWIW, they're sort of broken right now. They don't benefit from the Weapon Artisan perk and even with Makeshift Warrior 5 they have the durability of tin foil, so be prepared to repair a lot.
---
Usually I have a couple seconds but it seems like these are exploding at the last hit. It happened again on another legendary kill, but at least I got my loot! Just a friendly PSA for all the melee characters out there.
---
The real question here; can I USE the Alpine Horn? Please...?
---
Not mentioned in patch notes, regarding stairs.  I can see them fixing foundations, as they shouldn't be considered walls but stairs should snap higher than one floor!
---
I milked Chally Moo Moo today too.   Didn’t immediately see anything do into my inventory though. Does it give you anything?
---
Shocking. 
---
Lol just like in real life no real pics of the Squatch... at least yet 
---
I really can't decide if this is enough to drag me back in. Especially over other games I could play. How much play time have they actually added or am I just gonna do 5 quests then back to the same old?
---
All of those sound great, might have to bring some beer home tonight to drink while I play 76 lol How much would it cost me to start up some brewing of my own? 
---
That has to be a gltich
---
Seems it is now. 
---
It's just a visual bug for now.
---
Brahmin milk! Gives hp and clears a small amount of rads if I remember correctly :)
---
Good to know! Thanks!
---
I have a two shot gatling plasma I've been waiting to use. Tried it once and it broke before the first core ran out. I'll be equiping it later today to try it.
---
I had someone build a base near mine. We added each other as friends. After logging out, we discovered they are too close to each other as we get “your camp can’t be placed”
---
So the problem is that it let you build it too close. 
---
Place your base further away, then log in and see if it can be placed there. If it can, then build it. 
---
I spend a lot of time getting a textured and varied design but it is challenging. I hope they do add more roof pieces at some point
---
Yeah, it's like a green hooded slicker jacket I used to have when I lived in Colorado and used to hike up in the mountains often.  I completely wore it out, but you could get caught in a freak mountain downpour and stay perfectly dry.  In a real apocalypse it would definitely be my regular jacket, because it actually works and keeps you warm and dry.  The bandana and goggles would keep dust out of your eyes and nose, and the hood would keep dust out of your ears, so it's totally practical and realistic.
---
Ya k for the LAST time I have to say it if I had more time I could of used more or it and gave more away. Don't you have a noob to bully at a workshop somewhere?
---
I saw where someone else was saying that, I've seen them for sell a few times now at the Harper's ferry vendor bot. Bought one last time, its pretty bland. Does okay damage for a shotgun, reloads painfully slow for a shotgun and can't be modified. 
---
It’s your mods
---
I can't figure out the camp vending system or how to display items because, you know, I suck.  Anyone?
---
It's kinda stupid how it works. 
---
Anything in custom ini should be ADDED to main ini, instead of replacing whole thing(referring to any particular entry not whole INI of course). That way we'd have just the mods in custom ini and Bethesda could change the main ini at will. 
---
Yeah it's not a major thing to do after each patch if there is problems, but still that way is how it should work.
---
I’m sorry, but the RDR2 comment made me laugh. Can’t a ninja fish??!
---
Great release guys! I'm really glad to see the team is still hard at work making this game better.
---
Any word on fuel crafting though? Fuel is extremely expensive to craft, we should be able to craft 50-100 fuel with the ingredients it asks for. 
---
I don't know for certain but check back with biv periodically
---
i dont understand what your trying to say?  i said theres only 2 glowing ghoul spawns at whitesprings in a non nuked zone..am i wrong?  maybe there is 3
---
You can pretty much milk anything with nipples.
---
Actually I use plastic to make Marine Armor Helms to sell for caps hehe.  BTW Yes I do save wood because I use around 600 a day. 
---
Its a So-So situation that can hardly have a winner. Concider Fallout PVP more of an Arcade mode.
---
Sure Assassin/Sentinel and all the other damage mitigation can make a char pretty much unkillable, however if you take these away, even a regular Handmade/Lever will onehit kill everything with a proper build. You cant really balance that properly with all the modifiers you can stack. It will be a huge shitfest and most people entering it will leave it again really quickly and never return.
---
One of my favorite updates yet, and I haven’t even started the brewing part yet.
---
That's true, everything is milk-able if you're not a coward
---
Hey this just happened to me too! Mine read 83 hours.
---
Nice
---
I do but am still downloading the update and waiting for my weed to be delivered. should be on in 30 mins or so
---
Yeah, I thought I knew this area pretty well but it's so easy to miss things. Now I'm second-guessing everything I see and can't remember whether it was there before. 
---
Use common sense here man. Who in their right mind would be farming a non nuked whitespring?
---
Oh Bethesda, you never fail to disappoint. :)
---
Did u get the hunters longcoat tho
---
Looking forward to it. With a pair of distinct three-star fireaxes that both see equal useage, it sure will be nice not to constantly have to muck around in my pip-boy looking for the right one! 
---
It's not much. If I was you I would rather wait till bigger updates come out. This just added a new quest and a new crafting station. I was just saying that although it was so small it was quite nice and gives me hope for future updates.
---
It's the same with Black Beer Lodge, where you get the beer hat for the daily. But you can't scrap on these stations, but you can with the chemistry :/
---
Same here, submitted a ticket
---
why not?? non nuked has just as many legendaries as nuked.well when i go there anyway..maybe im just lucky
---
Gg Bethesda, glad you waited a day so this wouldn’t happen. 
---
God I love the “visit beautiful West Virginia” one, it means a lot 
---
I have nipples, Greg. Can you milk me?
---
If your on PC look for camps without turrets, I have a beacon on top of my 2 story camp and open signs, I have a bunkhouse and only my private suite is locked. I carry plans and recipes grabbed from the depths of the mire and bog just to give away and generally give 100 diluted stim's and a few dozen diluted rad away's to low level players. If i happen to have bobbleheads or magazines I won't use I drop them as well. I always felt this game was about rebuilding a better world all the way back to Fallout 3. Look for Trillian69(I was born in 1969) I have a new character I haven't done much with or can just do escort duty with my lvl146 main, there are a lot of atom rewards for team things and I haven't got many due to players dropping the game, my friend list is over 50 and never anyone on, and I play all hours of the day and night.
---
Wait until a ghoul explodes.
---
It isn't their fault people are using mods
---
I’ve never seen him have it! But I did buy both clock plans for the second time, I don’t know why.
---
Ah OK. Yeah my plan was to wait until the vaults come out but the trailer made it out to be way bigger than it actually is. 
---
The game is running really slow for me. FPS keeps nose diving while running and aiming. 
---
I'm in the same boat as you, small and cute with lots of game improvements :D
---
"Gods! Where are they taking us?!"
---
I smiled when i saw my full budget bar get cut in half after the update.
---
Alright that's a load off then, thanks for the clarification. I'm just trying to spam gunships in command and conquer not cheat in 76 
---
Because the glowing ones are always above level 50, the other ghouls are based on player level. You’ve been extremely lucky.
---
Asking the important (I GUESS???) questions here. 
---
&gt; but i'm also not going to find sources for your argument you need to do that.
---
You don't need to find sources for my argument, you need to find sources for your argument dipshit. Don't claim something is a mechanic unless you can prove it. You're not trying to have a conversation, you're trying to tell people factually incorrect things.
---
If someone gets another paint other than initiate in your reward list for turning in data, can you screenshot the turn in as proof?
---
Yeah I seen him for the first time the other night..my friends were server hopping repeatedly..it can take a long time..I heard someone tried for 8 hours with no longcoat to show for it 😬
---
The trailer also showed things that belong to Wild Appalachia that are coming in the future. The update today was just the first part of it. You should take a look at the roadmap if you haven't already.
---
Check out the pecs on Yolanda, that's pure Deathclaw milk. 
---
I go out of my way now to help, just seems natural to me. I have only had 1 bad encounter in 700 hours of play but I know that's just shear luck.
---
Sounds like butt hurt PC problems.  No such issues on the consoles I have.
---
I feel like it'd be viable if PVP just doesn't have legendaries or mutations?
---
Same here. Not sure about you but I’m on Xbox.
---
Really hoping they find a good balance.
---
As far as I know we don’t have that yet.
---
This has always been an issue since Day one for me.
---
Same xbox as well
---
It's important to keep your priorities in sight. 
---
Yeah and he's just chilling in the golfclub? Lol
---
Sounds like a big case of clickbait with no evidence 
---
Yeah I have. It didn't really impress me tbh
---
wall decorations, scroll over  the posters till you see it, or goto a train station
---
Oddly enough i met him by the red rocket. 
---
Of course not. Todd Howard solved the PvP problem.
---
ok..cool..
---
Nice try backtracking, lol. Even if you didn't obviously just try to cover your tracks your "unhealthy trends in gaming"  are not relevant here in the slightest because the examples you used are not in the game. Stop being a toxic dickhead.
---
This has been doing this for a while. It really is random though. Not sure if it's a server response delay of some sorts or an intentional random action they've put into the game.
---
&gt; This scenario plays out outside of PvP workshops
---
What  I said still stands though.  If someone contests your workshop and claims it, he gains the ability to hunt you down and kill you anywhere on the map. 
---
If he does that and the guy has zero caps and decides to keep coming back for revenge and ends up eating up a lot of ammo, then too bad.  That's the risk that comes with initiating PVP. 
---
I mean... you were willing to kill a level 6 because they took a couples shots at you with a pipe pistol. Are you really in a position to complain about high lvl/low lvl?
---
Glass houses man...
---
I saw a single post before. Just a single post.
---
I didn't notice a nerf, if anything it was fixed. My bloodied axe wint from 800 damage at 20%hp to 1200 damage after the patch
---
I’ve seen him quite a few times, I bought the witch outfit for 400 caps but that’s all he’s had! 
---
Wow 8 hours, I’ll definitely just keep my fingers crossed. If you’re on Xbox I can give them to you if you like.
---

---
Go to I think just about any train station and read the poster. I got mine from Watoga on the message board in the back next to the stash box.
---
Last item in wall decorations
---
Civil war hats are better. One cloth
---
Thanks 
---
I want that nuka cola lamp in the second frat house, very cool lighting effect
---
I liked it because I like Fallout, but to me it was too much shooting. 
---
The power armor sledge jump was dope though, and so were the vertical underground transitions. 
---
Don't you wake up in your underwear in GTA V next to a billboard after a certain quest with Trevor? Maybe an Easter egg. 
---
Nope. If you bought mothman poster it’s behind it 
---
It’s not there:(
---
My games  fallout76Custom.ini
---
I don't even even understand their design intent. As it is now, you can switch perks and optimize yourself for the task at hand, it just takes some effort. But what happens is we all feel like we HAVE to optimize, all the time. On paper what looks like it should make life easier seems to add work, because we feel like suckers if we don't use it all the time. (Well, that is how it was for my in Skyrim with gear loadouts... I'm still too low-level in FO76 to worry about optimizing perks but I can see it's going to be similar.)
---
Every proposed quality of life change, like loadout decks and passive perks reduces the amount of work needed to do a task with optimum perks. The end of that road is being able to equip everything all the time, but probably no one really wants that. 
---
IMHO... *braces for impact*... they should give us a lot more perk slots. Maybe even, double. Let everyone equip all their hacker, lock pick, etc cards. Because we're just doing it anyway... with extra steps. Extra steps aren't fun. 
---
BUT... I would also enforce a delay before you could change your perks. So go ahead and make your bad-ass sniper guy who also has all his hacker cards and other QoL cards equipped... but if you want to change a dozen cards to melee optimized, you have to wait 10 minutes, or do it at CAMP. No more doing it while you are hiding behind a car. 
---
In this way we could have a lot more "essential" and QoL stuff like lock picking, and a highly optimized card set for some kind of combat, at the price of not being able to change *everything* on demand. 
---
I killed a legendary ghoul in Whitesprings just now and he didn't drop any legendaries.  I got a non-legendary syringer off of him.
---
As i said before, there are still too many multipliers you can stack. You have sneak, you have vats crit, head shot bonus damage, nerd rage, Weapon mods for armor piercing and better criticals, bobbleheads, all that.
---
Even now where you have people in full assassin/Sentinel these get absolutely shredded by a good bloodied build or vats build. And full armor sets are more OP than a good weapon can ever be (combare \~80% more damage from a bloodied weapon to almost 85% damage reduction from full Assassin Sentinel). If you take these away, the damage output will be higher and everything will just die really quickly.
---
On the other hand, EVERYTHING will just die very quickly, which of course in a way is some sort of balance as well.
---
Get better caps per pound from water, chems, and costumes.
---
Has there been any talk of eventually adding new songs and/or stations? Obviously it's a low priority item, but it certainly would be nice, after hundreds of hours of gameplay, to have some new variety. 
---
Obviously I'm not asking for any sort of commitment like "Yes, it's coming in the April XXth update!" but it would be nice to know if it's something which is on the development team's minds. 
---
Look like they did alot of work on it. I am a little sad that I am done with Fallout. 
---
personally prefer a 25 year old Glenmorangie single malt when I can afford it, otherwise I don't drink. Did get a bottle of Crown Royal Black for christmas and that was good, for a whisky.
---
5 hours and 10 posts only.  This game is probably dead, or at-least the forum maybe.
---
There's a vault in the NE corner of the map as well that I stumbled across after the game dropped. I couldn't figure out how to get in, so I figured it was probably a placeholder asset with something to be added later
---
So is this what the invincible radstag stuck in my wall is
---
Uh wait, is the removal of the inspect option to view weapons sold by a vendor intended? Now I can't see what other perks legendary weapons have that are sold by vendors....
---
Happen to remember if it had a travel marker?
---
No idea how to send a private message.
---
PC platform though.
---
Someone else posted about this.  Turned out they were super mutants 
---
I do have that inventory weight mod. 
---
I guess it depends on the type of skill people are looking for. Looting/inventory or mechanical/positional based. I'm hoping more so for the latter than the former, but of course power armor &gt; most armors.
---
I stopped checking after several months. Did they ever fix the power armor carry bonus? 
---
That's honest. I hadn't thought of that, but what keeps you from picking up the cores and dumping them in the bushes? Same effect, more serverload.
---
Well, that's poopy.
---
I started out doing extract, but got into all grain. I dropped 600 on three 10 gallon pots and a double propane burner though moving from extract to all grain. It has been costly throughout the years with hardware, a pump, chillers, kegging equipment, and other stuff. Hobbies are supposed to take all your money tough I'm told. You typically get 5 gallons of beer per batch though. 
---
Cant tell if sarcasm or serious
---
Seems like a good atom shop item to me...
---
Pervert
---
How are they this bad at such a simple fucking task?
---
Every patch thus far has contained multiple bug-fixes. There's never not been a time when they haven't been actively working on improving the game. 
---
Just enjoying some golf i guess
---
Thank you for doing this legwork 
---
I have one mule player and combined with both our weights, I'm still maybe just over half capacity, lol. I've learned what can and what doesn't sell, really, so I'm not too worried about picking stuff up anymore. Besides, even if stuff just sits there, I can always just start selling to vendors. 
---
Also radaway doesn’t go bad, so you can stockpile it. But yeah, I’m saving my radaway for nuke zones and switching to milk
---
30 Classical and 30 Appalachia, for maximum cacophony! 
---
I don't. I haven't logged into the game in like 3 months. It was near the pumpkin patch house and the lore had something to do with missionaries IIRC
---
I just got halfway through writing a bullet point comment since you sincerely are too stupid to string two thoughts together but I realized I didn't want to put more effort into a comment about a game I don't have the effort to play anymore.
---
That depends,  got any nukashine?
---
Appreciate this update, I haven’t had the time to update. There are a couple more weapons on the board that definitely should’ve been buffed.
---
Do you want a shovel to dig that hole deeper with?
---
I was In the toxic valley, I thought you always ended up there cause two seconds later someone else spawned, didnt know it was random, BTW i didnt add that causd 1. Funny when you dont know about it, 2. I forgot 😋
---
Show me the tit on an almond!
---
Just make armor piercing perks effect energy weapons and we'd be done with it. 
---
You're really comparing apples and oranges. If someone comes to take the workshop, and the owner has no caps, they ill either still take it if they want the workshop more than them or leave since there is no reward. However, if you get attacked or attack someone and they fight back with no caps, if you win there is no reward. They can hit that revenge as much as they want and keep coming back and make q profit if they kill you even once. The issue is there is no reward for wanted players you kill or when you defend yourself and win.
---
I like you OP.
---
Great video
---
Same, prob will be atom shop thing, I did buy the deathclaw statue because it is amazing
---
What's your point?
---
Hello,   
---
Yes but lets hold a little we're gettint the pvp mode soon.
---
This is just day 1 of the DLC. There's more content coming every week or two throughout the spring. Then we'll have the same thing with the summer DLC and autumn DLC. 
---
appreciate it bruh..ps4..the witch outfit is rare (IMO) thats a nice pickup..i bought the hunters long coat off of the market subs here..with my playstyle..i wouldnt mind server hopping to get it..but u need one of your friends to stay on the server so u can keep joing them
---
I just bumped into him when I logged in tonight! Over by the Summerville Docks (on Xbox).
---
I've noticed my Speed Demon mutation drastically slowed shortly after obtaining it, maybe a month or two ago. I see it's supposed to be fixed, yet not specifically addressed like other mutations in the patch notes for today (3/13) can you confirm? No difference noticed
---
They should really buff all ranged weapons.   My two-shot gatling gun and my TSE minigun benefited from the buff after being initially nerfed by a previous patch. It puts the damage on them exactly where it should be, IMO. 
---
I think it would be the same with TSE rifles, shot guns, etc. 
---
Doesn't look like that to me, so the discounted items should just bounce back to full price. The new PA skin is time-limited, though.
---
Nice, just like you could in the beta. weird they removed them.
---
Yes 👍😍
---
Wut
---
Fingers crossed hard. Send me a message if you have another no build message. 
---
Oh, absolutely. I'd think most would agree that Fo76 should not have been released in the state it was in, and the fact that it was doesn't bode well for Bethesda's projects in the future. But the fact that they have been picking up the pieces ever since, and actively trying to improve the game, I'd say it has the opposite effect on the industry. No developer wants their product to bomb on release the same way this game did, and based on the overall reaction of the entire gaming community, I don't think other publishers or producers are going to try to do the same thing.
---
I was fighting with a difficult shit for half an hour, your post has allowed me to pass the obstacle, gratitudes dweller.
---
If you care for my opinion, it will always be at least 80% Build and inventory. Regarding the build, that is actually fair, because everyone can come ahead with a good build. Inventory, of course, not so much.
---
Positioning and basic combat strategy like switching positions, having a good lookout point, flanking, do play an important role in PVP already. Mechanically i only say VATS, but the fact alone that you can freely switch directions while jumping mid air and the excessive bunny hopping make VATS-free pvp mechanically challenging to say the least. 
---
I can say that why having all this OP gear is nice and all, you can play a proper build on a competitive level with only 1\* equipment, both weapon and armor. It works. Of course you are still on a budget vs a fully geared player, but you CAN make it work, and if you do, its pretty rewarding. and it feels good.
---
I actually stated that it was my own anecdotal thing the very first time and you're quoting a response to a conversation between another person that also confirms they got better loot after letting health regen. Again, not trying to spread misinformation only trying to have a conversation. take a break from the internet my guy. check my first post in this thread other than "YEEEEAAAAAAH" and multiple times I state it's my own anecdotal experience, I am not making claims I am sharing my own anecdotal experience, which I state at the beginning of the thread. So actually no, there is no burden of proof for me. Again, though if I am wrong I am willing to say so (check my post history, I do it often)
---
I haven't noticed any change. 
---
What hole is that? Genuinely curious how you have interpreted my words.
---
There's no legitimate reason. I hoard every unique outfit in the game, all the ammo I ever come across, all the food/chems I can lay my hands on, a ton of legendary armor sets I'll probably never use, and at least one legendary of each ammo type/functionally different weapon. Oh, and one of every single "unique" item (i.e legendary quest rewards) at max level that I can get my hands on. One suit of every power armor in the game, yes even raider. Tons of crafting materials, including probably around 80 flux by now.
---
The result? I can still run around and pick up a good 100-200 pounds before I become overencumbered. If for whatever reason I get even more crap in the future, I have a suit of excavator armor with calibrated shocks that will let me carry around 800 more pounds before I become overweight. And I believe they raised the stash capacity to 800 from 600 since the last time I played, so it will be even easier now.
---
I gotta assume it's gonna be atom shop unfortunately, I wanted everything in that room.
---
Wouldn't it be fun if the super mutants were wearing sheepsquatch masks?
---
I thought this patch was supposed to fix durability issues mainly, and wasn't focused very much on the DPS side.  
---
Still though we should see more changes in the future, lets see how they will perform.
---
Camp was across the water from Site Alpha. Looks like they have changed some of the area slightly as well. Positioning my camp away from the waters edge seemed to be ok 
---
I have Bos Arms, legs, and Torso. Picked up a 3* Unyielding combat arm during AWOL went to mod it to BoS and noticed I didn't have the ability to make that arm BoS 
---
YOURE BREAKING THE GAME BY EXPOLITING A TRICK TO 
---
Yup
---
Click his name, and it will take you to his profile and in the right hand side there should be a button to send a private message.
---
Yeah I wasn’t going to kill him though, just do damage so he’d leave. It was literally as I switched pacifist off that the 57 wrecked me.
---
Most of the top comments I see are fairly positive, the dislikes on the video though…
---
Maybe it’s intended as a close range option for rifleman builds...
---
I hope so, I'm already avoiding any beth game in the future regardless of how well they pull this out the mud or the quality of future products.
---
Agreed, I use the Quickboy interface in 1st person because my viewmodel FOV is pretty high and I switch to the standard interface whenever other players are nearby for this exact reason. I'd be happy even if it just put an icon above my character's head showing the Vault Boy looking at his Pipboy, similar to those that are displayed when performing an emote.
---
Yup, exactly. I'm just trying to make people aware that the game is allowing people to build in no-build-zones.
---
Didn't they add new underground zones? Which I can't seem to find but it's there on the trailer
---
VT Cap as well?
---
Ding ding ding
---
yup, it seems from reading other posts that everyone got a free Radstag or other in their C.A.M.P. with the update.
---
I think a lesser company would have cut support for this game and run away. I know a bunch of people who play religiously so its good to see 
---
When I logged on a radio was still in my "stored" from the beta
---
Yup, since the update any time I get notified of a defence event it says sheepsquatches regardless of what is actually there.
---
Shame about the flamer, did they at least fix how ridiculously expensive it was to craft little fuel? you could craft your entire supply of mats into enough fuel to last 5 mins. 
---
Yep and I built it right back in the same spot. Lol
---
Also yes! 
---
Ah that’s a shame, I’ll keep my fingers crossed for you!
---
That’s something I didn’t even think about, having someone on the server. Just kicked the difficulty up a notch there haha.
---
A; rifles can already be used at close range with no issues. This game doesn't limit your damage based on range. 
---
B; if that were the case they should change the name the GAME slaps on these weapons when you apply the mods. 
---
C; Don't defend BattleCry; they aren't worth it. Literally the only thing they've manage to do in their entire history is cancel their first game before anyone got a chance to play it and see how bad it was, and develop objectively the most bug ridden game Bethesda has ever released and drag their name through the mud. 
---
If you care about Bethesda and the future of the Fallout brand you should be calling for these buffoons to be fired. BattleCry is a liability, not an asset. 
---
Friend who found it didnt see it, hes double checking.
---
I like that it makes it look like we're actually making progress with the goal of rebuilding America
---
The update today was just the start. These underground zones in the trailer surprised me because they weren't on the roadmap but I guess they get patched in later.
---
I suspect the quest related spawn point is locked so that low level people don't end up somewhere dangerous like the bog, but I've drank 2 more since then and ended up in random spots.
---
Do they share a mushroom cap?  AWKWARD.
---
Morgantown is like the best place to farm exp granted the spawn is Ghouls then you Nuke it. Might still be a thing. 
---
Im lvl 68, not very low lvl so I dont think thats the case
---
Same for me. I don't know what they've done with performance but it's something bad right now.
---
In the speakeasy by Biv is the other crafting table - use it :)
---
And if you use Better Inventory, the mod author said to disable it until they can update.  Just FYI.
---
*cue the sound of banjos*
---
"The end of the line"
---
Rare drop.  Hit up the Market and have someone fi it for you. 
---
Better yet, have preset pages. Even if I have to spend atom points for each page. I want to able to switch between multiple seamlessly. Make it so.
---
It’s weird right? Bethesda seems extremely concerned about the servers ability to track items but does nothing to prevent scenarios like this... where you potentially pick up limitless numbers of items that you can never destroy.
---
You had six weeks grace. Time's up. You can pare down or rage quit, I really don't care. I'm just glad they're still working on improving stability.
---
&gt; Don't you have a noob to bully at a workshop somewhere?
---
[I sure do.](https://i.imgur.com/6CCUPeA.png) LOL, melee fighters.
---
If I run across a bag the contents pop up even if just for a second.  If I wanted to hunt it down I could. 
---
Nice! Haven’t seen that one. I wonder if it’s new with the patch
---
I was kinda stuck at that part, but you have to read a note on the fermentation machine
---
What I meant was that since he quest starts out in a low level area and is accessible to everyone, they probably picked a spawn point that wouldn't get low level people killed.
---
All the high level players are flocking there to make nukashine. Should have interesting spawns for awhile
---
I got approached by an insult bot , saw a momma mega sloth fending off some deatchlaaw that had killed her babies 
---
Thank you very much!
---
Sweet so we can report people now! That should cut down on the people following other players around the map hitting them and destroying their camp...
---
For me it's the mutations that make PVP's positioning/combat sorta pointless.
---
If everyone HAS to have the mutations that allow for superjumping, falling slower, and running faster - it's not exactly fun buildwise?
---
Instead of writing this like an entitled prick whining about how stupid Bethesda is you could have just written an informative and helpful PSA and not only gained the same attention but increased your odds of a rep actually providing feedback. 
---
Just finished fighting her. Had a few stutters when she landed and there were 10+ people wailing on her with explosives and whatnot, but we killed her in less than 10 minutes and her loot loaded for me before she hit the ground.
---
well..its really hard to make him spawn..so u need someone to stay in the server..but his inventory resets each time
---
Exactly this. After all the frustration, almost giving up, it is incredibly satisfying to see today's new content rollout and patch notes. They made a commitment to fix the game and provide new content, free of charge, and have done just that. From fixing almost every single glitch I have encountered so far, while simultaneously rolling out the start of the Spring content. You have lived up to my expectations Bethesda, and as someone who had played your games since Morrowind, I couldn't be more grateful. 
---
Bear Skull Gauntlet? Brewing and distilling? Legendary Vendor? Backpacks? PVP servers? New locations? SHEEPSQUATCH?!
---
Oh man, this is looking pretty awesome. 
---
The duplication glitch 
---
I've raised the gatling plasma issue a few times, they say they're still working on it for a future patch.
---
No more stacked foundations eh? No more impenetrable fortresses immune to attack? Excellent...
---
&gt; You're really comparing apples and oranges.
---
No I'm not. 
---
If there's no guarantee that no one will mess with your workshop, then there should be no guarantee that winning a PVP fight will turn a profit, or that the penniless guy you are fighting with will stop taking revenge. 
---
Just finished the brewing quest it took a while but it’s lots of fun 
---
Why the downvotes? Probably some butthurt people because they implemented some pretty strict "no more exploits" fixes. I for one appreciate that. I expect an MMO to be played as intended.
---
Yes it does and I believe they consider that to be "working as designed" at least for now.
---
Probably because of new events.  
---
Hehe, true, true 
---
Yeah, probably won’t get fixed yet either 
---
There's no mention of existing camps with this build being removed- I assume it takes effect with new builds. 
---
They mention this in the patch notes. It’s a new function. 
---
It's ok for you to teach a level 6 a lesson, but it is not ok for the level 6 to have friends to teach you a lesson?
---
I know it sux that they ganged you, but still... why would you even bother with a level 6. It's not like that pipe pistol gonna kill you anytime soon.
---
Cool, be on later
---
Same situation, I'm at work right now. I already placed a few more lights and I plan on attaching a bar to my clubhouse once i get home. Had to get rid of the back balcony to fit the bar in though.
---
Doesn't sound like whining.  Pretty damned informative and helpful to me.
---
Came here to say this. Taken my upvote, sir!
---
Fucking nice man! Been out of the loop for a bit.  Time to roam Appalachia once again!   Been waiting for a reason to jump back in! 
---
Can confirm went to comment section now have stage 4 brain cancer. 
---
It’s happened to many other people as well dude 
---
I’ve noticed that my mutations fluctuate between working with the strange in numbers bonus, working normally, and working without the class freak bonus. My friend who also uses mutations has this issue. We both have every single mutation in the game. Looking for a fix on this one.
---
Find them in any train station in the cork board. 
---
The limit says 50 when I work in my camp. I apparently have 29 already.
---
I haven't gotten to play it yet either,  am also curious. (No, I did not add anything worthwhile to this conversation)
---
Uhm when will be later? It‘s alrdy 00:40 am for me. 
---
I think you're talking about Vault 94.
---
Kinda disappointing 
---
Any idea where it is? I have an urge to visit it. 
---
&gt; I am not making claims
---
Well which is it? You can't have it both ways. You're saying it **was** a mechanic in fallout 4 (it wasn't) **and** that it isn't. Do you see why I, after such a short conversation with you, think you're a dumbass now?
---
...not excellent.
---
Yes...
---
It stays intact, I just tested it two days ago and played for a full hour on a server where my camp couldn’t be placed and when I logged off and back on in the morning, my camp was where it always was
---
You running PC with mods ?
---
Yes. It’s disgusting now. Pre patch my LMG was doing around 21-26 damage per shot. Now it does 61. Even though it shoots slower it’s DPS is insane and it is much more ammo efficient
---
Customisable backpacks are on the roadmap , along with the fact that there was vanilla items in the dev room.
---
I do thibk before the patch, the two were multiple of each other. Don't think it was intended
---
But I am a high lvl and go to Morgantown multiple times every session. I've never seen this before. Caught me off guard.
---
Happens every now and then when something rots or ferments or whatever. Somehow 1 pound of such-and-such an item, when it rots, becomes 1.5 pounds of the rotten material (or inert flux, etc - and the numbers are an example not exact). Just take out what is excess and find a way to get rid of it or use it up.
---
Awesome, thanks so much.
---
Woah man, I’m just wondering if someone else had the problem. No need to be like that 
---
Mutants in da Wasteland Vol. 1
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apvtea/this_game_would_feel_a_lot_closer_to_the_previous/?st=jt7um0qv&amp;sh=2ddd1f4a) is by far the best thought out way to solve the perks, and bring this version of Fallout more in line with the last 2 on what we get for points comparatively speaking. Seriously this guy put a ton of work into it and it makes perfect sense.
---
I definitely skipped over that part when I read through the note. But I see it now. Thank you!! Now to find a new place...
---
damn the people on youtube are hella salty
---
My cool down was 240 hours. My entire team all have 200+ hr to wait in order to launch even tho the silo is ready. I'm looking for any more info. As it sits can't launch a nuke for over a week... 
---
Slap Happy?
---
Did you go through the quest yet?
---
The 2 spots top of the mire the 2 spot south of harpers ferry cause my camp is there
---
Yes this exactly. It seems deliberate.  Who really knows though. 
---
Kill it.  Eat it.
---
That's really odd
---
xbox one getting this message after installing today's update... " A 76 update has blocked the building of your C.A.M.P at this location.  You have been given one free C.A.M.P. placement." rebuild my camp at same location. Was being harassed by "insult bot" which seems to do nothing more than say, "halt" so I log out, log back in and got the same message as above. Camp gone again. I'm at the little gorge south of Site Alpha on the way to National Isolated Radio Array
---
The pathword is....fuhgina.
---
I know everyone is quick to find and point out the one thing that went wrong with the newest patch, but I for one would like to thank you and the team for the amazing amount of work that must have gone into this latest patch. It is truly astonishing, and as someone that has been playing since Morrowind I am very proud of the effort you guys have put forth into fixing this game and honoring your commitment to us as consumers to do it without charging any more money. Not to mention also rolling out new content alongside a host of in depth fixes. If the inspection is the only thing that got bugged a little, I say you guys did a great job overall.
---
Visit the Vault-Tec agricultural center outside of Flatwoods. See those greenhouses in the back? They use the glass tileset from Fallout 4. Really hoping to eventually see them in-game. 
---
Which lights are showing this effect?
---
Betting it's for the Russian Mule cocktail recipe 
---
Same for all of us, my cool down is 240 hours. I haven't heard of anyone being able to launch. 7 of us tried we all have diff cooldowns 
---
It only took the genius's four months to do it. Bravo!!!! /s
---
Looking as well 
---
Still have the problem even after deleting the mod. Plus store items aren't showing up. Plus equipped sniper suit is making me invisible. I validated the game files and all is well. Any advice?
---
Tried. He's got knife-resistant hide
---
Are ye trying to go for a 2-3 week cadance for releases? And if so can ye maintain it  in the long run going forward? 
---
My point is that you were incorrect about them "finally" fixing bugs in March. I'm saying you were wrong. That was my point. 
---
No, I was wondering the same thing.
---

Running around the house, shutting off every other user of bandwidth...

Personal gratification achieved!
---
You'll only notice a change if you use both Adrenal Reaction Mutation and the Bloodied prefix on your Legendary weapon.
---
Some players have said they just had to move their camp a little further back. I assume this was put into place to stop the whitesprings farming issue with camps. 
---
Nice username
---
My Camp area on the Sutton station staircase was one of the areas where a move was required
---
My God. A race of immortal mutant deer has been set loose upon the wasteland. We are doomed.
---
Lol, back at you ❤️
---
I'm going to make a new character and make them chinese american just to mess with your backstory.  Cheers!
---
That is definitely a possibility. I stay as far away from whitesprings as possible. Fuck that place lol. 
---
Yeah same with me. Falling through map at all locations except vault 76.
---
It's the ones in the picture, the string of white lights (atom shop item)
---
#AW YISS
---
This game is rated M (one of the determining factors being STRONG LANGUAGE). There should be absolutely no punishment for cursing in game, much less the ability to report someone for it with the possibility of them getting banned for it. Harassment and the use of the word "Fuck" are very different things Bethesda. 
---
If you take all that out of the equation, you can as well go play Battlefield. This is still Fallout, and the mutations and whatnot is what makes it unique.
---
240 hrs here. My team of 7 also all have cooldowns. That sure as crap wasn't in patch notes... 
---
not any more there aren't! *zip*
---
I REALLY hope that gauntlet is a tease for creature specific items. I want to go hunting to make some cool shit, monster hunter style.
---
Did you have mods?
---
Actually yes you are. What we are complaining about is people abusing a system that is supposed to reward us for winning against people whom have wanted bounties and/or defending ourselves. What you seem to be mad about is people taking workshops. 
---
One thing I noticed since they announced the new content was coming was that the servers were more active, and also a little more unstable. Overall though, this has been a fantastic game, and it's just not a Betheada game without little twerks and bugs.
---
Had my first bad encounter today, always been fun otherwise. Lots of good folks out there.
---
You were able to launch? Was it your first launch? 
---
I am not really a fan of your build, I see wasted potential everywhere, but that is probably because I use a mod that lets me switch my perk card on the fly and can save 12 loadouts. If you want a build where you basically never change your perk card then your is probably fine. Otherwise I would tweak it to do something like this: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f245fc&amp;d=s60sa0sb0p02pd1pk1pp2pl1a72an2ao0au2l71lt2lv2c72lk0es1ir2i11pe2a04&amp;w=ic4a51a32e11e40e60iq2if2&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f245fc&amp;d=s60sa0sb0p02pd1pk1pp2pl1a72an2ao0au2l71lt2lv2c72lk0es1ir2i11pe2a04&amp;w=ic4a51a32e11e40e60iq2if2&amp;n=)
---
P: Sniper and Long Shot are kinda useless IMO. Replace them with 3\* glowsight when fighting SBQ and 3\* of all 3 riflemen perks when not. 
---
E: Ditch your perks. 2\* chem fiend most of the time, 2\* dromedary when thirsty, 1\* slow metabolizer when you eat and 1\* good doggy if you eat dog food. Grab   
---
carnivore mutation and eat ionized meat that never spoils or other meat for 2x food. Packaged food like instamash do not count as meat or vegetable and will always   
---
fill your food meter. 
---
I: Gunsmith is for modding weapons it is not something you walk around with IMO. Get 3\* nerd rage and 2\* first aid or vice versa. Change out you perk cards to repair   
---
your armor and weapons to 200% rather than having them degrade 50% more slowly. 
---
A: Your pics are fine if it is night, if it is day time swap out sandman and gun fu for 5\* adrenaline to make fights will feel better when they happen in the day. 
---
L: Mutations can't lower your stats below 1. Do you need class freak? You only have 3 strength and that will drop to 1 is you get both bird bones and eagle eyes. Those 3   
---
perk points can go towards increase you over all dps by filling out critical savvy or getting grim reaper's sprint or four leaf clover. If you want more utility you could   
---
get good with salt to keep food from spoiling or luck of the draw if you want a self repairing weapon. 
---
Is there any way you can provide a picture of the location on map please? I can't seem to locate the random zone.
---
I think this patch darkened it a little - I had noticed in the past that it was as bright as you pointed out, but today I think a couple of times there were some decent shadows as day turned to night.
---
Looks like someone did about 10 mins ago unless that guy was lying. Maybe someone just completed the quest &amp; has never launched. I haven't launched in days, my CD was still 240 hrs :( 
---
Only thing that put me off was the player expressions. After Pipers animations in 4, it's kinda off putting.
---
Mega hard to see the sheepsquach though. Trailer makes me think it may be more than just another enemy.
---
Animal friend perk? 
---
im having the same issue. havent played in a while but used to get decent fps. its now stuck at 30.
---
THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE.
---
*Initiates PVP with a Commie Whacker*
---
Oh god, he's found the stash box..He has my knife! Oh God oh frick
---
Let me rephrase what I'm trying to say I guess.
---
I feel like PVP shouldn't be based off of RNG (specifically the legendary weapon drops). If someone is going to have mutations fine, but the downsides should actually matter.
---
https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/243423/what-exactly-happens-when-something-mutates
---
this is all I could find. Again taking one piece from something and getting really bent out of shape about it. You win the internet OMG! I'll edit the post now to remove that portion! Instead of looking at the fragmented picture look at the whole (as in everything I've said up to this point) do *you* now see why I may think something is going on your life. I sent you a DM i'd like to help get to the problem of your hostility. 
---
My C.A.M.P. survived
---
Alright, thank you
---
Every patch has also added loads more bugs
---
I had the same thing. Cant kill or interact and it says owner Daliko.
---
Was that poster always there??
---
That's the thing, I don't have it. My charisma is 1. 
---
I've elected to never purchase legendary armor off a vendor until this is in the game. Not worth the caps if I can't be sure which type it is.
---
What's wrong with the favorites wheel?
---
You deserve atleast an upvote, if not PLATINUM for the pun. Where's the r/punpatrol?
---
Checked this out earlier and i wasn't able to use the camp fire trick. I can never move my camp... Bummer.
---
Rifles with long barrels commonly “shoot past” enemies at close range.
---
Have you taken a look at the roadmap?  There's a bit more going on than that.
---
Do you not understand English? Are you making up your own definitions of words?
---
Just because I said finally doesnt mean they haven't fixed a single big since launch. It means they are finally fixing these bugs. Go back to school.
---
Once a month I come back to this sub only to find that the people that still like f076 are braindead morons.
---
yeah. I wonder if something bugged out. hopefully i'll be able to make it when I next log in. if I can't I guess I'll have to submit a ticket
---
Hell yeah, I am glad to hear it.
---
I wasn't the one who dropped it. It was a level 120 something that cleared Charlie. I wasn't really in the mood for the fight, but I saw your post a little before he launched and figured I'd take one for the team.
---
That depends on how many times you press A.
---
Not sure if others are encountering this problem. When I try to drink alcohol I immediately get kicked from the server. The drinks aren’t counting as part of the daily and weekly challenge 
---
Maybe it does have to do with the update then? The theme is "Wild Appalachia" after all
---
So we didnt get any more real quests?
---
Would love to build it a little fenced area but we cant command them. :(
---
I sent you my details as well, in case you need more people to look into. 
---
Dang. 10 day wait 
---
Yea, I am the guy, the quest will bring u there, it is upstairs
---
I'm thinking so as well.
---
All I hear is wahhh, I didn't get what I WANT! This is the first thing they have in the roadmap, and used a simple addition as a way keep players happy and patch out bugs/fix stuff.
---
It was due to lack of stuff really for 1-hour walking no NPCs did feel lonely at some times in game 
---
I want the spinning Nuka lamp so bad.
---
They honestly don't care, it's their solution to duping and everyone who suffers from it deserves it apparently if the past mob mentality of this community has anything to say about it.
---
I want to know why 1500 was their cap limit, they've advertised player vending for months now, yet we should all limit our stock and inventories cause of dupers?
---
Why they ever encouraged people to break their game...  I'll never know...
---
Calibrated "Superior Critical" does 2.0x base damage on ANY critical. It is only available on as Semi-Auto receiver.
---
All other "Improved Critical" do 1.5x base damage on ANY critical.
---
Always
---
I won’t get to play until I get off work later tonight. How long is the new quest line?
---
You can actually kind of edit their patrol pattern! They move between a random point and your CAMP thingamajig. Just move that somewhere out in the open and fence it in!
---
At my lvl the only thing to do is farm either the SBQ or help low levels at Whitesprings. :( 
---
Thanks for the gold kind sir! First ever!
---
I'd appreciate my nuka cola vending machine if it supplied a random bottle every day. But yeah, more Nuka Cola branded stuff!
---
Flatwoods monsters Vault. 
---
Specifically the spinning lamp
---
If you have a cool down it's because you did the nuke glitch there is no timer for people who didn't
---
Where you and another chasing down a scortchbeast at the time??
---
will try tomorrow. had so much fun with the brewing stuff and then decided to move my camp. Worst idea ever cause I didnt really have a vision for my new house and I just got tired of building. 
---
Careful everyone. This user is so edgy you might get cut. 
---
Exactly. First bit of content after all the crying about no content is a shit quest that nobody cares about. Good start to a roadmap is always bring out the worst of it amirite
---
I'm enjoying it.
---
No I said Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker
---
Has there been any word on modifications to the Field Medic Achievement? It’s basically impossible to get now that so many people are at such a high level
---
Im gonna say it youre literally bashing them not coding the lazer weapons the way you want them to be coded if its a big deal then dont use the weapons if other perks work so be it they work and if there such a liability then why are they still up in business and making a detailed road map for the game and bringing in money but you know have it your way im ready for the detailed response on being incompetent or some other garbage because you dont like how one little thing is the game breaking bug of the century to you dont play the game and save us the shit show 
---
Why is a girl using 2001 insults out of content
---
Lol it's not a 2 hour that's a 200 hour, anyone who used the nuke glitch got one.
---
Mine is now at 170 Dmg from all heavy gunner 3s and 20% health adrenal reaction. I just ditched my shotgun build for heavy and rifle; 900 Dmg Dragon, and 350 Dmg gatling gun.
