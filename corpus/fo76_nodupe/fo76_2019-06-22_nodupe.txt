Do you know the plan for the X-01 Jetpack?
---
---
---
If you play on Xbox I‚Äôll give you a furious faster fire rate railway rifle I literally just found 10 mins ago for free
---
https://i.redd.it/jhvfm956wdx11.png check out this guide
---
I am!! üòÜ
---
Okay, she‚Äôs since picked up new technical data after the BoS quest line.
---
If the quest is already active, then it will not appear again when she picks up another Tech Data item.  
---

---
Check the quest tab and see if it is already there.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Tech data is not stackable, so she may as well sell 36 of the 37 to the closest bot vendor.  ( 1-2 caps each pending charisma)
---
I thought I did but I guess not and that would seem to be the problem. I crafted myself an ultracite torso and am now able to add the jetpack. Thank you
---
Can't believe I just found this. Upvoting for so many new players to find, hopefully.
---
Never heard of campfire tales giving possum badges before, and never seen it give any either. Best bet is to just do the possum challenges, easily done while out running around the world.
---
That‚Äôs weird though, because I‚Äôm able to drop off data, and I‚Äôve currently got 106 in my inventory...
---
Chatted you just in the middle of a mission
---
Glad you figure it out :)  The X-01 Jetpack plan is easy to get from the enclave vendor if you wanted to use that torso.
---
Thank you! üòÑ
---
People aren't even willing to take a joke when it comes to this game. DONT EVEN JOKE ABOUT GODD HOWARD AND HIS CREATIONS THEYRE PERFECT!
---
Yea when you pick one up from a world spawn it starts the quest.  Then you have to turn in one before doing it again.  If you pick up multiples they become useless.  Only pick up one, use it, repeat.  But it has to be a fresh spawn, buying from players or taking them from your stash doesn't work.
---
Because the whole playerbase is supposed to be edgelord raiders who will eat their fellow vault dwellers and put skulls everywhere. No one really wants to be a somewhat civilized boring cardboard person like all those people at Foundation right Bethesda?
---
I would, enclave vendor is the one inside the whitesprings bunker right? Where you do the nuke quest?
---
https://i.redd.it/jhvfm956wdx11.png try using this leveling guide. I recommend doing the event  Grafton day as the Grafton monster is only level 30 and is accompanied by level 5 super mutants so it won't be that hard.
---
You‚Äôll notice the stagger on something like a Gatling Laser. High fire rate means you get a lot of chances at that 3%. So line up a ghoul mob at the Golf Club and you‚Äôll notice them not reach you as quickly / as often.
---
20% is the cap on movement speed. So if you're running speed demon, you don't need any other movement speed mods.
---
Best thing about tse is unlimited ammo 2x. Each explosion procs a new 2x rails in each body the AOE affects. So within a close radius, a dead body might have 10+ rails even tho you never directly shot it.
---
So basically, dump current inventory and lobby hop for best results?
---
Yes it's the vendors near the workbench area, not in the military wing.
---
There's no need to nuke it if you just want to farm legendaries. Legendaries just have a random chance to appear regardless.
---
Thank you very much for the help
---
I think the ones the vendor sells cannot be unlocked by scrapping. You have to actually buy them.
---
I'll go see if i can start it
---
want an invite if it works?
---
Yup, pretty much.  Having extras in your inventory won't stop it from starting the quest when you find one, but no sense keeping them.
---
Your very welcome :)
---
Where does this event trigger at? I've never seen it before.
---
Buying from a player vendor caused the quest to start for me.
---
Sure ProzacPromises is my GT. Thx dude üëç
---
I don't even get that reach playing with a spear
---
oh boy...
---
This exact same thing keeps happening to me. I get the misc quest and an indicator to go into the tunnel but he says nothing and inside there's no caravan. All I can assume is that this means the quest is still on cooldown for the server. One time it took him a good 10-20 seconds before actually telling the other caravan members to head into the tunnel as well.
---
Yea I've never seen the event myself or know where even it would pop so guess I'll be grinding out the world challenges then.
---
Probably the same reason people can't read warnings and instructions.
---
Weed excitement is one of the best kinds of excitement so I know exactly what you‚Äôre feeling, big up
---
I think they and the other mega agile enemies are like that to encourage you to use VATS.
---
Nah if it was on cool down he‚Äôd say ‚Äúhold your horses‚Äù not ‚Äúperfect timing‚Äù
---
I do have some extractors blueprinted with power on top. It is about as fast as it gets.
---
You may have come into an area after a higher lvl. Enemies tend to spawn at lvls near the players except in the Cranberry Bog which is just pure Hell for everyone
---
The fixers seems to stack with speed demon (not sure if intentional or glitch). But every time I use one of mine, I move noticeably faster.
---
I actually understand technical limitations. I play with mods across multiple games. I just have no sympathy for companies that lie to their fanbase and make promises they can't keep. Interestingly enough, I'm 26 and used to play on Windows 98 as a kid. I'm a person that grew up with "If you say you're going to do something, I expect you to do it." I'm tired of the greed, avarice, and lies. Where's what I was told I was going to get?
---
You pissed em off
---
Lmk if u want an inv if we get it working
---
Many players sell the various serums for under 300 caps.
---
Fro example, I just bought the healing factor recipie - when I get back to my camp and do some crafting, I intend to sell the serum for 250 caps.
---
if you have the backpack plan from the airport, it maxes out at ... 30#, I think.  you have to to the tadpole quest for the standard backpack (60# at L50), then get 8 possum badges for the high capacity mod.
---
Stew is an aid item.  as long as you were in the event zone when it ended, you should have gotten several cans.
---
Depends which ally, the Raider Punk gives me a new quest once a day. I'm not sure about the others.
---
but you wont SEE anyones camp that way.. youll have to spend caps camp hopping for nothing then
---
It is, gameplay options.  It‚Äôs happened to me a few times.  I showed up to do my once a week pvp.  Unloaded on someone, nothing, we exchange awkward glances and emotes while I change the setting, then kill him.
---
Notice I said I only got one. It's such a small change that it's practically non-existent.
---
It has to be bugged then. Nothing I've tried can make it progress when it gets stuck like that.
---
Guess that‚Äôs what I get for making them sleep on the floor
---
I get this too sometimes. I dont know what triggers the bug or what fixes it either to be honest. Last few times its started ok for me though so all I can say is keep trying.
---
that's me. it's on.
---
Apparently lol. Maybe we should refer them to a proctologist and a mr. Handy farmer bot to remove the corn cobs from their ass.
---
Aww shit. Bummer. You'll get the plans soon enough. I'm sending good plan vibes to you!
---
Raider Punk has taken up residence at my camp over the last few weeks
---
On my way ü§òüèº
---
It's a shame too...the astronaut gives some really nice legendary rewards
---
Dont be a dick. Lol
---
No issues on PS4 today
---
Looking for love in all the wrong places....
---
?
---
Truths the truth.
---
Thanks.
---
Trying to run? Let me just stagger you so we can all catch up while you're waiting for the animation to finish.
---
2 way street
---
Looking for love in all the wrong faces....
---
QE 40 clip w/ auto receiver DESTROYS. Vats and high AP builds kills with this thing. I have QE 25% less VATs and can unload an entire clip into SBQ, with some sneak hits and 5-6 crits. Rinse and repeat.
---
You will sometimes get them for doing the repeatable daily scout quests - Operation Tidy at Kiddie Corner Cabins and the Stings and Things at Dolly Sods. I have no idea what the drop rate is. Sometimes I will get them for a few days in a row and other times none for days in a row.
---
Mods in an MMO?  Are there any other MMOs that have mods?  I think playing with mods *and* other people who would have conflicting/different mods would be a nightmare and cause more pain than joy.  
---
FO4 is still a great game if you want to get you mod on.
---
Helpful. Thanks pal üëç
---
And I'm not being a dick, just stating a simple fact to you.
---
I was about to say "looks like you could use some must-have mods" and i was prepared to dump my list of my favs. but then i saw your flair :v oof.
---
Lol obviously it was accident.
---
Camp Adams a bit to the west of the teapot
---
Hmm, I think maybe it's a specific window they give out the quest when you're not online? Else I have no clue...
---
You're quite welcome.
---
Or through you. And you'd better be quick turning around to get him before he does it again!
---
i dont really care.. i only go there to kill ghouls
---
An accident would of been trying the first time and seeing the warning pop up and goings oops. It stops being an accident when you tell the pop up yes I want to drop it anyways.
---
It should be free to fast travel to a player's CAMP.
---
Now i can see why youre part of the brotherhood
---
Yep. Logic triumphs over all. Ad victorium!
---
The real question.
---
Exactly.
---
That wasn't because of a funny reaction. Your body just saw an opportunity to take advantage of so it could eject the poisonous liquid you were about to swallow. ~~tea is icky~~
---
Dont forget Self Righteous
---
Awesome thank you, so If I have the less ap cost perk I don‚Äôt need the armour mod ?
---
That‚Äôs true, but raider punk doesn‚Äôt talk as much
---
ask the mods there..?
---
On the main servers if a high level is near you or was near you enemies will be high this happened to me A LOT in the beginning. 
---
I eat almost every food going and lots of med x physco helps. Trust me it does get better and leads to the shelf life of the game.
---
Also I found that the 2 hand weapons are OP great for killing hard to kill stuff.
---
You‚Äôll survive bro gl
---
Assuming bethesda doesn't mess up - could it work problem-free on console? I'd assume it's significantly harder to cheat there, even though the android part is still a liability.
---
This sounded very filthy.  Then I realized it was about 76.  Phew.
---
Happens to everyone, just poor programming on Bethesdas part.
---
Agreed the way coolers are set up don't make sense, no one can see inside it to see items thus shouldn't be counted part of camp.
---
Probably unrelated but someone built a sign in my camp saying to do so
---
because they are supposed to be used by soldiers in Power Armor, and they made the design with that in mind.
---
It‚Äôs the same problem with Assaultron beams. You‚Äôre crouching behind a car or standing on top of something and *ZAP* you‚Äôre DEAD
---
Unnecessarily funny
---
Yes but Bethesda still wants a cap sink so unlikely to be changed.
---
But why? You had to make someone angry
---
If you like it you should get one with the explosive legendary effect. makes ammo speed go from slow to hitscan. I have quad explosive less vats one set to auto, it so much fun.
---
I am someone...someone is me...why would someone do this?
---
It's a Zetan in some kind of hover suit.  
---
When you kill them the front panel opens and you can see their little feet inside the "chest."
---
Here‚Äôs the order of regions I went from, Forest, Ash Heap (shortly, don‚Äôt go to ash heap after forest), toxic valley (go after forest), Savage divide, mire and cranbog (mire and cranbog can be switched)
---
mhm, Purveyor Sale is scrip cost for all boxes is reduced by 25% or more. You can pick the type you want. Not this reduced cost but it can contain anything from all boxes thing.
---
This Mystery Pick thing they keep repeating now, I agree, it's totally not worth it.
---
Started quest markers that have been unfollowed through the pipboy will still appear on the map as blacked out markers, and will not appear on your compass unless reactivated. Essentially, it allows you to temporarily hide quest markers.
---
I never accept any unsolicited invites, like most people here.
---
The only time I get griefed is occasionally when I'm farming a workshop for something I need (acid, fusion cores, whatever), some lvl 400+ asshole will come in, kill me for the lulz and then just abandon the workshop. There are also the morons who come to my camp and try to initiate PVP, but I just server hop if they don't get bored when I ignore them.
---
Like, sorry you didn't get enough hugs as a kid, dude, go bother somebody else.
---
I have a jetpack and I still die way to often, some BS
---
I'm pretty sure they used hot glue.
---
Highest level will be 21,no matter what. I tamed a level 40 hulking megasloth, got it back to my c.a.m.p., server hopped/got offline, got back on and it was level 21. Happened several times, so apart from finding a legendary megasloth at a tameable location, you wont find anything better than a level 21. Hope that helps. Also cranberry bog in the parking lot spawns snallys yao gaui deathclaws ect. Right next to the cooking station I think
---
Lmao
---
I mostly put chems, stimpaks and food that I normally get for free in Vending Machine with 0 caps and put a note there "Take only what u need" 
---
I love seeing low levels choosing them carefully and some asked if they can take them all. And then there's high level players just swoop everything too. 
---
Greedy players are everywhere..
---
Fair enough üëç
---
Jesus christ that's a lot, but yeah the guy before was correct. Once you pick up technical data, the quest to submit it will begin. Any other data you pick up while the quest is active will essentially be nullified and made entirely useless. Even if you had a few hundred data in your inventory when submitting data, the quest will only consume 1 and reject the others for any future Forbidden Knowledge quests. Dropping and picking up data or buying it from other players will also be unusable.
---
Pfft uncultured raider, confusing confidence with self righteousness...go figure
---
Beckets doing the same thing to me even though I set him up with a glorious bar. He has everything he could want, but he doesn't give me quests anymore. I have given up and just let him wander around my camp now
---
Thanks y'all! Happy fathers day to all the other fathers! And to THE FATHER. SEAN.
---
No he just says the most inane things at random moments.
---
yeah, but those are not restricted - I got tons of 90% WR stuff in stash one on me with perks
---
This. Keep going there and lvl 62s jump out and Imma running but keep hitting walls...
---
Im on my main and probably only build lol but if you need help running shit I will be happy to kill stuff/ loot with you and gain xp especially if you are gonna be more or less focused when playing it. Lvl 125
---
Will add you soonüëç
---
The chances are grossly slim. Better for the quests than Campfire tales but still possible.
---
I have it but it has never worked for me. It is a cool idea.
---
Put the good stuff in a display case to save it. Otherwise its fuckedüòï
---
&gt; Highest level will be 21,no matter what.
---
Thanks, that's good to know. That parking lot is where I found my current deathclaw so I guess I'll just go back there to find a sloth. I'm fine without it being legendary, less chance someone will kill it for the loot.
---
Is there a source for this somewhere? I thought this only affected laser weapons.
---
I asked because I am from Southern WV and have only ever heard Hell-vetch-yah. Interesting to hear that their is variation even within the state.
---
The game had camps well before vendor shops at your camp...
---
I completely agree. If they wanna do it that way, they should at least have a method of getting different legendary modules or something
---
psn: Owl_No
---
How? PC?
---
Zealots FFR Gat Laser Primed. Works wonders as a Queen Killer. :)
---
Railway rifles fall under the rifleman perks since you can‚Äôt mod it to be automatic
---
Add me anytime with a message - pkunachan
---
All of what you wrote is why I hate encountering them in-game but upon reflection when I‚Äôm not playing the game I realize that I actually love the challenge they present. 
---
I‚Äôve spent up to an hour stalking single high level ghouls when they were too fast, too smart and too strong to fight directly. 
---
- Take a shot. 
---
- run like fuck once the doom music plays 
---
- hide.
---
- sneak back. 
---
- take another sho...OHGOD. HOWTHEFUCK. ITWASBEHINDMETHEWHOLETIME. 
---
- ghoul bitch slap. 
---
- die. (Again)
---
Handmade is rifleman when the semi auto mods are on it commando when its automatic. The RR is rifleman.
---
Well done playing decoy! I hope it fucked up their evening a bit at least, to have their camps all wrecked up while they were out being turd burglars.
---
Lol the hypocrisy of the Brotherhood, no one can have anything nice except us.
---
I destroyed her and now I have to hear Commander Daguerre go on about how I should not feel guilty about it every time I visit my camp.   Athena has not spawned for me since I killed her.
---
It used to be you could turn in 2 or 3 for more caps/xp. I haven't done it in awhile, but it maybe the same. Old tech data has been useless for a long time now.
---
Why full unyielding vs mixing some bolstering in?
---
Railway is either. You can mod it auto and it will fall under commando.
---
Same with the handmade.
---
it pops up at camp adams in the forest.  
---
are you on xbox?
---
But on the other hand, I got a random invite a week ago and was given 250 large handmade gifts which turns out to be a lot of cool stuff.
---
Nope ps4 :(
---
Disagree. I get your point but auction houses just mean inflated prices and people controlling the market. The reason shit sells is because comparing prices isn't worth the jump sometimes. Auction house mechanics typically just empower the same people that already have all the loot. This system helps the little guys. If you really want a specific item, use a discord or trade sub.
---
Happy Father‚Äôs Day to all the fallout lovers out there or otherwise
---
Used to have my camp there and loved it! That Yao Guai was great for the daily challenges...
---
Hmm weird. I've heard she shouldn't if you destroyed her so idk lol this game makes no sense lmao even the
---
This happened to me too! I was wtf just happened. But I honestly was happy just to be done with that part of the quest after about a million attempts.
---
ESO's is amazing. Played Classic WoW lately? 2 names own half of the auction house. Or everyone's shit is listed by "Banko1, Banko2, and Banko3." ESO Auction houses encourage joining guilds, allow variance in prices so you can actually find deals, and prevents a handful of people from completely controlling the market.
---
Yeah the last ones take a lot of scrapping. Intelligence increases your chances from what I've read, boosted it when scrapping.
---
The radium rifle was the crazy one, needed a lot of nuclear material.
---
I don't think the enclave would like that.
---
**MODUS**: No
---
at first it was punk not giving quests so i switched to grandpa and he gave me quests for a about a week. Then he stopped so is witched to the wandered. And she gave me 2 or 3 and now she's stopped.
---
‚ÄúRad city and I‚Äôm the fuckin mayor‚Äù spoken like a true wastelander lol. In all seriousness, I couldn‚Äôt agree more
---
She's a terminator
---
Just materials.  Msg me your psn.
---
They gave us some insight when fasnacht dropped like a sack of turds, they test in very limited numbers and cant simulate lag.
---
how they can't simulate the lag? I mean pretty sure every one of them have a pc/Xbox/ps4 at home at least one of those you know
---
B
---
Really, they could just weaken legendary effects/damage when engaged in PvP. Might be funky to code, but at least pve balance would be separate
---
Simply put your as safe as you can be in the game, the exploit you thinking about involves getting to the vendors within secs of spawning into a camp that glitched way over budget.
---
So unless your set up exactly right your safe from that one there's other but there's nothing to be done against those, it's just bugthesda crap engine.
---
Haha just doing our damndest to pronounce a Swedish name!
---
I'm currently doing a bos junkie heavy gunner, no mutations and it's pretty fun. If you set up your perks right you can still do a lot of damage and free up a lot of perks by not speccing into mutations. Recommend adrenaline and bloody mess for baseline damage increase.
---
If your other weapons are full auto then this one too, you don‚Äôt want to keep fumbling with perk cards.
---
I've had this on ps4 so I don't know if it'll work on pc. 
---
Log on to any other online game
---
Back out. 
---
You should be able to log on to 76 afterwards
---
Wait are you sure it wasnt the Elmer's glue that you'd use in elementary school?
---
yes but the premise here is..
---
&gt; I love seeing player camps but hate wasting time and caps jumping around. We need a Auction House!
---
kinda doesnt make sense..
---
What‚Äôs the max level you can craft it now?
---
Instigating Explosive Handmade on automatic is a true beast.
---
You need to put different perks on to get max armour upgrades
---
That‚Äôs just them using their own VATS
---
They also shouldn't be able to charge at you full speed and then roll through your body... I've never understood that. And yes, happens with me and using my JP.

---
Well, it is a Bethesda product after all. Good luck.
---
Which perks specially?
---
I am not fond of my Ultracite one I‚Äôve spent forever and a day working on. The only other one I have is my Excavator, so I‚Äôm gonna be following this thread for sure.
---
I knew ai was advancing but fuck
---
Still stuck at 40, I thought I'd be able to once I hit lvl 100 but here I am.
---
I may not be able to answer that sorry
---
Not a fan of settlers faction or not a fan of 76? Either or I'd understand.
---
I ran semi for ages but once I switched to automatic I never looked back.
---
That said Instigating only matters with a full health enemy, so after first shot it's kinda moot. It may benefit more from semi if the initial damage is higher with those respective perks.
---
I believe t51-b is better than xo1, but yea t51, xo1, and ultracite are the best
---
Try making the armour and changing the level I thought it was perks it's not, it's just level based
---
A lot of people have plans at camps
---
All depends on what you want. I have a set of everything, working on T65 now.
---
I explore in X01 with medic pump, have a second set with jet pack. I use extractor for certain quests where mining comes into play.
---
Is there a roof above? Sometimes things go flying up to the roof when you place them.
---
Well I'm lvl 107. What, do I have to be 200 or something?
---
???
---
It just won‚Äôt be on that server. It will still be there when you load into a server where your spot isn‚Äôt already taken
---
Should only be level 50 let me jump on the game and check out what I have on
---
Thanks!
---
No problem! :)
---
I wouldnt recommend accepting the stay option. Theres a chance it could scramble your displays and vendors. Best to find a new world.
---
Most of them drop from conquering workshop. if I knew you needed those plans would kept spare ones and given them free to you, if I find some ill let you know, hopefully you are on ps4
---
Why don‚Äôt you like your ultracite? I find it to be a pretty awesome unit.
---
Is she Catholic?
---
ESO's setup was a little odd and took some getting used to, but at least the Traders would be in one specific spot in each city and, if nothing else, you can pull up the trade site and get a list of everything being offered so you don't have to spend all day server hopping and fast traveling just to window shop.  
---
If I want an item in ESO, I know what city it's in, which vendor it's at and how much it costs.  If I want an item in FO76, I'm stuck server-hopping and stumbling around blindly, hoping I get lucky.
---
Thanks man, I‚Äôm actually on Xbox though
---
Settler vault 79, the mother loaded dies breaking the vault, she asked for last words. My chartar said we would honor her so, i did.
---
&gt; I am not sure if there are rules
---
rules are in the bar on the right...
---
I fully admit to being Power Armor dumb. I almost only wear it when in nuked areas. But the ultracite one doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything special for me. I should really do some research on all of them.
---
I also am starting to think I‚Äôm dumb when it comes to mods overall. I‚Äôve been relying only on plans. I‚Äôm level 150ish and probably am struggling due to my own naivety.
---
both
---
If you believe the DR numbers displayed in the pip boy, then pick the one that suits your fancy.  But, in the real world there is very little difference in the damage you take regardless of which set you wear.  They perform almost exactly the same.  Angry Turtle did a video about this.
---
I have yet to see any child other than RaRa
---
I‚Äôve seen her before too
---
There's been a few posts and yt vids analysing that subject. I think strangler heart is generally considered to be best overall bur each set is slightly different so depends on what you want or intend doing.
---
Keep your hands off my lead and steel!
---
Lol
---
Yes. Shame you can't tame a cat nad give her a new one
---
Bethesda name doesn‚Äôt even match I only changed after a few hours
---
SH imo the best if you consider the set bonus, even nerfed it's still a bonus none of the others have.
---
For DR ER RR it's the t65. It used to be x-01, t51 before the raids.
---
Far as useful, it's excavator. Ultracite has always been the freeloaders choice. T60 has the bos skins and cheap to repair. T45 and raiders kind of useless compared to excavator.
---
I‚Äôve lost my Unstoppables board game twice from my display case. I stopped using them. For some reason this was the only item I kept losing though.
---
Yea, although I think the one with the injured super mutant is sadder.... Just stick around and listen to his voicelines...
---
[removed]
---
Ok I'm level 87 with 12 intelligence and can craft level 50 X-01 power armour
---
Thank you. I hope everyone had a great day with family and friends. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ü§ô‚úåü§ò
---
that's a fallout 4 dlc.
---
If you post this on the specific market reddit and then give an idea of what kind of perks you would be interested in, it may help more.
---
I'd also like to wish all the Vault Dads a Happy Father's Day! Continue to prep the young ones for the inevitable future!
---
I've seen her a couple times at the road intersection south of Lewisburg
---
I‚Äôve gotten one from there. So I can confirm they do drop but I don‚Äôt know the rates. I‚Äôve done a bunch and that‚Äôs the only one I ever got.
---
For me it normally just had that option at level 55 or something. That is odd.
---
yes but trying to buy something from a vendor is different then trading items for another item. If I go somewhere to buy something with money that isn't the same as going somewhere and trying to trade and item I have for another item. Trading to me is one item for another item buying is when you go to a vendor that is why I wasn't sure about it
---
Check on top of Becketts bar. I've lost lights that ended up there. Had to put a table down to stand on to see up there.
---
Radshield does not suppress mutations.  It is superior to RAD-X in every way.  And farming the materials is easy if you hop servers, then use the chemist perk and super duper to get 3x more.  I always get about 40 per farming run (about 12-15 blooms).  That will last me more than a week.
---
I have one, switched back to regular instigating. The explosion gets everything around the target, becomes gimped. The semi, and auto depends on your other guns.
---
A YouTube video I watched recently said it was bugged. They said sometimes it starts and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. If it doesn‚Äôt you have to wait for cool down and try again.
---
right now there is a bug with vendors if you choose the stay option.  sometimes the game will randomly put items into your vendor at default prices.  so that Anti-Armor, Exploding, Faster Firing Minigun that you keep hidden will be sold really cheap.
---
If only it worked on consoles
---
I have mine setup like that. It's emergency protocols and jetpack, but they took out the only way to do it.
---
Now you're stuck with only one chest mod.
---
T-51b is only better than X-01 for the ballistic damage. X-01 is better for rads. SH and T-65 are both better if you have the gold to learn the plans.
---
Ah ok.
---
I definitely did not miss that boat.. LOL.  I think I got about 2k acid from parades.  I just don't want to use all of my acid making fuel.  I've been farming the Hemlock Holes and H1-Zwhatever acid farm in the south on my private server, plus going to tanagra town often.  I just don't think constant flamer use is sustainable by farming alone.
---
thank you for the information I tried the marketplace reddit for fallout 76 but I guess there is certain ways to do it. I am not dumb but I do have a hard time understanding somethings, so after trying to post twice on there and getting my stuff deleted instantly I figured I would give it a go on here.
---
I'm not really a VATS user, but it was the only way they could incorporate the turn-based elements of combat into FO3 onwards, and to that end I suppose it works; you can aim for specific body parts to produce an effect and there's a percentage chance of hitting. There was literally no way for it to be brought into FO76 though, and I think the compromise is pretty good for those who DO like to use it, all things considered.
---
That‚Äôs really gonna be up to play style. I prefer using semi auto in my games, others prefer pray and spray. But for an instigating, you‚Äôd be better off not having explosive.
---
If this happens to anyone on PC, hit me up, j0hnicus, and I'll repair it.
---
with instigating and automatic.  you can get the 2x damage for the first 2-3 shots.  on semi-auto you only only get the first shot bonus.
---
I don't want to forfeit my awesome camp though!
---
Beckett &amp; Raider Punk both have stopped giving quests. Haven't tried anyone else yet.
---
1. Wheel of Time is awesome
---
2. If you're a low level, they're probably just trying to be nice.
---
No u
---
Thank you!!
---
A bit of both really. A lot of the big guys/girls like to help out the smaller guys/girls.
---
Usually but not always, it's players that habe been helped previously. If you see it happen, throw up a heart or at least a thumbs up.
---
Maybe when you can, do the same for another bunch of players. There is no real Win the game in FO76 and whatever helps through the grind for others and yourself makes it all the more fun.
---
I sometimes do this (or at least buy something I don't need)  if their camp is particularly neat looking. Just a way to say "your camp is awesome, have some caps".
---
Thank you this is all good information!!
---
I've tried this a few times since the game launched and, well, it doesn't really work. As others have mentioned, there's always 'that player' who'll just come along and hoover everything up while they waddle around the map overencumbered.
---
Can confirm üëçEspecially if Primed üòÅ
---
The tent gets taken away too.
---
That's reasonable. Their release was a failure. I had to wait, and then bought a super cheap copy.
---
RIP in pieces
---
You're fine homie.
---
Why would you be banned? It was probably a reward of some sort from something being completed possibly or just some bug.
---
"Finally, someone with the guts to help."
---
Fuck
---
Off
---
Ward
---
OK so am I, but I don't understand why Unyielding should be nerfed or how, only 2 point per special or different specials? I doubt this will happen anyway but just saying nerf is not descriptive.
---
Nothing like looking up a bug and finding this month old comment ...
---
I mean it‚Äôs really just going around the mire, it‚Äôll trigger if you can do it that day. Otherwise just gotta wait and check back
---
Yeah hopefully I dropped it right away so hopefully I don't
---
My guy, listen to yourself.
---
It's a pipe pistol.
---
You're fine.
---
Ik but this one is a kid tho. Like... cmon
---
 No
---
Really? Huh
---
I'm pretty sure it did. They left the server.
---
Yea. That would be really wholesome
---
Yeah you are right I just get worried about stupid things.
---
Iirc T-51B has cheapest repair, which is something to consider
---
Check by the tower and railroads apparently is what people are saying
---
Its probably from Mr. Prize bot. My guess is he was approaching you just as you fast travelled. You got the reward without hearing the speech. Happens to me all the time. Don't worry...you're fune.
---
Nope. It will still trigger and do the sound, but will not create a second item.
---
The one in the mire always spawns 2, the others shouldn‚Äôt though iirc.
---
Depends.
---
Maybe
---
Youd have to build around a pre-existing box to make this work, as you cant build your own. Otherwise, yeah, it should. I've heard of other people doing this sort of thing.
---
I thought so too.. Solo'd it last night and only 1.
---
They probably would just like to kill them
---
I‚Äôve done the mire one many times. This was the first I‚Äôve seen two.
---
fuck em I say.. game is WAY easy now...
---
that said.. I still drop garbage I dont want at the overseers camp.. diluted chems, ammos and nades I dont use, plans I already know.. that sort of thing..
---
there is so much loot and gear between 76 and wayward I dont feel bad for them one bit...
---
They could have just used the bow system from Skyrim .. but noo they had to go and recreate the wheel, only the fuckers forgot what a wheel looks like and created a box instead.
---
A good rule of thumb is to not extend yourself into areas where quests locations aren't being flagged up to you.
---
Follow the main quest until it gets too hard, then start levelling in the areas in which you've naturally found locations. Then go back to the main quest, proceed further, pause and so on and so forth.
---
I mean, it is tempting to head off into the deepest darkest reaches of the map. I did that when I was something like level 10 and spent about half an hour trying to kill a bear with a hunting rifle so just gave up and stuck to where it seemed natural for me to be.
---
I'd say there was a good thousand Dracula cutouts. Not exaggerating.
---
Yeah, basically automation for 76
---
Cause it seems that when I wear my unyielding I get caught while sneaking a lot more even though I have all of my sneak perks active. Whereas if I wear my weightless it seems that I never get caught while sneaking ever. So thats why i was just curious to see what other people thought.
---
Players have asked for something like this a lot. 
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hdatig/would_this_work_id_like_to_set_up_boxes_with_a/
---
What are you, like thirty at most? Your balls have just recently dropped in an adults eyes. You're no better than someone in their mid 20's, little man. You aint going to be considered a man by an actual adult until you hit your mid 30's. What kind of loser kids did this country raise the last 3 decades?
---
really? i find ESOs worse than Fo76, i'll list the issues i have with it
---
1. only the richest guilds have guild traders in high traffic locations
---
2. these rich guilds often require a membership fee and you must sell a certain amount per week / month or you get kicked out
---
3. the guild traders are *all over the place*. the map isn't really that small like fo76 and there are a lot of different zones that each require a loading screen and a bit of running to reach]
---
4. the prices are often far too high because they have little competition to worry about, people would rather pay more to not have to travel to 20 different zones only to find that none of the others actually have the item they want (which tells you a lot about how tedious it is) 
---
5. you cannot sell from a vendor unless you are currently in a guild that has a vendor (see point 2) so you are limited to direct trading, which is better (less bugs) than direct trading in fo76 but no less tedious
---
6. i tried those trade sites, i checked it and then when i got to the location it specified, the item wasn't there. this was not a one off problem either, it happened with every single item i looked for, with the exception of one, which was at a much higher price than the trade site said it was.
---
7. there are *much, much* more items in ESO than fo76 and the zone hopping in ESO is actually slower than server hopping in fo76 because the loading screens are longer
---
in this day and age it is just inexcusable for an mmo like ESO to not have an auction house
---
Yea thats true i haven't had the rng to roll a good bolstering piece yet on this character.
---
It was right next to my camp at New Grad. I couldn't miss it. It was just there unclaimed.
---
My caps are always almost maxed so I can buy more legendaries I don‚Äôt need or go help low levels get caps.  I remember struggling to get caps for a long time so I try to jump around the forest redistributing my wealth.
---
It probably depends on what specific weapon it is, like a bloodied Gauss minigun is better than a hunter rifle. An explosive assault rifle however would be better than a standard Gatling gun.
---
It puts the diamond in the compass bar thing at the bottom of the screen. It‚Äôs kind of misleading but it works. 
---
I ended up going back to the long scope because I don‚Äôt like the color distortion.
---
Stings and Things delivers a possum badge about one in ten.
---
I just collect bug parts as I go, and just hop over there every day.
---
No, you have to kill the SBQ  hundreds even thousands of times to get all the plans for the Ultracite PA;)
---
I love the direction this thread is going please dont stop
---
Your welcome
---
Alas.  I"ll keep my hopes up, i suppose.
---
anxiety is real yo
---
bless
---
Well I have 15 intelligence lol, I got the plans for it from the whitesprings bunker, maybe the highest prototype X01 you can craft is lvl 40 and you have to get some other plans for it.
---
You need to use it in VATS my dude. I've got a TSE and both shots hit all the time!
---
If you're on Xbox I'll craft you the level 50 version if you have the materials
---
i replied to the other guy that commented, i think it sufficiently explains the problems i have with ESO, but i will just add here that most of the guilds in high traffic locations require a membership fee as well as requiring you to sell a certain amount per week / month. i can only speak for my own experiences and those i have seen shared on forums, but everyone who just wants to buy and sell casually doesn't like the guild trader system and the only people who do like it are those that make huge amounts of money from it (rich guild leaders and high volume sellers), essentially they just like the monopoly they have over the market and resist any suggestions that would revoke that monopoly. i've also never seen any deals in guild traders, they all seem to be overpriced, the only deals i've found have been from people who advertise trades in discords / somewhere else. a handful of people *do* control the market in ESO because the only way to sell is to join their guilds and for that 'privilege' you must pay them and meet a sell quota, so your prices must reflect this if you want to profit, which means that the prices are always higher than they should be.
---
Yes Pip boy Chat system please.
---
Seriously tho, dont get raiders and fiends mixed up. We might be a little more violent than settlers, but we are gonna survive by any means.
---
Ha!!!  Those bloatflies...oh those bloatflies.
---
Put them in a display case to assert dominance.
---
The Brotherhood is some hoes tho, we can barely have radios but these dickheads have the prydwyn and air conditioned bunkers.
---
They go into frog jars you can place in your camp home and they used to chirp like a frog but I haven't heard mine say a thing in a while.
---
I gotta wear my hazmat suit cuz this is rad! Thanks!
---
they suffer from the same problem that rdr 2 cosmetics do, they never seem to add anything that looks like it actually fits in the game or if they do there is always some problem. but here, have this PA american flag paint or liberty prime skin, 40 k PA skin or a giant mascot head
---
I have actually been crafting lvl 10 leather armor with pocketed and studded (full set) as well as a upgraded pipe piston lvl 10 and have been posting these in my vending machines for free (intended for low level characters since usually it would be level 10s that would be passing by where my CAMP is located). I have done this three times and all three times - it was a lvl 100+ character that bought them all. I have no idea what they would want them for, the tiny bit of scrap? 
---
Anyways, I know you mean well by doing what you want to do - prepare yourself for jerks so that you do not get disappointed.
---
I don't right now, but get it. Looks great. Best pack skin in the game IMO.
---
Which skin was he using?
---
I have no other commentary to make, just curious about people's cosmetic choices.
---
Kinda had this in reverse last night. Came back to my camp and a PVP notification popped up. I hadn't shot anyone, so I got curious and checked. Sure enough: My camp has a walled off indoor adhesive-garden with a locked door relatively close to the entrance of the unlocked main room. Above the door of the garden area are letters spelling out "NOPE". The door was wide open. It is within the firing arcs of several of my turrets, so it's clear that the player who picked that lock immediately got a face full of high velocity lead.
---
I quickly located him on a cliff at a distance, from which he was taking potshots from a sniper rifle at my camp.
---
I still was in my Chinese Stealth suit (so was he as I quickly noticed), so I made a beeline through the woods, snuck up from behind and at point blank range unloaded a clip from my bloodied Fixer into his back. 
---
My first PVP kill in FO76. Wouldn't mind if it stays the last.
---
Alright I'll start doing the scout missions each day with my dailies.
---
Who wants ultracite armor, though
---
No it's not.
---
I've had my Brotherhood of Steel build for nearly 2 years with no issues at all. Mutations would actually make it lore breaking/not immersive for those of us who want to stay true to how the Brotherhood operates.
---
Granted I'm 'average'/pretty mediocre when it comes to PvP but i really don't see that as an essential part of a Brotherhood build.
---
It's all in the right perks/playstyle.
---
 it's probably a glitch and you should just be able to server hop to fix it or unequip the mission and re-equipt it
---
Happy father's day to all.
---
Were ghouls perception lowered with Wastelanders? I‚Äôll try going to white springs guns blazing and like 90% of them stay asleep now and don‚Äôt run outside.
---
Ghouls being less rotted and a bit more agile in the relatively new Appalachian wasteland makes a bit of sense, but the absolute cocaine-panther level speed and strength of some ghouls makes zero effing sense, even less so in FO4. Like, I‚Äôve seen ghouls get shot dead in the chest by several .308 rounds, then they just stumble a bit and immediately fuck up some dude in full metal armor by wiggling their skeleton hands in their direction.
---
Best thing I can recommend is play another game and wait for the One Appalachia update so that you'll no longer have to worry about high level enemies spawning from higher players. Otherwise you'll have to grind in lower level areas.
---
I haven't tried unequipping it, I'll give that a try and keep hopping, thanks for the advice
---
It is supposed to snow up over the targets, unless it was removed. It doesn't show up while looking through the scope though. They removed that for some dumb reason.
---
Us?
---
No!
---
gun shouldnt matter much if the build around it is properly constructed.. you can shred mobs with anything
---
...
---
...I'm totally trying this next time, though it'll need some coordination. If anyone on PC fancies trying it sometime then let me know.
---
I guess this is why no one accepts my team invites when I find a wendigo colossus or need help with riding shotgun :(
---
If you're looking for a Roleplay group or fellow Roleplayers in general: r/fo76Roleplay is definitely the right place to look.
---
Context?
---
They don‚Äôt ban people who blatantly hack in NW so you should be fine...
---
I set up my camp near overseer camp &amp; wayward. All ammo is 1c, useful plans are dirt cheap, some low level armor &amp; underarmor for a fraction of what it's worth.
---
Still the modded underarmor (raider ua) is constantly purchased by higher level players, often 50+. I can't keep it stocked since it takes balistic fibre to craft. 
---
My solution would be a way to set up a vending machine where i can set a max level for the customers. I wish i could block anyone above level 15 from using that specific vendor.
---
Who wants PA;)
---
Ty
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt hand out bans without solid reasoning. Having hundreds of thousands or millions of certain items, or multiples of the same weapon that you couldn‚Äôt possibly have gotten by grinding the game will catch the attention of the bots that scour the game files. Honestly, you could have 50k of each junk item in your Fallout 1st scrap box and 10 of each god roll legendary weapon and armor piece spread out over 5 characters and you would generate zero interest from them.
---
I Like Hunting/Sniper Rifles, Levers and Handmades..
---
It would take 20 years to get anything then. Modders don't have deadlines it have to sorry about performance issues outside if their own system.
---
The blacked out one??
---
Just wish Papa Todd would lay off of the spankings.
---
It didn‚Äôt really matter to me personally but yes I‚Äôve played with people pre wastelanders who preferred 76 for that reason, it was easier for them to role play
---
everyone shit all over their "astronaut lady is still bugged" thread Im guessing...
---
His last post
---
The recon scope has never worked for me in 76. 4, sure, but not this game. The only real benefit I can see for the recon is on consoles so you still get the full screen of you want to deal with the color being weird.
---
T-65
---
Yes it‚Äôs totally separate is my understanding.
---
Do you have all the items you need to craft it? If the Level 50 option is there but it‚Äôs shaded out, that means the you CAN craft it you just don‚Äôt have enough of one or more junk items. Level 40 will show up because it takes less junk to craft.
---
Still got it?
---
Have you completed her key fragment questline?
---
Yeah before Wastelanders dropped
---
Did you steal the toy?
---
Bummer. Thanks for confirming. Will my X01 mods work on the T65? Or will I have to buy the jetpack as well?
---
Kind of going to slide the question here, is crafting prototype X01 the same as the regular one? Are there any other plans for it?
---
Basically this. Bethesda is just as good at handing out bans in 76 as Valve is in TF2
---
Weighted instead of Brawling since game have been released, almost makes me cry, Brawling is much, much better mode when going for unarmed.
---
It says prototype until you put a different paint job in it. All XO1 is the same. Mod plans are available in the maintenance wing vendor of the enclave.
---
Hopped at least 6 times now with the same results
---
‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è
---
No
---
You have to buy the T65 mods. Mods are armor specific.
---
No, but it can under certain circumstances make you a general in the Enclave.
---
Tyvm I hope it comes in handy
---
Tht sounds dope
---
Yeah it doesn't even show up the level 50 option, I thought it will once I hit lvl 100- and I did, but the lvl 40 is still all I have.
---
Kinda confused by this question. If you have auto receiver on it, it‚Äôs commando. If you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs rifleman.
---
Why announce your departure ? Just leave if you want too.
---
You definitely can mod railway to me automatic. The recoil is ridiculous but it‚Äôs possible.
---
It gets really sad if you do
---
I can‚Äôt stand it anymore. Even when doing hard playthroughs I‚Äôll console command my jump height because it feels so wrong without it.
---
Bro I‚Äôve lost many items over time. There is no use complaining. They won‚Äôt help ya. I once lost every weapon on my mule. All my armors and aid items were still there just zero weapons. That was back in July last year with the only response from Bethesda was ‚Äúwe cannot replace lost items‚Äù
---
When I feel like running vats commando, my BE Railway is my go to. It smacks so hard.
---
Btw I still play lol.
---
Got pianos from claiming Grafton steel the other day.
---
So are you saying I should start the transition to Unyielding and Bloodied?
---
I am also curious about this because I managed to get a hold of a full set of Unyielding urban scout armor and urban scout mask recently, when those legendary perk cards drop for the complete light medium or heavy sets of Armor I wanna put points into the one that effects my UNY Scout Armor.
---
If I‚Äôm at max caps, and I know I can still sell another 1,400 caps worth of items to the vendor, I usually hit up random camps and buy their stuff like you mentioned above. Ammo or first aid. And I drop it right there and then. I only do it when the owner is there, they usually give me a thumbs up for buying stuff. Then I drop it all on the ground, they give me the confused emote, I mothman dance and disappear into the night.
---
Yea that's proof enough for me man.
---
Been having issue after issue recently and I do love the game, but I'm out aha. Why grind for 600 hours, farm every single spot, die a billion times for items that just poof and disappear. Big ol fuck that aha
---
So THAT‚ÄôS what those diamonds were!
---
Hold up.was this just random or is this some trickery? None the less it looks cool
---
That‚Äôs definitely odd. How long have you known the plans? It could simply be a glitch and closing app and logging back in might reset it.
---
Free states, responders, and brotherhood all have vendor bots in the mall.
---
Tbh I can‚Äôt find another game like it. So I still play. Close to 2400hrs. Just started giving away all my legendaries because I don‚Äôt want to hoard them anymore.
---
I run the crits card instead. But this is good. I don't think ppl understand food stacking. Yeah my tummy full but all the extra stacks. I eat almost all scorched  beast parts, but relish and berry mentats got me to were I'm at
---
I wonder if people were confused with quest markers. I cane in new with wastelanders so this is the only way I‚Äôve known it in this game.
---
Sadly no... but I can confirm eating several legendary ghouls in a row does NOT make you legendary either unfortunately.
---
I set up by wayward and run a discount store for ammo (i run melee anyway so...) I like to stop low level players offer them plans or weapons that i plan to sell or scrap anyway and let them know " hunters lodge is always open"
---
Can you explain how you came to that conclusion? Or maybe more detail on what you mean? Cos i never inferred to nor mentioned any specific legendary effects.
---
I run all the cards too. And in a big fight I stack the overdrive and psychotats with small guns bobble and the guns and ammo magazine if needed. I am just always curious about other stuff
---
The app barely works for 4
---
I have a free vendor for low levels, basic stuff like .38 ammo 10 mm ammo, food etc...
---
I also have a punji trap hidden in front of it with about 95 punji boards. When I find high levels looting it I activate the trap and kill them, I don't get my gear back but they don't come back.
---
Will do!
---
What he said. Especially with shotgunner and demolition expert perk cards equipped.
---
Ah I actually got that exact shielded lining plan you were talking about from queen of the hunt recently, after 1500 hours of playing it was weird to get a plan reward that I didn't know.
---
Well if I have full buttressed and full vanguard it seems like I would be better served with something a different effect.
---
Okay? Have fun standing around watching people fail events instead of joining in and maybe helping. Bye.
---
I just crashed out as soon as I started talking to Lou, and now I'm afraid of logging back in, on XB1
---
I've done it literally hundreds of times. I don't even bother with suitcases, I just drop everything in a loot bag and I have never once lost anything... As long as you get back to the Private World within 5 minutes, you're good.
---
Yes to all 3
---
Mounted firefly. I agree it looks very cool though!
---
They're all kinda shite tbh... Power Armor easily gets outclassed by legendary armor, it seriously needs a buff.
---
Illiterate man boy
---
Dude chill I don't even understand why you're worried
---
Psn snow-ninja
---
Thanks for the warning!
---
Well unless you are going specifically for a sneak bonus from Shadowed, Buttressed is the best - no contest. Armor mods aren't in question, because "diminishing returns" means that you get a *decreased* benefit, but a benefit nonetheless.
---
The same goes for Vanguard, only this differs because you would gain a lot more benefit from other legendary effects than you would from Vanguard/Bolstering.
---
If you do hit a tamable creature encounter the creature that appears is random based on the location.  For instance you won't find a mirelurk king in the forest.  Personally myself and another person have found mega sloths in the parking lot of cranberry glad.  It's a good location because the spawn location is only a few steps from the fast travel spawn area.
---
Oh shit my man, "rad city and I'm the fucking mayor" got me. Thank you for that!
---
I‚Äôve been trying to find a good flamer to use forever now. Would love to buy one from someone, but no camps have them.
---
Wait a second... A female!
---
I say T-65.   Not just for the damage resistance but the mods  for T-65 are easier to come by. The strangler heart requires Ultracite power armor mods.  Ultracite calibrated shocks are a ridiculously rare drop from the queen.   I have played since beta and killed hundreds of queens and they never dropped for me.   I have a lot of people on my friends list that I have played with and not one of them has ever gotten the mod either.   I had to find someone on Reddit to craft them for me.  That is insane.  Yes I know trade is meant  to be part of the game but dammit they shouldn't be so rare that not a single person you play with has gotten them.
---
"I have literally watched people fail the enlightenment quest and even feed the people." Copy pasted from your post.
---
Or a male cosplayer
---
My stealth build has been looking for a flamer for a while now...
---
Tell your friend he needs to learn how to read.
---
Yep, just not primed automatic:( Bethesda please fix it!
---
I found all the allys with this simple method, execute all NPCs on site and if it's head doesn't pop off then it must be of some importance so I'll then talk to it.
---
June 30th
---
Hi.
---
Yes but in my case i have them all,calibrated shocks.emergency protocols,jetpack and the rest, my main is 414 level and i was in a group that was doing multiple sbq's each day for a while.
---
*Would‚Äôve or would have! English is only my 2nd language and even I know better. Sorry not sorry.
---
Just make the game stable and not loose your hard earned inventory.
---
Probably a MEME. I found one where it was all gas signage for everything. And one vendor(empty) in the middle of it all.
---
I hated not being able to carry my power armor with me in my inventory...
---
It reminds me of how monsters work in classic Doom. When you try to cross paths with them from above it doesn't allow you lol.
---
Ofc that has to do with limitations of the past &amp; in Fallout 76 you can jump over them sometimes.
---
You din't understand why people say there are diminishing returns? Well I'll tell you.  
---
Because numerically and factually, there is definitely and undoubtedly diminishing returns on DR/ER in regards to damage reduction.
---
So yeah.. people say it because it is 100% true and accurate. Seems like a pretty good reason to me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Today I was at a train station trying to sell some stuff and some doofus kept smacking me with a melee weapon while I was trading with the vendor bot. Like, dude, I already have lag and slowdown, I don't need my screen to shake in this trade menu every time you take a whack at me. And this person did it for way longer than you think it would take to get bored and leave.
---
Google image search, saw a pic a couple rows down, backpack has a big red bomb on it
---
No it's not on the list of tamable creatures.
---
I do believe it‚Äôs chewing gum or a glue stick.
---
Welcome to Ghoul Burger, home of the Ghoul Burger, can I take your order?
---
How about you guys played 76 without legendaries and mutations I have one char that I do that with just for the feels he s no build just a regular guy in the wasteland it‚Äôs a lot of fun
---
i go hilariously slow when transferring anything over. good on you for noticing!
---
Yea I played survival mode and I forget how big the punishment dying gives you. 
---
I didn‚Äôt save the game for hours. Died in the glowing sea, wake up Preston thanking me for bringing them to sanctuary.
---

Well then my cursory Google search failed me! I could swear I could hear a hint of Jake the Dog in Biv's voice, but I guess not. 
---
It's still definitely Michaela Dietz as Brenda, though! IMDb confirmed that one.
---
If Regs had a return/refund policy - I would give back to plans for Strangler and get T-65.
---
Same. I made it all of three days before making a conscious decision to pretend FO4 never existed
---
they plan on adding enemy scaling later when and how well it will be is a whole other matter
---
That's the kind of person I drop a roll of toilet paper and raw fertilizer for in front of their vending machines.
---
Maybe using the queen of the hunt quest, then, don‚Äôt take any samples from the cryptid and server hop till you find a megasloth
---
I got a 3* Exterminators Gatling Laser with reduced weight 6 months ago and keep going back to it despite getting other ‚Äúbetter‚Äù weapons. It‚Äôs easy to carry and the ammo is ‚Äúfree‚Äù. What‚Äôs not to love?

Lick their backs.

Sorry to hear this. Scumbags like this should rot. If your on ps4, i can give you the resources to repair for free, no team invites required

---
Do you have stored items and/or blueprinted items?
---
Instead of maxing out 1 of the heavy gunner cards. Do all three with just 1 point.
---
So the usual standard then?
---
I usually jump up and down on the bag
---
The guilds can hardly have a monopoly, though. You can only bid on so many traders per week, and you can be outbid by other guilds. The meet and sell quota forces people to have reasonable prices and not hold down vendors to lock others out... it does all of the things I was describing.
---
Remember when the game launched and 85% of the base tped as a Raider? Not much has changed. 85% of the base are still shitty people, there's just finally enough non broken content to distract them.
---
You clearly haven't played the game much.
---
Id also probably get rid of sturdy frame and white knight. Also you could drop down those endurance prks and give yourself more points to spend elsewhere
---
If you get really lucky you can get 3 spawn, 1 is a random event that splits left from the path and then 2 at the house. 
---
Only happened to experience this chance once.
---
I disconnected on PS4 a few times today as well.
---
I‚Äôm down
---
How do u get max caps? What‚Äôs your strat
---
Whena the last time you built anything /added to your camp and do you have the contemporary floors? One of the floors used to cost half the budget so Bethesda fixed it to be in align with other floors an that caused the budget to go over budget. You have to rebuild your camp to fix it or try an remove a lot of stuff. If it doesn't go down just remake it.
---
Same problem, but did not finish prior quest
---
Pretty sure that the point of one wasteland will be to rectify this somewhat. But tbh would the game be fun if you were an impenetrable god?
---
I do remember the griefers. I still disagree. Me disagreeing also has nothing to do with how long I have played. But keep reaching. Good day.
---
Appreciate the feedback, I'm probably going to submit a ticket and can update here when I hear back
---
That's a long slog. I've only just begun.
---
Did you get the mods for the T65? Wondering if any other PA mods work with the T65
---
How so? It's a dungeon and you can clear it once for the quest, and farm the ghouls any subsequent time your wish
---
They've acknowledged it as a bug and have said they will work on a fix but they've said that about many things before and yet we are still waiting on them.
---
Yes I do that often but for some reason it says inaccessible today
---
I don‚Äôt want to be an impenetrable god, trust me. 
---
I just think there are quite a few enemies that are disproportionately damaging to players who have leveled up significantly and have acquired some reasonable perks.
---
I see you have 1 point into Stabilized, which requires Power Armor, which means you have a lot of perk cards that are useless.
---
Here is my build. It's probably not the most optimized but it get's the job done.
---

---
It is it's own type of armor...but cards are separated by regular armor and power armor. You have to buy the mods from MODUS to upgrade scout armor...and from vault 79 (Regs) for solar and thorn plans
---
That just means it didnt load properly in your server. Server hop and itll fix.
---
Awesome, thank you!  Was thinking the same, is the percentage bonus higher with the three 1 point cards instead of a maxed one too?
---
Are you sure you are ready for reddit? It is about discussion, not about telling others to drag their face around. If you are not interested, do not waste others time.
---
Yes, I had to purchase the Jetpack mod and the Calibrated Shocks mod also. The Helmet has all of the mods already unlocked which I found both very odd and very pleasing at the same time. I didn't bother with arm mods because they are all useless.
---
One gun army!  I haven't got that one yet!  Thank you, I might have to do some events to get that and move some points around!
---
How do you even get caps, between fallout 4 and 76 the ruined the economy by making almost everything worthless so my strat of selling crap guns doesnt work as well anymore and all the caps i've made in 76 are just windfallen ones i've picked up through out my playtime
---
Feel like it was something they did intentionally. Lol this game worked better day one than it does now.
---
Yes. If you do 1 point in each thats 30%.for 1 card maxed out its only 20%
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f344e88&amp;d=sq2st0s22s32sr2s01lt2ls2l71a72a04cr0cu2ei2pe2id2ip2ic4ih2e60&amp;m=c29
---
Made one
---
Go for looks, the T65 is technically the best imo, but T51, T60, Ultracite and SH are all fine. Just pick whichever you like the look of and whichever you can get the mods you need easiest.
---
Is this really the way it works? I have my doubts.
---
During fasnacht (I was level 30-40 at the time) I was getting broadsiders and gatling plasmas etc, and I didn't know the plans for any of them.
---
Besides, there's a bunch of junk in the loot tables, regardless of plans. Stuff like tire irons, wrenches, walking canes, pipe pistols, etc. It's still going to be a crapshoot.
---
You're welcome.
---
Ye but my chances are way higher
---
Awesome, now I'm kinda bummed I maxed out one!
---
Whoa, didn't know about Adrenaline, thank you!
---
Dont worry, youll get more man
---
They are just really bad at running things. It's sad that people are better at making huge mods by themselves than a company with way more resources
---
Hop servers
---
Isn't it so, that you can get legendary Fixers without learning the plan, and any other weapon too, except Wastelanders' ones?
---
Ya but there is a lower chance too
---
Awesome. Thanks for the tip. Definitely gonna check this out.
---
Nuking won't make a difference and is more used to farm flux and flux mats at WS. In fact before I nuke WS, I make a run through it to see if there are any legendary enemies. If there isn't there's a good chance you won't get them when you nuke it. I then log off, join a public world and then sign off and go back to private. Doing this will reset your private world and you can then make another run through WS and see if it is spawning more legendaries.
---
There‚Äôs an inside the vault from a month or two ago (or maybe it was a dev interview) where they said they want to increase budget but it‚Äôs difficult to maintain server performance. They also said there were camp-related things that were coming.
---
If you only know the fixer plan than most likely, but you can only get fixers via the purveyor.
---
I have full X01 power armor and a level 40 assaultron can one shot me if I don‚Äôt get behind cover
---
I feel sheepish....I didnt read "legendary card"...
---
I‚Äôm wondering if they have a high employee turnover rate or something so maybe the employees working on the game now are unfamiliar with the coding idk lol.
---
Stupid mole rat!
---
Yeah it's annoying af.
---
Look at the road west of Summerville, near the bridge to the north. There are two different flat spots. Hopefully one of them is big enough to suit you.
---
It is considered medium armor. https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Urban_scout_armor
---
Really flat spot to the south east of the freak show. Just off the road, close to defiance as well. Plus lucky hole just a walk away.
---
what effects does it have? would you trade it if youre on xbox? :D
---
They are just being idiots about when they update the game. They test a couple things revolving around the update but not everything. They need a sh*t ton of game testers to make sure the new update doesn't ruin other game content
---
I just gave a new level 9 a level 10 brotherhood sniper and an exploding bow. Then asked them for a group invite and build a circus cage, seedy shed, fusion power, and some high teir defense.
---
Had to google "becomes gimped" (English is not my first language). 
---
Explosion would be a good thing then, right? Well one problem I have is with close quarters as the explosion damages me too, but at level 140 it is not that much of a problem. Still not ideal against ghoul sprinters.
---
T-65 has better all around stats where Strangler heart has higher rad resistance
---
And sentry bots
---
Wait! how many motherloads are in  VW? 
---
1 on the event of breach and pull the stuff of the little boxes
---
1 on the &gt;!chinese base in whitespring.!&lt;
---
and this of vault 79
---
or is the Same Lore  wise and game wise work different...??
---
Damn I‚Äôm not on rn just made a new character and boy even basic building plans would‚Äôve been a steal wnat to build new base but grinding for rare plans is a pain
---
Good point. But I noticed that the difference between auto and semi-auto is not that high per shot (on handmade at leasts) and with the higher fire rate it quickly adds up.
---
As it's been said before, they are assault troops of the former army and are meant to be THAT nasty. As well as Gutsies.
---
Plz do actually, I love building myself but always enjoy seeing other people‚Äôs builds and ideas
---
But u learned ur lesson. Actually there is not that big deal . U can make it better and find new place. Sad I play PC version and I cant give u some scrap materials to rebuild it.
---
There are options against all of these.
---
Level 62 charred feral ghouls: These guys can be rendered mostly harmless by getting level 3 'Blocker' perk (Strength). For some reason this perk seems to be a lot more effective than the stated % would indicate, at least when facing ghouls. It seems to be bugged in the same way the 'Fireproof' perk at level 3 completely neuters scorchbeast attacks.
---
Yao Guai: Don't fight these in melee. They have almost no armor so ordinary bullets shred them. Just shoot them from afar. (For some reason, 'Blocker' doesn't work as well against them, probably due to their ability to stunlock you with constant staggers.)
---
Robots: 5 pieces of Troubleshooter's armor will help a lot here, especially against the Gutsies.  
---
Assaultron head lasers not so much, they just burn through everything.
---
Well, everything stops for you at level 50. That‚Äôs the highest level for all equipment.
---
the traders rarely change, yes they can be outbid but it doesn't happen too much in trafficked areas because the bids are already so high, so it still ends up with the same few guilds there most of the time. the meet and sell quota doesn't force reasonable prices, people pay for the convenience of not having to zone hop 20 + times. it doesn't do any of the things you are describing, it's not seller friendly and it's not buyer friendly, it only benefits those who run the guilds. an auction house is far better because prices are actually competitive and you usually only have to pay a small AH tax, if that.
---
After radiation exposure that may have changed
---
you serious?? yes im on xbox and id love to get that! but let me pay you like 10k caps or at least 5k of .45 or 5.56. also, im at work now and cant get online now
---
The problem is I can easily take a sentry bot head on without dieing
---
I've had it happen recently. Stuff that was purchased was dropped right away, and some excess junk was added to the bag as well that I know I don't have for sale. (Unless they grabbed it out of my unlocked Collectron.)  
---
I'm level 153, so it seems like maybe either leaving stuff in return for "underpriced" items, taking out the trash? I don't know.  
---
I've bought out entire Vendor inventories on lower levels and left useful stuff for them in return. I usually just seek out the players directly and drop Aid and Plans most often. I always, always, always end up with tons of the most common plans and recipes. Sometimes, I stick them in my vendor for 5-10 caps, and after a while, I just start dropping them on lower level players. I just try to stay behind and make sure they pick it up, though. Not that it ultimately matters, but if they're not going to take it, I might as well save it for someone who will.
---
It doesn't always spawn two but it can spawn two. This is also the worst one to solo because the cows stand right where the Sheepsquatch spawn and it will kill them super quick.
---
Man you are always on point and dropping good advice.
---
It‚Äôs no problem, I don‚Äôt really mind since I‚Äôm running a melee build, shoot me a message whenever you‚Äôre on my gt is LicortezanoiL
---
hey man add me whenever I just want to get rid of them and make a friend. my name is Cory76 add me and you can have them. I found a bag of like 100 something plans and its taken over my inventory. I honestly dont think anyone will join me. Lets be honest here, If theyre playing theyre not checking reddit.
---
Maybe because my perks are all at 1* for commando and rifle, but the difference per shot is not that horrible (but maybe i am wrong). 
---
The higher fore rate of auto makes for an easier way to go through bullet sponge... decision decisions
---
I don‚Äôt really have a build yet, even at level 140 lol. I guess Vanguard would describe my build but I find that rads are given way too easily to be good. I have all the perks for vats, but it is less useful in auto.
---
Well, of course. Thats how instancing works. You're getting sent to a different server.
---
Thanks man. I definitely agree with you, I feel like we desperately need new content. I have no idea how these level 800+ players keep doing it. I'm only 228 and I'm running put of things to do. I'm running 4 silos a day and doing encryptid. Other than that, I'm not sure what to do.
---
Could be a weird reaction from the "time machine" up there at the end of that monorail. I think it has some tesla emitters attached to the support at the front.
---
This is what I was going to say, it also increases the size of the loot pool üòÇ
---
Fair enough, though from my perspective it means Sentry Bots have to be made way nastier. You encounter them rarely enough and they are basically tanks.
---
We are the game testers, and this is just a paid beta test ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Completing the story doesn't lock you out of either faction, the most it does it put you further ahead with one faction than the other, if you choose to give them a greater share of the gold.
---
As another comment said, it's about the build (unless it's a pistol). An LMG can kill virtually anything quickly with the right build, same with a combat rifle.
---
awesome, i will. thanks man
---
Ohhhh that will make me stay in auto most probably then.
---
Nope. Soloing a Queen and Colossus simultaneously does though.
---
Pretty much
---
I might be in the minority here but I kind of like it like that. The power trip of running through a camp and absolutely annihilating a group of enemies that would have stomped me 50 or so levels ago is really satisfying. I‚Äôm only level 93 though so I may change my tune in another hundred levels!
---
I‚Äôm anxiously awaiting Bethesda‚Äôs new scaled enemies. Hoping it doesn‚Äôt make it too difficult. I gotta about, levels 10-30 were rough for me. Call me a filthy casual but it was hard enough that I almost quit until this level 230 guy saved me from a deathclaw and dropped me a legendary gauss rifle that carried me until level 65+.
---
They were all semi-auto (2 shots .44 mostly) but this is the first "wow" legendary weapon i‚Äôve come across so I am ready to change my perks and special point from Agility to Perception.
---
I still feel assaltrons need to be nerfed and sentry bots need to be slightly harder
---
I just got a piece of one star wood leg... but a guy was blowing heart emote none stop after looting the queen, looks like someone is very happy about the loot.
---
I would say the same, but it is on their known bug list.
---
You also may want to make sure that you don't have craftable objects only turned on. If it is on turn it off, basically it makes it so that only stuff that you can build with what supplies you have shows up and not everything will show up
---
With a combat knife, no armor
---
Never seen one of those sticky slapper hand toys?
---
Rather existing events should be re-balanced/redesigned, so many of them are so bad/boring/broken with horrible rewards like grenades/rockets/mininukes/useless items. Most haven't been looked at in more than forever and no-one does them. Modus/Enclave, horde, Distinguished guests, Guided meditation, Swarm of suitors, Tea time, Jail break, The messenger, Sensus - do you see anyone do those? Even if some are low level we all enjoyed Fastnacht which is as low level as it gets, still the entire server was able to enjoy it. If existing events get real love and care we wont need new ones in a while.
---
Thank you hun! üñ§ One of those is gonna work just fine. Starting my build there now
---
So their willing to admit they‚Äôre so incompetent they somehow gave an enemy cripple immunity on accident rather than say they have the queen a buffüòπ
---
I saw her just west of the Giant Teapot-- just up the hill from the pipe, under the power lines.  
---
The one that bothered me most so far was Colonel in Flatwoods, the 13 year old brat who thinks that his Dad is gone because of all the rotten shit that he did as a punkass kid; that he brought it on himself. Maybe it's because I work with punkass kids and see their realities, but that story made me feel awful. (And I know you find the updated holotape where he grew up and was a full time responder, but still. It sucks when kids have to deal with heavy psychological stuff like that.
---
Learning the fixer plan it adds the possibility of getting a fixer to the stock pool of weapons that you can get... for instance you dont need the 10mm SMG plan to get one from the purveyor.  Maybe your chances of getting a fixer may be slightly* higher..? But I would guess it's not worth the effort... dont let that stop you from trying though. If that method works I would consider deleting a character just do load up on scrip..
---
Gotch, if you‚Äôre used to semi auto style, the handmade works very well as a fast semi auto - with a large mag too, big advantage over other semi weapons such as the lever action and pipe revolvers. The hardened receiver hits the hardest, you can one shot most creatures with it except a few bosses.
---
I've noticed if the bug is to the players benefit, like the separate cap pool or unbreakable armor, it is fixed quickly.  Bugs that aren't to our benefit are put on the back burner.
---
I corrected your statement by saying there is a marker most never see and ive only recently seen because I looked up at the lighthouse
---
Brotherhood sniper?
---
It may sound a bit cocky. I don't know what level you are, but eventually you the character will be the overpowered one. I would argue, in your list, only the assaultron is quite deadly because of the invisibility and the headbeam. 
---
I would rather have some enemies that are able to to kill me once in a while when I am surprised, then act as a walking god through the wasteland just like end game fo4. My 2 cents.
---
Yes cause I was doing other events and came over since they where still active just to arive when they fail
---
You're gonna do a lot less damage in the absence of Nerd Rage (20%) and Adrenal Reaction (50%). That, plus the fact that Junkie's caps at +50% whereas Bloodied at 10% HP is 80% for the weapon. So, a bit less than half damage compared to bloody.
---
The Yao Gui stagger is a real struggle, even with full sentinel SS armor they will still stun and kill me with three hits.lvl 210 here, admittedly running zero defensive cards, as you said, they gotta go from a distance. They did teach me to pay more attention to the terrain because if I don‚Äôt kill them quickly ranged, I gotta marsupial jump before they can stun lock.
---
There are two ways to cap out regularly. 
---
1) Find items in demand and sell them for a reasonable price. This is typically a strategy for long time players. 
---
2) Find items that are not highly desirable but still useful and sell them cheap. 
---
If you're melee, sell ammo. If you're a PA player, sell ballistic fiber. If you're always exploring, sell junk. If you're always doing events, sell legendaries for scrip.

My main is 378 and my alt is 114. Only reason I even leveled an Alt was for something to do. He's my Covert Ops dude. I can, almost 100% of the time, sneak right up to sleeping Ghouls around The Whitesprings and double tap them in the head and move on without being noticed. Chinese Stealth Suit is pretty damn nice.
---
i do the same. im a dood but if a game gives me a choice, i make up what i think a fun character could be in my own head canon and if female seems more interesting, i go for it. its my character but its not *me*. just being me in every damn game i play would get old. i know what *i* would do. but what about Regina Knight? outwardly a simple dusty courier, caught in the escalating war between the NCR and the Legion, trying to scratch out a living in the wasted Mojave. but when a local pawn tries to move on Knight, she realises the game was rigged from the start and sets out to flip the whole. damn. board. Grey's 204th playing of FO:NV presents: KNIGHT COURIER. this summer, the bad guys wont be getting any sleep... theres an enemy nearby.
---
It's a plan found at fort defiance after registering an ID card for the requirement blues quest.

The sniper rifle has a recon and silencer already attached when built at a weapons bench
---

---
Nope, nothing really works anymore.   Best bet is to have someone with a cryolator to slow her down.
---
I just explore. Experiment with new weapons. Craft, rebuild my camp. I was a shotgunner the entire time and decided to switch to heavy once I got this sweet furious flamer and plasma caster. Other times I look for rare things like the casual shielded lining and the hunters coat.
---
This is only true if there are other weapons that behave just like the fixer, ie: they would be left out of the loot table for your legendary rolls.
---
But as far as I can tell, there are no other weapons that behave like that. As I mentioned above, you still get heavy weapon drops of all types and everything else as well, even without knowing the plans.
---
Can you tell me which weapons, specifically, you would be excluding from your loot pool by following through with this plan of yours?
---
Where I don't disagree with this, I think the best solution is to re-program the event to be more like Heart of the Swamp and Line in the Sand, turn it into a waves event just like any other MMO boss event. Have the Queen land and take X amount of damage and then take off. Have mobs show up, kill them and then have the Queen land again. Repeat until dead. This removes the need to cripple the limbs (unless you wanna stop her from attacking with her wing) and give melee builds a better chance of getting involved.
---
Have you been to Abby's bunker? Repairing the uplink usually does the trick..
---
Do the Dailies: Stings and Things and Operation Tidy. 
---
Operation Tidy seriously gives me one every few times I play. My character must have Horseshoes up her ass because it drops Possum Badges for me on a fairly regular basis, which is not a common experience, apparently.
---
The devs for 76 had no experience with the Fallout series or a (supposedly) AAA game.  I'm sure people have moved about some since then, and they have had some help from other parts of the studio (mostly for NW I think).  So...yeah, they're working with a code base that is hobbled together to make an online game using a 10 year old single player framework, and the people making and fixing it had no prior experience in any of that.
---
You can‚Äôt do the main story for the other faction but you can still do daily‚Äôs for both factions regardless of your choice
---
I‚Äôm aware they‚Äôve marked it as a bug. It can‚Äôt be very hard to fix unless should be as simple as change a value from true to false or something like thatü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Logged off for the night, but I'll try that first thing in the morning, thanks for the advice üëç

Awaiting clandestine T-65
---
Or just leave the only thing that long time players have been grinding since the beginning alone. The queen is the only thing we have that‚Äôs sacred don‚Äôt touch her lol
---
For the pro‚Äôs:  you‚Äôll free up 1 end on radicool, 3 int for nerd rage, 3 luck for serendipity, be at full health, and can dip into party person, happy go lucky, cola nut, rad sponge, potentially revenant and dodgy with some gear if you weren‚Äôt doing that before.
---
What I like about junkie vs bloody is there are choices and tweaks to be made on both sides.  Too bad there are only 2 sides!
---
Dense mod in chest and adamantium skeleton in endurance will solve that
---
Meese gang
---
I still see a lot of people go guided meditation, jail break, swarm of suitors and tea time. The other ones not so much. An overhaul of events to make them all public events would be good.
---
Having been with 76 since BETA, I have my doubts they will figure out what they broke any time soon. It likely has to do with preventing stunning her head.
---
Thanks for providing this, I‚Äôd seen it before but could not find it on the fly.  Now I have it saved üòÄ
---
Fallout 4 had too much water
---
Yeah, especially when server ticks apparently don‚Äôt exist and everything is client side.
---
With sentry bots hit the fusion cores
---
I personally do anti armor and I do loads of damage with AA + 25% less vats cost handmade with on top of that running around 400 dr and 500 ER and plenty of health. Bloody was to spongy for me.
---
Except I'd you're not on the ground she wont land
---
They should put her back to normal and never touch her again. She‚Äôs not super rewarding anyway. It‚Äôs just a fun grind to kill her for people who want to test builds.
---
Today was my 1st time in there.never saw it 12 months in game .found a 3 star legendary.
---
that was very informative and concise. that really finally answered some questions ive been harboring for awhile. im finally ascending to the pc master race and the transition has had me learning things ive long taken for granted. you didnt know it, but you helped me learn something today, thanks.
---
Speed demon and squad maneuvers stack
---
Supposedly it‚Äôs Str end and per as I recall but I don‚Äôt recall the spread.
---
I do view it as BiS if you‚Äôre a Str build however.
---
Agreed.
---
Queen drops are the worst.  I can only take so many 1-star lead pipes.
---
Despite the plans being expensive but not the outfits I managed to sell several of these and also insurgent ones at about the same price -))
---
Weird, most of the times I‚Äôve been to that one, 2 usually spawn. Given I haven‚Äôt touched any of the free ranges in a while, so I may be misremembering something
---
She landed twice on that platform. Everyone was on the top.
---
Sometimes notifications from events come minutes later than they ended up, probably was one of these. It's especially annoying when you're in the.middle of another heavy fight already, when BAM! - full-screen legendary notification is completely covering my POV. Good job, Bethesda. 
---
Why doing that full-screen anyway? Like it's SO RARE and SO EPIC I'd better drop anything I am doing right now and OBSERVE.
---
If you take the toy she will ask for it back, and if you give it to her she will give you some other toy in return. Sad indeed.
---
Other examples are the bear arms, gauss shotgun and pistol, plasma caster, and sheep stuff.  You are still correct just wanted to add those into the mix.

I hear you. I'm locked and loaded with the 3 things I wanted most in the game - JE 25 Fixer, JE 25 HM and a Tattered Field Jacket. I've been stealth commando forever but since I do so many SBQs, I'm now half heavy gunner which sounds weird I know.  I'm running 9 heavy gunner perks and a junkies LMG for the SQB event. But to launch, I'm stealth commando in the silo. 
---
I'm hoping the new Colossus event is good, we need a new boss.
---
These things are so annoying. They just get in the way.
---
Wait wait wait. There was a fallout 4 companion app? Why didn't I ever hear about that thing?
---
Shit i should have thought of that. Thanks
---
Not really unless End is fixed on underarmors.
---
bloodied is the alpha damage build and junkies will not match it.  
---
full health and good damage/dps vs low health but alpha damage.
---
Wow yeah, that's a huge hole in the lore, I mean hornwright only made one that we know of. The one you give the voice to in the quest had the boxes. The one that dies doesnt, but it does have the voice.
---
Same with power armor suits.
---
My buddies run this kind of platform. It‚Äôs awesome but takes away the fun of it. Taking the Queen out with effort is more rewarding IMO.
---
I thought I read somewhere if you complete the Wastelander‚Äôs story and choose a side, you can‚Äôt get Ally with the other side, thus locking you out of some of their faction rewards. Is that not true?
---
T60 is the cheapest to repair.
---
the game is way too easy.  these "op" enemies are too easy.  check your build and gear, surely you can improve to the point where these enemies are no longer a concern.
---
It's all.the same. What doesn't make sense is that it gets destroyed assulting Vault 79 and then you meet it again at Breach and Clear.
---
define reasonable perks? what is your exact build, weapon and armor?
---
Pvp wise junkies always win. Matched.
---
From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!
---
If you're looking at the first screen it shows the lowest possible level. Once you start to craft it, it will ask if you want to make it lvl50.
---
Junkies is better for pvp
---
I am still carrying Excavator as my only PA, because farming Lucky Hole gets me so much satisfaction.
---
No you must know the plan to get them in the pool.
---
Gameflip or ebay.
---
I'll give you 6 reasons:
---
1. \+75 carry weight + melee damage bonus
---
2. \+vats accuracy + a few detection bonuses
---
3. Considerably better buy/sell prices to the point that it can negate need for Hard Bargain perk
---
4. Sizeable XP bonus + increased crafted item condition + bonus scrap mats from junk
---
5. Sizeable bonus to AP + sneak bonus that can nullify need for Sneak perk
---
6. Significant boost to crit meter + increased found item condition
---
All this for having to micromanage low health and rads, for which there are a number effects that synergise well with it i.e. perks, legendary effect and mutation. 
---
All this for just a single legendary star rank. Name any 1 star legendary effect that's even remotely comparable? Name 2 star legendary effects combined that can outdo this?
---
People would say that the low health balances things out but that's not even remotely close and if you're a bloody main, you know it just as much as I do. Were it not for Unyielding, I don't think that people would complain all that much of the difference in carry weight between PA vs regular armour.
---
Damn i want to circus cage lmao
---
There's a place just behind where you arrive when you fast travel to the Cranberry Glade. It's on the old dirt road leading out of the park.  There's a spot where things appear 2 or 3 off of the ground on the right side of the roadway as your back is to the park entrance parking lot.  
---
The first time I found a portable power pack and didn't realize so I just scrapped it.  Since then I had about a 5-10% chance of picking up one of the quest items.  I didn't realize what was causing the glitch with the Foundation quests where as soon as you talk to Ward he says "I see you found the ..." . It never leaves your possession either.  So the extra power packs works as well.  
---
I think I now have 3 or 4 portable power packs, an extra red diary, some sort of turret board which resides in junk and can be accidentally scrapped, and today (June 21) I found an osmosis kit.  
---
I've never found more than one while playing on the same server so it's best to server hop after you found one.  
---
It seems to only be on the public server side and not the private server, at least that is what I've seen so far.
---
So the Wasteland has its very own Marcel Duchamp....Futuristic Dadaism. What‚Äôs next? Melting Nuka Cola Clocks? I hope I get to come across this first hand. I love how people can be so creative. üòç
---
Hopefully you have the Gauss Shotgun as well. This essential as is madly OP. I'm in a similar situation: Ally with both, Full T-65 set, Cal shocks, Protocoled Torso, Gauss Shotgun and Minigun. What next?
---
I plan to get the SS jetpack that I can wear outside PA.
---
Otherwise I've been scrabbling around vendors looking for specialty armor sets. For a long while now I have full perfect sneak sets, troubleshooter sets (for Silo runs) and I have all but one piece of a full Sentinel set.
---
Speaking of which, the Sheepsquach seems particularly susceptible to a Gauss Minigun, dying in seconds which allowed me to solo the Mire version of that event easily  (yeah, not that hard, I know).
---
I guess time to take a break
---
Bare hands, just undies
---
I actually moved and rebuilt my camp today. I canceled the auto renew on my Fallout 1st sub because I'm pretty unhappy with a lot of things related to Bethesda currently, so I've been trying to find the perfect spot within the 'Safe Zone' so my camp isn't accidentally or purposefully nuked.
---
I think I have a pretty good spot now, with a rather nice lay out that I borrowed and modified from a YouTube video I watched to day.
---
Plasma Casters are fun if done right. I have a Zealot's Plasma Caster with +33% VATS Hit Chance and 25% Less VATS Action Point cost. I only use it for Line in the Sand and man oh man is it a blast. I end up walking away with so much Nuclear Material.
---
Who mentioned lvl 33?
---
That's not how it works. All the standard weapons will drop regardless. Otherwise, everyone would use their alts to flood the market with fixers or other specific guns (making them very common, which isn't true).
---
Alright, this is pretty darn cool! I absolutely love stumbling across unique campsites!
---
thanks. where do i buy mutations again? the enclave bunker right?
---
I did not notice that.  So gonna look for that next time I see one
---
I would laugh so hard if someone dropped theirrecently purchased items and danced into the night! That is by far the most awesome sentence I have read tonight!
---
I run a shotgun build with a vamp combat shotgun and vanguard armor. I only die when I run out of AP as I‚Äôm flying high with my jet pack...like a fool.
---
For the REAL pros: you still keep the bloodied shell and benefit from all the bloodied perks but have the flexibility to have higher health when needed without affecting damage too much i.e. base weapon damage remains the same no matter your health.
---
The special cost for going junkies is pretty minimal given the flexibility you get in exchange.
---
I dont even have it in my own Camp because it takes up so much budget. I mean like 10%. Its insane.
---
10%, nevermind then lmao that is hella expensive
---
I had someone destroy half my camp before I caught them and logged out. Looked like explosive bait. There was a bunch of weird colored clouds. I was not in group. I was not in a nuke. I had pacifist on.
---
Wade airport yo.. you dont need water üòâ
---
I don't know why people are downvoting you because you're right.
---
Having said that though, you can still use a bloodied shell and benefit from all of this except have some flexibility with health without affecting weapon damage too much.
---
I've seen the SBQ destroy entire camps like this. Pretty funny when somebody tries to drop down a pre-prepared turret bunker and she instantly lays waste to the entire thing.
---
You can get mutation serums for 300-500 caps at player vendors, the serum plans still sell for 20k at the enclave bunker, but you can find plans on sale at camps for a lot less.
---
Get better weapons now, enjoy your endless server hop or browsing reddit for god roll weapons lol
---
Maybe. I'll still likely log in to do Daily and Weekly Atom challenges until they are removed.
---
I keep trying to do this... but every time I get round the back of them the cool down sequence ends and I end up staring at them face to face.  Plenty of times that git under the castle stared me to death.. literally.
---
I don't have any of the Gauss Weapons, just not a fan. I have a .50 HMG and enough ammunition to take over a small country, that makes me happy.
---
No kidding...it's like the old martial arts movies. Enemy only attacks one at time.
---
Glad somebody here finally mentioned it.
---
With how clientside hit detection works in this game, little can be done to prevent it outside of drastically modifying how the current combat is implemented.
---
It's probably not quite that much but I scraped 4 floorings, 6 railings, a large tent, about 5 lights, and many pieces of furniture and still didn't have enough to put it down. The doors on the other hand that comes with the circus cage are amazing. I use them on my greenhouse.
---
Only weapon I'm looking for I have to craft. I want an Instigating Plasma Caster with either 25% Faster Fire or 25% Less VATS Cost and +33% VATS hit chance.
---
Here I thought that a robot's weakness was to present it with a logical paradox. I guess Star Trek was wrong....
---
This. This comment made my day, thank you.
---
It was certainly added to the PTS for the *initial* Patch 20 update.
---
I don't know if it still applies, but it was working fine then. I assume it'll hit with Patch 20 on June 30. Patch "20.5" seems awfully late for a relatively simple fix.
---
My math is assuming that you are at full health. Obviously you wouldn't take away damage for Nerd Rage or Adrenal Reaction if you plan on being at 19% with a Junkies weapon (but why?). Other than that, can you explain how my math is wrong?
---
Ah, T-65 I see.
---
In this case:
---
weird flex but ok
---
Meh, basically everything that isn't the SBQ dies in a single hit regardless, and afaik the armor pen provides are larger increase to damage output against her than Brawling does.
---
I would gladly change my mind if you had some math to back up your claim though.
---
Currently hitting the SBQ for about 1300 per swing with no food/chem buffs.
---
welcome back, general
---
Pretty sure the Mr. Gutsy ballistic arm outright ignores *all* armor.
---
Somebody who can load FO76.esm in Xedit will have to take a peek sometime.
---
Thanks a lot ü§£
---
If you don't learn the bear arm, sheepsquatch staff or any of the wastelanders plans, you'll have the best chance at getting a fixer, but it's still going to be abysmal because you're still looking at the base loot pool of the weapons in the game.
---
The jet will make you jittery
---
Place your camp inside the bottle, start with a foundation and stairs in the water ü§£ PS4
---
Happened to me once. Guy burned my house down with flamethrower turrets :(
---
And something I like to do is, when I have 200+ of a scrap resource that I can bulk, I bulk it until it‚Äôs below 200 then sell the bulk, usually to a vendor. It also saves CAMP space. I don‚Äôt really max my caps because I‚Äôm always buying plans and such, but, at least to me, it‚Äôs a decent strat.
---
LOL ü§£ That sounds great! Hired!
---
Perfect time for dad jokes!
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Every once in a while you get something good.
---
The scrapbox and tent are basic ideas that were requested by fans, and the primary draw to FO1st. They don't have a large demand on server resources, and they're not a major nuisance.
---
So they locked them behind a paywall.
---
Everyone expected atoms to be locked behind a paywall, but a simple feature like a scrapbox is the case of Bethesda inventing a problem so that they can sell the solution.
---
They really aren't especially compared to unyielding.

Updated my original comment with a [comparison from the github](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-Handmade_L-45_ModReceiver-PowerfulAutomatic_ModMagazine-Stinging_ModMuzzle-Standard_ModSights-Standard_Prefix-Bloodied_Sneak_PHP-19_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Covert-50_Nerd-20_Adrenal_Other-0&amp;right=R_W-Handmade_L-45_ModReceiver-PowerfulAutomatic_ModMagazine-Stinging_ModMuzzle-Standard_ModSights-Standard_Prefix-Junkies_Sneak_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-5_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Covert-50_Nerd-20_Adrenal_Other-0). 100% HP Junkies actually does up to 2/3rds less damage than 19% HP Bloodied. Obviously, this gap is bridged if you are trying to run a hybrid - but I don't see the point in that.
---
Thank you very much ü§£üëç
---
You are most welcome!!!  üòäüòä

If you want to do workshops peacefully and don't have first, go to the workshop, clear out the enemies and wait until it says you claimed it. Leave the workshop immediately and fast travel somewhere else. Wait until the defend event fails and the retake event comes up. Check to make sure there are no player dots at or near the workshop. Stash all junk. Go back in stealth, clear out the hostiles and then build a your resource collectors in stealth. After that you can leave and stop back when you can to collect. You can even lock the collectors if you want, but I don't usually bother. Just make sure no one else is in there and you always use stealth.
---
Most of the PvP players who hunt for targets won't camp at them for long. They server hop looking for taken workshops with targets in them or they look for the defend events which show up for everyone. The retake events only show up for the player. You'll still sometimes get attacked, especially if you take hemlock holes or the munitions factory, but if you stash your junk, you're only losing 50 caps if you die so no big deal. I don't even bother with stealth any more personally. If I get attacked I leave and wait until they are gone and go back. Most of the time they won't even claim the workshop because that will make them targets.
---
It‚Äôs a great weapon for sure. Someone gifted me it also when I was a lower level. Helped a lot.
---
means you got to level up, as with all RPGs. You hit an area you can't beat, just level up and get better equipment
---
I like the idea,  but as others have said high level long played players will dominate the market and newbies wouldn't get anywhere.  
---
Also,  if camps were free to travel to then people would use them as stops to hop across the map.  Negating the need for the travel perk card thing... whatever it's called. 
---
I think it's a good idea,  but there are a lot of issues that'd come with it.  Just look at the market on crossout for instance. 
---
Maybe a notice board could be useful in whitesprings.  You can add a note of items you want to sell and the price, maybe a limit of 10 items,  then if someone wants to buy they have to travel to your camp.  I'm always looking for a decent heavy gun and do get tired of camp hopping sometimes.
---
Hey that's me! :) Glad you liked it!
---
I had a guy recently buy a bunch of items from me. I went to my camp and gave the heart emote as a thank you. He proceeds to attack me. I fled up upstairs thinking there was a miscommunication and he follows, still attacking so I jump servers. I don't get people.

---
Is my Heavy Gunner build that I use every day.
---
Thanks a ton man!!!
---
I just sent a friend request, even if I have the plans it would be cool to peruse through the vendor.
---
The point of running a hybrid is about giving yourself a larger health buffer to work with than bloodied whilst still retaining some of the damage bonuses, which only get better the harder you're hit.
---
Go solo a Scorch Beast around Cranberry Bog, or Behemoth Super Mutant at the Abandoned Bog Town
---
Or go launch nukes
---
I agree. My camp is nothing compared to what I did at my favorite settlement in fo4. I have so many ideas but I am so limited. Maybe in future updates we will have more freedom.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that. It was so long ago
---
Unpainted. Got no paints for Ultra/T65 and don't put the store paints on it.
---
levelled enemies will break the game. no point in a RPG where everything is the same level as you. as you said, part of the satisfaction comes from blowing through enemies that you had problems at lower levels. but if every enemy takes 5 hits to kill. there's actually zero reasons to play the game past the story quests
---
Being into ingame photography, i must say I admire your photo sir
---
Nope, got the Starched Genes n such. Only got Marsupial n another one I bought syrums for.
---
Well, just so you know - Both weapons perform exactly the same at 50% HP with identical builds.
---
For me it's the Gutsys.  I melee and they can hit me pretty hard by the time I get to them, still love AWOL armaments for the challenge.
---
Thank you so much for this! I've been wondering where punk is lately as I've yet to encounter them!
---
No.  Not remotely. 
---
Nothing wrong with junkies, but plenty of ways to hit damage cap in pvp. Every last point if damage over cap is wasted.
---
The Forager side quest tends to brick other allies. Especially if you started his Search and Rescue quest, didn't finish it, and changed to a different Ally. Changing back to him, completing the side quest and changing to a new Ally tends to fix it
---
Yikes. 
---
I take solace in the fact that they‚Äôre just wasting ammo at that point.
---
No problem. It's probably not the end all of Heavy Weapons builds and it will evolve once they change the hunger and thirst mechanics to not be so pressing anymore, but it does the job for me.
---

---
There's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Used this build for well over 150 levels now
---
That's very true.
---
It's a mod for the small and standard backpack. You need to craft one of those first and then mod it.
---
Wgat is your name? IDK if I got anything
---
Really good looking build.
---
Think i spent like 10 mins just looking at the details good work
---
Thanks just looked threw yours. They're basically the same lol. Bit different but not much lol
---
thanks. big pp
---
Thank you! I am very proud of it. u/d0ntst0pme has some [great ships](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g9po16/yarrr_greet_my_10_cannons_into_your_port_rate_my/) as well. He was the one who inspired me to make mine.
---
Should have blown him up while he was stuck in the vendor menu.
---
I know, it's pretty eerie lol. Once they change how hunger and thirst work I'll be dropping Thru Hiker and moving the points into Batteries Included so I can run more Energy Weapons.
---
I do too, love it!
---
Pro Tip: Concentrated Fire trivializes Sentry Bots. Aim for the cores in VATS, shoot them until your hit percentage is greater than zero, pop a crit, done.
---
It's kind of hilarious how you can get over 50,000 damage hits on their cores.
---
Honestly, bloodied handmades are an excellent choice. I got one with hardened receiver, semi auto, compensating stock, suppressor, the whole shebang. I literally called mine ‚ÄúCommunist‚Äôs Legacy‚Äù, hinting at it‚Äôs looking like an AK. I only wish it had the other 2 stars... but yeah, if you can, use a bloodied one, you‚Äôre completely right!
---
same thing happened to me today and i was flying through the ground haha. i also recorded it. pretty weird haha

Bloated Glowing One 12 feet away just chillin'

Glances over and gives me the stink eye

Aw crap and here I am building a set of each PA :o think I‚Äôll just store them and stick with my excavator for now - thanks for letting me know!

---
Junkies are funny and Bloodied are basic
---
You do know those enemies saying the same shit about us, right?
---
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that man! If you need any resources I‚Äôll be glad to help out on PC
---
Numbers
---
Yeah, I really appreciate it though!
---
LOL big excitement not weed. =)
---
I know it‚Äôs frustrating -.-
---
I can't think of what it could be then. I suggest stripping the parts off your chassis and server hopping. Put it all back together and see if it was bugged.
---
The mentality of some people is just absurd
---
LOL not weed excitement. Big probably as I was too damn asleep typing these words.
---
Anyways, weekend was fantastic!
---
You'd have a good few seconds while their stuck in the vendor, if their bloodied especially use nuka Grenade to kill them with rads.
---
Really a lvl 50 player isnt that much weaker than a 100+ just a matter of how optimized theor build is and their luck at having gotten good weapons.
---
Where do you find him
---
Don't worry all of our characters are getting nerfed with One Wasteland.
---
And this might sound like a minor concern, but  I want my power armor to look cool with having to use an Atomic shop skin. 
---
The Strangler heart has plants growing out of it. I don't like plant growing out of my power armor.
---
Do the bullion weapons also drop from legendary drops / purveyor? (once you know the plans). I thought they were only craftable.
---
I wouldn't give up on them on public servers. When you realize that as long as you stash your junk, the worst that can happen is you lose 50 caps and have to retake the workshop. Or you hop servers and take it again. As long as you don't go crazy building and dip into your own stash (workshops have a limited amount of junk on their own), there there is next to no risk involved other than annoyance. PvP players are in the minority in the game which is why they've all but been forgotten by Bethesda.
---
On the road map, didn‚Äôt they claim that instanced interiors were on their way?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm way behind on optimizing my build and weaponry. I think I only have one piece of equipped legendary armor and two legendary weapons. I focused more on just building a catalogue of materials, plans, mods, etc.
---
Yes, they can drop, so can the SS armor
---
Why didn't you tell us that when it did work???!?
---
XD
---
Yeah. Nothing like being given the same note over and over again and having to drop it over and over again.
---
Why? I've never made a run of a solo, and don't think I'll ever will. But if I'll do, I will get new cards. They are relatively easy to get if you need them.
---
VATS unknown is trash but what if it would get buff?) and even if not, it'll be a nice collection item.
---
Zealot Fixer got Scorched Killer's Receiver becoming sort of 5 star legendary, and I'm quite happy about it's future. For the rest, I can now expect The Fixer to be available in the genetal loot.
---
Oh, it works on the small? Think i'll get it then.
---
It‚Äôs easier to farm blight for blight soup. It has the same effects.
---
Same. But I'll probably move points to action boy and maybe move my oga points away since t you can't cripple the Queen (been running good with salt or luck of the draw for now but don't love them)
---
Good thing there is no down side to death.
---
Player 1: I‚Äôll pay you to kill me.
---
Player 2: Deal. *Shoots Player 1*
---
Player 1: *Dead*
---
Player 2: So where‚Äôs my money?
---
Player 1: *Still Dead*
---
Player 2: ...You son of a-
---
Well, this is concerning.  Please make sure you put in a help ticket to make Bethesda aware of the problem. Anyone else have this issue?
---
It definitely is NOT supposed to be that way. I am suffering from this as well. With each update I lose more respect for their development team, especially QA part.
---
There are 3 megasloth spawn points around the southern belle motel in the mire, two of them are south off the side of the road by the river in two trees, usually only one spawns, but there can be more, another spawns to the west across the river from the motel not far from a small campsite. All sloths spawn hanging from trees and are easy to miss.
---
Another rarer spawn is up around the base of tanagra town, but there are several different mobs that can spawn there.
---
I feel your pain my lack of a decent legendary weapon is killing me üò•üò•
---
There's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Been running this build for 150+ levels now. Find it very good
---
Well, it‚Äôs annoying because, trying to help my friend with his pre-Wastelanders quests so he can do the Wastelanders ones, both of us get annoyed with me asking ‚Äúwhere are we going‚Äù every five minutes.
---
I know this is kinda old, but hoping I can get an answer. I have a few note recipes (not Delbert's) such as Headhunter's Headcheese. I have it in my inventory and I've read it, but I still haven't learned it. How do we learn them? It's still not on my crafting/cooking list.
---
I am in the minority and think the sh is better. With the diminishing returns on Dr er the t65 is pointless. A guy did a bunch of tests and against a level 95 behemoth is was hitting 3 less dmg per hit on the t65 vs the ultracite/t51b. The sh gives better rad resist and some extra damage (though the damage is tiny and barely worth mentoring now). I also think it looks way cooler, and there are some bad ass skins you can get for it from nw. I also love mine since I got it before they removed the ability to place a jet pack on any limb. So I've got a jet pack arm and a free chest piece
---
Items gone, caps gone, your knees gone for not paying rent, infinite cripple.
---
You are only level 50, you have no stat benefit from leveling beyong 50 lvl, just more perk cards.

Here‚Äôs a concept: a beacon device that‚Äôs playable in your camp that, when powered, makes your camp appear on the map like vendors currently do.

I miss Lucy  :(

Project Paradise was supposed to be a ‚Äúnew‚Äù (as of last year sometime) endgame event with rare outfits and plans but not a lot of people run it as it does take some team coordination... and too many of us play solo. Unfortunately the ‚Äúrare‚Äù ‚Äúrewards‚Äù (imo) aren‚Äôt worth the event. Radiation Rumble is sort of the new Uranium Fever (since all the legendary drops in are now capped at 35 to 40). Moderately harder than Uranium Fever with more legendary drops and a chance rare plans and even rarer hazmat suit. Personally I don‚Äôt run either of these for completion rewards or treasury notes... just for the xp and scrip.
---
Set bonuses are the big thing that power armor has that makes the sets different from one another.
---
The excavator has 100 carry weight and 4x ore yield
---
the strangler heart has a weak poison aoe and dot effect.
---
and the rest have nothing. Not even the t-65 has anything special going for it, it's damage resistances look good on paper, but because of behind the scenes magic there is very little difference between it and the weakest lowliest suit of level 15 raider armor.
---
The only other thing to think about besides set bonuses for power armor is how easy it is to get a full set of mods. where the only notable instances are that ultracite requires you to farm queens for rng to get upgrades, T-65 requires gold, and the rest take caps at specific venders, with the potential for treasure maps to spawn mod plans for free.
---
PA is very homogenous, great until you can get a set of working legendary armor, but doesn't really get any better than it starts as.
---
Yeah someone did the same to me i was just looking at weapond and some jerk starts attacking me to get me off the vendors i wasnt even on it that long like i just got on it maybe they should do like a ticket system or something cause its just annoying and because of that the jerk got the weapon i was actually thinking about buying it was an anti armor 10mm pistol, i mean i eventually got it but thw point is if that didnt happen i couldve gotten it then and for cheaper too.
---
got a source for that?
---
It seems to be a glitch. I was helping a buddy with his first run through and noticed this as well. I've done the missions all enough that I pretty much knew where to go and what needed to be done when he told me what mission was next, but there where some that i couldnt remember exact locations so i had to have him place a marker on where it was telling him we should go. I dont know what happened or what mission we were doing, but at one point, his missions finally started to show up on my screen, for the rest of the day spent playing. The next day, however, we were back to placing markers. We moved on to a different game, but i've always wanted to see if i could duplicate the sudden appearance. I remember we had just fast traveled to the medical facility in Charelston when it happened, but we had already moved east on the map and never needed to go back to test.
---
I believe it is. My special stats show +4 endurance. The BoS underarmor perk and another armor with +1endurance. I‚Äôll take all I can get for it as I have 0 perks slotted for endurance.
---
Nice
---
Executioner's Sledgehammer
---
40% more Power Damage
---
40% faster swing speed
---
A perfect roll would've been 90% reduced weight.
---
The lead dev tweeted it
---
This one.

---
Not bad ,nothing compared to my hunters bash damage pipe revolverüòè
---
If I can remember to get a shot of it when I‚Äôm on with my friend tomorrow afternoon I‚Äôll let you know. He‚Äôs got it and it does looks pretty cool. Not my cup of tea, but credit where it‚Äôs due.
---
Project paradise, right. Every time I‚Äôve done that the 3-8 people participating end up defending the one creature left alive if more than one was even spawned in the first place. And 80% of the time it‚Äôs just me waiting there for more than one other person to show up lol
---
That would be cool. I dunno tho.
---
Outstanding, thank you very much!
---
I know there‚Äôs a bunch at the whitesprings resort vendor. Most I find laying around or in vendor shops. What system are you on?
---
What if you know you just want to run and run?
---
It works the way it‚Äôs supposed to. It‚Äôs counting the number of times you‚Äôre collecting wood. Not how much wood you‚Äôre collecting. For the weekly challenge you can complete it faster by crafting 5 bulk of the following, aluminum, concrete, copper, gears and oil and then scrapping the bulk.
---
It shows in your stats screen, but you don‚Äôt get extra health for it and what not. At least that‚Äôs how it reacts atm
---
if you want to use sneak (stealth builds), you should max it. if you dont use it, leave it. i dont know excat numbers but i can tell my stealth commando with 15 AGI, sneak 3 and the chinese stealth armor can wander directly in front og any enemy and they dont care. i think its mostly the armor but "a little bit stealthy" wont be good. do it right or leave it at all.
---
Sell cooked meat (it's worth more cooked) and excess chems to the robot vendors. I can sell out the vendor every day from just these items. Most days I cannot even use hard bargin just so I don't sell out too quickly.
---
Ooooohhh ok that makes sense. I kept wondering why everyone was saying endurance perks were broken on armor.
---
Remind me in 35 minutes if you still need help
---
MAke a big, ugly, resource intensive blueprint of garbage. I have a blueprint that's like 4 foundations with like 20 stash boxes, plants, radios, concrete blocks, the whole deal that uses up almost all of the workshops free materials and can be placed all at once when I take the shop.
---
People have to pay for everything you build in the workshop to take it over, and just paying for this pile of junk I put down brings the cost to nearly 200 caps, which is far more than anyone could ever hope to get by killing me.
---
well, thats a szrong source :D   
---
thanks, didnt got that
---
A decent spot for flat land is in the Forest by the Gilman Lumber Co.  Moved my CAMP there yesterday cause I planned to renovate my CAMP to look like a bar.
---
A knife that let's you see the future. It told me that every roll will be something that sucks or I can't use.......
---
Hello, on xbox one(regular) i'm getting 4:11:1 error code for my private world.
---
Oh Really I got a weapon that shows my wallet draining after another month of fallout 1st..
---
These lil guys make me so so sad.
---
That roll is literally impossible. Both 40% SS and 40% PA occupy the same legendary effect slot (second star). Unless you mean 40% less damage taken when power attacking?
---
Scout armor is apparently classified as "light" in the PTS.
---
Yeah the less damage one sorry.
---
My bloodied build with a full set of unyielding armor has 31 agility and maxed out sneak.  I can solo a nuke silo without ever being spotted.  I have to switch to chinese stealth armor during the reactor section, but outside of that I'm basically invisible all the time to NPCs.  I think Sneak is absolutely worth it.
---
I Sell ammo, plans and chems for dirty cheap. 5.56, 45,5mm, shotgun shells are super popular. I sell for 1 cap a piece and can‚Äôt keep them in stock most the time. Sometimes i also sell 2mm mc i happen to find exploring for 2 caps. 
---
Theres also 1500 caps a day if you go farm weapons from somewhere like welch, hunterville or the mine right near whitesprings and walk them to the vendor at Closest  train station. Grab everything even the pipe guns and sell them. Server hop as needed. Probably 10 minutes of work for 1500 caps. 
---
Between player vending, farming and running events it adds up over time. The biggest advice is don‚Äôt  buy ammo or stimpaks from game vendors. Buy from other players. Especially ammo. Most players sell it dirt cheap.
---
Radiation rumble - rad barel thingy
---
Honorable mentions :  
---
Distant thunder 
---
AWOL armaments  
---
otherwise, there is not enough end-game content.  
---
I am helping newcommers - thats my currently end-game .. :D
---
I don‚Äôt even waste scrip on that only buy legendary modules
---
If someone starts attacking your camp again, leave the server ASAP.
---
Thanks. Someone else finished me off.
---
Selling flux is good man but you need to get a method down to farming the mats. Nuking a fissure works pretty good for mats. My favorite way is to nuke Morgan town..kill the ghouls, leave server. Rinse and repeat. Then just google a map of flora nuke, green thumb it up. Craft you‚Äôre flux with super duper and bing bang boom. Caps. I‚Äôd eventually get a serum recipe because they take up less room and are more profitable than flux.
---
What level are you?  The CAMP budget increases with your level.
---
Encryptid is good except you die a lot
---
We've all seen the time knife
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
Operation Tidy, Stings and Things, and Campfire Tales CAN (key word) all award a possum badge. I got my first 8 from qorld challenges, but the 8 i currently have are from doing these three events/missions.
---
Yeah this dude was 100% trying to make sure I didn‚Äôt buy something he wanted. 
---
Like yeah bro, I‚Äôm really out here tryna pick up that ghoul slayers machete for 5000 caps...
---
dunno your lvl but if you are lvl 30+ and are getting massacred by those check your gear, I'm melee and I can fight one a one (put agility perk to gain more def wile running) and I can take up to 5 lvl 62-68 druged with psycho/med-x  and 6 stins on pa like I did on the BoS cave mission. I'm lvl 32 btw
---
Crazy man some people are also just terrible online like they make it their main goal to just make someone mad.
---
I like the new ghouls, but they should definitely tweak some stuff
---
I would like to see them release a paint/skin that can be applied to ALL the armor. Like a pack of black, brown, camo etc. That way we could mix and match armors and it wouldn‚Äôt look so fucked.
---
That's what im thinking, a SH p.a with emergency protocols would have 85% dmg reduction , reduction is way more usefull than resistance,also that tiny dmg is something no other P.A offers,i think ill go for the SH too,i can gring the t-65 later.
---
It needs more moire.... Oh I kid...
---
Yeah his test where at full health with out lone wanderer. So if you're using nerd rage, ep, and lw I doubt there's be any difference at all
---
With it fully modded with calibrated shocks what is the carry weight compared to the excavator
---
I‚Äôve got an AAE 25 less vats fixer, a bloodied 25/15 handmade, a junkies 25/25 fixer, and two or three nice armor pieces. Those drops are few and far between though.
---
This. Also important to weigh is how difficult mod plans are to obtain. Ultracite and SH drop from the queen and some of them like calibrated shocks or targeting hud are brutal to get. T60 plans show up in bos events and various locations and can also be a pain to track down. T60 is also not craftable, you have to find the pieces and mod them. Excavator, raider and t45 and xo1 are all purchaseable with caps.
---
Now that made me lol
---
We‚Äôve been able to somewhat counter it by freezing her dumb as she in mid air. It‚Äôs not perfect, but we can take her out pretty quick, much faster than waiting for her to land.
---
I had the same problem!! Go to the settlers camp and talk to them about the scorched plague
---
If this type of thing happens you wont need to ft to camps which means you dont need to spend caps. Vendor hopping is some sort of cap sink in the game when you are maxed at caps you either gonna spend it with ft to camps or buying junk from whitespring
---
Id like to know what ur doin to acheive this been playing since release only time i acheive this is with enemy specific armor
---
T-65 Carry weight is the same as T-60, X-01, etc. Excavator Armor has a bonus to carry weight because it's a Mining suit.
---
I've got all but one mod for it.  Gt is username if you want me to build one for you.  Will need some scrap though... running a bit low on steel and stuff.
---
What mod you missing I might have it
---
Im not trying to sound horribly rude, but this is an aweful idea. You can finish all main quests before level 50. After that, the only things worth doing is going to other peoples camps to have a look see, dailies, and nuke something. Camo/vendor hoping is probably 95% of all end game fun.
---
Ah its a shame if it had the extra carry weight maybe id start grinding for it but I'm working on buying all the weapons and modds from the settlers gold bullion seller the gauss shotgun has my devoted attention lol
---
Almost looked like it was about to become a Joker Stairs situation there.
---
Not sure... got the barrel,  sight,  large mag, bayonet.. I know I've got 6 out of 7
---
Okay I guess if you can make a long barrel on for me that would be great two to three would help I can spare some materials to give to make it
---
Queen legendary &lt; uranium fever why because queen is just an enemy with 3 star nothing else and If you are doing queen for legendary item you are doing it wrong
---
Honestly, an automatic railway is enough to kill most of these wanna be griefers, and they still work with vats. Or, get yourself a buddy who likes murdering people.
---
During the reactor room, as soon as you enter turn left. A little bit down there‚Äôs gonna be a level 3 locked door. Pick it, go in, and close it behind you. There‚Äôs no robots in there, so you won‚Äôt be seen. And in that same room there‚Äôs a level 3 terminal that bypasses the reactor repair and opens the bulkhead doors again to the next part of the silo.
---
You know if you can build a basic low level one,  then scrap it,  you'll eventually unlock all the mods?
---
If you, for instance, did the raider side without doing the settler side, you would miss out on the Chinese Stealth Armor.  But all of the reputation based rewards are still accessible after a (very lengthy) reputation grind.
---
I do have the mod on my axe and I don‚Äôt have any issues. Looks like a ball with spikes
---
Lol if I shot a robot combat inhibitor it would just die
---
I start at the National Isolated Radio Array and head south to Huntersville, hitting up all of the buildings alone the road.  There are tons of Super Mutants and you can usually find legendaries at max level.
---
A buddy of mine liked to start at Abbies Bunker to the North East and head down route 65 to Watoga.
---
Dumb part is I‚Äôve been doing that but I don‚Äôt get the long barrel and it‚Äôs a pain in the a** to find it in the first place
---
Nah, it isn‚Äôt the armor. I have sneak and Agility maxes too, and I can walk right in front of stuff without the stealth suit too and never be seen.
---
Zealots explosive 90WR .50 cal for me.
---
You want *realism*... in a dieselpunk, post-apocalyptic setting where radiation zombies are a *thing*. ü§îü§îü§îü§î
---
Nope Assaultrons are bugged, have been since late FO4, its one of the many enemy mobs Beth has never bothered to fix after they broke them.
---
Charred Ghouls are also bugged, their Rad damage acts like you dont have any rad resistance even when you are in Stealth armour or Rad Suit and have 1000 rad resistance.
---
Mr Gutsys are fine, they are teh only mob I dont have an issue with being as OP as they are.
---
Do the quest line for the settlers as well before you raid the vault. This will give you the Chinese stealth suit instead of having to purchase it later. As far as rep, Ehh,  fuck the settlers. Paige is a prick.
---
oh neat. would love to get back to my bathrobe so i should try perhaps. what is your total AGI?
---
lol yeah, when wastelanders first came out i was like ‚Äúguess i‚Äôll go settlers‚Äù. but after completing the raiders quest line i‚Äôve decided i like them way better.
---
Disagree on all except gutsy
---
It's not too bad tbf, bit more of a pain in adventure mode. But I just run around down thumbing till everyone gets the idea to stop shooting the fucker in mid air.
---
In private worlds I just put an bullet into her every so often to stop her flying away and make sure you're on the floor. Because if you're on top of something she won't land if you're her target because the game thinks she can't attack you.
---
It's the base stats that make it special.
---
T-65 DR:565 ER:470 RR:470
---
T-60 DR:400 ER:370 RR:415
---
T-51 DR:454 ER:454 RR:305
---
X-01 DR:398 ER:453 RR:453
---
Ultracite DR:453 ER:393 RR:393
---
Strangler DR:453 ER:393 RR:500
---
Over all T-65 is a pretty stout Power Armor.
---
Shishkabab + Friendly Fire ftw
---
Instigating explosive +1 agility fixer
---
Do both questlines up to the Siding with x group point for max xp and rep, but it doesn‚Äôt really matter tbh lol pick who you want! You can build rep with both groups after the raid still :)
---
Right now my build is pick what ever card is useful at that time
---
oh phew, i thought the side i didn‚Äôt raid with would be pissed that i‚Äôd set them up to break in and then decided not to.
---
SH
---
Wait I don‚Äôt really under stand what is this for
---
Actually you're right, didn't know that. My friend told me to get it because it would improve accuracy on ranged attacks. Guess I should have paid attention to the actual effect. Looking at the mods I would say either brawling or weighted would be the best option, depending on your playstyle.
---
That ain't bad
---
Upvoted not only because that was very informative but also because I 10000% expected that I was about to be rickrolled when I clicked that link.
---
Damn...
---
It sounds good, but believe me, I‚Äôve rolled a metric fuck ton of scrip with that mumbling asshole ü§£
---
Mine would be a B2525
---
Would ruin the game and make bargain finds a thing of the past.
---
Just go and look at fifas transfer market......a single person can raise the cost of a player because they're uber rich and buy hundreds of them. 
---
Can you imagine someone doing that on fallout with some of the already insanely rare items? 
---
I'd rather server hop, see people's camps and have the satisfaction of finding an absolute beauty at a bargain price. 
---
Not to mention, I get great enjoyment out of wheeling and dealing weapons and armor using my knowledge of what people want and what will sell.
---
If you want an "auction site" market 76 on here is all you need for trading.
---
Just shoot her with a Cryolator and the bitch will be so easy to kill you will wonder why you would ever bother trying to cripple her.
---
Better yet if she is cryolated while on the ground she stays there for a long damn time.
---
Why I persevere with my shotty build in spite of much adversity!
---
 Yup.  I made like 20 altogether just to get the 6 mods I have.  Made another 10 or so to try and get the last mod,  but no luck yet.  There is a perk you can use I think but I cant remember what it's called.  
---
How many have you made/scrapped? 
---
I'll be on later if you're still struggling
---
It depends what you are looking for. If you want legendaries go to places like West Tek, and run events like AWOL armaments, monster mash, one Violent night or horde events. If you want a challenge, the best events are encryptid, project paradise and radiation rumble. If you want rare plans there are lots and lots of them from random encounters to events. Free range alone has like 23 of them for example. 
---
But yeah, there is nothing even close to being as difficult or in depth as the vault raids were. It's a shame that they closed them instead of fixing them especially with public teams coming out, which would have fixed one of the biggest problems, matchmaking.
---
Which is the real stupid thing. Intentionally abusing things on live servers isn't good or smart, but the whole point of public test servers are to simulate every possible abuse or exploit people can think of, and patch it before it goes to live. A lot of potentially game breaking bugs in various other games get fixed like that.
---
Use a cryolator on her, she hardly flys about when frozen and when on the ground she stays there for ages.
---
I definitely agree endgame you can shred with anything but with other guns you at least gotta aim or vats them singularly. This monster aoe arcs anything in its range, you can just shoot the floor and still get them. Sometimes you get the odd stragglers getting through but not with this
---
It's all relative to your character and expectations. I once got a b/e shotgun that inspired me to build a bloodied shotgunner. I got a junkies/ ffr handmade, that sparked an interest to experiment with drugs and alcohol I never felt in the 40+years prior. Recently I got a b/ffr .50 cal machine gun, but I couldn't use it. I sold it, and then posted about it; everybody said I should've traded it, but I work 6 days a week, and don't know where to trade or how to not get ripped off, or does items, so it's just as well.
---
It's only possible to pull the Shielded Lining Plan from Queen of the Hunt IF you already have all the other Casual Lining Plans
---
If you girl they hit bag flaps &lt;3
---
I too hate assaultrons. I was walking to Watoga and was ambushed, then stalked by one. I was in a group with some higher levels and they finally came to help me, but even though we were the same level I couldn‚Äôt get more than 2 hits on it before it melted my face.
---
I know my baseline is 15, not sure if I have any mutations that modify it at all though. I know I don‚Äôt have any armor that does anything, though.
---
Yes. Be careful not to blow yourself up.
---
My character is bloodied/ unyielding and still rocks a junkies weapon. They're far easier to obtain and with better secondary perks. If you already have a good bodied primary weapon, keep it and try a junkies secondary for a bit.
---
Bruh
---
Same for everything you putt on display.
---
They should work on a display limit (in num√©rique of objects, cause they are alot different), outside of camp limit, but taking space into inventory
---
i used to fight her for the stable flux, cause I couldn't be bothered to farm the materials.
---
now i just fight her for the lulz
---
I encountered this once and it‚Äôs weird.
---
A guy came but and bought 2 armors from me, and I immediately logged out right after the second notification popped up cuz I‚Äôm maxed out on caps.
---
HOWEVER, when I joined a random server later, the stuff he bought were in a paper bag on the other side of my camp(relatively to the vendors).
---
This creeped me out. Since it‚Äôs impossible for someone to buy a thing from the vendor then immediately run to another side of my camp AND drop 2 specific items.
---
Nothing will be messed up, you won't even lose rep with the one you didn't chose. The only thing you'll fail is the quest "siding with" the side you didn't chose.
---
I will work on it soon thanks for the information it helps alot
---
I would try that event more but no one wants to wait for everyone to tag the legendary spawns.
---
Because their objective is not to make a fun game. But a game you have to come back every day to login.
---
If could level fast and obtain your legendaries so easily, you would soon stop playing
---
nice. i think with mutations my AGI is around 19 and tbh i didnt tried any other armor since i got the CSA. but it doesnt look good at all and i miss my bathrobe with the chef hat...i will just try it without the csa, thanks for making me overthink it
---
Okay I‚Äôll be back on in a few outs cause it‚Äôs 2am right now I mainly need screws for me to get what I need to mass make lower lvls
---
I‚Äôve been replying FO4 too. Put about 30 hours in on a new character. Im not noticing much difference with the movement of my character compared to FO76. If anything my character feels a little heavier, that might be what you‚Äôre referring too. It‚Äôs just not bothering me.
---
What does bother me is being able to carry your PA frame in your inventory like F76.   
---
Also, I love the survival-lite gameplay mechanics in F76 compared to the regular difficulty in FO4. ( And no, I don‚Äôt want to play Survival mode in FO4 necessarily.)
---
Also, all the junk in FO76 seems so much more meaningful and has more uses in my opinion. In FO4 I was surprised how much  I missed scrapping at work benches. Little things!
---
And finally I absolutely love the map of FO76 so much more than FO4‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt get me FO4 is beautiful, but F76‚Äòs map is so much more immersive and enjoyable in my opinion.
---
I'm pretty sure that in public groups the only building you can do is in public workshops you can edit or modify individual players camps
---
Still need to find the conduits plan befire even thinking about it lol
---
You can also have random encounters in set locations to up your rep there are maps out there
---
Yes but anything after 1 or 2 points is wasted.
---
No problem. It's a horrible grind and I didn't even maximize it, some day's I just didn't feel like trying to get enough Notes to get 200 Bullion and would just settle on 100, so it took me longer.
---
But they do they have arms that reach 6 feet long? No. You dont see their arms stretch ever and no fallout lore says that they do.
---
Well you can tame a wild Brahmin as well as having one from the Brahmin Pen (aka Fertilizer Producer). And with so little know  about the upcoming "pets" feature, it's unknown if it will replace or compliment the existing taming system. Who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è maybe you could have three Brahmin
---
Shouldnt they launch your farther with their hits?
---
I‚Äôm on pc.  Have bloodied sniper rifle for sale.
---
Or the double stats when armor is repaired to 200%.
---
Also funny with the anti PA mod from the plasma gun
---
Right because the server crashing the instant she crop dusted player was so much better.
---
alot of duped stuff
---
Cool idea, but maybe it should be more often and way less than 500 bullion. If you couldn‚Äôt get on, that would suck and you‚Äôd have to wait another month. If you won and got the bullion, you wouldn‚Äôt run out u til next month when you can do it again.
---
That's just a set bonus feature of the T65
---
buy Gold from Smiley, buy all Plans and Recipes
---
also, remember Bethesda's objective is NOT to keep us playing the game. It's to keep us logging in every day. Hence the reason for the daily caps
---
farmable floor tile is where its at
---
Lost all my robot models :( but I am too lazy to get more every time.
---
Thank you. If you find out anything else, please inform me
---
I lost do many things when display case gone.    Why can‚Äôt they just NOT scrap from Stash?
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
It was all just an illusion, yer trippin ballz
---
As far as I am aware, this skin is still broken. I would not recommend using it.
---
If I knew, or if it's even possible, I would have done that already....
---
From what I can tell, I cannot contact them directly unless they are already online.
---
just leave and log back, thats the best way to go and make them understand what they do is useless
---
This needs to blow up on a post or something!
---
Use the camera
---
Yeah but the things is with my perspective is like i need that meat. My point i am really hoping like actual raising herds and then calf brahmin for a continous supply. Ugh I really hope it does get there.
---
you need to have rep for this and i‚Äôm kinda done with the grind on this.
---
I had a party member shoot my walls once and no damage was apparent.    I‚Äôm confused.
---
you can stay south of the complex, where there is the hydra thing on the map, and Never get nuked.
---
Thats where my camp is, and been destroyer once by someone missnuking the golf club during double XP weekend (which made me very pissed as i couldnt even farm for the price of my camp)
---
I prefer using a Cryolator to to put her in a near paralysis state. Takes about 60 cells. Works every time!
---
Terrifyingly brutal encounters: FO3 Reavers.  I‚Äôd like a mix of behavioral types in new iterations.
---
NFL OT size and speed.
---
the fact that it allmost Never happens shows hiw Nice the community is actually 
---
And if he had reacted correctly, it wouldnt even have been a thread on reddit
---
Mostly yes. If it's an explosive that still drops in game it should. The first batch of weapons that became legacy it doesn't but thet later ones, at least the harpoon gun, it still does.
---
My legendaries have been beter see y‚Äôall at 8p tomorrow
---
I don't think this game will ever be what it is that we are all looking for, unfortunately. So many potential opportunities overlooked. I just hope another company learns from the many many mistakes and creates the ideal vision that this game could've been - a game that could've been like EVE Online where people dedicate themselves to it for 17 years. And yes, farming, produce, and commerce would be a big part of that vision. In a post-apocalyptic world, as soon as people have secured their own safety and survival to the extent of their abilities, trade and bartering would be the logical next step. I'll give you some of my yield of brahmin meat if you build me some laser turrets. I'll supply you with corn if you then provide me with some of the alcohol you produce from it. And so on. Instead, we have vending machines, and ice boxes locked behind a paywall to prevent food spoilage. A shame, really. But I just hope something greater is built upon the ashes.
---
Happens all the time. Killed a 3 star behemoth and it dusted, couldn't find the corpse at all.
---
Tip: Use the camera. It tells you what you're looking at in the upper right corner. If you have the enemy corpse in range and in field of view, it will be listed in the top corner.
---
As a whole, Secret Service Armor looks shit, even the helmet.
---
I Wish they had a frontal lamp mod for Ranger Helmet
---
Just favorite your armor pieces, youll at least have a Warning
---
Have you tried scrapping/replacing the display they were in then logging out and back in again? I've read that has fixed it for some people.
---
Thank you very much! I only do Fallout shots but if you would like to see more please check out https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery
---
Side note. The Gauss weapons also benefit from the demolition expert card even if they don‚Äôt  have the explosiv attribute
---
I could be wrong but I don't think it was like that when the game came out. I remember a patch where they buffed NPCs ability to land a melee hit.
---
Stop i can hurt too much. I loved Fallout 76 but i really wanted to get into EVE and just imagining a game with the same action rpg elements of fallout and the complexity of EVE just makes me hurt even more. Doesnt help the fact fallout 76 is available in my region in steam and EVE isnt.
---
Press X to win mentality. 
---
I don't like to torment myself, but I agree with having some sort of a difficulty curve in my adventure game.

I understand. I myself have been trying to do the last ending I never did, which is BOS. Didn't get too far, wasn't gonna bother with settlements and made it to Danse and did the Arkjet mission.
---
Haven't played much since, my problem is mainly with looting. It's natural for me to loot everything, everywhere. So not doing it feels wrong and like I'm rushing but I also don't wanna loot because I feel there is no real purpose. Let me explain.
---
I feel looting in FO4 isn't gonna matter once I finish this playthrough and if I wanna loot I probably am better off doing so in FO76 because it'll add to my Scrap Box and I'll have more of the needed components when I need them.
---
So it's been difficult going back, I mainly just wanna experience the story and side quests again but not looting feels so very wrong. Also....doing a playthrough knowing I won't be siding with The Institute also feels very wrong.
---
I have never heard of some of those notes you were talking about, but I have only been playing since January.  However, I am very familiar with the "Delbert" recipes, because those recipes are static spawns in several locations across the Forest, which happen to be part of some of my regular farming routes, so I run across them all of the time and I have them available when I am cooking.  However, if you are looking through the cooking menu for anything that starts with "Delbert", then you will not find them.  When you are cooking, things like "Delbert's Appalichili" just shows up as "Appalachili".  "Delbert's Tato Salad Surprise" is just "Tato Salad Surprise", etc.
---
I really dont care for the reward, hell it could be a pipe pistol.  Im just thinking, that would be a really cool event
---
That's a lot of wolves.
---
That doesnt bother me quite as much as what I might call Phantom Melee Acrobatic Olympics. It's where an enemy charges straight at you, and you charge straight at it.  You try to time your melee to land at the right time, but somehow the enemy phases right through you like a ghost, and also simultaneously hits you, and you have to spin around and around flailing wildly hoping that hit boxes are a thing Bethesda has heard of before.
---
Same with Yao Guais
---
The queen to land on at Queen fights
---
I only encountered one and the insult was the one that goes like ‚ÄúI heard you got drunk and missed exiting Vault 76 on time. Too bad you didn't do the same thing before entering it!‚Äù It really hurt man
---
As far as I could ever tell, it did not.
---
False. It has been tested multiple times that all legacy weapons benefir from demo expert.
---
If you would love 5 mins needing to join a server and constant lags
---
This is so cool. Well done!
---
First rank is 20%, and all the rest are 10%. How is everything beyond 1-2 ranks wasted exactly?
---
I am betting they'll rerelease it on PS5 and Xbox Series X, probably at full price.
---
Testing right now. No change on either a cryolator or a flamer.
---
Keep the gold for yourself. U lose a little rep but meh the golds worth more and complete settlers until u have the stealth suit
---
i personally recommend siding with one crew then keeping all the gold for yourself. it doesn't hurt your rep with either that bad.
---
Assaultrons are bugged. I have no idea if Bethesda ever acknowledged this but their fuck off face melter is not supposed to be instant fire. It's supposed to charge up before it goes off and I'm pretty sure that it used to do that before one of the patches broke it.
---
If it isn't bugged and indeed intentional I want them to fix the Salvaged Assaultron Head because that is clearly not as fast or destructive as an Assaultron.
---
The rest, well, the problem is that all damage is calculated in various ways. 
---
You have "On Hit". Enemy slaps you, shoots you.
---
You have "Over time". Radiation, poison, fire, acid, energy.
---
You have "AOE (area of effect)". Explosives plus some enemy attacks.
---
You have hidden buffs. 
---
Damage dealt to you, or dealt to enemies, can be any combination of the above, which is why
---
some enemies can be a real problem since there is no way to mitigate ALL potential incoming damage via perks or armor easily.
---
Worst offenders being the Floaters. Their attacks are a combination of all 4. It's on hit plus over time plus the AOE plus the hidden AA buff. 
---
If their is an overpowered enemy in the game, it's the flying nutsacks.
---
it doesn't show on damage numbers. But on health bars. Look up some you tube videos from Angry Turtle and Captainoob.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since jan. I roll on 4 max toons a day. Every day. I‚Äôve had an AAE25 handmade. JE+p handmade and Uny sneak/ap marine arm. The rest have been mainly crap
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Sadly this isn‚Äôt how it works, all the base game weapons show up at the purveyor even if you don‚Äôt know the plans. Only weapons that don‚Äôt show up if you know the plan is the GB weapons, bows, and the fixer as far as I know.
---
(I had this same idea for handmades.)
---
Well giant crab is like twice the size of the deathclaw though
---
After you finish the quests you really want to think about what you want now compared to what you‚Äôre willing to grind for. I‚Äôm not positive but I think there‚Äôs only about 2 missions a day that will give you rep with either faction. I believe there are people from both factions scattered around the map that you can help but even then it‚Äôs not much. I suggest you look up the loot you get for siding with either faction to help you decide. Also, not everything is purchasable after finishing the vault. You‚Äôll have to max your rep to get the good stuff!
---
What would the discord be for?
---
In the meantime STAY OF THE FUCKING BUNKER!
---
She lands much more often if there is no one on the bunker or if she is focussing someone who isn't on the bunker.
---
Man the things people think of in this game has not stopped amazing me!
---
Honestly idek
---
I suggested this before 76 came out and was shat on. Glad to see the idea come back.
---
god i love insult bot
---

---
Captainnoobs video clip, small reference to his tests while he is putting the build together.
---
The only hard enemy in the whole game is the Impostor and not even she is hard enough to be considered "overpowered".
---
Not sure if we can put our photos in other people galleries but we should be able to do that too
---
This would be a good way to incorporate gold bullion more- especially with the premise that it will start to circulate generally in the Appalachia economy.
---
Pretty sure in some factory theres a chess board with a bunch if them
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but I think you can find the blueprint skin for the Pipboy Mk 3000 prototype in the game. Don‚Äôt know for sure if it‚Äôs that skin you mean which I remember.
---
I‚Äôve noticed ever since equipping the ‚ÄúEscape Artist‚Äù perk that enemies don‚Äôt notice me even while right in front. So I don‚Äôt use 3 points just opting for Escape Artist.
---
Alot of people saved the pails after the event and the plans and are now putting them up for quick and easy caps. 
---
However, duping is very viable as a possibility as it is possible to do outside of vending. Which is annoying but sadly can't be stopped.
---
same, the armour itself is just too underwhelming for the amount of grinding it requires, i didn't really notice any difference in damage taken between my t-65 and my previous set of unmodded ultracite
---
It was a skin for the pip boy that just changed the colour, I think it‚Äôs labelled as the MkVII
---
You know when you just feel suspicious when you see a vendor which was holding 3 Safari Croc Plans, 5 Circus Trailers etc, next one along had a few and just rang odd with me! Totally understand people holding onto the pails to use later it just struck me as suspicious
---
Doesnt bethesdas bot ban you for cheating when you mod
---
It‚Äôs totally plausible, don‚Äôt forget that even though it‚Äôs in the past, the pip boys were all created before the War. It would be good to see some future NPC‚Äôs with different PipBoys
---
Not super realistic but its bethesda. Everythings a featyre to them
---
Yeah it is suspicious, like I said it is still possible to dupe items so that's the most likely option really. I just want try to give the benefit of the doubt.
---
You might have more luck in 8 days, when the Public Teams come out. ([Patch 20](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2Pp7LRjLjBUGy5fEJzLNvy/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-public-teams-overview-and-fasnacht-stats) on June 30th)
---
Some guy gave me 100 holiday packages for free and I asked him why and he just msged me "I like giving people stuff". I got 10k from those gifts.
---
Seriously? I thought it was just crappy physics making me take damage from something but the HP boost actually makes more sense.
---
Beat the system
---
Same here, it‚Äôs a shame but currently seems unavoidable! Now if only I can save caps and find a Deathclaw mask in a vendor
---
I sneak around in the grass man
---
Yeah sounds more plausible. I don‚Äôt remember it correctly since it was back then when wastelander dropped where I found that skin
---
Mate I'm with ya. I've been looking for those aswell
---
I smell some issues here. Vendors are like trouble magnets.
---
Would i have to take all the items out of the box and put them back in if i wanna server hop or get offline
---
I lost hundreds of hours making settlements in FO4, now 76 let‚Äôs me play with my girlfriend (she‚Äôs real I swear LOL) we‚Äôve built loads of stuff together. 
---
If you ever come across me online man, help yourself to resources etc.
---
They should go back into your stash, I've had my Fasnacht masks on display in my last 3 camps and I've never taken them out before scrapping the camp. I will generally find a spot to place my new camp in a public server and then move to a private server to build, I have heard relogging is meant to fix this, as has been mentioned already, so its possible I just haven't noticed.
---
I‚Äôll drop a message if I ever find more than one! Haven‚Äôt found anything rare enough yet to trade for one
---
Bethesda really likes raiders for some reason. Maybe its because they both steal from others?
---
Sweet, I shall do the same then
---
While the Ghoul Reavers in FO76 are the least threat when compared to other Ghouls. It makes no sense.
---
to be honest i hate the wave events because it always takes far too long for the next wave to spawn, the only exception is the heart of the swamp event, but it takes way too long for the heart to open up after you have killed the current wave, so it evens out.
---
I wish I could find one of those vendors, been offering an arm and a leg for some of those plans haha
---
If you killed it in air, dust pile is exactly there... unfortunately goo piles and dust piles are invisible from below
---
Yes but unfortunately that is at the end of the year given that that they don‚Äôt delay it more.
---
I wish I took the name down of the vendor! If I see any again I can always give a shout, I saw the SC plan for about 15k in one vendor &amp; 25k in another. I‚Äôll add you here and give you a shout if I see any again
---
Don't need YouTube, I've got the game in front of me. You're right, the damage definitely changes with demo equipped on both weapons but the amounts are far more erratic where as they hit for the same amount each time without. Good old Bethesda eh.
---
Definitely. Anything vendor or display case related  is going to cause new exploits. So my suggestion is probably never going to be looked into. It would still make a very handy addition to selling loot. A high level vendor with legendaries, and a lower level vendor with free starter gear. Just felt like sharing the idea.
---
Yes. This
---
I do too
---
You sound creepy as hell putting your age and sex in the title.
---
Two of my main characters are melee builds and when ever I come across Yao Gui it's a pain, but interesting enough of you get that first block in you can finish them off before they finish you with their "super-duper over kill stun-gun claw slap"
---
I see where you're coming from, but that's just business. Buy low, sell high - or buy low for scrap.
---
Besides, unless you have a sign saying "These items are for newbies, please let them take it" how are people supposed to know your intentions?
---
To be fair, if I'm browsing vendors and see free shit, if I can somehow use it or potentially resell it, I'm gonna take it, because I don't know the owner's intentions.
---
But if there was a sign above a vending machine saying "Free gear for new players" and it was all low-end stuff, I'd probably leave it alone.
---
If you're not actually advertising as such, other people aren't the problem.
---
Whats the harm in trading?
---
I am like you, have been playing since release. Currently ~lvl320, bloodied stealth commando build.
---
IMO all the bane weapon/armor aren't efficient. (Arguably troubleshooter may be worthwhile in Encrytid and silo runs) I am just running a typical bloodied build with 5xUNY armour and a random two-star bloodied handmade. I guess it really depends on perk card arrangements and the stealth playstyle for me not to die that often. (And I am not even min-maxing, I have lots of weight reduction perks)
---
Perk cards with %dmg reduction like blocker, lone wanderer and serendipity perform way better than straight up +DR/ER. I don't die to ghouls and yaoguais due to blocker. I out-DPS gutsies and sentrybots. The only challenges for me would be the invisible assaultron because I can't VATS, or a surprised DoT damage from SBQ/mirelurk.
---
1. Get rare event stuff
---
2. Wait until some time after the event ends
---
3. Start selling rare gear
---
This is a pretty good business model.
---
No stimpaks or radaway
---
Yup..
---
It would be cool if they gave us the ability to break parts off of tough enemies like in monster hunter
---
If it was in the air then you probably won't be able to loot it until you can jump up to the level of the ash pile.
---
Leveling above 50 does not make you more powerful, so a level 62 ghouls should of course hit a 50 just as hard as a level 8000
---
Nothing
---
Troubleshooter armor helps
---
NO. the queen is far too easy as it is.
---
Queen needs a tail swipe that only a maxed PAIN TRAIN can tank. Everybody else goes flying and takes damage. Buff her range attack because right now we are just tanking everything. A swoop grab attack for folk on roofs and fences will also be great.
---
Yes of course. A description of the vendor seen at a glance to show your intentions should be put next to them. And then the lock ensures nobody abuses the sellers helpful nature. 
---
It is difficult to trust people with just a note, so these level locked vendors could create some security.
---
Probably never going to happen, but it would sure be nice to have.
---
They were from the previous month.
---
It is not the new ,, two hand mace ,, skin. It was the Stanley, Goalie stick with mounted stanley cup with some ice skates ... :D
---
They‚Äôre bonuses for the raider and settler bundle that released with Wastelanders.
---
yeah, thanks mate .)
---
That‚Äôs a month to grind my final atoms
---
Wait, why? I only did that because I don't want anyone being uncomfortable when they hear me on the mic?
---
Just for extra lolz; when doing that little experiment I was server hopping to kill the same thing to keep the numbers accurate. It put me back on the same server 5 times in a row. Never does that when you want it.
---
That would be months of work. What tail? Queen I a quick grind for a bit of scrip, treasury notes, and kits. Making an uber pain in the ass is counterintuitive. If her AI was not cancer you wouldn‚Äôt need to cripple her but she flys around all over the map, inside the mesh, lands for half a second and takes off. She needs to receive limb damage for the fight to be reasonable.
---
Ooh, thanks for letting me know. And I feel you, I do play solo a lot just to do those kinds of things. I mostly want consistent people to play those grindy events with.
---
ED-E was made in 2275, so it‚Äôd be impossible for it to be in 76.
---
Yes but with diminishing returns
---
An instanced interior would be homeplate in FO4 for example. They most likely will give us a cellar door to place down which would lead to a bunker we can customize. It would most likely have its own budget as well as it is in its own cell.
---
Lol that‚Äôs possibly months of engine tweaking and programming to alter maybe three enemies. I like the idea but it‚Äôs unlikely.
---
Literally lol. That‚Äôs the point
---
I mean I would as I‚Äôm curious but if you‚Äôd rather not even have the option just don‚Äôt build it.
---
I'd make my own is what I was implying, sorry if I led you to misunderstand
---
How do you know it's 2 level 200 players if you were solo elsewhere?
---
Not discounting a new exploit, could also be they a bunch of enemies to your camp &amp; let them destroy it.
---
Oh yeah I probably should‚Äôve said a couple weeks ago I did buy the Raiders &amp; Settlers content bundle, so do I have access to them?
---
I always thought AA (ignores 50%) and tank killer 36% meant it was a total of 86%? Is that right?
---
My main issue with the game as of now is the excessive amount of time spent on crafting ammo and getting the materials to do so. If you have any sort of automatic weapon you're gonna be running around crafting 25% of the time - which gets tiresome.
---
It even broke my armor
---
So you‚Äôre asking if eyebots in general will exist. Maybe as a camp pet. I‚Äôd gladly take an eyebot over another Dogmeat, but I‚Äôd still rather have a deathclaw.
---
This guy was the worst when I was looking for a Deathclaw to tame. I'd go to the crashed vertibird near house of fears only to see that robot marching towards me.
---
Same. I hate the idea of this lil guy being all alone down there. He‚Äôs so small and frail looking.
---
Though maybe if we change the narrative and believe he‚Äôs actually living out the dream of being a badass cave explorer it won‚Äôt seem so sad?
---
Nuclear Winter on PC simulator
---
Theres usually a bunch of high level ghouls in that area, one or two of which are in that room. Could you be getting thumped by a ghoul thats not spawning in properly?
---
I believe there's an exploit involving explosive bait that allows you to destroy camps. Never felt the need to try it so couldn't be 100%. There's definitely something weird with pacifist as I walked in on a bunch of people pvping last night and took some damage, albeit a very small amount, despite having it on.
---
Should be under one if the skins tab then.
---
Yes and no, I'd like to be able to build one and have it follow me around on quests, but at the least have It as a camp buddy
---
Put a lock on them and I guarantee people will rage.
---
We're already limited to how much we can sell, how much we can scrip (both buy and sell) and have a storage limit.
---
Restrict what people can BUY, and that'll be the shit-flavoured cherry atop the shitcake.
---
Just do what I do - keep some basic gear on me, and if I see a low level player, I'll just go to them and drop it. Cut out the middleman.
---
Random spawn locations, I've had him spawn next to my camp a couple of times
---
Very well could be i go in and there are no ghoul to see at all
---
PSN id: xxplaguewind
---
I probably won't be looking at grouping until the Public Teams comes out and makes it worth swapping out my Lone Wanderer perk, but I'm always down to talk Fallout, trade, or just help each other out with mods or transferring or keeping an eye out for certain items etc
---
yeah lets just make it easier. Maybe Besthesda can let us pick up small rocks and give us a 'Throw Stones' perk that stacks with the Agility, Enforcer perk, Junkies and Bloodied builds as well.
---
No,it's not additive. If I did my maths right, it's closer to 54%
---
I live in Finland and i have never been able to realm hop properly without using the friendslist. It seems to be that the game servers will try to put you on the fastest servers they can find. And on a remote location like Finland, where there are less players than in central europe for instance, i will most of the time just get the same server or two over and over again. Most of the people i have on my friendslist are from US and other far away places and when i realm hop there i always have lots of lag.
---
I was shopping at someone's camp when a naked level 5 showed up with a minigun that fired explosive bait, the whole camp was gone in seconds.
---
Thank you! So if I run tank killer might as well look into a diff leg effect on a gun huh?
---
Jus dont understand how when i die it wont let me spawn anywhere not even v76
---
Unless you have nothing better, then yeah.
---
Got it! Thanks bro ü§ù
---
Also, it's an incentive to see people's camp designs &amp; possibly socialise.
---
Strangler PA definitely. Mods are much easier to get (the only rare drop is ultracite calibrated shock but it can get cheaply for around 20-30 k on market 76). It has a acid atack which was to be speak nerf into oblivion by BugThesda since those morons couldnt fix the issue like the modders did but it is still proper buff to atack.
---
Yep you are right my good fellow they where invisible lol had to close down the game altogether jus gone in there and was 4 of them ghouls.....was a freaky experience. Serves me right for being a stealth build guess them ghouls wanted to show me how it feels to be killed from out of nowhere lolüôÉ
---
That father winter helmet on the right is pretty cool too.
---
Seems like they‚Äôre adding a gauss variety to all weapon types, so... expect gauss melee weapons soon.
---
It's latency between the server and you; they're already going for an attack before you jump.
---
&gt;Edit - umm, I dunno how providing my age and sex is ~creepy, I'm just tired of people disconnecting when they learn that I'm a female, and I don't want to play with kids.
---
And here I thought you'd have to fight off the thirsty lads climbing over each other to play with you &amp; make things awkward.
---
I was able to do this until wastelanders update!  But when I asked about it, nobody responded and friends couldn't remember being able to or not.
---
I miss it, I used to fast travel closer to other places and save caps.
---
You can get ultracite calibrated shocks recipe easily by using market 76. These plans were duped to oblivion when raids were still on.  I got them myself for only 20 k caps.
---
I very highly doubt Bethesda will just let it follow you, and I‚Äôm basing that on the fact that both Beckett and space lady are allies, and the after you have them at your camps they both only go on quests with you during the final quest for each. And even then, only on instanced interiors.
---
Same here. I use the Lone Wanderer perk but mostly I'm playing the game to just chill and do whatever I want.
---
Also, I'm assuming a few of the requests are probably players accidently inviting me to a team when they really just wanted to fast travel to whatever location I'm at and clicked too fast.
---
I'm gonna take a wild stab in the dark that you're on pc?
---
If you die overloaded that usually happens although that can happen because of the glitchiness of the game too
---
Yeah Ive encountered some weird shit on some servers too. I think sometimes hopping servers or even restarting the game is the best
---
Umm, no. I've just learned it attracts more general assholes than thirsty dudes.
---
And why do you need to cripple sbq? She sits down pretty frequently if players are not stupid sneakers on fence
---
Not like you can stop the general public from littering the place with tents and standing on everything. I generally try to just stay in the grass but I can‚Äôt force people to be competent.
---
Or the "magic" damage some weapons do if you have around 200 fire-rate and specific prefix.
---
ohh wait, that hasn't been fixed for ages lol.
---
So far a Q/25/25 gamma gun.
---
A _TON_ of the code to support it is still in place: the Pip-Boy UI files include a number of code forks for dealing with the companion app being active.
---
I wonder if they disabled it over concerns about it giving PvP advantages to people using the App vs people who are not?
---
Decorative items and the ammo converter. That‚Äôs basicaly it.
---
My experiance with my junky commando is that you dont need it for normal farming if you have escape artist + high agi + one armor with harder to detect. But in special situations like the imposter sheepsquatch i use the sneak perk. Tried without it too but got detected more often then. But for normal runs like west tek or the burrows i dont need the perk
---
Do you have the prime receiver mod?  No amount of scrapping will get you that.
---
That‚Äôs a different bundle you‚Äôre talking about. Those bundles come with the power armor skins and planters and such but not the tent skins. Those were like the Ranger skin and the current Atomic Camo you can claim in the AS. Sadly not there anymore.
---
Well overwatch launched with 21hz. And Blizzard improved it. So maybe Bethesda will do the same?
---
Haha. Who am i kidding...?
---
Not the bundle, you needed to have fo1st that month to claim them.
---
&gt;  hard to integrate into 76
---
The Fo76 UI code still includes the support libraries for the companion app and various functions actually check whether it's active or not.
---
Probably they disabled it for some reason like not wanting to give advantage to PvP players using it vs. those not using it, because the guts are all still there in the code.
---
Nope.
---
Finally! Make power armor great again!
---
How can you access the source code?
---
No. It is multiplicative based on the remaining armor amount. It ignored 50, then ignores 36% of that 50% (order doesn't matter). Total ignore: 68%.

Working fine on PC
---
DEAD
---
The funny thing with this issue is if you take berry mentats the invisible enemies still glow. It's handy if this is a persistent problem.
---
I know that AWOL is a guaranteed lvl 50 3*, sometimes two, but why is distant thunder worth it?
---
The "SeventySix - Interface.ba2" file in the game's Data directory contains the "pipboy_*.swf" Flash/ActionScript user interface files. 
---
Use the FO4 CreationKit Archive2 tool or BAE to extract the files, and an Adobe Flash decompiler like JPEXS to read the code.
---
A melee weapon that uses heavy ammo. Brilliant!!  Personally I would go all out and make it use rockets or mini nukes but 2mm is okay I guess.
---
I was kicked from 2 servers btb, giving it a break for now. Xbox for me btw
---
Dunno. Last time I was there all of them woke up and started explaining me how to get to rad city and how to become a mayor.
---
I'm stuck with 49 too. I still see the damn pic that I deleted as a load screen though.
---
I don‚Äôt know how OP knows what level they were,  but I can confirm that using explosive bait will damage other people‚Äôs camps.
---
If and when Bethesda 'fix' unyielding I'll stop playing, PA makes be claustrophobic and I love running bloodied in my leather, I hate PVP and avoid other players in Adventure except their camps, I live in FO1st.
---
I do not have any effect on anyone else and will react badly if I get penalized because people want my fun lessened because they feel they have less fun.
---
 I also dislike other players thumping about in their metal coffins, they look goofy, they are loud and make my world shake, I think PA should be greatly nerfed so they have no area effect when bumbling about and jumping.
---
Sorry to hear it
---
Probably in the air, you can just barely see the outline from underneath
---
I fight her for the flux and advanced repair kits for a long time now. Sometimes she drops that 1\* armor or melee I just need for my last 3/5 scrip of the day :)
---
Oh I see a workshop fun regardless.
---
Mannequins and even a rock has bled when I shot it, that's not a good argument. It's dead, the Interloper in Lucky Hole Mine is dead too.
---
I absolutely disagree. Players are given extremely, and I mean EXTREMELY strong weapons and build options, which make ALL the enemies (except end game bosses) in the game die in one or two hits. 
---
If you are playing bloodied build, and crying about that something can kill you... Something which is supposed to be an challenge in the game. Then you should recount your math. Bloodied builds are LOW HEALTH builds, and you sound like you want to play a god who just jumps around, oneshots everything and is literally unkillable. 
---
I would argue heavily against such gameplay, since Fallout 76 is actually SUPER EASY. If anything, Bethesda should introduce enemies which are far stronger then the ones you've mentioned, since we kill everything so fast, that it is no longer any challenge or fun. I want to see more enemies which make me go "oh crap, it's this guy, I have to play SMARTER and BETTER in order to not get kill". I don't enjoy running around like a invincible mass-murdering steroided kangaroo. I want more tougher enemies.
---
Hey! That is my master plan!:)

My bf's camp just got destroyed as well by someone using some sort of explosive grenade. Not in PvP, no alert. He caught him though and killed him before logging off. This was on PC and the guy was lvl 800.
---
The interloper in lucky hole mine actually moves dude.
---
Why are these exploit runners always naked, is that part of the hack?
---
It's a reasonably well known exploit. We're probably seeing more of this sort of thing because the griefing community is sulking because the upcoming patch 20 is figuratively taking one of their toys off them.
---
Oh yeah, I just remembered that. Felt weird in a good way, definitely should try it.
---
Yeah, lots of dead bodies still move dude. It's a hanky 20 year old engine.
---
Right, all good! First time I have every seen entire servers targeted. I jumped around and he had destroyed another 4-5 camps.
---
I have had a few very good ones, maybe the TSE 25 fixer.
---
No...I mean it has a programmed and non erratic movement.
---
BE Combat Shotgun, TSE FIXER
---
That‚Äôs crazy! Can you see drop odds? Enemy values?
---
And your evidence of this is what exactly? This game is full of bugs.
---
Depends on your build. I wear an Exavator PA (so not that tanky by itself) with Medic Torso (now this makes me very tanky).
---
Ghouls: not a problem, medic torso can deal with it. For the level up while in Whitesprings using a sword, I have a Ghoul Slayer's Swing Speed Machete. With Martial Artist 3 and Incisor 3. I can easily whack the Golf Club.
---
Yao Guai: Shoot them from afar, don't let them surround you ever.
---
Assaultrons: shoot the legs, but I usually shoot them in the chest with my Troubleshooters Explosive Gatling Gun. Do not just stand there when they laser you, get to cover or keep moving around them.
---
That was not directed at you directly, more of a PSA.
---
Because dead corpses move randomly and glitchy, the interloper stays still most of the time and jus occasionally moves its tentacle face thing a little. Look it up if you dont believe me but I'm seriously not concerned about one person not believing it.
---
Considering all they‚Äôd have to really do is add the ‚ÄòMain/Side/Daily‚Äô tags to the quest section and add some different sections to the inventory, it really wouldn‚Äôt be hard.  
---
The map could be it‚Äôs own different interface just like in game.
---
9 times out of 10 ya, but if you have a stockpile of scrap it can suck
---
Man I WISH I'd find these places when I server hop! Best I've seen in a hand built monorail carriage someone attached to the actual track. This is even better than that! Well done OP :)
---
Which toy? What's changing for them in 20? There's definitely more of it going on rn.
---
"This. Sentence. Is. FALSE."
---
"Um, true. I'll go with true. There, that was easy. To be honest, I might have heard that one before."
---
That's one absolutely amazing camp!!!!
---
edgy stuff
---
I had this! I also made a post about it because I thought it was a bug.
---
Group pvp flagging. It's being changed so only the instigator gets flagged.
---
&gt; Can you see drop odds? Enemy values?
---
Sorry, what do you mean by this? The SWF files are only the user interface frontent.
---
Drop odds are set in the loot lists in the main SeventySix.esm file, which will require Xedit to open and view.
---
If by enemy values you mean HP, resists, etc, there are Actor records in the ESM file defining those as well.
---
Just because some random person made a wiki entry saying something doesn't make it true. You know that right?
---
Fashionable Raider Outfit, or Stalker Outfit? Maybe ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Angry Turtle's Photo op.
---
I did the same thing to my BSS90 Supersledge yesterday, wanted to drop it for a mule, just clicked away the warning because I thought it was just because I had it in my favourites, then realized there was a skin on it.
---
Feelsbadman
---
More than likely. I doubt these people limit themselves in dick behaviour.
---
All of them. Mostly legacies and glitched/jacked in weapons. Because PvP is changing to where an entire team doesn‚Äôt get flagged, just one single person. So now how it is, a modest level 38 could attack you and you shoot them back. And then their teammate in a stealth suit and a TSE flamer can just end your life in a heartbeat. With patch 20, if you shoot them back, then PvP will be *only* with them, not their friend. Just make sure their friend isn‚Äôt crouched in front of them and invis, though.
---
Who said anything about wiki? I've seen it myself. It's a programmed animation.
---
Thank you!
---
Why aren‚Äôt these stored server side?
---
Its a terrible feeling ü•∫üòñüò≠
---
The raider outfit looks like my best option, thank you.
---
There‚Äôs a gun you can only get with rara , I won‚Äôt give spoilers but just keep checking in on her
---
Every Fallout game had a maximum carry weight. This one is just different because it's ONLINE... which is NEW FOR FALLOUT... Regardless how many games they made, this is the first Fallout online and Fallout had always been different... If you don't work in the company how are you talking about their capabilities? 
---
I don't even see complaints about other games much. 
---
How can Bethesda fix the real bugs if this is all people complain about? I was mad when Sony itself started charging monthly for internet services... But lo, I'm paying for the shit! 
---
Am I missing something or is there a page where people complain about the GTA P2W packages too? I'd like to see that...
---
You did when you stated you have 201 saved points.

---
Did you know that you can close a fissure if all 24 people on a server simultaneously shot it with their fatmans???
---
Yarrr, thanks for spreading my builds around :)
---
How did your new ship experiment on the alt character turn out btw?
---
Or maybe you didn‚Äôt get to that yet? :P
---
&gt; Why aren‚Äôt these stored server side?
---
Certainly they are _also_ stored server side, but having the game's maps, items, scripts, actors, dialogue and all the other content on the client side is definitely required.  So far as I can tell, the client uses the local data to run the game, and sends the player actions to the server which actually validates those actions and updates the game state.
---
There is a fairly constant stream of data flowing both directions as to keep the client and server in sync, but this is using end-to-end encryption so not much can be sussed out about the communications by sniffing the connection.  Probably someone could inject a DLL to read the decrypted packet stream, but I don't have the expertise in Windows development to do that myself.
---
Other than being super easy and quick depending on your build, it can drop BoS paints and the ever elusive super rare shielded Marine Underarmor plans. I think only Bog events drop those.
---
There's only a few options,  faster barrel, sight,  that's about it
---
Drifter outfit if you're after a long coat look.
---
I know they were level 200+ because I saw them hanging out there when I was fast traveling and my C.A.M.P.  icon was the vendor one but when I opened up my map again after a couple of minutes my icon had turned the the tent and they both were still there. I guess I can't say with 100% certainty but circumstantial evidence makes a strong case that they were indeed the perpetrators. Wouldn't I have to set off the explosive bait for them to destroy my C.A.M.P.?
---
He organised it and everyone in the livestream dressed up like this! We killed at least 3-4  Scorchbeasts and cleared a silo with just the pitchforks lol
---
You can prime it, but primeing a Hunter's effect is a waste of flux.
---
I used to use the drifter outfit all the time, I wanted the longcoat to go with the as helm. My friend uses that combo and it looks pretty cool.
---
Fun fact: In the UI files, there's still the companion app code and assets. It just seems to be disabled in the engine.
---
Do the mobs mobs spawn under the platform or on it with her?
---
I accept them but through experience I know the signs of someone being a dick so I just leave straight away, this sucks op never heard of this one before so I'll add it to the list
---
Oh I thought we were talking about the immortal one
---
if the 'renegade' cow in the mire goes right instead of left, you get two sheepsquatch.
---
Laser turrets should've taken out anything other than players
---
The best spot Ive found for finding the Responder bot is by Lady janets Ice Cream. Head down the road westish I think till you come to the overturned Whitespring bus and the spawn point is there. You dont need toh op servers. Just come back every so often if you dont get the bot (id say 20 mins or there abouts. Enough time to refresh the spawn)
---

---
* ghoul's slayer less vats action cost with bashing damage. Reduces everything to a pink mist
---
* gatling gun. Ammo conservative and enough damage for one-shotting in most regions
---
I always do this:
---
&gt;Find a robot model
---
&gt;Okay, don't scrap until it is safe at home
---
&gt;Forget or needing an outside camp repair
---
&gt;scrap all by misclick
---
&gt;Repeat
---
I'll have to check that out! Thanks for the info.
---
I have 3 level 50 Chars just to farm fixers, they dont know Bow or Beararm etc. plans. After 3 month I got 4 fixers, 1 good one (and a TSE). It works, but its still a depressing gamble.
---
3? I have multiple spawn points just for myself without moving the module.
---
He wont always stock the coat either so finding the bot is only half the battle. You may need to find him several times before he will actually have the coat in stock. Good luck.
---
You mean you don‚Äôt Molotov them until they get the idea? /s
---
Okay thanks! Is that the only thing? Exept holotapes
---
Similarly stealthy tse boi would be out of group and level 38  buddy would shoot them, flagging everyone. This is why I don't accept group invites.
---
I personally don't think that a 12% damage increase (60% of the 20% damage bonus from Explosive) justifies the use of 5 perk points, but if you have the perk points and nothing better to spend them on, go wild. If you have a Legacy Explosive energy weapon, that calculation changes - I'd definitely consider the perk worth it for one of these.
---
I don't want to be one of those 'git gud' guys but.. I would strongly consider checking your equipment and perks if a charred feral ghoul can kill you in 4 hits.
---
That‚Äôs the only thing that comes to mind
---
I believe they are nothing more than random notes and not actually learnable
---
happened to me last night too. A guy was just spamming explosive baits on my camp. I logged out immediately.
---
People with a lot of caps would be buying all the good stuff instantly, leaving nothing good for other players. It is already hard enough as it is to find good stuff out there, this would make it worst :(
---
Not rare, spawns there all the time. I have one on my character and found it the same way you did, wandering the map.  Guess I'm married to a rad roach now.  There is unique version somewhere else but again, don't believe it's rare or any more rare than this one.
---
Not possible, system limitations
---
It is bugged. Unequipping then re-equipping the card sorts it but it is very annoying over time and I dropped it
---
If you run a Bloodied build with full Unyielding armor and All The Mutations, your agility should be high enough that you don't really need the Sneak perk anymore. In all other cases it's definitely worth using at 3 points, though.
---
Fucking Bethesda.
---
It's in summersvill or how ever you spell it. "old ring" I'm pretty sure it's called. Also not rare, it's a static soawn
---
Had him held on a server once and farmed solidly for about 40 minutes. Got multiples of every other outfit but only 1 coat. Apparently some of the scavenger traders sell it too now.
---
There's really only like 1 mod per slot. Just use the ones you can
---
Bloodied heavy tank here without fancy tin can üòÄi dont need to jump, just stand in place and melt every thing in my sight üòÄ
---
Ah maybe that's what it is.  Didn't know that.  Thanks for saving me a lot of scrap.  ü§£
---
Love it, too bad the bottle texture is so glitchy :/  but otherwise this feels like something that would actually exist in fallout. Diner hidden in a knocked over structure
---
Sorry, PC. There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm selling this! It‚Äôs the best thing I‚Äôve earned from 100+ boring Fasnacht parades. :)
---
PS4 :( sadly I‚Äôm on PC
---
Oh okay bummer stillbwas funny to find
---
would do the same. have fun with it :D
---
None of those enemies are any kind of real threat any more of they are going to "adjust" an enemy they should buff the death claw in to being an actual death claw instead of being a large scaly kitten
---
Be cool if you could mod it to
---
Wait they nerfed that? I've been double repairing all this time
---
Backpack and power armor de-equip when you die, I believe, causing overweight condition if those had you under.
---
FO4 Survival is always tons of fun. I absolutely love every Fallout game and I continuously play F04. I don‚Äôt feel F076 is superior given the period it came out.
---
It happens when your a bloodied build i take it you are happens to me to until i lost most of my weight but its cause of the unyeilding armour gives you more carry weight but when you die it doesnt take the unyielding effects in cause your not alive so just try to space out your weight in your stash and across other mulesüëç
---
This is the only major thing I can think of.
---
You can skip waves in Heart of the swamp with enough intial damage, you can even break it by killing it in one shot and that's just with a normal bloodied fire axe. Having that be possible for Scorchbeast queen would be really bad.
---
It has never de equipped tho the limit stays the same but the weight goes up
---
But ima junkie build
---
anything that fires fast enough, can get whatever bonus on multiple shots.  forced critical, instigating, sneak, etc.  (Automatic, Minigun, 50cal, LMG)
---
ex  on the weekly when you need to do 50 crits.  I have a vanilla fixer and head over to West Teck Labs.  1 super mutant i will load up my crit meter, next I'll force crit and I usually get 2 crits on the sm before it dies.
---
AngryyTurtle covered this in a vid a while back but I don't remember which it was [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSEDsFOPSQp6VP8vfH\_Zxcg/videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSEDsFOPSQp6VP8vfH_Zxcg/videos)
---
Tell that to all the non heavy energy guns
---
I agree. The perks are there for our advantage. Using them on a queen is an advantage
---
Using a cryolator or cryo grenades keeps the SBQ on the ground for longer
---
Tear it all down and start from scratch. Tweaking the same build over and over makes it so budget bugs add up over time even if you didn't notice when they occurred.
---
Yes, carry plenty of stim packs and weapon repair kits! I maxed out demolition expert (it's so much fun) and have western pistol with explosive damage, it's great, but if I miss-aim and hit the area I'm standing on (like on a roof to pick off ghouls) it takes a chunk of damage.
---
for Mr Gutsy, it's actually the propulsion nozzle that allows for the greatest damage dealt
---
Oh right well happened to me alot when i was using unyeilding armour but idk about junkies sorry
---
With concentrated fire you aim at 0% in vats from the front and fire a few rounds until it hits or you can crit.
---
Thanks. Changeing the weapon itself does not solve it?
---
Bethesda already struggles with the network infrastructure on this game. They also can't properly implement the current trading systems. While the concept of everyone being able to list items in a centralized location is fantastic, it would be an unmitigated disaster of proportions we haven't seen before.
---
So you have a modifier on you backpack? Grocers or Chemists etc?
---
I've found him about 30 times and not once has he had any of the outfits. I ended up trading for them.
---
I claim posiedon on a quiet server to sell stupid amounts of fusion cores for 50c each. Its amazing how man ypeolle want to buy on xbox.
---
It just works.
---
Yes. The items will only show on the serve you‚Äôre on. When you leave and go to a new server they will not be there. You‚Äôd have to collect them when you log out each session
---
you want to know fear, Radscorpion's where it's at. they aggro onto you even if you're invisible and just home in on you with no escape. their shell is pretty tanky as well. 
---
Charred Ghouls are only scary for lower levels. they have ZERO armor and can be one-shot easily. Gutsies are functionally blind, just shoot them from far and juke them
---
If anything, I'm more annoyed by level 1 Mole Rats than an Assaultron or Sentrybot
---
Well you are in luck....well kind of.
---
There are legendary versions of it on PC because hackers gonna hack lol.
---
I'm sorry. You didn't give Bethesda your money fast enough, so you're relegated to the hobo tent
---
It happens with any passive weight buff builds
---
Not that I've noticed, however it's so noticeable when it happens it's usually an automatic thing to just do the card right away, and you're usually in the middle of a fight when you reload and realise so it's just autopilot for me. 
---
Overall it's not THAT good of a perk anyway I find now (depends on the weapon), and definitely not worth having to do that kinda thing constantly. I was running plasma caster/.50 cal and those definitely benefit from faster reload for sure, but I still think on balance there's better stuff with it being bugged as well.
---
In a ‚Äòrole-playing‚Äô game, not everyone has has to ‚Äòrole-play‚Äô as a self-insert character.
---
I‚Äôm glad I managed to get one as a drop myself it took me a little over 100 runs to get all of them.. which sounds bad but I didn‚Äôt get my first rare mask till the 70th run so got really lucky after that.
---
Actually managed to get a second crazy man mask never got the old man winter power armor one though.
---
I missed a few of them purely because I didn‚Äôt have the time and got unlucky! I managed two and traded for one so far, again missed the old man winter power armour one!
---
 [Jake\_THINGS](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jake_THINGS/)  is right in that point with the backpack    
---
( with PA it has never happen to me... until now :D )  
---
In that moment u die, the server DOSNT COUNT YOUR BACKPACK   
---
\--&gt; also means that for the moment than u should choose an respawn point   
---
U ARE OVERWIGHT !   ( this effekt dosnt happen with the PA ; for me )  
---
So u can only respawn at  V79  OR  near an Friend, if one is at the same server as u or even in your group !!!  
---
For now u have to deal with this... its anoying but not "gamebraking" as some other   
---
BUG's ingame !  
---
\+ to be honest: i dont know if this a "game-mechanic" or a BUG ?!?!  
---
maybe someone knows some indeep details ... 
---
\*sry my english isn't the best atm\*
---
Auto axe is in the game files, not sure if its been there since launch or not though.
---
So I believe but I think they may have the same "drop" rate as the bot. I dont think its any easier to get it from them.
---
Yes you should max them, I run maxed stealth skills with my stealth rifleman/commando and don't get seen very often unless I do something really stupid. 
---
If you want to go the stealth route max them, if not, don't bother with any.
---
It WAS alot more fun than I anticipated.  :)
---
He has outfits for me. Primarily the Grey Fishing overalls seem to be more frequent than others. I managed to get the coat quite a while ago when i wasnt particularlly looking for it. Ive been consistently trying to get another now for a few weeks with no luck
---
This is so epic lol
---
I would buy any flux for 35 c/unit. I farm flux myself to store it in the scrapbox for whatever reason in the future.  But who knows where to store junk when I have 80% of stashbox filled with legendaries.
---
Just get rid of pvp in adventure mode. It adds nothing to the game. Thats what NW is for. All pvp does in Adventure is create frustration and misery for the 99% of players who dont participate in it. Maybe limit it to wanted players and make the reward scale to their cap total. That way high level griefers have more to lose.
---
Last time it happened to me, i checked my weight in the bottom right while the map was open waiting for me to chise the (only) respawn point and the extra 100 carryweight of the excavator full set bonus was missing, making me overencumbered
---
I've done the same during server maintenance etc, as much as I loved fallout 3 and 4 it now feels like I'm running around in God mode
---
The limit is not *76* from the start? Unplayable!
---
I think Census Violence has the same drop pool like distant thunder, but it takes 5 min :/
---
That‚Äôs alright
---
I leave all  no-ultracite ammo in front of vending machine. I am scary to believe that someone actually sells it even for 1 cap per bullet, and I am more scary that someone have to buy it.
---
Thanks a lot üòÄ
---
Is there anyway i can join this community?
---
What happens if they ever get round to patching the bottle back to its original size? I wouldn‚Äôt want to be any of your diners at that moment!
---
yeah I know what you mean ü§£ Thank you very much ‚úåÔ∏è
---
I still believe there should be different types of Ghoul speeds and levels that reflect it. They shouldn‚Äôt all be able to sprint.
---
**Rotted Feral Ghouls**: Basically slow Zombies with little to no upper brain activity. They soak up damage but are easy to hit. Very Common.
---
**Feral Ghoul Roamer**: Ghouls who have a moderate level of intelligence. Can jog and open doors. Common.
---
**Fresh Feral Ghoul**: Recently turned Ghouls with higher brain functions allowing them to climb and sprint. Uncommon.
---
**Bloated Feral Ghouls**: Feral Ghouls that have frequented water or chemical lake beds too much. They are heavy, slow, but soak up a lotta damage. Sometimes they‚Äôll pop and might damage you depending on their contents. Rare to common depending on the area.
---
**Glowing Ones**: These puppies are the real deal. They are monsters and have a crazy AOE healing and damage attack. Their high levels of radiation have kept their cells alive thus preserving a good amount of brain activity. They are fairly fast too.
---
And just because I loved getting mutilated in Fallout 3 Broken Steel:
---
**Feral Ghoul Reavers**: These are basically the mutated kin of Satan himself. They have ranged irradiated flesh attacks, heavy hitting claws, and are Olympic sprinters due to their rad-based diet. This is what Freshly turned Feral Ghouls become if they dedicate themselves to irradiated environments and large amounts of Jet.
---
I have too much time on my hands.
---
Lol ü§£ what would be funny
---
Their marketing for Fallout first sucks. If they would be more explicit about which cosmetics are available and/or coming soon maybe more people would sign up...I know I would...
---
I've stopped rolling things at the moment in favor of stocking up on modules. When I get to 100 I'll start rolling some weapons again. 
---
I don't think I've ever rolled anything really good from her weapons wise, a few decent uny/vanguard armor pieces is about as good as it's got for me.
---
I was attacked by a non-legendary diseased cloaked mutant hound on my way to vault 79. Luckily I was in a PA. At first I was like 'wtf?' Then the super mutants came and after I started killing them, the mutant hound decloaked
---
Yep, they either seem to swing for the gaudy Fortnite aesthetic, or grim dark teenagers, and often miss everyone in between.
---
Can confirm explosive bait will damage camps and not flag pvp or cause attacker to be wanted. Saw it happen on PS4 multiple times.
---
We have bone chimes, why cant  we use tin cans as well.
---
Thank you.
---
Thats kinda cool
---
Considering theses so many exploits and broken weapons.... I really can't argue.
---
Do they just bait your camp to lure wandering enemies?
---
Kfg (kentucky fried ghouls) are arguably a worse problem than scorched. Running around slapping absolutely everyone with their incredible reach hacks.
---
They ask where is rara but they dont ask why is rara
---
mybad got confused I guess xd
---
How did you do that?
---
Mind elaborating what you mean by this
---
That's already what we have
---
They technically aren't. It's lag and a little of that mmorpg mechanics that make you feel like they hit you. But if you jump a little in advance they can't ;)
---
This is the problem, quests are showing up - received between five and ten levels ago - and high lvls are there.
---
Sometimes people leave marine helmets in the flor. I sell them for 10 caps bcz it was the most wanted thing during the event and I'd hunted nearly 150 treasure hunters to get the plan. I would sell them cheaper but in this case someone will buy the whole stock like it was with fascnacht masks.
---
Maybe for selling very cheap people are nice to me and one person have given to me a serum recipe and other few very rare plans.  Another one rewarded me with a lot of 3star legendary items. Being nice is the perfect and the most profitable thing to be. So sell free-to-take stuff  for lower price and there will be more nice people. I never go to other camps for trade purpose bcz I cant believe my eyes.
---
wait what ...?   
---
the old grumply Lady CAN give u Bullion wpn/amors ?  
---
( than u know the plans for sure )  
---
I thought they addet this parts and wpn's  only to the lootpool from Fastnacht-event ,...  
---
But at the purveyor,...hmmm....  
---
If this is correct than my endgamegrind has an new target from now !
---
Does it have to be some lego Cryo? I crafted a regular one recently, and was so excited to help out on Sbq with that, i was hitting her, but i couldnt slow her down like i saw people do, what am i missing?
---
They have thousands of players in the PTS. Bugs happen.
---
Actually sneaking around in the grass all the time doesn't quite work either. She needs to aggro on someone to land and that doesn't happen if she can't see you. Stand up now and then,  slip into sneak as she lands.
---
I blocked him for S&amp;G‚Äôs lol
---
I love backseat developers
---
Hilariously untrue. Modders themselves optimized fallout 4 and patched thousands of bugs completely ignored by Bethesda, all within year one.
---
The house with the radroach and wedding ring is near Camden Park.
---
The old ring is on a park bench under ( a hat I think).
---
Both are static spawns
---
somebody invited me to their camp by sending me an out of game message. machine seemed damn near full but everything was being sold at vendor prices no fuckin wonder
---
Do you have legendary armor that reduces weight of things like chems or ammo?
---
Nuclear Winter is not the answer to solve all PvP problems. PvP should be reworked in a manner that is rewarding and engaging for the player base instead of further gutting it like this change is doing. Wonder why most of the player base dislikes PvP in this game? I can tell you based on countless successfully games with PvP it's not because players dislike PvP; it's because the devs have done more to dismantle Adventure mode PvP and make it worse rather than take the time to fix some of the issues and improve the system over-all. 
---
They started gutting Adventure PvP when they added Survival mode. Then they made change after change that killed Survival mode, and then slowly went back to gutting Adventure mode PvP further. 
---
Some people really enjoy Adventure mode PvP and want to see it be improved, not slowly phased out. You say it adds nothing but it absolutely does add to the game and has the potential to add considerably more. Players offer far more challenge than any NPC will and it is something exciting and different to break up doing the same quests and events day in and day out. I bought this game knowing there was PvP. It was very much advertised as having such. I want them to improve the system that was promised since the beginning, not eliminate it because it's easier than fixing.
---
No youre being a dick.
---
Nah man, better to give her more speed, and let her fly ALL OVER the fuckin map, so everyone gotta chase her. That will make it a fun event... /s just in case...
---
Drifter outfit?
---
I've noticed that workshop turrets have very thin skin and dismantle the insult bot instantly.
---
Had the "only respawn at vault 76" thing many times, it's a pain in the ass. Also had it where i can't respawn at all and have to restart the game. That's fun.
---
No they're not, they're FO1st bonuses from a little while back.
---
No. The bait explodes and destroys the camp. No need for enemies. They can just do it as much as they want.
---
Oh ok
---
The Fashionable Raider outfit is sort of similar, but nothing really beats the Hunter‚Äôs Long Coat in terms of style. Gotte keep looking for the vendor.
---
to be honest i don't really mind the dark stuff as much, at least it's better than the gaudy stuff
---
Speedy Receive, long barrel, extended magazine (it doesn‚Äôt take up as much screen space), comfort grip.. Also, explosive and rapid are mutually exclusive effects afaik, so no idea what‚Äôs up with that dude.
---
I'd prefer it if they made whitesprings a location where you could rent/buy a spot for a vendor. Possibly even rent/buy a suite that we could decorate ourselves, a second home away from the camp, or even a main home for those that can't be arsed with all the camp stuff.
---
It's a decent central location and I would love there to be a market hub again. It has most of the NPC vendors in there, it's also more lore friendly than an auction house, plus it's freaking massive, there's loads of room they could utilize inside.
---
How do I get the raider outfit? I've seen a couple of people mention it
---
I know you meant something else but it looks like the thing you didnt mean
---
When I fight SBQ I like to go in as close as possible with my combat shotty and leather her. Normally right up the arris :D
---
I think it's just players being friendly to a low level. 
---
Just noticed the handle, what Ajah are you?
---
Thank god, finally someone who agrees that removing PvP from a game that revolves around builds is a bad idea.
---
Imagine selling something at a stupidly high price that a Bethesda employee came along and saw it just so they'd code the Insult bot to come along and insult your prices lol
---
Finish the Wastelanders questline by siding with the Raiders - or trade it off someone who did.
---
Love the Infinity War joke Bethesda.
---
It adds to the thrill of the game for me.
---
As soon as you hear an assaultron powering up you know its time to fleeeeee!
---
Ghouls do alot of slappy damage to be sure, you need to develop a strategy if they're causing you serious grief, maybe throw a grenade in first then go in with your favourite gun to mop up afterwards?
---
Protectron shoot their arms off but back up the explode
---
That what it was.. 
---
Saw a camp with tons of explosive baits.. It actually gave me chills üò£
---
Please. I'm bloodied unarmed stealth. I need a way to keep her down when she lands
---
Sort of wish I sided with them. Settlers just gave me a blue shirt and weird hat
---
The other day this guy had a flattened pyramid-like structure with multiple turrets along the edges and along the top. The stash-box and workbenches inside the thing. He dropped it over closer to that shed with the elevator/workbench and it did a good job of tearing up scorch mobs and managed to not aggro the queen. Placement seems to be the key.
---
Try to find some troubleshooters armor. I normally sneak, occasionally I tank, but the first 5 or 6 silo runs, I ran a full set of TS armor and weapons. Without being build specific, that's your best bet.
---
Instigating or any main perk with 33vats, limb damage or bashing damage as secondary perk. Those perks are glitched and give u an insane damageboost especially in vats. Angry turtle has made a good video on youtube about glitched perks and shotguns
---
What type of weapons do you focus on? Melee, rifles, pistols, etc? And do you have any Instigating or Troubleshooter's versions?
---
And yes the hp restore bug is still working
---
My first character couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag. When I started my second character, I started following some build guides for a while, then accidentally landed on sneak commando. Rolling a junkies handmade put the build over the top.
---
One quick burst (1-3 shots at a reasonable range) from sneak will knock out any one of the listed enemies. One longer burst at fairly close range will take down a sheepsquatch or behemoth from sneak. If I can sneak up on a scorchbeast of any level flapping its wings in a fissure, it's the same result. Less than 25 rounds of 5.56, and it's down. I haven't been able to stay in full sneak during encrypted or scorched earth, so things are a little trickier there.
---
Shotty build here. ;) Before I went to a bloodied shotty build, I was using Instigating, Furious, Quad or TS (I still use them every them tbh) with 10% aiming(no VATS) and 15% faster reload(especially with a DB and Pump-Action) It works pretty well IMO. And yes, ‚Äúrubber banding‚Äù of enemy health is still a thing lol. You could also go for the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù effects if you want OP one shot damage. Lol. Works well with a Full Health or non-junkie build. ;)
---
I read your post wrong and thought it said girls were slapping you..
---
Thinking, 1.. why you six feet in the air?  And two,  why do you keep getting slapped by girls? What you do to them?
---
I agree, to the right build there are no hard enemies in this game, just enemies that take slightly longer to die.
---
I'm considering changing my current bloodied rifleman to something else for a change of pace, I got a FFR vampire handmade from PP last night, maybe I'll try that with some vanguard SS and see how it goes for a bit.
---
Imagine if we could remove all the garbage from workshops and not just the occasional piece
---
just came off of f4 to f76 a month ago. Went for a month of fallout first to help get me into it. private worlds feel so boring and empty compared to fo4 and there are times in the public worlds too. the only thing that moved me over was hearing good things about wastelanders and a comment from someone on here. saying something along the lines of this being the fallout game for the foreseeable future. REALLY STUCK WITH ME! now i can‚Äôt play fallout 4 without feeling like it‚Äôs meaningless. 76 is gonna be around for awhile and with that in mind. I can understand why the games more grindy. i pray fo5 is strictly offline though.
---
Does the magic damage thing work for shotguns? I watched his videos, but I thought there was something about needing to get your fire rate above 200.
---
For me it's yao guai. I can legit stand on a roof shooting a yao guai and they can still smack me
---
just log out...
---
Correct. It was part of a broken, shitty, bugged to hell group ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù that you had to complete about 700 times to craft it. They removed that content when wastelanders came out and just threw it all on the gold vendor.
---
Yeah, I don't believe that for a second. 
---
You might rage quit for a bit. I believe that. If you've stuck with the game this long, not having bloodied isn't the thing that'll stop you.
---
But hey, prove me wrong. That bloodied nerf is coming. It's just a matter of how and when.
---
True, but the higher level will have literally all the perks plus a load more equipment they can use, trivializing all the content if they so wish.
---
Ah, I started after Wastelanders came out! Makes sense I‚Äòve never seen the even pop up! Thanks for your reply!
---
Yup its working with shotguns too. Also with laserrifles moded with beam splitter. Guess because you shoot more projectiles per shot
---
Tiny bit less damage and durability.  Still a great weapon.
---
So, they're basically being CoD/Fortnite toxic?
---
I‚Äôve been here since launch, took a few breaks, but I love Fallout. I just hope Bethesda gets their heads out of their asses and get a move on, like The Asgard said to the Tau‚Äôri in Stargate, it has great potential.
---
If you're using a high powered rifle (Around 100 based damage before effects and perks, Ie LAR) then spending 3 slots on 15% extra damage will do more for you than 3 slots in Tank Killer
---
Yeah, I did both on different characters. The Settler outfit is super underwhelming lol
---
it would help if they had the damage numbers correctly turn orange for the parts that actually take more damage rather than the usually most armored part, like protectron
---
To be honest, I absolutely love the series and when FO76 was announced I was super excited, but after all my friends said it‚Äôs unplayable, I didn‚Äôt bother to get, since I didn‚Äôt want to spoil my Allout experience. After Wastelander many people seemed really excited, so I thought I‚Äôd give it a try. I‚Äôve gotta say, I love it, despite a fes very annoying bugs I encountered. The overall experience is still super nice!
---
If it was limited to one auction item per player/character I could get behind that.. But if it was our whole inventory, no way. That would get rid of most social interaction in the game for me.
---
Thanks for giving an example yourself. I was not sure, that my hunch were the case, but know I feel reaffirmed.
---
For whatever reason I would not know or dare to assume those people you contacted for grouping, reacted very sensitive to your approach.
---
But obviously you are a very sensitive person yourself, so to me you do not seem to be so different to those people you block for their lets say overreaction.
---
Btw ‚Äúa difference in perception‚Äú is exactly that - people assume certain things about others based on their observations and interactions. So if others come to a conclusion, which the person in question does not agree with, then said person is perceived differently by others than the person perceives himself.
---
Of course the others can be in error about their perception and conclusions. But the point is how much discrepancy a person can take, before the emotion go kaboom. And you can take very little discrepancy in perception by others in relation to your selfimage.
---
So if a person upsets you, said person needs to be blocked or like in my case to be attacked. That is how little you can endure. You seem to have it hard.
---
me and beckett fell through the map together when i travelled to my camp yesterday. today he was talking about having a strange dream today like i‚Äôm sure bruh
---
The trade menu can be glitchy and sometimes the wrong items get selected. Not gonna risk this with a stranger who may not be cool enough to return the wrong item. 
---
Plus, typically people are always asking for my best stuff (which I'm obviously not giving up) and then they get pissy when I won't trade. I dont need that hassle.
---
Yes but this game gives them auto aim and tesla rifles so they can feel like real winners.
---
well I watched a video about it some months ago so I think that a lot of people know it
---
Same story except I didn't see the clouds. May have already disappeared.
---
All faster reload effects are bugged on PA (Lock and Load perk, Speed Demon mutation, 15% faster reload legendary effect). After you enter PA just swap your weapon to another, or unequip/re-equip one. There is no need to fiddle with your perks. I have 3 different heavy guns i use, just switching one to another is enough. Until i realm hop or jump out of my PA again.
---
God, I hate PvP in this game... any other game, I'm perfectly fine with it but this game? Its different
---
Thank you for all your hrlp$
---
Yep, my mistake. There was another minor effect but it doesn‚Äôt make a great difference.
---
Changing the weapon or unequip/re-equip works just fine. Been doing so for months.
---
Flaming level 5 pitchfork
---
Yup, south is good too. There's a nice spot between the wall and the train tracks the has a farmable junk pile. I use that spot frequently.
---
Why's people so stuck with this pvp thing? All it does is brew these glitches and exploits. Pvp itself isn't fun at all. There's no such thing as aiming you just get legacies or teslas and fire at their general direction. No skill involved, not entertaining, it's all about who's exploiting more/hacking more.
---
Sometimes it glitches out and never opens again!
---
There is a potential, currently unconfirmed method to get it to trigger every day.
---
Go to the mire, once per day every day to get a Mire daily. Once you have all the dailies pending in your Pipboy, do the Queen of the Hunt. Next day, go to the Mire, game checks and issues a daily from the ones you don't have, only one missing is Queen of the Hunt, issues that. 
---
If it works, logic says it should, then you can get Queen of the Hunt every day, but you can not do ANY of the other Mire dailies.
---
Hack all the terminals, remove targeting restrictions for the turrets... let them kill or atleast heavily damage the robots (Gusty's, Assaultrons, Protectrons) then deactivate them when it seems lile they have cleared atleast most of the room. 
---
Atleast this is what I do, really helps!
---
So rad
---
wait till she lands the first time switch to Cryo and blast her with it, ive seen people hit her in the air when she does her hover thing but its a lot harder to do.
---
A BFFR Cryo works, you really need a FFR version.
---
They did with their multiplayer Elder Scrolls game, you'll probably find very little or none items being sold. 
---
There's one game Bethesda cares about and there's one they don't give a damn
---
Agreed. Overwhelming majority of players have no desire to participate in PVP and Bethesda should go with the majority.
---
The game could use more structured, instanced PVP modes, like capture the flag, base conquest, etc... But in a mode that is strictly instanced and doesn't hurt regular players. 
---
Game after game just prove that any kind of outdoor PVP in a PVE world is in vast majority of cases used for griefing. It's not "player vs player", it's "player vs defenseless victim". But I guess PvDV doesn't roll off the tongue so well...
---
So instanced PVP is the way for PVP to go forward. Just like Battleground in WoW. I'm fully aware that Nuclear Winter is not the answer for everyone. There should be a mode where we can use our actual character, build and equip to duke it out with other players.
---
Im on ps4 so
---
Its weird how little damage she can do unless you run up and have a fist fight with her. Compare that to how much damage she takes its like the event is just a "let's all shoot the same direction for 10 mins" event unlike encryptid which is a genuine fight
---
np :)
---
Besides nukes, it's basically Scrip and Bullion Grinding.
---
Do dailies and Events, cash in, log off.
---
"And those humans in the tin cans are so hard to get into !"
---
*Ward
---
At least he is upright. Usually the lazy turd is napping. I had a cat that was awake more than he is
---
its a pipe pistol man there are thousands of these fuckers that spawn in the world bethesda would not waste their time banning you for picking one of these useless shits up now if you have a million or 2 mil of a certain item that you did not get by grinding and farming then yeah your at risk for a ban
---
And it actually applied to deathclaw. When you cripple it's limbs, they look differently and deathclaw itself behave differently as well.
---
To bad you kill them before you even notice that.
---
Does that disable their attacks or something?
---
it was that at launch to, the shitshow around launch was just a bunch of haters
---
Learn something new every day. Thanks!
---
If someone wants to try and grief or pvp me in game, fine, I can ignore them and just make sure pacifist mode is on.
---
Its utter stupidity that these players can then go and trash some innocent players base, this is something that needs to be fixed before anything else.
---
As with most online games, for every cool person there are atleast three assholes trying to ruin everything for everyone.
---
Time limit is just fine.  PP is easily done with 3 players.  As long as u have a decent loadout and know what to do anyway.
---
No, just ultracite power armors. I'm joking. Ultracite cores are only for primed gatling lasers/ultracite gatling lasers
---
PA won't use your ultracite cores.
---
I'd like to see this too. I don't get why theres a pvp mode *separate* to adventure  mode if people can just pvp in it anyway.
---
my "BE15RL 50. Cal" and "B50crit15critfill railway rifle" stand out for me
---
Thanks for clearing it up!
---
They use the same glitch to kill escort event npcs...
---
For me i do Golf club, west tek, burrows, glass cavern, rinse, repeat.
---
I haven't been near the SBQ event for that reason. I would need some elevation so my squishy babe isnt so close to her minions.
---
&gt;this game worked better day one than it does now.
---
I agree that it's ridiculous some things are still the way they are, but if you legit think this, you were not playing on day 1
---
No it doesnt. The initial explosion will not be effected by it since it's tied to your weapons base damage. Demolition expert only increases the splash damage of the explosion
---
It's a bug. I remember reading that it should be fixed in update 20.
---
really not sure what they were thinking with that comment. the game was borderline unplayable on day one.
---
Sleep in someone else's camp, maybe? Should work, and no risk of disease
---
How's the Gauss Shotgun?
---
As the main B guy on my team. No idea wtf ur taking about warping rats.  
---
My technique for B room is fix the turret, then I basically run the and pick up sludge and let the mole rats spawn.  Then I just run towards the turret and kill the rats with the turret.  Rinse and repeat.  60+ toxic sludge every dam time solo.
---
It also procs on perk cards!
---
No someone posted this a while back.  Part of the credit is ‚Äúwell rested or Well Tuned‚Äù.  Given lovers embrace is a bug and likely already on their list they are working on I always make sure my well tuned is on instead.  It is a shorter timer, but that is what I have been doing and I get the credit.
---
take some cues fro the instanced events in GTAV
---
When i was level 35 me and a friend were following a hogh level person that wanted to join the party so we stopped at the purveyor and i got a junkies explosive black powder rifle. Sucks that i wasnt lvl 50 when i got it but its still a good weapon
---
There's a worse varient of the glitch where you can't even respawn at 76, your only option is to respawn on a team mate if you're in a team, or abandon the world!
---
And another one where you don't even get the respawn screen, you have to close the game down entirely to fix that one!
---
What you wanna do is get rid of your known plans, sell or drop them at vault 76 or a station. You dont need them! Next I would reccomend removing any heavy ammo you dont need (mini nukes, missiles etc.) 
---
For weapons and armour, it would be better to only have the armour and weapons you need, rather than many sets of armour you've picked up over time and don't sell/scrap/store. Outfits do not weigh much so they should be fine, but it could be useful to put some 8n your stash, if there is any room.
---
  Do you have a backpack? If not, get one from doing the pioneer scout quests, they are great and at level 50 add 50 or 60 (cant remember) weight to your character. 
---
If you do not use chems (like me) then you should sell them to a train station vendor because they add up really fast in the inventory as well as alcoholic drinks and nuka cola.
---
Hope this helped you reduce weight, 8f you have further questions comment and I will answers as quickly as possible!
---
It procs on perk cards too!
---
A goat and a bat?
---
This is a known thing.  It happens to everybody.  If you want loot from a flying enemy, you have to use a different gun.
---
Is that why my shotgun does stupid amounts of damage in vats?
---
That's a bug that while helpful seems a tad OP.
---
Same, robots are far too flimsy!
---
check out angry trurtles vids on YT,
---
with the right gear (UNY low level armor and low lvl B pipe) he gat a char to 50 in an hour or so
---
I was just at the point not long ago. Heres some things that may help.
---
Sell all ammo you dont need. If no one buys it after a week or so, dump it. Free up that space.
---
Only carry 1 or 2 weapons with you. Change out weapons as you need to for what you're doing. Like if you only ever use the 1 gun for the queen, no need to carry it around all the time.
---
While AA is good, if you going bloodied with the armor and perks, get a bloody weapon. Gauss mini gun would do you wonders. 
---
Check how much gunpowder you have on you. It seems innocent,  but that crap weighs a ton. 
---
Keep food and chem weights down. 
---
If you dont have a backpack, get one.  The base version adds 60 carry weight, and then there are different mods for it. 
---
I also just went from bloodied to junkies, but now I'm back to bloodied after 3 weeks. I was too accustomed to the extra stats from the unyielding armor, and the damage it does with my bloodied weapon.  I'm currently spec'd for sneak rifles, but my bloodied gauss shotgun does 800 base damage, and while adrenaline is kicked in, it goes over 1700. Junkies is 2nd best to bloodied, but like I said, inreally hated that loss of stats from the unyielding armor.
---
This goes hand in hand with (rare)outfit farming.
---
I think the assaultrons are very OP especially the dominators at level 46. They do too much damage and extremely good defences. I hate fighting them.
---
is there any empirical evidence of this, or people standing on tents? i keep seeing people berating others on the sub for standing on the bunker or on their survival tents, but i have done a few now where there is always someone on one or the other and the queen lands just fine.
---
What platform?
---
Sleeping in a bed in your CAMP with an ally that is your lover gives the Lover's Embrace bonus. I think if that Ally is not your lover you still get a bonus that is different from Well Rested. This is where the camp fire ring atom shop item comes inm as that gives you Well Rested now.
---
You also still get Well Rested for sleeping in a bed everywhere else. I tend to use a bed in Crater or Foundation or up on the 3rd floor of Fort Defiance, but any bed that isn't in your CAMP will do.
---
What about a gauss rolling pin
---
The ramp concept worked, but to scale up the design that much would have taken too much budget I think.
---
Same way some were trying to hold Fasnacht hostage for a while.
---
Dumbass, God has nothing to do with it
---
Is it obvious like the welder T-51 helmet?
---
Though I haven't experienced the bug, I feel the pain of wasting a ton of ammo just to not get the loot from the boss at the end. I hope this bug is resolved cause it must suck.
---
Bug that has been in this game since launch ("It just works" - Todd Howard 2018). Laser and plasma weapon can make flying targets goo piles / ash piles invisible if the goo/ash effect procs (as it doesn't do that always). The ashes/goo is still there but it is invisible in the air. If you are on PC you can install a mod that changes the look of the piles to turn them visible. I used to do this when i used laser weapons. 
---
Word of a warning... This can happen on Queen too. So stop shooting at her when she is near death. Or you can lose all the loot for yourself and others.
---
I don‚Äôt think you can see inside too well, but it is just on a table in a small room
---
it's the best shotgun, a close second (or so), is when some  "accidentally" glitch the double barrel to have 1000+rounds somehow loaded into it, (no reloading just tap the trigger for endless shots). Buuuut, the Gauss is actually realistically reliable.
---
BMO is Ae-Ri in Crater though.
---
Asserting dominance.
---
that must be PC graphics, PS4 doesnt look nearly as good...
---
Yea troubleshooting items would be incredibly helpful for you. I'm lvl 90 and haven't launched a nuke yet I just started getting ready last night. I had alot of ts items and never thought to save some.
---
I have no clue then, I‚Äôm a bloodied PA user in full T65 and the sonic blasts are not really an issue.
---
A BUNCH OF WHINNING FAGGS IN HERE
---
Think about this carefully.  If you use rank 3 of Bandolier and Traveling Pharmacy, all your ammo and chems are 90% lighter.  If you store them in your crate, they are 9X heavier.  Stop resisting and get those perks.  Put items in your crate that you cannot lighten up with perks, such as non-heavy weapons, armor, etc.  You will end up weighing less in the long run, being able to carry almost unlimited chems/food/ammo and your crate will be 50% lighter I bet,  all for around 10% of your perk allotment.  You'll maybe lose 5% damage on some melee/heavy weapons.. but seriously by lvl 146 your weapons should be pretty OP.
---
You are already using Bear Arms.. so why not the other two?
---
Once you complete all of the quests and beat the SBQ, thats about it.
---
 This game has the most non existent end game out of any multiplayer game I've ever played.  I know from experience as I am level 400.
---
The only thing left to do is search out God roll weapons and armor.
---
 If you want time fillers then you can earn all the scout badges, collect all the TnT keys, find every location on the map, collect all plans and recipes, ect...
---
 These days when I log in I run a few events that I know spawn a 3 star enemy... Awol Armaments,  Riding Shotgun, horde events ect..  Or if I see an event in an area I know has Max level enemies I will hope a few of them are legendary.
---
There really is a lot to do but I wouldn't consider any of that end game content as I know it.
---
What mods do you use or suggest for different shotguns? Not legendary effects, but like barrel length, primed, etc.
---
Endgame... CAMP building (perfect location and alotted resources)... and finding that perfect outfit, also finally getting the one weapon that's better than the others for your build...
---
Then there's in game lore, collections, magazines, pipboy games, etc. 
---
Endgame (Bonus Round): Conspiracy Lore!!!
---
: you learn there might be a Pioneer Scout level above Possum, and exactly what happens when you Nukashine Dreamwalk in the "haunted" locations....
---
I looted an instigating compound bow with vats hit chance yesterday. Looking forward to giving it a try.
---
The [roller](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2137909125) [coaster](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2137909153) ride was fun too!
---
Start with Chems and Drinks do you hoard?
---
For chems check your armor for buffs that cut 25% of weight.  There are strength perks to knock it by 90%, and now a backpack mod that I use so I freed up 3 slots.  I like to gather chems(ghouls) as they sell for good money and every day I hoard and sell out but they kill you on weight.
---
Drinks do the same, I used to brew every day, and due to that I carried a lot of drinks, plus you boiled and purified water the later being good to sell daily as well.  Huge weight, so either the drink perk in Agil or again the backpack mod now out of wastelanders.
---
Go through miscellaneous and you will find Ore, gun powder, tokens, sort by weight.  I throw that in my storage and smelt occasionally but out all excess in there and not on me.
---
Ammo the guy before covered, I try to pick ammo that works for a couple weapons, better efficiency.  I also have weapon weight reduction perk on my armor and helps as I like to carry 6-7 weapons for different situations.  
---
Armor I carry what I wear, and then a few outfits most likely to be a daily for atoms, so clown outfit, formal, responders, asylum, etc...  
---
I carry one heavy for scorched beasts, but I use a 50 Cal and use that for a instigating rifle as well, plus have an ammo perk on armor so I carry 5000 rounds.
---
I am sure all your armor has deep pockets.  
---
I also assume you flush out scrap as fast as you can, 1st is a game changer for that, but otherwise all I did was bulk and sell scrap to keep my levels low enough to have room in storage.
---
Thanks, I had no idea, I mainly use ballistic weapons but I like to switch it up sometimes.
---
Scrip and bullion grind, nuke silo runs and SBQ fights, events, exploring, roleplaying, crafting, collecting &amp; rare outfit hunting, etc
---
Plenty to keep you going, just need to decide what to do when you log in.
---
A month? You know its the 22nd of june now right, its a week away
---
This.
---
For armor, keep the Unyielding set and a Troubleshooter's set for Sheepsquatch and missile silos, and a Zealot's set for the SBQ fight. Definitely mod both secondary sets to be ultra-light. Ditch all other armor.
---
Bear arms makes it possible to carry several heavy weapons, but try to be more selective. I'd definitely go with no more than one weapon per ammo type, unless there is a very good reason.
---
Sell the 5.56 mm and .45 ammo and maybe the shotgun shells. Ditch the .38 and .44 as well as missiles, nukes, 40mm grenades because chances are you won't be able to sell those. 2mm EC is heavy AF, so sell it unless you plan on using the Gauss minigun in the future.
---
Np :)
---
Todd would fix this game launch bug... but ps5 is commin out, so skyrim needs to be released on it with buster sword dlc.
---
The booster on the Mr. Handy / Gutsy is also a pretty big weak spot. You don't get the frenzy effect, but it does huge damage and can be shot at from 360¬∞
---
I've never gotten anything good EVER!
---
This is key, TS armor changes it a great deal, or go full sneak and hack terminals.  I carry a TS with me at all times now
---
*creepy electronic* Baaaaaa
---
This is a great shot, love it.
---
Appreciate the advice, I'll give that a try. Happy cake day!
---
Yeah it gives "Kindred Spirit" which also does not count.
---
You and everyone upvoting you failed to understand the point. I can't deny that PvP in it's CURRENT state is flawed. That's the point of making improvements. Remove the broken weapons etirely, disable VATS on players, adjust damage outputs for PvP, disable stealthboys after the first shot.
---
Exploiters and hackers ruin the PvE experience just as much (Anyone forget player vending being disabled?), does that mean we should just delete the game entirely because they screw up other parts? Obviously not. Bethesda should work to fix their bugs and implement a better (or you know, any for that matter) anticheat system.
---
There's plenty of improvements that can be made, but people like you don't care. They don't care about PvP or the people who do. People like you just want to see PvP removed because why should the devs put in effort for something you don't care about?
---
One of my fav things to do, is to play fresh character, game feels more like survival, u need food, water, you low on materials and enemies can be challenging and dangerous. At high lvl with gear it becomes god mode simulator, we should have SOME enemies that are able to kill us...
---
the real game is to off the music player, then avoid detection long enough to have another begind playing... rinse and repeat...
---
(8 hours later) Yea! Worth it!
---
I‚Äôve lost so so many restored desk fans to this, I‚Äôm honestly at the point where I‚Äôll just wait till it gets fixed to display and keep junk it‚Äôs just heartbreaking
---
This used to happen to my allies when I had a camp near a freeze floater. It's like the slow effect from their attack was still affecting them. Honestly it kinda just had to go away on it's own.
---
You mean shoot them in the back, like a coward? I'll just stick to my MIRV fat man, thanks.

Thats my stupid inefficient build
---
happened to me since the halloween event started
---
yea, the dysr guy was buggy with me in a stealth suit. I tried using a variety of mines (pulse cryo nuka, plasma, etc) after crippling it and having it army crawl into them.
---
Yeah i got fallout 1st and i always flush out scrap as soon as possible
---
Like Monster Mash. It has a goal, it is fun and no repercussions as long as you don't have junk on you.
---
Getting all the achievements/trophies helped me play more.
---
It‚Äôs basically the same as when you load into the game initially. You spawn into a game automatically over encumbered until you‚Äôre armor, backpack and perk cards load. However when you die all these calculations go out the window. I also heard this was supposed to be fixed in patch 20.
---
And Rara will give you a prompt of some sort?

Game of Thrones had the red wedding, so Bethesda created the Rad Wedding...
---
I either use traveling pharmacy 1 or sturdy frame 1 but i have been advised to only carry weapons i use so i might reduce my bear arms and replace it with traveling pharmacy 3 as i have over 60 stims on me
---
Use the fireproof card when using an explosive weapon especially when the enemy is very close to you. Otherwise you will die more from your splash damage than the enemy.
---
3 star legendary has the potential to drop a 3 star item.  Its RNG.
---
Amen- remove PvP from Adventure. PvP is the anti christ. It's the nemesis of all that is creative, fun and exploratory. 
---
It's also a clash of mindsets as PvP is inherently competitive and (fuck it I'll say it) narcissistic whereas pve is generally more cooperative and features the kind of folks who build amazing camps. Generalising? Well yes I am a little, and apologies to the base building pvp'ers. 
---
I also have years of ESO and other games behind me and, well, I never got Tea bagged in PvE when died in a raid whereas Cyrodiil (for those not aware--a dedicated PvP factions war landscape) was a ball dragging extravaganza of poor sportsmanship.
---
My camp before this one was regularly attacked by floaters. Could be a connection there, however I only noticed it happening right after moving to a different place and placing his bar. But yeah, I'll wait and hope he gets better üòÖ
---
I look at a 3 star enemy as 1 star enemy that ha a chance of droppin a 3 star item.
---
That way I am not disappointed.
---
Remember when there was a bug that when repaired to 200% drills, rippers and Mr Handy Arms did extra damage? It was the only time I ever used a MR Handy Arm
---
It's only invisible from the bottom. If you have a jetpack, you can still sometimes recover it.
---
I would add that when you hack the terminals check for the commanders of each section which are the robobrains. You can do the same as the turrets by removing the targeting restrictions or just shut it down. 
---
Also, the terminals might not show the turrets, I have had this happen on multiple runs but don't know why it happens but all the turrets are down.
---
I would also recommend getting some stealth boys so you can use them before using the terminal so that they can't attack you.
---
Collecting every plushy in the game.
---
That's it.
---
Precise stock essentially doubles the durability of the weapon while adding nearly the same effect (arguably not noticeably different than...) as the aligned stock. Typically I mod all my shotties the same: hardened receiver, aligned long barrel (extended barrel on the gauss shotgun), circle reflex sight, precise stock, no muzzle(!). No muzzle because your range drops off dramatically but your accuracy only goes up a little. One would assume that you‚Äôd have better accuracy if your enemy was right in front of you. With no muzzle however you can almost use a double barrel as a sniper rifle.
---
Thankfully in this game it's more like 1 asshole for every 100 good people.
---
the only issue I have with hard events, is:
---
1. like SBQ is a bulletsponge, that why I dont mind if someone with a bugged 200+firerate gun joins the event so the queens health goes down in a moderate rate and its done in 10min instead of just withing the 30min if lucky
---
2. the oneshot mechanics of example ISS, its crazy, you join the event, in PA for example, so you should be a a walking hulking tank... "BAA" red flash and u dead in 0.5 sec.... respawn... 5sec later "BAA" and dead again 0.5s later.... u kidding me...?
---
You are not getting the point. It's not the system, it's the players that's ruining the pvp. Ultimate improvement to pvp would be to make pvp so shitty that these toxic pvpers would quit the game for good and them Bethesda can start from there
---
It‚Äôs missable if you don‚Äôt check on her, after talking to her you‚Äôll get a choice to ask her to look
---
Damn you're the github guy! Thank you so much for that tool, it's a godsend!
---
T shirt and jeans, that sort of thing.
---
I have those - thanks, though!  Others might not know that.
---
Sneak and Melee go a long way in a silo.  Hacking to disable the turrets or tuning the turrets on the robots to help clear the rooms for you.  Trouble shooter weapons and armor help.  The less people in a silo the less mobs, you may be temped to have a whole posse but it is so much easier solo.
---
Its pretty much just a square, but ok... Pre build structure then.
---
Also, as far as legendary effects go, while explosive does drastically increase your damage output on shotguns, due to how close you have to be to an enemy (not including the gauss in this as it can hit a target at 120 yards) explosive perk will kill you more than any enemy even with the fireproof perk and dense torso. I typically go for anti armor, instigating, executioners, quad (for double barrels) but the most important perk for shotguns is faster reload. Shotguns can get so powerful that explosive is just extra.
---
The best suggestion I have seen was when you kill/assist in a legendary enemy that the legendary should automatically be added to your inventory
---
Its 12% extra damage at rank 5 (60% of 20%). Usually not worth it unless you have extra points.
---
Stims that you need if you want to run Encryptid for example.  When I finally decided that I was willing to sacrifice a small amount of damage for some QOL, the game became much more enjoyable and I don't regret it.
---
I normally did well rested, but this was the first time I actually slept in my own camp. I had missed the previous announcement for it, so I thoigh inwould bring it up in case others didn't know.
---
enforcer, tank killer, armor piercing 
---
makes easy game is even easier
---
Your objection is not reasonable.
---
Not at all, the only problem i have is that survivors sometime crash but idc about that
---
I don't have the fire ring, but it's easy enough to find a bed outside of your camp. This was the first time I slept in my camp since having an ally, and didn't realize it wouldn't count.
---
Charleston DMV, Whitesprings (Kill all the robots too), Westek.  Return to the DMV, re-log and repeat.
---
I love this game.   Have since launch.  I have never rushed through any of the quests, without getting into "daily loops".  I know the game is not perfect.  Id anyone expects that, they're fools (imo).
---
I am looking forward to a lot more hours of enjoyment.
---
It's the one frat house in fraternity lane near Biv. They're labeled as their respective chess pieces too.
---
I did two queen events yesterday at different times on different servers. Got a 1 star meat hook and a 1 star pole hook. 5 scrip each.
---
Don't really focus on any particular weapons, been using Anti Armor Axe and Anti Armor Hunting Rifle, thinking that ignoring 50% of their Armor would be fairly helpful but Mr.Gutsy's and Assaultrons literally eat round after round... 
---
I have no weapons with either of them prefixes ‚òπ
---
 This happens if you die right at the end of an event.  You have to kill the game just to get back in.
---
I think they should get rid of some shit ones first.
---
Incendiary.
---
Bashing damage with reduced VATS AP cost combat shotgun. Ghoul slayer I think
---
I‚Äôm on PC, but thank you! I ended up server hopping til I found one where someone had nuked a useful area and went and got it the hard way. And now I have secret service jet pack armor. :)
---
For me the evidence is just anecdotal.
---
T-65 is superior in defence values, but if you value a slight dps increase at the cost of some defence then Strangleheart.
---
Aw, crap:/
---
https://youtu.be/bFuRkFObLWY
---
They need to get rid of a bunch
---
Ok thanks
---
Pls dont run stranglerheart with the helmet tho it causes everything in the server to lag for other players around you
---
I had that happen recently as well.
---
Flamers are awesome and melt everything real quick, why would u play melee, just play a heavy build, equip a flamer, run to stuff, tickle the fire button and watch stuff melt in front of u...
---
also, recently got to know the Railway rifle better, its an aboslute beast and lets u appreciate the wonderfull weather meachinics and cloud behaviour in the game
---
Ignoring the exploiters/hackers because it's obvious they're doing something wrong, blaming players for using the optimal tools to accomplish their goals is foolish. Just because you don't min-max or think player should doesn't mean everyone shares those values and the reality is the best players are going to be the ones that seek out the optimal strategies.
---
It's up to the developers to balance their game. It's not on the players to create some universal honor system to avoid any perceived "unfairness". Pushing players out of the game isn't going to make PvP better. The only thing that will is the developers making actual changes. 
---
If you can't understand that Bethesda are the ones that failed to make PvP enjoyable for more of the player base and not the players themselves, then there's no point in trying to discuss this with you. Clearly your attitude to "make PvP so shitty" it drives away players you deem toxic shows you don't care about PvP, you only care about gate keeping.
---
People be selling white fedora's for max caps
---
at the moment?
---
It's now been a year plus and we have all been saying this ... That's just how it is
---
FYI the short range is a bug, every time you relog in a server, you have to recraft the short barrel, and then long barrel again, then u get the full range again with the best nozzle, or just learn to live with the melee range if u cant be bothered recrafting the barrel again each time (like me, I carry 4 flamers on me all the time xd)
---
Server hop westtek
---
Yes.  The mechanics for this are already in the game.  I'd love that.
---
I have insult and prize bot show up at once of my camps all the time. Free lead and steel baby.
---
Yeah, I learned this in FO3 by accident while scrolling between words.
---
Always a good tip for new players.
---
Also with hacking and lock pick you can bypass the reactor repair sub-quest and just end the reactor lockdown.
---
It is called priorities.  Things that break the game are given higher priorities then things that just midly inconvenience people.
---
Agreed.  Nocturnal is the first one that I'd delete.  Or you could make it good by simply removing the damage debuff during the day.
---
Whether it removes a dud or resets tries is random. There's usually (always?) one that resets the tries, the rest remove duds, but the reset tries one doesn't necessarily show up last.
---
Otherwise yes. I actually really like the 'find the brackets' game so always unlock terminals even if they're attached to a safe I've already broken into.
---
No believe me it still happens quite often, atleast for xbox players anyways
---
NW is not the PvP anyone asked for in Fallout 76.
---
I also played all Fallout titles and i have never bothered to use hacking "the way it is supposed to be done". I always just randomly click words, and exit before the last guess. Rinse/Repeat.
---
craft a couple flamers with super duper,
---
scrap em with scrapper
---
theres not many mods on flamer, u can learn em quickly by scrapping a couple,
---
also, theres a few places that spawn mobs that drop alot of acid (crickets and snallys I farm, if I hit up my 2 farmlocations I walk away with about 75-100 acid in 15 min), you could serverhop since these are mobs wich should respawn
---
I'm not saying Bethesda should make pvp better. I'm saying Bethesda should remove pvp. Pvpers in this game are swimming in such lake of toxicity that even jesus himself cannot save them at this point. Pvp is now nothing more than test site for new hacks/exploits and thinking that exploiters/dupers are different demographics from pvpers is being way too naive. Pvpers dupe so freakin hard at least that's what my team was doing. Bethesda should just remove pvp as a whole and see if toxic players quit. If enough toxicity is removed from the game, then Bethesda can work on doing something about pvp
---
I watched the stream it was hilarious, loved all the mascots running about, good show!
---
I haven't witnessed any issues on PC
---
if u dont change the nozzle, then u dont get the damage...
---
the short range is a bug, been like this from FO4, you need to recraft short, and then long barrel again each time u relog, or live with the melee range
---
They are the corpses from the ghouls that the nuke killed.  If you get a buddy to log in, or another player enters the area, the glowing ghouls will respawn.
---
Its just fair warning, the player using stranglerheart armor wont experience lag, but players around you will
---
Yep, Todd‚Äôs angry with me
---
I've tried that, I have access to private servers and its myself my brother and a buddy and we've tried the re-log strategy aswell and that didn't work either
---
Yea i didn't say you were wrong to give that warning. I personally have not used Strangleheart ever and the lag issues on Queen stopped when they changed the mechanics (again on PC).
---
Ranger outfit with Fo1st
---
If anyone is standing in the nuke zone while the new person logs on, it blocks the spawns.  Anyone who is in the zone needs to crouch while the new player loads in.  This removes you from the map and allows the ghouls to spawn.
---
Yup it is worth reminding folks who likely missed it, all good I just wasn‚Äôt sure if you hade seen it before.
---
[Brotherhood of steel ](http://imgur.com/gallery/RFciw2B)
---
And why is it they always have the ability to melt you where you stand I e always wanted to know that Sonu could give as good as I get
---
How "shit" a legendary effect is can differ from person to person. 
---
Also you need shit rolls in RNG or otherwise the mediocre ones become the new shit ones.
---
Relog log, run through,clear out the odds and ends survivors, relog again...sometimes it can be a process to get the proper spawns again other times it's quick.
---
Ok ill give that a try next time, but in all honesty we shouldn't even have to go through all this extra effort just to play the game the way it's supposed to be played. I wish Bethesda would fix this
---
With hacking 3 u don‚Äôt have to leave.  U can use up the last try. It won‚Äôt lock u out of the terminal like other titles.
---
Regardless of the side you pick you can build faction with both sides in the end.  I am Ally with both sides.  It just takes time.
---
You are guessing right.  LOL.  Otherwise, just FT away and fart around for 10 minutes.  The enemies will be there when you return.
---
It's time for Sesame Street!
---
Like, i wouldn't mind if the game had some benefit from doing it like you get some of there stuff, but it really doesn't at all.  Ppl are just wierd.
---
You dont have to wait for them to be In cool down to do this. Itll say 0 percent chances but with concentrated fire that will go up with every shot so you'll miss the first couple but bame crit from like 20k plus
---
But im jus askin when ur talking to overseer about ur options can u choose one then change it or ur perma stuck wit that choice.
---
Agreed.  It is frustrating.  Especially for someone who doesn't know every little detail on how it all works.
---
Dang bro that's cool, I didn't know that. I still got my original outfit from doing the quest im level 267 now ha ha
---
I do it for low levels to help max their caps
---
As far as I know, it's not possible to do the quest without involving at least one faction.
---
this hahaha
---
How many do they need to destroy a whole camp this shouldn't even be possible
---
We need a Sheepsquatch day! I wanted to join but unfortunately I wasn't able
---
Does anyone actually use explosive bait for anything other than griefing? I wouldn‚Äôt mind if they disabled explosive bait until they fix it.
---
That one assumes that the numbers published are accurate, and they are not.
---
This one explains it better.  There is a part two also.
---

---
We had survival but it was taken away. 
---
Those of us paying attention at the time - all called this out as an inevitable future. 
---
Where were they gonna go? Better to keep them in an ‚Äúarchived‚Äù game mode then adventure imho
---
I have yet to die 5 times. 
---
jkjk
---
I jumped in on awol armaments and there was a sb hovering around. Initiated the event and the first wave of gutsy only 3 took out that sb in a matter of seconds . If there was a gutsy gun in 76 it would be the most op weapon ever . Hate me some mr gutsy !
---
Sad thing you have to beg people to attend and they still do not.
---
Wow, what a weird bug. Must be the same thing where my gatling fire rate isn't as high as it should be. Oh, this game. haha.
---
I didn‚Äôt know angry turtle did a power armor vid. He‚Äôs considerably more thorough. Good find!
---
It's not that. Im not a bloodybuild, It happens every time I die in a nuke zone.
---
It‚Äôs based off a lovecraft entity that sleeps
---
I suspect they either duped the resources required to craft them, or bypassed that and duped the item itself. Likely some degree of overlap between people that dupe and people that grief (or know people that do).
---
Yeah, first thing I do after 3 wrong guesses is hunt those brackets down. 
---
To anybody who doesn't know what to look for, heres a few examples:
---
1. (-'!__-"$+)
---
2. [%‚Ç¨+$#]
---
3. {_-4(&amp;;*}
---
4. &lt;";$&amp;($-&gt;
---
Those matching symbols at the beginning and end are what to look out for, although sweeping across horizontally until they highlight is even faster.
---
I know. i was doing it by myself one day to get candy for the daily challenge and someone random showed up and I was genuinely freaked out and happy at the same time! No one plays this, radiation rumble or project paradise. Sad :(
---
I saw this yesterday day and she actually lands on it . Good idea for someone farming the queen all day everyday.
---
It doesn't drop Paints, that's Forbidden Knowledge only. Shielded Marine is Census Violence only. Distant Thunder is only good for T-60 Part Plans, and other PA Mod Plans. Same with all Bog Events.
---
Everytime I pass this title it's a wild ride.
---
You can say anything you want to the overseer.  Nothing that you can say will significantly alter the way things turn out.  Her mission is solely to get you introduced to the factions and gold.
---
I was just talking to todd about this, he punched me in the face and screamed "SKYRIM PS5 WITH BUSTER SWORD DLC!!" Then ran out of the room screaming hysterically "IT JUST WORKS!" over and over...
---
I also consulted my trusty magic 8ball about the situation, outlook not good.
---
Im only a Lvl 45 with mine rn but this is what Im going for

---
There is a blood eagles camp with a guaranteed blood eagle spawn that has a flamer. You can server hop that location. Sadly, forgotten which location but I'm sure google knows.
---
For the most part, any more than 2-3 weapons and you're just wasting space. 
---
It should pretty much just be main weapon, a backup in case the main goes down (or a few repair kits) and an alt to cover those situations that not suit the main e.g. killing trash mobs with cheap ammo.
---
That's what you carry. You might have 1-2 more utility weapons e.g. SBQ prime for example but that's it max. You really could get away with 2 for the most part. 
---
Limiting weapons will super simplify ammo needs.
---
As for plans, keep only the ultra rare and expensive plans for high value trades/sales. For the rest, either sell mega cheap or just dump them if they're common and/or shit.
---
As for your build, go a hybrid bloodied junkies build ie bloodied gear and perks with junkies weapon. That way you don't need to micromanage health so much as you have the flexibility to go full health when the situation calls for it e.g. nuke zones.
---
Also, just a personal opinion - vanguard is massively overrated. Go bolstering instead, even if you don't go a hybrid build. What you should care about isn't that it's hard to knock you down from 100% -&gt; 50% but it's harder to take you from 50% -&gt; 0%. It also synergises well with adrenal reaction mutation, even if you don't go bloodied gear as you hand around the lower health longer and hit back harder the more you're hurt, rather than accelerating to 0% health when you're in the thick of it.
---
They can also be nested within each other. The "inner" bracket set should be the one first used in these cases.
---
Log in with alt character, then log back in with main. Everything should respawn.
---
Good to know :) If i ever happen to find a rank 3 computer i need to hack :)
---
....and yet the reddit Karen's demand pvp be completely removed because "a vast amount of people do it"
---
Yeah, i was just about to edit in that they can vary in length, or form part of a larger one.
---
Thanks for catching that one!
---
How about consistency? Why the fuck isn‚Äôt everyone else in the wasteland jumping around like jackasses in all the other FO games? That‚Äôs a better point to make.
---
These are hit or miss. Sometimes it blocks her from landing, just as too many tents too close to each other and everyone just standing on the bunkers.
---
Ok so that fact that it takes a huge amount means it probably won't be that common so that something at least
---
I feel It every time someone activate the cryptid event I get downed but I can't respawn for a few seconds but right before I spawn back the event ends and im just laying there watching my screen rotate around my deal body, sad part is I forgot to store my scrap
---
He's the go to guy.   We should throw turtle a party or something.
---
&gt;there is always someone on one or the other 
---
The Queen will focus one player at a time. As long as there's one person out in the field she can focus, she can land on that person. For each person on the tent/bunker, she has a chance to be focusing someone she can't land on. If everyone is out in the field, she'll always focus someone she can land on. 
---
It's okay to be on/in a tent or the bunker if you need to hide to heal, but I wouldn't advocate staying there for the entire fight like many people do.
---
You probably find anecdotally that having people on the bunker isn't bad because it doesn't stop her entirely from landing, all it does is make it less likely.
---
nice
---
At least you are getting legendaries off it, the last two that i did i shot at them for around 10 minutes and somehow didnt even get a claim on them to loot them :(
---
We need a turtle power armor
---
Fire Proof Perk Card also.
---
Regarding your mic problem, last weekend I discovered the perk loadout manager and text chat mods for fo76. 
---
While mods are not officially supported, i find these 2 too useful to not ignore. Had to play with them a little to get them working though as vortex didn't do much. Text chat is a bit strange (and idk if it's prone to hacks) but damn, that was satisfying seeing others that had it and were actually chatting.
---
NW is not the PvP experience anyone is interested in. This game was specifically advertised as having openworld pvp, there are much better BattleRoyal games on the market.  Until they create some events to facilitate PvP you're going to be forced into it by bored endgamers, because let's face it. PvP is the endgame when nothing in the game is dangerous on is own.
---
Well PvP should be in one area- Workshops.  Once you exit the area, you can no longer deal or receive damage.  
---
The problem with this is there would be some sort of PvP cooldown, otherwise you could (and let's face it, would) have someone sit at the edge, snipe, when they get return fire they hop out of the zone, heal up, then hop back in.  With their systems as it is, I don't know if they could do it.
---
depends on you buld: commando=full auto, rifleman=semi, its a 60% damage difference
---
LOL I'd even buy it from the atom shop.
---
How do you have your Special allocated so that you can switch from stealth commando to heavy? Do you just have no points in Endurance, Charisma, Intel and Luck?
---
About 4 weeks or so. I was only a few pieces off until I saw a screenshot of someone who cheated in around 400 notes and just lost the will to keep grinding. And playing the game for that matter. If you are constantly doing the events and getting notes then you should have enough notes to cover days off and whatnot
---
I barely use power armor but just to show my support for Turtle I‚Äôd go for it too.
---
apperantly this bug is already in FO4 and was just carrierd over, gotta love Beths bugfixing department
---
Personally I'd like to see them remove it from Adventure and bring back Survival.
---
There is definitely a unique experience to be had with doing PvP in Adventure, and putting Survival mode back in should sate that appetite for the PvP'ers.
---
Survival was kind of shit too. Get rid of leaderboard shit, keep all players off the pipboy, disallow grouping. Now were getting somwhere.
---
I much prefer mine as semi-auto.  I don't waste a billion spikes on birds and trees.
---
Isn't that what Bethesda has been trying to do.  All they need to do is fix the exploit the OP is talking about and remove workshop PvP, on top of the patch 20 change and there won't be any reason to PvP in the base game.  So they can then work on a way of introducing PvP back in a balanced way.
---
5650 gold for the base pieces + 2000 for the jetpack, other mods are an additional 100-750 each depending on the mod.
---
So starting with the 1000 gold you get from the raid, assuming you keep it all, and you max your 200 gold a day note allowance + 600 a week from smiley...means fucking ages mate, or so I have been reliably informed anyway, I won't be grinding for it.
---
Realistically 3-4 weeks or so for a full set with a jetpack.
---
I nuked W/S over the weekend on a private and did 3 runs. I always launch the nuke then change to an alt then back to my main and it always works. Sometimes i wont have a full spawn until the 2nd run though.
---
The damage is ok in my opinion, but if they are bugged they can fire it without cool down and that is to over powerd.
---
It's literally just there to exist as another layer of RNG for you to get past while searching for perfect weapons.
---
I have to agree with you and I'll generalize too. I think people who are ***really*** into pvp are low key psychopaths. Every game I've played with a pve/pvp split has shown me some of the grimiest people I've encountered in online gaming. And in a game like this where, like you said, the emphasis is on story telling or mood and exploration, pvp just straight up doesn't make sense. Not with this engine/netcode/weapons/gameplay/etc. 
---
I legit don't care if these new leanings towards a less pvp game mean some of those people will produce salt and leave. This was never the game for that and any tryhard is just taking advantage of the broken systems to be a douche. Go play Rust or whatever.
---
Well that's stop any new characters dead in their tracks if they haven't started Rose's quest so I don't know how tenable that is.
---
Thanks for the explanation!
---
It‚Äôs because you remove the regular armor when stepping into the power armor
---
It doesn't boost your chances unfortunately, it only gives you a little more scrap back.
---
I‚Äôve gotten so many bloodied firerate/explosive heavy and energy weapons. But I hate heavy and energy weapons.
---
Me TOO!  I prefer mine with semi-auto (primed) and gun fu.  But even though I have every bloodied weapon, I find myself going back to the Railway Rifle just so I can laugh every time I reload.
---
If they're anything, it's consistent!
---
So if you are just server hopping to find stuff and not playing why not just put on Travel Agent?
---
Also there comes a point where caps really don't matter so while this addresses a problem in the short term it really does not matter later on.
---
I'm a stealth character and I had to get my heavy power armour build friend to gun it down because I couldn't get close to it
---
I just try to avoid them as much as possible
---
It does not increase with level.
---
Yeah I did this twice since Wastelanders dropped. Got a level 80 stealthy explosive automatic boy and a level 90 heavy weapons power armor guy to compliment my no longer viable &gt;100 Survival PvP original character.  
---
It's even more fun if you have a friend to start fresh with.
---
Not sure on the percentage of the player-base that used the dupe before it was fixed, but I do believe it is a small yet significant number. Unlimited resources means it is just a matter of crafting time, but I do agree that normally it is fairly rare. 
---
The problem is the spike in griefing at the moment caused by Update 20 griefer outrage. Therefore just keep an eye out. Heard lots of reports of people getting their bases destroyed (only takes 1 per server).
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt even think of that. Good point.
---
This bug has been fixed in the pts.
---
That's so cool! I remember doing the firebreathers quest, scrapping the suit, then relizing how cool it was. It's probably a bug that will be patched soon so I'll try it soon! Thanks!
---
Being able to cripple the queen clearly makes it far too easy
---
Excavator armor + lucky hole mine = lead ore for days (need acid to smelt it get around 900 lead)
---
West tek roof - lots of paint cans for lead/steel
---
any nuke silo has a gym with lead weights
---
Yeah me also, but i like that there are enemies that whoop your ass if you are not careful.
---
Depends on if theyre built with paradox absorbing crumple zones.
---
Excavator armor? Where can I get that
---
I love the fact that they are changing the way PvP is no more being ganged up on or ambushed by the high level hiding in the bushes
---
Fair enough. I like the challenge but they are a brick wall in the middle of the road to finishing a quest
---
Can confirm works on Xbox nice one thank you so much for this didn't fancy doing another play through
---
Why are we complaining about the only few enemies that are somewhat challenging in the game? Please leave them the way they are.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Excavator\_power\_armor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Excavator_power_armor)
---
The sooner you get our missing equipment, the better
---
Condesending ass, u just gave me the quest 2 sec ago
---
This seems to be working for me!
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Too long. Not going to even bother with it because right now it's not necessary. Will only spend bullion to stay under the max so I might get it in a couple of years organically but by no means pushing for it.
---
I dunno man. Bethesda's been doing many things to stop griefing but they always found a way to grief people. I'm pretty sure these 'pvpers' will find out a new way to harrass people cause that's all they do in this game. They don't play the base game cause they are set for life in this game since they dupe a hell lot.
---
mate half of the bugs that I read on launch wasnt properly fixed, I wait to buy the game tho , I'm only 2 months playing and  I already can put an list of 15 bugs that I suffered, is sad couse the games is good, and dont even start on the performance side, some times I think I'm on PowerPoint.
---
why do people always put 3 in tenderizer is beyond me, 1 point for 5% is enough, the 2 extra % isnt worth the 2 points...
---
I don't know man. If you've been playing since beta like myself and still have issues with those enemies... ..there's gotta be something you're doing wrong.  
---
Are you using serendipity outside PA or emergency protocols in PA? Do you have the blocker perk?  
---
What's your build? What weapons/armor do you use?   
---
My stealthy character just doesn't get seen by anything it seems so he downs all those np, my melee character was built for PvP Survival but still 1 hits everything and with gun-fu just tears through groups(plus his perks and bolstering/vanguard gear make him pretty tanky) and my Heavy Weapons PA guy omg yeah he not only 1 shots all that stuff but he doesn't need to be sneaky about it since enemies barely scratch him.
---
I am somewhat ambivalent about the change, but I think it does address that issue. As has been raised in the discussion above, PvP in adventure certainly has a ways to go in becoming an enjoyable experience.
---
I personally like NW because it disables VATS and provides a better playing field, but cheating is certainly an issue and the build attributes can be restrictive. Hopefully Bethesda looks towards more instanced/event based PvP, or utilise the new team function to schedule a 4v4 match of some sort. Could be fun.
---
That was an awesome live stream :)
---
And he talks with closed lips, and closed eyes. The horror.
---
At that point in the quest line, you're not forced to stick with one or the other. It'll be VERY clear when it gets to the point where you have to choose.
---
The only thing I found was that whichever side you go to first nets you a boost to their reputation and the quest ends. You have to manually go to the other faction (there's no quest marker) to kick off their quest line but you don't get the reputation boost.
---
After this quest you go talk to both factions. You don‚Äôt make a choice who to side with until you‚Äôve completed all of a faction‚Äôs quests. You do that to get to know both sides better. What you find is that neither is truly good or bad, they both have positives and negatives. Once you‚Äôve done all of both faction‚Äôs quests, then you make your choice who to raid with. 
---
The side you choose will give you more rep, but not picking one side doesn‚Äôt actually hurt you with them. 
---
The consequential part of Wastelanders isn‚Äôt in how each faction as a while treats you. It‚Äôs in the various actions and dialogue characters engage in based on the choices you‚Äôve made along the way. You‚Äôll see this during the prep quests, during the raid itself and with various things that happen to the characters afterward.
---
Exactly! Some of these bugs have been around for a long long time. Sometimes they get patched and then return but a lot of the bugs have been pointed out by players and the Devs have said they‚Äôre working on a fix or investigating the issue, and then nothing is ever said about it ever again. I think a forum with a new thread for every known issue would be good, with weekly updates on the progress of the fix that they‚Äôre developing for it are posted so that players can see whether they‚Äôre actually doing anything about the bugs. As of right now it doesn‚Äôt seem like they‚Äôre doing anything to fix the issues that are constantly raised by the community.
---
Camden Park. Scrap all of the Scorched weapons, and take all of their Can Chimes.
---
This was super fun
---
Personally, I'd like it more if it doubled your melee attack range for that first strike. Like the [Blitz](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Blitz) perk from Fallout 4.
---
Yeah now they do after they've already released stuff that needed the most testing they should have had the pts be public from the start. Rather or not they actually listen to the pts testers is a whole other thing considering they straight up said that they didn't think a bug that ruined an event wasn't an issue
---
My preference would be for a Vertibot/Bird blade, and only if theyd give Power Armor a 2h'd melee animation, currently looks terrible. But ya, seems weird that Super Mutants couldnt think of that.
---
yup, you get no more bonus from overrepairing. 100% and everything else is just added durability
---
I don't know about dropping in bags, but I do it in containers like ice machine whitespring station
---
World containers with 0/0 at limits are your best bet.  Suitcases at train stations have never failed me yet....heavy on the yet.
---
 These 1 of outfits should be re-obtainable anyway.  I have no idea when/how my Garb of Mysteries got scrapped or dropped.  :/
---
Make a new character and have someone mule the outfit
---
Here we go.  More whiners about PvP.  Quit complaining and having Bethesda wreck this game.  
---
If you want to play SIMS there‚Äôs a game for that.
---
Give it some time :D  
---
As long as someone finds out how to glitch it ... its gonna be biblical ! :D  
---
It is poor design, it should be knock down or something ... as you said, it is absolutely useless on melee weapons ( tbh i have not found any use for stalker ranged weapons either ).
---
yeah they happen...and get pushed to live without any fixes but dozens of bug reports anyway
---
No problem. Angry Turtle has a few really videos on shotguns. My personal favorite shotgun is a quad 33 vats hit chance faster reload double barrel. You can squeeze out 16 shots faster than a combat shotgun can squeeze out 12. 
---
Forgot to mention use a perforating magazine for the combat shotgun. With the scattershot perk maxed all shotguns reload faster regardless of magazine. Stinging mag and drum mag will give you more shots but with a shotgun you should only have to pull the trigger once... maybe twice.
---
This specific example is your best bet. However, this is not a 100% reliable method.
---
Awesome dude thanks! I'll probably do a couple tests with junk before I commit to sending over my legendary gear but thank you for the solid advice!
---
Oh yea! I forgot about that one. üëç.
---
This happens to me all the time, once you've launched the nuke quit to main menu and then relog. Make sure no-one is near any of the spawns and you should be good.
---
Are you guys forget travel agent perk card or am I dreaming about it
---
It can be tough to do solo without a solid build.
---
You can use stealth, but it can be hard to maintain vs assaultrons. You can also run full troubleshooters, but it is by no means necessary to complete the event. 
---
There are a few shortcuts you can take. Hacking can make things much easier vs turrets, and the reactor. 
---
If you want help with it, there are always people willing to help in here.
---
I'm on XB as well, and usually on after 7PM EST. If you'd like a 2nd to help run it, feel free to hit me up.
---
That has been a feature in Fallout games for awhile. It's just easier to kill the robot outright than trying to frenzy it.
---
Yea I figured it's not 100 percent reliable but I couldn't imagine bothering my friends to help me transfer gear every single time I wanted to move stuff around. I'll have to test everything out. Thank you all for the advice!
---
THIS is why I read this sub!
---
It is hard to make such a choice for another player. I would recomend checking the cliffs on border of savage divide and cranberry bog. If you like more post-apo view, it will be northern mountains in toxic valley.   
---
Nice camp places are on the southern part of the map, there is water too and I think its nice and flat.
---
It wasn't really a 'bug' more of a positive feature that they later on removed and called 'unintentional'.
---
I don't need another set but this is a great tip, and it's making me wonder what else in the game it might work on...
---
It is not allowed.
---
I'll use the cigarette vending machines as dropped bags end up in the nether, but there is still that inherent risk of losing your items.
---
I have an auto Berserker explosive RR and an auto Bloodied FFR RR and they are really fun.  The Bloodied is devastating in PvP.
---
Still broken.
---
Still not working.
---
It causes them to self destruct like a small mini nuke
---
Do you have a jetpack? Secret service goodies?
---
Faction rep maxxed? Have all their toys? Resources ready for when an event (Rad Rumble, SBQ, Project paradise etc) pops up you're good to go?&gt;
---
Personally i enjoy just seeing where and how high i can get with jetpack etc. and keeping my kit good to go.
---
My understanding is that Private servers with no one in them persist for 5 min.  I have moved things between characters a few times.
---
My suggestion is put both characters at the point of exchange.  Do not drop stuff on the ground.  Put it in a suitcase or something (I use Charleston Train station).  Change characters and pick it up.
---
#WAIT WHAT
---
Some days ago someone also suggested a central exchange hub exactly for the social fun as it would have a lot of player traffic
---
Not anymore, they broke it in a previous update. No longers spins (bugged).
---
Still not working (not spinning, not generating power).
---
Honestly, I was thinking the same - it makes sense that adding something to a display takes a small amount of CAMP budget, because that's then an additional object the servers need to load in and render whenever you or anyone else visits your CAMP, and the servers then need to keep track of its exact position and where to display it, in addition to knowing that you have whatever the object is. It's a bit strange that the refrigerators behave the same way, though... I *guess* one could argue "well, it's because the game needs to track what food is being cooled", but since these don't need to be rendered or anything, it shouldn't cost much extra... 
---
*plus!* How do vending machines work? I don't use them much myself, but, if it's possible to put something up for sale without it costing against your CAMP budget, then it really *should* behave the same way with the refrigerators...
---
On the point of the post, it is to raise awareness about an exploit that in no way resembles PvP. Griefing camps is simply ego-trip behaviour that has no recourse for the target as it stands. These people are not looking for a fight, they are looking to grief and run. 
---
Regarding the PvP comments, I personally think re-balancing and updates could fix it for adventure. I enjoy NW minus the hacking. The main points for adventure would be removing VATS, minimising the damage players take from weapons that do not require aim (or lowering effective range in PvP), nerfing stealthboys so that they expire once you shoot (like NW) and perhaps providing some structure through the new team system in Update 20. As it stands, PvP in Adventure is some of the lowest skill PvP out there due to the use of PvE tools. NW got that part right at least in removing them.
---
No longer turns (not spinning, not serving as a generator). Broke in a previous update.
---
ah so you found some more broadsiders for your ship!
---
My Vampire Vats 33% Combat Shotgun. Literally one shots 99 percent of enemies and I have zero shotgun perks on.
---
Yes, paints must be learned in order to the next one to drop.
---
This is the answer, I haven't had any issues myself using them...yet.
---
Yeah I don't think that they are thinking of that perk.
---
One of my camps had an ammo box next to it. Both characters had camps in same spot. Never failed me switching stuff over
---
I‚Äôd stick with crafting them, you‚Äôll have a much better chance at getting the piece you want because it is only drawing on one armor/weapon type.  And the cost is lower as well (at least for the armor).
---
That's what I thought but I'm not getting KNIGHTS SARGENT which is next one I should be dropping I've two Captain plans now I'll contact Bethesda my account must be bugged
---
Go north of freddy fears up onto the mountain.  continue north/northeast to a clearing that overlooks a nice valley with a fissure site to the left and a bog/swamp off to the right which contains anglers.  There is a super flat, large, nice spot there on the edge with a great view.  That will also open up free fast travel to an area of the map that normally would cost a fortune to visit.  It is n/nne from freddy fears, about 400 yards, or ne from the Red Rocket Megastop.
---
Everything ok at home?
---
I want that Vault Tec van she's got
---
This is basically how I mod my shotties as well. ; This is awesome input! üò¨üò¨üò¨
---
**Most carrying capacity and a boost to mining** = excavator  
---
**Easiest/cheapest to mod without buying plans out (imo)** = t60/t45  
---
**Best defense w/o a gold sink:** t51b (mods are very hard to find, just get plans)  
---
**Best radiation resist:** X-O1, (I believe you have to buy plans to mod this out? SO it has a cap sink?)  
---
**Best defense w/ gold sink:** T-65  
---
**DPS Boost w/ gold sink:** Strangler  
---
**Honorable mentions:** Raider PA for lowbies(15 to get in), Ultracite Power Armor (Very similar stats to t-51b, slightly better radiations resist vs less energy defense)  
---
I rock a T-51b on my power armor user at the moment. I also have a modded T-60 as it I could easily obtain all the mods for a T-60 vendor hopping. I plan on modding out a set of Excavator next for mining Ultracite in Nuke zones... ..if I were to have ANY power armor it'd probably be the T-65 as I like damage reduction and it's the most exclusive Power Armor at the moment.   
---
***To answer your question though, I'd say the T-65 is the best overall power armor.*** It has the highest energy/balistic resistances, and has 470 radiation resistance which is the 3rd highest radiation resistance next to the X0-1(highest at 513)/T-60(which only has 475 resist).
---
This!  "A nice view" is subjective.  I personally set up in the water in the Mire and I love it.  Others may want trees or ruins to enjoy.
---
Also flat is really hard to find in this game.  Roads are your best bet to find flat surfaces.
---
I like PvP too, but this wasn't it.
---
Stop whining about griefing. Griefing =/= PvP.
---
Good tip
---
Have you checked whether you can put the knight SGT paint on?
---
Yeah if you look in link I posted I've only got the knights unlocked and I've two captain plans dropped
---
Glowing Ones definitely can have limbs fall off, too.
---
Hacking made easy..... Pick the first three words if that's not it back out and go back in and repeat
---
[unlocked](http://imgur.com/gallery/RFciw2B)
---
Yep! 4 down, 2 to go
---
We're getting cursed prefix with new colossus boss fight
---
I've ONLY dropped items on the ground, never in a container (memories of losing items in prev FO titles).  Not saying it's the best strategy, but I've only lost stuff twice and i think both times were my fault.
---
I have dropped things into the blue suitcase at the whitespring station for an alt literally hundreds of times.  It has never failed me.  Bags on the other hand, have failed me multiple times.  Once I lost about 10 legacies and 40 other legendaries when a bag glitched and could not be accessed, even though you could see it just sitting there.  Always use an unlimited world container when transferring items, and try to log back in within a minute or so.
---
Or 8 days...
---
It doesn't always create this bug. Most of the time it's okay but every so often it screws up and makes you go to the vault.
---
Ouch sorry that sounds painful.
---
They should just remove the recipe after you are done with the quest.
---
If you want a lot of easy lead there are a bunch of deposits to the left of Hornwrite Test Site 3, mine it with excavator power armor and you'll get a couple hundred lead each time in less than a minute.
---
Add up the total cost of bullion and divide it by 200. That‚Äôs how many days.
---
These comments appear on every single thread complaining about any exploits people use. Do you even read the post? This clearly isn't an issue complaining about PVP
---
This is also explained pretty well in the help files (open the map, open the menu from there).  Most of the other stuff there is pretty general, but this was a happy exception.
---
If you are low level this will be the easiest to do, also equip the scrapper perk and collect and scrap all the weapons when you clear an area.
---
When you get a bit higher level you can use the Excavator armor and hit up all the lead ore nodes in the lucky hole mine, the armour collects more ore when you use it. With one run through the mine you can amass well over 1000 lead with each visit with the super duper perk while crafting.
---
The irony.
---
Fo76's pvp is a shitfest of bugs and exploits shoehorned into what is historically a single player PVE franchise. And you are crying because someone wants to take away your ability to inconvenience total an enormous majority of the population.  Strangers who just want to keep playing their beloved single player franchise. People who want to explore, delve, build wonderful camps, etc without having some maladjusted sociopath wreck all their hard work.
---
Indeed there are other games for that type of gameplay. They are called PVP games.
---
Learned in order. You have to learn the plan.
---
1. Lay down a floor trap. 
---
2. Place Fusion Gen on top. Was just a little bit of the trap showing. 
---
3. Make  connections. 
---
Exit build mode and trigger the trap.
---
Sometimes it happens to me that some mole miners remain underground so the auger does not appear.
---
FFR? Sorry, im relatively new to the game.
---
I like that idea.
---
What toy is that?  To PC public hack was updated and thus far does not seem overtly broken by patch 20 coming
---
Is that gonna be a world drop or is it locked behind gold or the colossus event?
---
Yeah but the captain is above Sargent so if I learn captain there is no way to learn Sargent
---
It's required for one of the main quests to get Rose to trust you, so they'd need a workaround for that.
---
Awesome.
---
lol true.  But even you have to admit that it is time for some new shit ones.
---
Last time it happened was in the middle of the fight. The queen was already mutated and at halve life.
---
That's what I usually do.
---
Id  say search for some fallout4 mod guides i dunno, they pretty similar (same engine)
---
Yeah that one
---
I set up my camp just south of the chem factory. I've never had to server hop to load my camp. Love it. 
---
Swamp Rat Life
---
You will in a silo.
---
Yeah we‚Äôve already been discussing that.
---
I play on PS4 lol
---
Buy them.
---
Only read the TLDR, but I agree 100%.
---
To be completely fair, I'll note that my evidence is also anecdotal. I often play in public servers, where most players stick to structures, and when I'm the only person out in the fields she only ever lands near me. Even if I'm quite far from the bunker.
---
I started paying attention after I read about it on Reddit, and it's pretty clear to me that the advice to stay in the fields is correct. Realistically if you all spread out enough, each individual player is just as safe as they'd be on the bunker.
---
mine is om the cliffs above white springs station, above and to the right of blackwater mine. greatviews and good flat spots up there
---
Hey I‚Äôm doing a competition to tell me the funiest joke and the winner gets a mutants explosive faster reload combat rifle and 2.5k 5.56 anyone wanna go to that post and join in its on xb1 only sorry ps4
---
I agree that this would be welcome, especially to those of you that have been playing since beta. I think they should also consider fixing/improving some of the more useless ones first, but yeah more variety would be fantastic. Incendiary as has already been suggested, plus cryo, poison, AP regen as you say, etc
---
Sorry, I must have loaded the page before those comments were made.
---
I blocked them for the "blocking is rude" bit. Huge red flag.
---
How were you able to farm him?
---
The people doing this likely are using a spawn projectile hack.  Its not even crafted
---
Seems it's a rare reward from boss fight only.
---
You should be able to solo at that level.
---
Buy them from the onclave officer vendor
---
You can only learn something with a Recipe: or Plan: prefix. 
---
The notes you found were lore for the Beckett/Blood Eagles side quest.
---
It's a spawn projectile hack.  Doesnt even require materials
---
Best place to go! And there's actually 5 spawns.
---
Can only buy 300 a week.
---
And don‚Äôt forget the weekly 300 from smiley
---
True!
---
Recently I submitted a ticket that Smiley wouldn't sell gold to me for over 2 weeks.  Got back a canned response that told me to visit a forum.  I clicked the link and there was nothing but posts generated by bethesda summarizing recent updates.  That was it.  No discussion, no info pertinent to my problem.  And at the end of the email, it said "We will assume that your problem is resolved if you don't reply to this ticket within 4 days."  So I replied that their response was not helpful in any way.  This same exchange repeated week after week until I just gave up.   Never did I receive a response that even slightly indicated a desire by bethesda to inform me or help me.  
---
I'm not trying to say FO76 is shit, but the support definitely is.  Like your example of the lack of any way to even track bugs or know if an item is known, is frustrating.
---
You need to focus on some particular weapon types.
---
If they do that you'll just slow the process, not stop it - people will just make new characters and rush to that quest so they can craft the bait, then they won't ever finish the quest so they can keep crafting it.
---
IMO the best way would be to replace the explosive bait in that quest with a frag mine and a separate bait item, used in tandem. It could even have the same ingredients in the end, and that bait item could be valuable even when not paired with explosives (e.g. To draw enemies to a specific spot so you can sneak attack them).
---
I don‚Äôt even know what that is.
---
If he‚Äôs not bugged tho
---
No worries!
---
I very rarely go there, and using hacking is not absolutely necessary. But yea, you are right.
---
Don't shoot the heads of robots it's the most armored part aim for the legs or torso.
---
Whenever the  uranium fever event is on, loot everything off the mole miners and scrap it all. You get quite a good amount of steel.
---
Quite right, 6000 was what I was thinking, I'll update it.
---
Maybe not, but it ended up being a lot better than Survival Mode/Adventure Mode PVP
---
Right, makes sense. Is this active at the moment?
---
Don't Shoot The Piano Player
---
It sure is. You can also equip a piece of armor with the stat "take 15% less damage while blocking" and it will make every shotgun magical in vats for some strange reason.
---
I‚Äôve never seen him bugged before. I just make sure when I go see him it‚Äôs after Saturday when he resets.
---
The only shotgun I've seen break super fast is an AA explosive combat one I have, and I'm pretty sure it's the explosive doing that.  Any other I've used seems to last forever.
---
Easy fix if they can't fix how explosive bait works:  Remove explosive bait from the game.  For the quest that uses it, create static bait that you walk up to and interact with that creates the trapped bait.  Problem solved.
---
This was out way back in FO3. It's been in every FO since. I'm not sure how you missed it.
---
Sounds like you are missing some of the lead nodes in lucky hole.  One run with super duper will give me anywhere from 1400 to 2000.
---
We watched quite a bit of the stream and it looked like a blast!
---
yes
---
Consume something that raises your intelligence level and there will be less words to choose from on the screen the higher players intelligence.
---
It would be cool to have it as a power armor only weapon in the same way unarmed stuff doesn't work with power armor.
---
When it starts happening drop some grenades or sprint away then 180 and start firing. Also Blocker is your friend.
---
I would rather they get the monorail up and working and have it stretch across the map diagonally. Would be a fun way to travel and you know there would be camps littered along the path.
---
didnt know about the one on the roof of the school! :)
---
I do, Rad Ant Slayer, maybe. Lol.
---
Oh I missed that. My bad. I think they‚Äôve changed the drops for them. I‚Äôve been stuck at CPT for like 75 tech datas and have gotten 3 BOS underarmor shielded lining plans.
---
Only 5 times? You must be new here...
---
"Oh god, hes too stupid to know what a paradox is!"
---
This. Be thankful that 40% swing speed hasn‚Äôt shown up in ranged weapons yet.
---
I like this.  You are just zooming along and then you jump out cause you see a camp that looks cool.
---
Wow didn‚Äôt expect someone to respond that quickly. Do you by any chance have a video to show the whole process? Thanks üòÑ
---
that rollercoaster pic is wizard
---
Are you using unyielding armor? A lot of people play below 20% hp to get stat buffs and then when you revive, you're at %25 hp so you don't have as much stats and you're overencumbered.
---
They fixed it in the current PTS patch, so you can expect this bug to be gone by june 30th.
---
Figured it out y‚Äôall,I had to double check the mouth style numbers in character create under a new character. In there it rendered mouths correctly 1 being smooth and 5 being wrinkled so with that knowledge I went back and switched the mouth type I had back to 1 since it was on 5. It didn‚Äôt render back correctly right away as this game is broken until I quit and re entered.

And the award for "Answer that provided zero help" goes to...

Indeed. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 76 is better than I initially expected in terms of game content. It's enjoyable and I really like the sound of what's to come in terms of the upcoming updates. But the QOL flaws and the bugs really do get on most people's nerves and now and then it makes you sit back and wonder why do they not just address it? A lot of these bugs are around a long time. Why not just fix it?  
---
Personally have never submitted a ticket but judging by your experience and that of a lot of people who have submitted tickets to no avail, it seems futile. They have a thread on the Bethesda forums at the moment under the Fallout 76 support section for 'Known issues and bugs' but the Dev's never comment on it so it's somewhat pointless. It'd be great to see a detailed timeline or roadmap of how they're dealing with these bugs. It'd be great clarity and transparency for the playerbase, and then they'd also receive less duplicate reports (people reporting the same bugs over and over) because we'd be able to see that they've acknowledged and are working on the bug in once centralized location.
---
Yeah, so you now know 4/5. You're getting there!
---
I started farming it late and I only lack the helm. As with everything in life it goes by quicker once you actually start doing it. 
---
If you are a power armor player then it is quite nice.
---
That's a fair argument, but also the first intelligent argument I've hear put forward about it.
---
In my experience on here these people are usually just "no because no, I don't want so you can't have" rahrahrah 
---
I only ever ask for balance or a separate place for pvp/ve players.. NW is a nice thought but doesn't cut it due to how most people that play it don't like pvp and only are in it begrudgingly for rewards.
---
And TBF I don't even care that much about the team flagging being removed bc I don't use that feature anyway I just worry that it's just another piece being taken away that they don't want to fix and so many people seem to be trying to use it to get the rest taken away.
---
This game would be incredibly boring without pvp in adventure.. I know no one here cares, but it's the only thing still keeping me invested after just 3 months of play and coming here being treated like a criminal for liking a feature doesn't exactly feel welcoming.
---
Oh wow, I hadn't thought about that.  Going to be weird going back.
---
If you learn the shielded lining can you still keep dropping them after. I'll contact customer support see what they say if no joy may have to make another character or hope some one is selling the one I need.
---
Even on the consoles? Happened to two friends on xbox yesterday. They both hopped servers before anything too crazy happened.
---
Exactly!
---
I see. Dunno then as that is what it should be. Might be worth a ticket.
---
No they need to buff power armor and make it relevant again this is a great idea as of right now power armor is pointless there‚Äôs no legendary effects or weight mods that can up how much you can hold power armor needs a big buff nobody pvps so let us have good power armor
---
It would be cool if you could add a 30mm cannon or rocket pods to the shoulders of pa. I would use it more if you could add armaments.
---
Thanks for your time anyway.
---
i feel the same way. i played F76 religiously from release for over a year before going back to FO4 for a short while. the game play just messed me up. i still love FO4 but the mechanics threw me right off after playing 76, mind you i have done 5 play-throughs of Fallout 4 and keep finding new things all the time. The one thing i can say that i don't miss from 76 when i play 4..... hearing those damn wings flapping \*screeeeee\* urgh goddamn scorthbeast
---
Me and my buddies do this regularly on PS4, keep an eye on the event marker - usually we get 5 or 6
---
I would love me some power armor only weapons.
---
Yea I agree completly I used to use power amour but now I‚Äôm trying to get a good set of ss amour
---
On console no its probably just people who made them and duped them in the last dupe.
---
80% of the map is catered to players lvl 5-20, so end lvl theres not a whole lot to do
---
Vending machines used to work the same way, they implemented a fix so they don't take camp budget. So they actually already know how to fix this.
---
I already answered that question.
---
It has been happening to my friend for a while, but just started happening to me when I got the chemist mod for my backpack. I think it loads you without your armor so any weight benefits you get from it don't count. That includes unyielding stuff, and deep pocketed.
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
Personally, I just scrapped a few of them.  Theres only like 4 or 5 mods iirc, and it took me long enough to find one roll that I wanted to use that I was able to find a few as loot before then.  And wastelanders made them more common in the world.  It never crossed my mind to buy them as others have indicated though.
---
As a real estate agent in real life, I support this.
---
Its bugged.  I have seen some folks say you can open a ticket.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know as I don‚Äôt run lock and load on my heavy weapon power armor build. There are too many good strength perks to sacrifice the points on lock and load.
---
Unfortunately you have to get the last hit, I've been playing since beta and haven't been lucky enough lmao
---
I'm with this guy. Almost everything is super trivial after a certain point in endgame. I like having to be scared/challenged by some enemies.
---
No worries. I've now noticed one of mine doesn't have it either. I need to do some investigating lol.
---
lvl 95 Behe takes 1 or 2 shot of railway rifle on bloodied build, and on my FH heavy gunner (no comm perks, only demolition expert and bloodie mess boosted dam) my 2shot expl railway rifle killed him in less than a mag (10 spikes/mag)
---
so once u get some good leggys, whole game feels like a tour at disneyland
---
It's been active since the last version of the hack was put out.  The create projectiles vtable was added and allows someone to essentially spawn any kind of projectile into the world.  It was broken after the author left the community, but has since been updated.
---
Wow, that‚Äôs brutal. I‚Äôll never get those atoms then lol
---
Mines been that way for over a year now and not even a solo kill counts
---
I posted about this yesterday and got down voted back to zero. I'm glad I'm not the only one seeing this.
---
The fastest way I learned the plans was that this was my main objective in the game. The time frame was 20 runs five or take to get a paint plan. I would say and average of four days or so per paint. Additionally, one or four Technical Data your turn in doesn‚Äôt matter. I got the last one when I only turned one in. The grind sucks. I got to the Charleston Herald building, the desk at the Whitesprings, Sugar Grove, AMS headquarters &amp; Harpers Ferry. You have a good chance of getting them out of lock pick 3 safes.
---
Needs 2 people or accounts. One just sits on the server while the other keeps logging off/on which resets his inventory.
---
Or Daily? Ward can't seem to hold onto his 'Vital equipment."
---
There's a grand total of 5. 4 of them are obtained by scrapping them and have a high or medium chance of learning them and the last one is the prime receiver that the SBQ has a chance to drop.
---
Lmao yep, people say the best way is to solo it, good luck to anyone trying that without a bloody build
---
Right and I'm saying the toy thus far doesn't look to be going away.  At least not unless there are more changes coming to the PTS build
---
The reason Survival died? PvE'ers **wouldn't stay out of it** for the XP boost, and complained *constantly* about PvP. BGS kept breaking the actual PvP in the servers to placate the farmers, until it was finally unplayable.
---
I might start a new character and try get them again and give them to main hopefully it will pop this time round.
---
Hi,  Regkuy, Burnt_piggy, i've got some gifts for you.  My PSN: Padaka 
---
Jump to my camp in the evening today. I will fulfill your dreams for Free.
---
Sorry for language, i'm Polish so...
---
Pretty sure they're fixing that in Update 20.
---
I mean... Wouldn't be much (if any?) sillier than having all these supposed two-heanded melee weapons we can apparently just easily hold in one hand. (At least while idle in PA, but still.)
---
Oh sorry, in a way yes (exploding damage) but I found I get better results with a regular instigating.
---
The tse is good for tagging if that's what you're after. Sometimes line in the sand bugs out and all the scorch fall from the sky over the sonic machine over and over. Easy 1k xp a pop there with tse, get them all tagged before the minigun guy. Also good for tagging when the bees bug out during meat week (not sure that's a thing anymore).
---
Sorry to hear that you got downvoted, but thanks for doing your part to let everyone know about the grief. Upvoted.
---
Great information, thank you!
---
It was indeed
---
Yea but they can only be used In power amour mad hold it in 2 hands
---
Okay, very good to know. I think I've only ever used explosive shotguns, so that may be why.
---
They were "rewards" from the month Wastelanders launched. If you missed out, they're probably gone for good.
---
True but Rocksy and Ward are still working to our benefit.
---
The drill appears for me just has empty containers.
---
Strange that they wrote about it in the last ITV then.
---
yeah i still haven't been able to complete the wastelanders story for two months cause my story is bricked
---
Can't you craft that one though?
---
It would be super nice, but I don‚Äôt think vehicles in this engine work very well. Horses in Skyrim are generally iffy, and I personally know that traveling in vertiburds in 4 would crash my game every now that then; modded and vanilla, PC and XBone
---
Have you logged out and logged back in?
---
I know. I just was commenting on the lack of drops of the paint plans for myself. I‚Äôve stalled out on the progression.
---
I still boost, it's a server side thing so no way to really know. I've had good results in the past boosting luck and charisma, especially early on with purveyor. I know it helped with world drops early on in the game too.
---
All these guys who claim to know, they really don't it's all figured server side. Only the devs know.
---
Yes, I have just done that. It's still the same üò≠üò±
---
Haven't seen anyone mention vampires or medics yet.  Each hit counts, and shotguns fire 8 pellets (8 potential hits).  On my shotgunner, i mainly use vampires combat with 33%vats for the magic effect.  I can solo encrypted with it.  Also use Four leaf clover which basically allow you to have endless crits with shotguns.
---
In an ideal world we can have well balanced and developed PvE and PvP modes. I'd love to have a better implementation of PvP in adventure mode that isnt just a gear-check (I think that's one of the best parts of NW). Sadly, it appears that development is a zero-sum equation.
---
 We barely get enough PvE updates as it is, so asking for equal measures of PvP revisions just doesn't feel realistic. I think a good comparison would be the vault raids; wildly unpopular and broken. BGS opted to remove them entirely rather than fix them, and I think that's where a large part of the community sits with respect to PvP at this point.
---
We have a rail network and even a monorail.
---
Like, the answer is right goddamn there.
---
Pretty sure you can get another if you find another Torn Dress dead lady, theres one on the cliff lookout thing right by Mountainside Bed and Breakfast
---
I want roller skates, then I could use my jetpack to propell myself forward faster than sprint speed.:-D
---
Transit Call of Duty Zombies
---
Is there a Ward trick? Besides him standing inside of objects of course.
---
I mean, it‚Äôs already hard enough to kill people as it is. But I don‚Äôt think you should fast travel, but instead there be a few separate busses that you have to go to a bus stop to wait for. And that‚Äôs *if* Bethesda could make vehicles work. Assuming it would be on a fixed route like the few times you had to use a vertibird in 4, it might work.
---
It taking me about 2 days none stop to get the captain twice hopefully you get your next soon it's frustrating when you see the two items pop and nothing else got loads of bomber jackets and army fatigues though lol
---
Dude dont advertise your posts in someones elses thread lmfao
---
It is, its almost like they want people to think they are doing something about the NW hacking, but they actually aren't doing anything.  Only time will tell though
---
Ok sorry I will delete it
---
Yeah i thought of that too but some rails are completely destroyed like the whitesprings ones
---
Maybe he forgot super duper?
---
Or maybe hes like me and doesnt have 1st, so I really cant hold that much lead too long.  When I go I only take what I can reliably use and hold.  Typically end up leaving with enough ore for 1200 lead, about 600 to 700 of which is consumed on arrival to lighten the load.
---
I couldn't disagree more. FO76 is the easy mode-- you may find some survival challenge, until about level 15 when eating/drinking/medicine/ammo are ridiculously easy to find. And on the topic of ammo, yes FO4 has oodles of it but 76 is the same way. The only way there's scarcity is if you happen to be exploring places recently cleared, or you're intent on using the same gun all the time and aren't a very good shot.
---
At least in FO4 there was the Survival difficulty level, which made enemis much more of a threat and had you dealing with a harsher save function. In 76 the enemies are frequently mindless to handle and there is no real consequence for death, never any lost progress; you just rez nearby, pick up your junk (which often isn't needed anyway since there's tons of it) and move on.
---
I've played FO4 for thousands of hours (a lot of mods and hang time) and I've played 76 for a few hundred, and I can't see how anyone can claim 76 is the harder game. It has no difficulty setting and after the first 15 levels is mostly Easy setting from 4, with the occassional run-in with tough encounters.
---
Exactly
---
I am not counting the one at the top of the emergency center. theres loading and fighting involved. too much trouble for a server hop hunting.
---
but after more than 2000 f76 hours I‚Äôm still learning something new. 
---
good I‚Äôm getting there.
---
What do you think it has to do with then?
---
I usually luach nuke, drop my tent in the zone for FT. Do a fast lap or pick all the flux i can while there sre no enemies, everything is usually dead . Fast travel to my camp (by foundation) . Leave the server from my camp. Immediately rejoin, which spawns me at camp. FT to nuke zone, clear it, FT to camp. Than repeat the process. 
---
Dont wait to rejoin, servers can do down even though they are supposed to stay up. Also never join a public server in between because it will close your  private.
---
I just thought buses as although a train sounds better most of the rails are destroyed also buses for Bethesdas sake cause they couldn‚Äôt get us cars or bikes cause they‚Äôd be added in a day and all severs would crash
---
Are you on crack?
---
No I'm trying to find out what you think.
---
Yay, awesome congrats:) it's so fun.
---
I do not want nor need a new way to travel around the map..
---
BIKES! THE HORSES OF THE APPALACHIA! IMAGINE ALL DA SKINS!!!!!! GRAHUAHUAHUAHUAHAHAHAHAHHA
---
What people want is irrelevant. The engine/servers simply cannot handle vehicles. It's a moot point to even talk about it. We couldn't even have squirrels for the first  month of Wastelanders.
---
Had that happen right at the end of the parade once, right after the quest steps cleared for escorting all the robots to the bonfire area. Someone in a Mystress of Mysteries outfit, of all things to wear, tossed a bunch of explosive bait out, failing the event immediately. They got a whole bunch of angry reactions and I think they ended up getting run off the server, because I never saw them again at the parade after that.
---
I wanted that van when I seen itüôÇ
---
You make a great point tbh like many people still believe that legacys should be removed cause they don‚Äôt have them
---
I thought most people were playin on Bethesda launcher
---
That instigating pvp while in a group will no longer flag the group for pvp.
---
I dont see the need for any more fast travel options, unless it could be used while overencumbered. 
---
But it would be a good way to move people into a new off map area. Although the map is already set up for that from some train stations
---
I mean at that point, if people are rushing to get an item that allows them to exploit and greif CAMPs there is not much that's gonna stop them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That's a slippery slope.
---
Also what would happen if everyone paid for more camp space? The servers struggle as it is. If everyone had huge camps then it would crash even more.
---
My solution would be reduce the player count from 24 to 18. That would free up 600% worth of camp space, divide that between the remaining 18 players and you would get an extra 25% camp budget per player.
---
It would also make the game run better in general. Probably.
---
The prison - the yard has a bunch of dumbells and supermutants for weapon scrap. Vault Tech university - the middle building has a two gyms- one on the first floor and one in the test vault below.  With the Charleston fire house and hotel in Flatwoods, that's usually my lead run.
---
It doesn't affect your chances. Neither does Charisma or Luck. Luck only affects the condition when you find gear, Intelligence only affects the condition when crafting.
---
Well since you actually know how to communicate, let me ask you.. Do you really think even a theoretical removal of PVP would get rid of griefing or amplify it? I can't name a single online game where griefing doesn't happen.. Shit even NMS where combat itself hardly exists has rampant base/location griefing issues.
---
I feel like this could have a bad backswing with people that have nothing better to do but finding new was to mess with players.. Maybe I'm just a pessimist but creating needless division in any community usually doesn't play out well.
---
There's a terminal in there to skip the reactor. Saves time.
---
And yet we got two major settlements requiring significant map changes and structure creation, and several large factions of actual, real people overnight.
---
Who woulda thunk?
---
I'm not gonna lie...if you can't find my Vendor...you can't read or are not even trying...
---
About [1%](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/chances.html?patch=P19&amp;formids=0046D296-0046D29A). (By default, if you completed the related quest at least once, you have a 10% chance of getting the plan once.)
---
[Vendor](https://1drv.ms/v/s!Ah1Of2BbsdtFpC2Jgyo46BQRUsnc)
---
I was thinking for survival mode if it ever gets added back
---
I usually only do about 4 every time I play so it‚Äôs been taking me a while. The enclave military wing has desks that I empty out. Other than that, I don‚Äôt actively farm them.
---
Oh you think this is PVPers who are butthurt?  Sorry to say this is likely just trolls.  There lots of people in the FO76 community that just like to wreck havoc with the game.  That whole war on FO76 thing was all just a couple of people pretending to be bigger than they actually are
---
Please no - leave the "BattleBus" to Fortnite.
---
If I want to fast travel, without fast traveling, [here‚Äôs what I do](https://youtu.be/nbYemhMfq3E)
---
This is awesome üëçüèª
---
Only if you have the original. The original one is need to upgrade but cant be crafted without it
---
I started off selling purified water and Stims.  You can hunt ticks and then use chemist and super duper perks to make loads and loads of diluted stims to sell.  These days it almost all from my vending machines.  I do at least one legendary farming run a session.  There also companion quests, events and stopping by every queen fight.  I also sell cheap so shit moves.  I do watch markets a little bit, so I know to charge more for bloodied, junkies etc, but really only a few minutes when I‚Äôm already on reddit.
---
I‚Äôve actually been keeping my eye out for a Vampires shotty to play around with...and since I have the Blocker effect on one of my armor pieces it‚Äôll be magic too. üò¨üò¨ I hear the vampire effect is good on a shotty. I wanna test it out. ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
If your on xbox I'll give you mine
---
That's some mighty fine 'squatchin.
---
The griefing will likely continue of course. There will always be a cat and mouse arms race with the devs and new ways to grief. My hope is that if PvP is removed, it might usher in a new wave of gameplay changes that benefit the general playerbase. More compelling workshop mechanics for example, or maybe more exciting perks and weapons that couldn't fly before because they had to be considered for PvP.
---
Dupers have already ruined the shit out of the game. Plans are practically worthless anyways since the majority of people have them all or selling them at cheap prices like 1 cap a piece.
---
Ah dang it, never noticed, makes sense it would work the same as the weapons though.
---
I did the same with the Responder Policeman outfit.  It's supposed to be an ultra-rare drop from the Back on the Beat event, so I've been doing that whenever possible.  No luck, so far.
---
I use a quad double barrel magic shotgun it's brilliant. They don't break as fast as people think. Well I don't think they do I can do scorched beast queen 3 times before they break but that's with weapon art on .
---
I agree dud, Bethesda needs to make this official!
---
Whoever wrote the insult bot's lines must've had a blast.
---
Biased perception. bugs like Miniguns or Shotguns dealing gamebreaking amounts of damage haven't been fixed for months either.
---
they should have been made untradeable when they removed them from the loot pool.. many people who had a legacy before they were legacy got them legit..
---
Yeah you can fit a fusion generator inside, but you need to use the rug glitch to run power from the generator to the outside of the dome (unless you run the wiring through the door, but that‚Äôll look stupid). So basically, put the generator inside, place down a door mat, place a power conduit on the mat, connect the conduit to the generator, select the mat and move it over just a little and place it back down. Now when you pick the mat up for a second time, you can literally move it anywhere in your camp and the wire will stay connected (through glass, walls, foundations, roofs, objects, and even the ground).
---
This is of course if someone has enough of all the materials. If they are missing just 1 item they will have to repair everything piece by piece.
---
The only endgame
---
100% agree wi that one
---
So i have experimented with weight reduction. I think I've found my sweet spot after trying a few setups. 
---
4 pieces of weapon weight reduction gear, 1 fdc piece. Pharmacist's backpack (chems and stims), bandolier for ammo, and batteries included. 
---
With this setup I can loot 150+ weapons and still run. If i drop a few damage cards I can add bear arms too.
---
The back pack was a great add too. Now if I empty my loot, I can still run in power armor. 
---
I dont run any deep pockets, I like stabilized and ultra light and dense way better.
---
The only thing I can't carry a lot of is food, but with the new ability to directly eat things, I just rummage for food. 
---
As for useful secondary armor, it is now worth picking up a crafting set to make the new faction weapons and armor. Intelligence is key to crafting so unyielding +int, fortunately level is not important. 
---
 
---
So plans. My plan for those is based on value. Vendor space is restricted, so selling a bunch of 50 cap plans is a waste. If i can't get 200 or more caps, i drop it. I tend to do so in front of my vendors along with some food and unuseful ammo. Gift to the customers. 
---
It is a fun build, and very versatile. I like having a lot of different weapons for situations. Very quality of life based. 
---
I hate dying, so bloodied was not for me. And unless you are very skilled at min/maxjng I probably do more damage with my lever action, way away from melee range (one shooting gutsys). And if I get spotted, well I do cary 5 heavy weapons.
---
Thanks, I will give this a shot
---
Doesn't hurt to leave with less either way because if you grab everything you just have to sit and spam the smelt button even longer.   Really wish they would add a slider or a "smelt all" button.  Something would need to be adjusted for super duper to work correctly but my god it sucks having to press the button 220 times in a row.
---
Can you help me work on my underground base psn same as on here
---
I am rolling secret service armor for 4 characters‚Ä¶ i would really like to be able to exchange armors between them. The bloodied build rolls Vanguard or Autostim, the full health one gets Unyelding‚Ä¶etc. It is so frustrating to have to scrap a good armor piece that you want to stop playing !
---
Once you learn that method, use it every time for all your camps. It‚Äôs hands down the best way to hide all wiring.
---
I notice you mention a fusion generator and missile turrets which require power but not how many wires or power conduits you have. A poorly handled electrical situation can chew through budget. Do you play on PC? I'd love to stop by and check out your camp to see if I can help. If so, and you feel comfortable, send me your game details on a private message.
---
In most cases yes, that is correct.  When it comes to Bethesda, their priority seems to be anything that takes away from the grind gets fixed first, then game breaking bugs.  
---
For example.  The Armor bug was immediately fixed.  It wasn't really causing instability issues.  However energy weapons(non legacy) still have issues where you can't loot ash/goo piles.  Same level of bug, nothing really game breaking, one got fixed the other didn't. The difference one keeps you from stuff and one kept you from having to repair your armor if something looked your general direction.
---
Thats why I just do Sundew Grove instead of V9, no place to really sit on a fence and they patched sitting on the flowers stalks and now mobs will spawn up on them to keep pll on the ground. But I can kill the SBQ in 2 min or less regardless if she lands or not. There are plenty of OP in game weapons, armors, and aides that will bring her to her knees quickly. Until a colossal problem arrives, Im not worrying about the Wendigo  inside the grove as the odds of that showing with a nuke are like 1:1000. Get me in, get my XP, my repair kits, my flux, and off to the next silo.
---
Prime receiver mods also drop from Xmas presents and mole miner pails.
---
if they just fix the bugs that plague the combat and the desync and performance, they sure would start to gain some form of respect again couse this time they don't have moders to fix the bugs they can't, like on fo4 where all the textures where 2x bigger and blurryer than needs to be and a modder fixed that and guess what half the shuttering on PC was gone by that, I don't get all those modders doing amazing work and fixing what was supposed to not be broken, and bethesda can't fix theyr on mess on 76.
---
but in game content and mechanics (besides the legendary rng) is a hell of good game.needs more content tho for high lvls, a new map perhaps like eso, a map can support a limited amount of content tho.
---
Honestly, for yall sake I hope they do. I won't be here to experience that. But, I guess it's my fault for not giving the game a fair chance earlier bc I'm starting to feel like I would've appreciated it way more pre-wastelanders. I'm sure it would bring in more people but the ideal friendly Appalachia doesn't cut it for me. It's too unimmersive to play a post apocalypse game and not worry about the people at all.
---
But.. Here's to hoping the RUST console release is sooner than later üçª
---
Yea but 'all the materials' doesn't mean everything needed to build the place from scratch. You only need a fraction of what's normally required, and the materials are largely common ones, so other than the odd time I use crops and don't have any on hand, the issue you mention is easy to deal with. One could have 5lbs of repair stuff in the stash for situations like this.
---
If it a double barrel, quad is generally always good.
---
Easiest way to get strong is probably plasma caster build right now, since all you have to do is finish wastelanders and get 750 gold, slap that shit together, jump into some power armor, and respec into a basic heavy vats build like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D_JUXQ6EsI
---
The plans are coming from Xmas presents. People still have tons of them. I personally know someone with 530 million in a stash box. There isn‚Äôt currently a dupe unless you‚Äôre on pc.
---
they acknowledged it as bug, while it was dedicated in the patchnotes of wastelanders as a bugfix. this note is removed btw, but i can swear i there was a line where they claimed it was a bug that we were able to cripple her wings.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CZctgLEmkQ
---
Why do people want this and Firebreather? Just for RP purposes?
---
I‚Äôm on PC, I‚Äôm going by sites and seeing you can buy 3000 miner pails so I think found the answer if those have been duped! Crazy really but that‚Äôs how it is!
---
I don't recall if there is a way to get him to award rep prior to awarding the quest rep.  If so it would work just like Rocksy.
---
the issue is that the splash damage will do a little damage to other nearby foes, then when you want to shoot them the Instigating effet will not work since there are not at full health anymore‚Ä¶
---
Only because they either thought they fixed it, or can't figure out how to.
---
Yes I know this. I was just stating that if you‚Äôre missing a component you won‚Äôt be able to repair all in one click and you‚Äôll have to go find that component to repair with one click. 
---
Or a work around is to store that broken item and then repair everything.
---
Have the camera photos be items in Misc, like Rosalynn's in the quest. Hell, have a special camera for that purpose if it's such a huge deal, Davenport could give us one when we first pick the quest up. Sell the photos or turn them in and they're removed from inventory.
---
(And while at it: if I sell them to settlers or raiders, don't force the double loading screen on me, just have the quest end there.)
---
this is happening to me since I installed the grocers mod on my backpack.
---
I knew about moving some things via rug but didn't know about conduits. Nice one buddy!
---
For me personally it's trying to get completion (All plans, all main/side quests done, all exploration nodes, all outfits) The side portion is trying to get a God Roll armor unyielding secret service set / god roll gun for all the new untradeables. Another side portion is just patching sets together for fun and trading.
---
Oh man, good to know! I‚Äôll ask a friend next time. Thanks!
---
Yeah, pc is still the Wild West version of this game. Xbox to a lesser extent and PS4 is pretty much locked down as far as exploits. I‚Äôm on PS4 and the only widely known exploits involve Nuclear Winter. Keyboard/mouse stuff and aim bots.
---
^this
---
Yeah it‚Äôs been a building truck since fallout 4 and worked day 1 in 76. Makes wiring so much easier!
---
If you have FO1st it should work on a private server without the 2nd person.
---
Yeah, because they had the time to do it. Game devs have a process they HAVE TO do for every bug, and it can be time consuming. If a modder tries to fix something and ends up making it worse, oh well, no big deal, if a dev does that, they get in a lot of trouble. Not to mention the approval process for getting those bug fixes approved for distribution from Microsoft and Sony.
---
Modders have zero accountability if their mods break a game. They have nothing but time, and dont have to follow any standards of any kind. Game devs could do the same work that modders do, but they have limitations for very good reason.
---
Would be cooler if it auto attack hostiles. Imagine sbq fights where you don‚Äôt have to worry about looking for that rad roach in the grass or that stingwing flying around.
---
It looks like it's just a Mii skin. Still pretty cool, though.
---
FT should only be allowed to player bases, 76 and events..
---
should have to walk everywhere else..
---
As someone new to the game, I couldn't play a solo low level character because I'd keep getting one shotted by some random lvl 60 cave cricket or 62 charred feral ghoul that I didn't even see coming at me which was spawned in by other high level players in the area. I see where you're coming from, wanting more to do in the end game, but if they let the enemies spawn any higher the game would have been nearly unplayable for me to start without access to private world.
---
Having played two characters to that point neither one of them took more than 50 to get the plans.  Hundreds or thousands sounds like something is wrong.
---
works with explosive weapons too, i got excited and did it until i realised its the firebreather uniform and not the really rare one lmao
---
Justmake sure your perk load out is ready to fight the SBQ, get better weapons and armour, make sure you're using your aide items like bobbleheads, magazines, meats, drinks, and chems! My alt is like lvl 65 and I can bring down the SBQ in minutes even without the crippling effect and doing it alone. The fence sucks ass as she can't lock on to players there, but I stay in the field, usually by the grove and just demolish her and her sisters as they come out. Don't be a wimp and sit on a fence, you can't loose junk anymore so just go gun-ho!
---
Yup i know
---
And just FYI, everyone uses rugs or floor mats for this because they are small and inconspicuous, but you can attach those power conduits to literally any item in the floor or wall decour sections. So if you want to put them on a cardboard cutout instead, you can, just follow the same method and you‚Äôll have unbreakable wires on anything.
---
Yes. They work on the Gauss shotty. 50% limb damage, 33% Vats, and 40% bashing damage. üò¨
---
I don't know, but tell him / her not to give up. It took almost thousands of Technical Datas to get them all. He'll / She'll get them all eventually :)
---
I‚Äôll give that a shot! Any chance you would know how long it takes for his inventory to reset?
---
Fast traveling doesn‚Äôt cost that much, and it doesn‚Äôt even take that long to get around on foot either.
---
Happens to me Quite often with weight reduction Stuff and unyielding. Ive heard multiple reports on it beeing fixed on the test Server build and the fix will probably Come with update 20 on the 30th of june. Fingers crossed!
---
Also, if you have the blocker effect on an armor piece, it‚Äôll make all your shotties ‚Äúmagical‚Äù. Lol
---
Kill them first so you can farm them for uranium ore, frog eggs, frog legs, and skip making that stupid frog jar altogether. Massive waste of time and resources imho
---
I‚Äôve been stuck after CPT for over 75 datas
---
I sadly play on PS4, my wiring is very minimal I have about 3 actual wires, the ones connecting the water purifier and then 6 power connectors
---
Just don‚Äôt increase the weight. Make it power armor only. I‚Äôm already over encumbered. Ha.
---
I wanna ride a Brahmin. I got the outfit n' chaps, Black Cowboy Hat and bandana. All I need now is a Brahmin.
---
And hey it's LORE FRIENDLY :D
---
Ooooh gonna try this tonight!
---
God Howard
---
Yea like my stash is never below 730 I have to much stuff
---
&gt; For example.  The Armor bug was immediately fixed.  It wasn't really  causing instability issues.  However energy weapons(non legacy) still  have issues where you can't loot ash/goo piles.  Same level of bug,  nothing really game breaking, one got fixed the other didn't. The  difference one keeps you from stuff and one kept you from having to  repair your armor if something looked your general direction. 
---
Be specific about the armor bug because I remember people still complaining about power armor being lost after the update to address it. The stat gain from over repairing items with Fix It Good Perk was done several months after release.
---
It does happen, and it happens more than you think.
---
Thank you so much for sharing this info with us, I just tried it and it worked perfectly.
---
Note:  A plasma grenade is definitely an "outside toy" and in addition to liberating the Firebreather Outfit from the display case completely trashed the Overseers home.
---
All you need now is a collosus to turn up and you have then the trifecta of pain and suffering
---
If you camped there because of Fasnacht, maybe plan to camp by that little lake near where Meat week will take place. Guaranteed to have a TON of visitors stopping by when Meat week kicks off. It‚Äôs nice and flat, near water, soon to be high foot traffic, it‚Äôs an ideal location. I camped there last year and it was a huge hit with a lot of people checking it out. [Here‚Äôs a look at that camp and area it‚Äôs in](https://youtu.be/P9phGiQfHOQ)
---
hur dur dur
---
Furious is pretty decent on shotguns and has no penalties. The first hit won't be full damage, the second will be almost(varies due to a few factors), and every hit past that is as strong as Junkie's. This is also true of laser and plasma pistols/rifles with beam splitters, but they sadly can't use shotgun perks.
---
For the second slot, it depends on whether it's gauss or what exactly you're using it for. The Enforcer perk is crazy good when crippling enemies is more desirable than killing them, and it synergizes very well with explosive legendaries or gauss explosions so that's a very popular go-to for good reason. +33% VATS accuracy is rather good, especially since the rubberbanding health thing largely doesn't happen in VATS. +25% Fire rate isn't terrible, but I'm not a big fan of it on shotguns personally. Every other slot 3 legendary is nothing special. A buff is a buff, but inferior to these others.
---
Slot 3 is generally best with -25% VATS cost since, again, the health glitch is a nightmare. The exception is the pump action shotgun suffers greatly from it's reload time, so reload speed is ideal for it it my opinion.
---
For mods, I prefer setups emphasizing VATS and fire rates. Not using VATS cripples your damage output due to the health glitch. Forceful stock, reflex sight, aligned long barrel, no muzzle mod, and hair trigger or vicious receiver is how I roll. I use shotguns exclusively in VATS or fired at the ground for Enforcer and I don't get the glitch until I try manually aiming directly at an enemy. Suppressors are options I avoid because of the range penalty. As much as they reduce range, you may as well be holding your gun by the barrel to use it as a club instead.
---
Durability is fine to me.
---
The gauss shotgun is a class unto itself with it's ridiculous damage output. It has no suppressor nor option to be fully automatic because that would break the game. The others just can't compete, and this is absolutely worth the Foundation rep grind. I used up all my luck for this entire year and crafted a Bloodied +33% VATS hit chance -25% VATS cost. I drop regular scorchedbeasts before you can blink and the few enemies in the game tougher than them don't last either. It's basically the Unstoppable Monster of shotguns. It'll be toned down once the legendary damage glitch is finally patched, but still extremely powerful.
---
Double barrel remains an interesting option if Quad and Explosive due to it's extremely high fire rate cap(basically as fast as you can pull the trigger: on par with an automatic rifle that has a 2 or 8 unit magazine if you're fast enough).
---
The combat shotgun remains versatile with it's huge array of mods, the only shotgun that can go fully automatic. There's no wrong way to use it. Well, except without a long barrel.
---
The pump action is largely, almost completely obsolete at this point. It's lackluster selling points are how easy it is to unlock mods, just generally looking cool, and, bizarrely enough, it's reload. If you have all possible reload buffs, you can reload a single shell so fast it's barely observable. If you are reloading multiple shells, you're reloading them individually so you can stop reloading and fire whereas all other shotguns have to finish their entire reload animation if you empty the magazine. Without reload buffs, it's terrible(and a Quad pump action is a terrible crime for existing). Unfortunately reloading doesn't directly increase fire rate, so it's a niche strength. It's otherwise completely outperformed by the gauss.
---
there's a lady next to the wall that by the bridge that leads across to Poseidon Power Plant. She has an out fit on. There is also another lady that is in the Whitesprings guest house as soon as you walk out the door on the vendor wing of the Whitesprings, tun left and go pass the the green bus and the 1st house on the hill has a lady in the bathroom with a dress you can take. PSA.. you need the whole outfit for the mistresss of mysteries to count as an Unstoppables costume. So get the Eye of Ra and her gun!
---
This community hates anything that messes with the "the community is great" narrative. I really wish that as a whole the player base would be more open to acknowledging the bad apples within it, because there are a ton of them at least on the PC servers.
---
My pleasure! Hope you find him!
---
I think I'm just upset because I can't afford these rng God rolls people put up for sale and the queen is endgame content yet feels so unrewarding.
---
hey yo.. people need those 40 caps because.. oh wait.. caps ore otherwise worthless.. 
---
nm
---
Use the cryolator in the meantime, if you have the ammo, it‚Äôs a great way to hinder her mobility.
---
If I had meant power armor I would have said power armor.  I specifically stated the bug that prevented armor from breaking.
---
dupers.
---
No, but I do get a message that I'm overencumbered on almost enery login or respawn despite being about 40lbs under my max weight.
---
call me clueless but i have never thought about doing that before. if i come by a low level players camp i will generally buy something just to give them a leg up with caps, as like a lot of other people in my level range of 150+ i always have a nice stash of caps, usually always over 25K. next time i come by a low level folk i am gonna do that.
---
I avoid vendor camps near cliffs. Either you fall to your death when you spawn in or you spend 15 minutes climbing up a mountain to find 1 Star nocturnal lead pipes and weathered white asylum outfits.
---
watched the stream. looked like a blast!!
---
My VATS pirate build with 10 black powder pistols on quick select would like to have a word with you üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
---
Good advice, I wish I had the Luck points to dip into crit build territory witg my shotgunner character.
---
It's 01:00 BST it resets. Not on GMT as it's summertime.
---
It's 01:00 BST it resets. Not on GMT as it's summertime. Fuck Google. HeHe.
---
Are you on PC? If so I need to be a camp regular of yours :) Where do you go to farm legendaries?
---
For what it's worth, I do enjoy a good workshop scrap. I usually get obliterated, but its exciting. I really like NW as it's a relatively even playing field (once you have all your perks). I know BR isnt everyone's speed, but it was way more enjoyable than adventure mode pvp for someone who wasnt fully kitted in UNY/Cav. I wish there was a way to have an even playing field in adventure mode. Some kind of instanced pvp  content would be awesome.
---
Not only in the air, but it also drives me nuts how they seem to hit me from farther away / in wider angles than my own hits register, apparently...
---
If you‚Äôre talking about trash mobs, I find missile launchers and auto grenade launchers do it best. They just break hella quick
---
You really want explosive with Medic's or Vampire's, basically doubles the effect.
---
With Nintendo having only the Vault Dweller mobile game, and the costume having the Vault 111 jumpsuit, I'm thinking good ol' Todd "Let's just port another game" Howard is bringing Fallout 4 to the Switch.
---
Yeah exactly man! I could care less about the occasional Super Mutant that's stuck in the floor or that sometimes the mountains on the horizon suddenly spike up and look like a big wall around the map. The main issues are the quality-of-life problems such as the game saying you're overencumbered when you die and only letting you respawn at Vault 76, or the very annoying damage rubberbanding when you shoot an enemy and their health goes down and suddenly comes back.   
---
There's lots of bugs but there are some that need to be addressed moreso than others, definitely.
---
It woulda been sick though...there would've been room for cabins below deck!
---
I'm referring to having the quest item in your inventory before talking to him. I found a power pack on the ground before ever going to Foundation for the first time. I thought it was odd that I kept completing his quest instantly every day and didn't know why. 
---
Apparently there is a glitch where you can server hop immediately after completing his quest and you can get him to give you more rep as in the new server, the quest isn't marked as complete. It's supposed to only work within the first 20 minutes of the daily reset which is at 6pm eastern time. I followed a video to try it but it didn't work. The first glitch I mentioned still works. I have actually never done his quest, just shown up and completed it with the item in my inventory. Between him and Davenport, it's not too bad of a grind. I should be completing the settlers today.
---
so far the quests are working 100% playing for 2 months now so yeah stop being dumb
---
And yet one is easier to fix then the other.
---
People would farm them, ride them back to their CAMPs, and lock them up.
---
It's way more than 1:100
---
no kidding... just getting out of bed and boom, you contracted parasites...wtf???
---
Wait?  What?  I just learned something new today.  TYVM.
---
I use the power conduits. The one conduit that is able to pass through walls will pass through the wall of the dome. Rather than having a generator or more in there, you can at least wire with the pass through conduit and move on!
---
it just works
---
I mean, Skyrim is already on it, so might as well.
---
Cheers!
---
When you log off then on you're treated as new so that resets it. Otherwise I don't think it does.
---
yeah I agree , if they fix the combat part only this game will start to get more and more people, then fix the performance, then fix the minor bugs like those you sayed, I mean the game is centered around combat if even that isn't 100% working you need to fix asap.
---
sorta-- its like, the rubberbanding doesnt effect it in vats. the difference is like +80% IME. If i cant kill an enemy-- i switch to vats and itll one shot the mob.
---
then you'll be fine, just vats the mob
---
Thanks for the info üëå
---
It is not the most flattering to view it from the front. It's much more convincing from the side and back :)
---
Automated anti aircraft cannons now that would really come in handy
---
Yeah, I can imagine üëÄ
---
looking forward to the future ZoMg!! they NurFFed maH bUiLd thread..
---
That worked!  Had to explore the whole building but I found them.   Thanks for the assist.
---
I know people like you, you think Bethesda can do no wrong and 76 is the best game since Pong.  The fact remains their priorities seem to be a bit off.  
---
With that said, bugs aside, I do enjoy the game.  The story from the outset is an interesting take.  I don't think it was time to have people come back and in the numbers they have returned, but its an interesting twist.
---
Of course there are still bugs that benefit players, and some that may actually contribute to instability they have yet to fix.  Clipping through walls and the ground comes to mind.
---
Well, the pic is from the side and still wont convince me. I get someone can like it, but this is not any close to a pre-built structure.
---
Even normal mobs that gun fu and adrenaline wrecks. Quite a nice weapon that grenade launcher I like it just ammo is time consuming. My all favourite is always going to be the fatman, love the animation. . . . Worthless against bosses though :(
---
I would not mind at all. Playing Fallout on a portable screen would be nice.
---
You'll have to be way WAY more specific when you use that sentence.
---
No problem! üòäüòäüòä
---
Wait till AT makes a YouTube video on the magical effects of stalkers melee. He‚Äôll find some armor with a prefix to make a stalkers melee one hit wonders.
---
if you stay in an area standing up you prevent mobs from respawning. However if you crouch and show [Hidden] and wait about 20 minutes all the mobs in the area will respawn.
---
Great advice.  I believe, as well, that having the contractor perk on will lessen the materials required for repair although I may be mistaken.  Also I cannot remember if it is labeled contractor or carpenter.
---
I ran into one while ra-ra went into the air duct never came out, i blame myself and the moldy food I gave her...
---
Have you tried the vault raid yet? Lolz.
---
Maybe I should have specified it should come back without any incentives that appeal to the PvE crowd, like boosted XP or unique items. I did intend that, though I didn't say it.
---
I get that Bethesda wants more people in the game mode, but getting people who hate it to play it is not the way. Only leads to the problems you described.
---
What?!?!?  I have played this game like a 1000 hours and did not know you could ride a bike.
---
I know man it‚Äôs so disheartening to get vanguard when your bloodied
---
Thanks, will try that as well to see which setup will fit my camp design more
---
Thanks guys! I hate not finishing the story and having access to additional stuff like the SS armor, bullion, etc so I was worried I had to stop and grind both reps to Ally before choosing a side. 
---
So, as long as I do both side‚Äôs stories until it says, ‚ÄúSiding with X‚Äù, I can realistically get all the rewards? I‚Äôm up to Friendly with both factions I think so I‚Äôm not too too far from Ally at least.
---
I honestly wish more people came to that event too. It's actually kind of fun to just mess around with actual PvP in adventure that has 0 repercussions. Last time I had done MM with others we all used drills on each other.
---
Better thing is to no fight back and your camp wouldn't be destroyed. They have already won when you attack them back and of course they will destroy your camp. I do if someone is stupid enough to hit me back when I start smacking them around in their camp. Plus, usually that type of person won't learn and they will attack again and I'll just destroy their camp again. At lvl 900+ what else is there to do for entertainment? They promised us PVP and by "Todd" Im getting it till theres no more to get! Viva La Resistance!
---
Right!  Itd make factions more like feuding factions and less like a homecoming dance
---
I think his answer provides the most succinct and efficient response to a yes or no question.
---
Yeah I just seen something about people asking for instanced arenas and that sounds cool.. And I really wanted to like NW but there's no variety in maps and wait times are ridiculous just to run around looking for people playing hide and seek.
---
If NW stopped forcing pedestrians to play for to get things in adventure it would be way better imo.. 
---
And yeah I feel that lol I love doing workshops, but I only pvp with my low level melee so I get easily melted by people using metas.. But I still try, and it's still fun. But tbh I hardly even encounter meta kits when on pvp runs normally it's only when I kill someone higher level and they get salty and think they're punishing me lol.
---
I already tried it on the delberts traditional chitlins with no effect :(
---
That‚Äôs what inspired this post! Finally finished the vault raid on my third re-start ... 
---
(The Ra-Ra quest had bugged out on me too, but the vault raid hurt worse).
---
I watched the stream. Love Angry turtle. I can never manage to get on the same server as him though ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Yup, I got stuck on the Ra-Ra quest too. For me, some of the robots wouldn‚Äôt come out so I was just stuck in front of the first door gahhh
---
It's utterly random. Currently doing some data drops to try and get one of my toons off initiate as someone reported on here earlier that SGT was missing from the drops. So far not one in an hour. Did some on a different toon this morning and got 2 Elder in the space of 10 data.
---
Does anyone know where I can find the stream? Does it still exist on YouTube or something?
---
I‚Äôd take that over the propeller jet pack that‚Äôs on the power armor picture that‚Äôs floating around.
---
One of my favorite camps is on the side of the mountain by Camp McClintock. It has a great view of the huge bridge and the forest. Another nice thing about being on the edge of a cliff is you have more build area. If you bud.on the ground, you can only go up so fsr, but if you build high up, you can build stuff down and up. It doesn't increase your budget but if gives you more height to work with.
---
Have you checked your stache?  I logged in yesterday and all of my power armor was in my inventory and all of the chasis were in my stache.  On PS4 also but not a private server
---
Alright, listen up agents. If you're hearing this, I left unfinished business for you, and that dont sit well with me. You've just initiated the recall process for a rogue Assualtron. A tough one. This thing's got a shield so strong hardly anything will dent it. But I have just the solution for that. There are three pylons around the area. Starting one of these up makes you a "conduit". Long story short, that means you're full of juice. Juice that pumps from you right into that robot's shield. You'll need all three active to down it. Good luck, hope you do better than I did.
---
I got it https://youtu.be/KQC3K6QI-2c

Faster Fire Rate
---
If you're going to use stealth, yes.  If you don't have the patience, invest elsewhere.  You have to sneak everywhere and be prepared to disengage when discovered to reacquire *hidden* to make it worthwhile.  Also invest in the cards that multiply damage for sneak attacks.  IME if you can clear a location by one-shotting enemies sneak is great, but if you have to put 2-3 bullets in everything, you end up running away too much and it's a bite in the ass.
---
does anyone know if there is an archive of this live stream?
---
Hi there butthurt.
---
Targeting HUD, for me. It's completely unnecessary, but pretty handy at night or in nuke zones(especially combined with a blue headlamp).
---
Helmet mods just kind of suck, in my opinion. At least Internal Database gives you a modest XP bonus as a side effect, I guess?
---
i'm willing to bet you still use fast travel to other locations though. Nobody is stopping you from not using fast travel.
---
No thanks at least this way you can sometimes get some good deals and people dont care so much about profit (at least most). With AH it would be just " ok so 1 cap less than lowest deal, ok!" Besides fallout is unique with this market and you have purpose to visit other players camps we dont need another copied mechanics from standard boring mmo's.
---
Maybe on double xp.otherwise no
---
That's fine. I can't speak for the OP, I just know I'm quite proud of my ship :)
---
I want to know more about this Nukashine dream walking in "haunted" locations
---
I am a sneak sniper with a Two Shot Lever Action Rifle. For Yao Guai I aim for the head kill them in 3 shots 2 if I have a critical available. For Colonel Gutsy or Assaultron I aim for the Torso kill them in the same time. They don't even have time to recognize that there is an enemy before they are dead. The only time I have issues with them is if something sees me first and prevents me from sneaking.
---
Instigating will work crazy in VATs, as it's a *magic* effect.
---
Hi there buttstain.
---
Well that's awesome, thanks for sharing!
---
I've thought this for awhile. Seems yellow Icons on your map should be free FT.
---
I'd also be happy with Crater and/or Foundation
---
I wore it for a long time and kept it forever so I could put it on a mannequin whenever those come to the game... At some point I must have scrapped it by accident, because I noticed it was gone the other day.  :/
---
I've done it a few times and I think I've had 1 smooth run. The raiders seems far worse than the settlers for bugging out. Either the bit with the intercom or Ra-Ra just doing one behind the last door. I did find if they get locked in the intercom room coz the door bugs out leaving and re-entering the vault seems to fix it.
---
Except there is an Or in the question.
---
So answering yes means that both are correct.  It is both a good idea and silly.
---
Yup
---
You can only craft the upgrades from the one that you get from the quest.
---
Bethesda.
---
I will, with the people I play with. I may try it with randoms just to see how well or horrible it works.
---
PVP sucks in this game. My suggestion is to get used to it and not take your frustrations out on others like a goon. Find another game.
---
I will go check it out tonight.  I did go there and the machine had no crafting options, but I don't think the Tattered Dress was in my inventory.
---
Thank you very much for taking the time to write all of this out. It's very informative for me. I genuinely appreciate it.
---
It looks like playing without VATS, though, really hinders a shotgun build. I so very much hate using VATS, so it's disappointing to see that the rubberband damage bug outside of it is still present. That kills my enthusiasm for shotguns, unfortunately.
---
Yea I think it's contractor. Never used it myself because the mats required are already super cheap, but I think it might also affect cost of materials for basic building as well as repairs.
---
Echoing what others have said, don't ever drop on the ground. Drop bags will sometimes show up empty. Always use a 0/0 suitcase or other world container. I find it's best to pick one spot and place your mules camp or tent  near it and always use that as your drop spot.
---
A couple words of caution from someone who has lost stuff this way. It's really easy to accidentally go into public when loading up your mule after you dropped stuff. This will instantly get rid of your private world and you will lose everything, so be super careful. Also, server errors do happen. I had one time when I lost stuff because the suitcase I used refused to load in. The only truly safe way to transfer items is with another player. Even if you have another friend with first who can stay on your private world to make sure it stays open it is better than doing it yourself. But most of the time dropping it into a world container in a private world and loading it up immediately works.
---
PC :/
---
It's just about the same mission for both only real difference is buying stuff from Beckett bar or if you did the luck option having A.t.h.e.n.a to buy from.
---
Sure. Its a cool build. Nice job.
---
Right, and I was just clarying that the mats needed are low, to ensure that people reading your first reply don't think 'all the materials' means everything needed to build the place. :P
---
[I do it like this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6b455be&amp;d=sg2p00pg2ph2pi2e82e00c72cu0i11ic2a72ar0an0a02a31ao0lb0lv0lt2lr2l71s00sb0sv0po0lu0lk2&amp;m=5c8&amp;am=-16293b-13-1029-132333&amp;wp=w6w6w6w5&amp;wm=172939-1a2035-172038-1d27)
---
Sofia and Beckett have their own actual story line, after finishing it they'll give the same dailies as the other three but with different quest names. Their weapon case rewards share the same loot pool as the purveyor so you can get the rarer items from them as well, provided you know the plan. Effectively they're all the same, it just comes down to a matter of personal preference/ whichever one you find least annoying when you listen to the same voice lines or guitar strumming on an endless loop.
---
I'm going to try it, especially joining a team for the perks, but then do my own thing. Or start a public team, but then make sure to tell them that you're looking to solo with benefits. Maybe they'll leave, or maybe you'll find like minded players that still want to benefit from it, yet play solo.
---
If its a cluster, then I'll just abandon it and use it when I need to refill my treasury notes by farming events in a group or something.
---
&gt;the griefing community is sulking because the upcoming patch 20 is figuratively taking one of their toys
---
not sure that's it honestly...   
---
once you're through with all the story content, did all the challenges, did all the events a hundred times, ...collected enough bullion to get your favorite weapon/armor etc... 
---
there's just so much you can do before it gets boring. and killing the queen for the 1337th time is not really gonna help either... 
---
i've seen a camp that blew up right when i was going to check the persons vendor and - i am going to be honest here - it looked kinda cool xD 
---
don't get me wrong - i know what a pain it is to rebuild your camp - i had mine nuked a couple of times for whatever reason... but yeah. i honestly think most of those people are just utterly bored at this point and are looking for ways to entertain.
---
guess just don't be afk too long when you have your camp visible on the map?  
---
¬Ø\\\_ ( „ÉÑ ) \_/¬Ø
---
It used to be like it but idk it's nice to have something to spend caps on
---
wut diz
---
Pretty sure their loot pool is the same as the purveyors. I‚Äôm not 100% but that‚Äôs my guess. Pretty sure I‚Äôve seen people post fixers and bear arms as ally rewards.
---
Lmao, don‚Äôt even Get this sub started, we‚Äôve been complaining about it since the game came out. (Yes, it‚Äôs been around that long)
---
sometimes it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission
---
Well see now that‚Äôs a good point...but the ‚Äúor‚Äù as I see it is asking you to answer one question or the other, but not both.  Ergo a single answer or single word answer is intended to answer the first question unless further clarification denotes it as an answer for the second question.  That is how I see it, but I will admit that is not a grammatical rule of which I am aware.  I don‚Äôt think grammatically it‚Äôs intended we ask a question(s) this way, but it is common enough that we have to evolve some sort of structure in which to answer them if that makes sense.  Thanks for not taking my reply as a criticism as much as a point of discussion.
---
Ahhh, that answers it perfectly. Honestly I was getting sick of the wanderer but I thought she was meant to be special or something
---
No, I agree,
---
Sounds like I need to swing by your camp with some explosive bait in pacifist mode.
---
That's a relief, I was getting bored of the wanderer
---
They're all the same. Only Sofia and Beckett have their own questlines. The other three are Raider Punk, Settler Forager, and Wanderer. They're cool but don't have anything different in comparison.
---
Daguerre and Beckett have good questlines with different rewards (not ongoing), they have one perk which is lovers embrace (+5% xp replacing well rested). The others tend to improve faction rep with their factions. After doing Daguerre and Beckett I went with raise punk to Improve rep.
---
i think it was already announced to be happening
---
I'd expect it around July 4th
---
Do you want hamburgers or hot dogs for dinner?
---
Yes =)
---
I've tried it in whitesprings, no luck there either
---
So just personal preference then? That's good to know
---
Ok cool thanks
---
Yup, pretty much :)
---
She's considered rarer than the others as she's the only one with no guaranteed spawn point, so you have to either get lucky or hunt for her. Punk and Forager wander like she does, but they can always be found in the lower area of Crater and Foundation respectively. I like wanderer best because of her personality, but I'm getting pretty sick of the two guitar riffs she relentlessly plays.
---
I had the thought that fast travel between train stations should be free.
---
Oooh I didn't know about the lovers embrace perk. That'll be really useful as I'm trying to shift my build at level 360
---
go to the lucky hole mine and wear your excavatorfor all the lead you will ever need will be in there, and then head to Hornwright Estate and walk along the road from Hornwright Estates down to Garahan Estates, then keep following the road to the abandoned mine shaft 2. Stop by Vault 63, and check the hillsides. There is tons of Steel, copper, aluminum, uranium, and so much other ore. You'll need a good source of acid to convert all that ore and a 1st box will help too! Plus, both locations have a short cool down timer, so you can farm there 4-6 times a day with server hoping. You've been warned, dont get to greedy or prepare to slow walk home!
---
Certain places that you ‚Äúhave to‚Äù visit should be made free at some point. Foundation and Crater should be free at max reputation and Vault 79 after the main quest. Any upcoming faction bases (BOS) should work the same way. Also, the purveyor should have always been free
---
I see your Bumper Sword and raise you a Vertabird Blade from Edge of Tomorrow.
---
I've been trying also but mine is bugged I went from knight to knights captain completely missing knights Sargent. So not sure what to do I've got 2 knights captain plans now so might have to start and new toon and try again or buy the missing plan
---
You are right that it is an RP status but style as well.
---
The helmet and mask look good together. While the gas mask alone looked bad on my character.
---
whats your playstyle? Do you get more instances of stronger enemies hitting you?
---
The incessant humming has gotten to me now haha. Gramps seems the quietest
---
Why does fast travel cost caps? You can run events all day and those caps are fine but travel cost something? It isn‚Äôt a meaningful cap sink and as such the cost should be removed.
---
Instigating explosive. Ohk for all non SBQ
---
Take a berry mentats before you do this and you can easily make a lv 3 terminal have like five options. I won't do a silo without them now. I hate the hacking minigame. Take a brain bombs too and you won't even have to guess, but they're a little bit of a pain to farm for the sugar bombs.
---
Did you place a generator so they move? I love doing that
---
So still totally worth doing.
---
I don't think it's nice to use autism, something that real people live and deal with every day, as a way to describe people you dont like in a video game.
---
Just my humble opinion.  What do you think about using a different word next time?
---
Even without being romantically involved with Beckett or Sofia, you can still get "kindred spirit" by sleeping in a bed with any ally at your camp. It's the same as lover's embrace or well rested.
---
I tried that a few times but the only thing that worked for the Ra-Ra quest was using a private server. I might get hate for being a Fallout 1st subscriber, but it saved me some heartache that night once I finally attempted the quest in a private server. But it bothers me. I‚Äôm sure plenty of people have finished WL no problem without a private server, but the fact that I need something I‚Äôm paying for to finally get a smooth run of a quest is pretty frustrating.
---
You're welcome to try and find my camp! I bet my camp will still kill you before you can get close enough to do any damage with the explosive bait. Worse you may break my Bass guitar as thats the only thing partially visible. Explosive bait can destroy underground camps...Ha Ha Ha.. Im also safe from Nuking....lol
---
Are they worth anything to sell?
---
I'm pretty sure you can go back to the manufacturing machine when you originally got the garb and have another made I could be wrong though I'll check when I'm able too
---
It‚Äôs what happened when GAMERS finally realized they couldn‚Äôt use gay slurs they decided to change over to using autism as such. It‚Äôs pathetic really.
---
I‚Äôm so glad someone said this
---
Only if you can ride a tiny bike/tricycle while in power armour, for comedy purposes.
---
My game crashed in a similar situation, I got like 17 kills that round what makes it even more painfull
---
Gramps is quieter for sure. He also has some funny lines. "Back in my day, we didn't mutate willy-nilly."
---
Oooooh, that's why I'm getting kindred spirit.  Tyanks for the info!
---
PS4.  Sorry :(.  I do sell cheap, about 1/2 of market, because it‚Äôs a lot easier than going to a sub, finding a buyer, setting up a trade and then getting it done.  I just put in a machine and keep on trucking.  When I stumble on a unicorn, ex: BE handmade, I‚Äôll trade it for a weapon I want (bloody was boring to me.  The game is easy enough without one shotting everything). Event hoping is my current regular method.  Farming treasury notes usually nets me several leggos a day plus the daily companion quest, for me anyway, seems to be a leg weapon about 60-70% of the time.  There‚Äôs always the Capitol building, west tek.. you know the places.  I scrip everything useless and do a 3* pull and some days that gets you a couple more.  It‚Äôs all luck and time playing but even with an hour a day if you do your companion quest and a few events you‚Äôre likely to get at least 1-2 a day.
---
Targeting helmet tracks invisible assaultrons as well.  And nice for nuke zone crowd control. All in all it‚Äôs my favorite mod
---
Targeting HUD, generally speaking. It's handy for spotting things in dense environments and otherwise just sneakier little buggers that might be around.
---
You get that bonus for sleeping in camp when an ally is present.
---
Well, I see your point but neither one of those is a full question, and technically ‚Äúyes‚Äù would mean that you would like hamburgers or hot dogs for dinner, (as opposed to something else).  There is no way for me to win this discussion as grammatically I just don‚Äôt think the rules exist to answer that kind of question.  Because even though technically yes would intimate either was fine, you and I both know whoever is asking that is wanting know whether the person wants a hamburger or instead of a ham we would prefer a hot dog.  I am so glad I don‚Äôt have to take a high school grammar test ever again! Lol.  But good points.  I am not even sure if it should matter whether there is a complete question or not or whether the ‚Äúor‚Äù is all part of the same proposed inquiry.
---
Does this work with all effects? For example my bloodies handmade sits around 250dmg. Is tank killer still worth the three perks or is it better to dump them into something else
---
I had an idea where maybe they could have an area of the map that is similar to the dark zones in the division, hella good rewards, but the enemies are extremely tough, and it‚Äôs a free fire zone for pvp.
---
How do you get that costume it is so cool I have ever costume except that one
---
Hahaha, thanks, that made my day! :)
---
I do want to use it, mostly hoping that the roleplay option gets some good use out of it. 
---
I however do not want to team up with the likes of you, OP. If you already don‚Äôt want to be with autistic people, god forbid you find out that you‚Äôre teamed up with me while I‚Äôm just trying to be a mercenary and find out that I‚Äôm a furfag too.
---
Well-rested - Slept alone
---
Kindred Spirit - Slept with ally nearby
---
Lover's Embrace - Slept with romanced ally nearby
---
Omg, i thought people like you only existed in SouthPark.
---
I'm sorry PC Principal, i just got a call from the autism community and they would like to thank you for your brave actions. 
---
The sheen from your armour is almost blinding Sir White Knight. Imagine, if it wasn't for people like you scum like me would use whatever words they wanted.
---
Thats why the Fallout Community is the BEST community! üëç All stand as one and NEVER a free for fall üéâ
---
" nobody complains about anything. "
---
we must be in different places!
---
But yeah it's mostly quite nice.
---
730?! So much room for activities!
---
I‚Äôm rarely under 798. I‚Äôm constantly full of decent or better weapons/armor in my vendor that I pull from daily to scrip. But seems I collect more than I can sell/scrip and it keeps me at my limit
---
Of course
---
So I see you‚Äôre one of those pussy griefers that attacks people for fun but hides your own shit.
---
This is amazing
---
Nobody is forced to play this game. If someone is that bored there's an infinite amount of better things to do with their time so I really can't see that as a valid excuse. I think the game could use some pvp elements to it, maybe like battlegrounds or an arena, but there's a big difference to consenting pvp and being invited to a group only to have dick 1 shoot dick 2 so they can circumnavigate the games pacifist system. 
---
 Shit blowing up does always look cool, mo no argument there.
---
I 100% agree.  Which is why I personally don't like "Or" questions.  Just ask your question and if someone thinks its silly they will tell you =)
---
The wanderer constantly plays music gets annoying after a while
---
‚ÄúNever give up. Just keep doin‚Äô it. You‚Äôll make it through.‚Äù
---
Can we have an official drinking game where we take a shot every time somebody breaks Rule 9 on this sub?
---
It‚Äôs definitely a quest reward from one of the early responders quests. If I remember correctly you get it sometime around the part of the main quest when you first visit Morgantown, so pretty early on. I don‚Äôt know whether or not it drops from back on the beat.
---
For someone who‚Äôs User is ‚ÄúStayPositive‚Äù you sure are negative.
---
Lol I like the single black sheep got included.
---
What happens on meat week?
---
Imagine being so low in life that you have to try and degrade complete strangers on the internet to make yourself look cool.
---
Not entirely sure. I know it has something to do with Grahm
---
"Licorice tastes better....after the nukes."
---
Yes it is so annoying
---
I can make you a new one
---
Huh? I didn't know explosive bait sparked pvp cause none of the other grenades spark pvp besides that I'm guessing explosive bait damages everything because it's not listed as a player projectile ...
---
First off it is my presumptuous of you to assume that folks read the rules.  Also do you want alcohol poisoning?  Cause that is how you get that.
---
You can feel my dissapointment
---
This is not a new thing! This has been around forever! Just with BS making it harder to PVP in a game that was promoted for its PVP, PVP'ers are using any tricks to fight back and make a statement to BS that the PVP needs to stay. But basically you now go to using the cheesy things as they are nerfing the one true aspect that this game offered from playing Fallout 4 and that was to interact and do harm to our other wastelanders if we so wanted. It's just like real life and when there is no law, chaos and anarchy reign. I can imagine a class action against BS if they totally remove PVP as I know I bought the game to lore, play, and to kill other players. Life is dangerous and leaving PVP in the game helps keep the game real in a sense.
---
They need to switch assassins back to +Damage vs humans again since PvP in adventure is pretty much dead
---
Make as many large water purifiers at your camp and sell the watersm every so often. Do uranium fever loot literally everything dont scrap, then sell literally all of it to the whitespring bendor just a few seconds walk away
---
I call it Full Health Sneaky Vats-Crit.. not many regular mobs hit me..
---
ASSaultrons and high level floaters are the only mobs I think twice about anymore
---
I would rather not but.. I dont sweat breaking stealth.. Furious weapons targeting weak points with crits cleans up in those situations nicely.. YMMV
---
I‚Äôve never read the rules for this sub, and yet all it took was a few days of being here to figure out not to name people in a negative way here.
---
Yeah, Beckett has the bar, but it barely has anything useful and Athena is no different than the wandering traders that show up in your camp from time to time, so not really worth it. She used to have a different cap pool, but they 'fixed' that. I personally find the raider punk to be the least annoying, though his alien conspiracy theories and vocal exercises also get old.
---
It's a bit sad that this is still the case despite delays and pts. It's not like it's something small and unnoticeable that could easily slip the net. I was lucky and didn't encounter any issues the first time until the raid but that made it feel so anticlimactic.
---
Not really. Can‚Äôt hurt to try tho.
---
Kill the imposter
---
I could make one too, if had I had the original order piece.
---
I just wish the ammo was 1:1 not 7:3
---
Come back when the servers are down üòÇ
---
I tried the other day, but I don't remember if i had a tattered dress in my inventory
---
Do you drop it when going deploying it or do you press x in your inv when your deploying it
---
you can convert 20 tickets every day. so max a day is 200 gold bullion. so if you have zero atm. 28 days will get you the base armor no mods. trading in just max event ticket. now if you chose the stingy quest ender. you can add 1000 gold bars. or 500 if you chose the PC ending. you can reduce this even farther by trading in 6000 caps a week to simly inside the wayward for 300 gold bars. that is if he will trade you mine is always glitched and he will only do it once a month for me.
---
This game needs a ton of "focus." There's too much splitting of mechanics. They want you to single player... but also group. They want you to fast travel... but also explore. They want you to play all day... but they lockout everything behind timers. Same shit show with pvp and pve.
---
I already killed the imposter sheep Aqua this and have the outfit but is it a plan you get after completeing the event
---
I have a mule just for rare, uncommon and one off outfits. At the time of the toon‚Äôs creation I just thought it‚Äôd be cool to have a collection started. Then I transferred all my outfits from both of my main characters to this mule. Then I realized how much of my stash box weight was just hats, helmets and outfits. Especially after fasnacht. All together the mule has about 70 ish pounds of masks, clothes and hats and other collectibles (bobbles and mags).
---
You should be able to fast travel to train stations from other train stations, sort of like how the fast travel works in ESO.
---
(I know there's no trains running).
---
Be aware it doesn't count as well rested for the daily challenges. Because Bethesda.
---
The loot and rewards in this game are awful, and the only end game activity is waiting for some giant bat to land, i got bored and im taking a break of this game. This would help a lot.
---
No I mean I have the original still, I can craft a new Garb of Mysteries and give it to you if you want it.
---
So. Meat Week.
---
You gather at an area near Vault 76. It's an hourly, like Fasnacht. There are cooking spits set up, a stage with instruments, a cooler for meats that need to be gathered at the event. There's also "Primal cuts". Think that pops up every 15 minutes. Like mini events where you get prime cuts of meat, from prime animals. Those cuts can be deposited at the event for small amounts of scrip. 
---
You can shop with Graham before and after the event. It's a lot of fun and had some cool drops. Some of note were the bloody chefs outfit and the tenderizer and accompanied mods, salted, peppered and I forgot the last. Thing weighs 20lbs though and is huge.
---
Didn't they used to be?
---
The current state is "we have passed this information on to the team for investigation". The state a year from now will still be "we have passed this information on to the team for investigation"
---
Damn, im seeing all kinds of ship builds lately, im wondering if we should all get together on a server and check each other's builds and share shipwright tips
---
Ah, ok thanks!
---
Thanks! I had a feeling just wanted to make sure.
---
Cool thanks man. Cant wait!
---
Just play the story. If all you‚Äôve done is most of the Wastelanders stuff; then you still have most of the Scorched quests to do. Don‚Äôt worry about unique items; you‚Äôre almost guaranteed to find better stuff just from playing.
---
My thoughts exactly hahaha, but it's a shame really though. I feel like if they had to keep us updated with the progress they're making in actually fixing the bugs they'd be more inclined to actually try to fix them. Or, so I'd hope...
---
I just want a pet to walk around with
---
Most of those guides still hold true. 
---
My 2 caps: do all of the public events. Especially line in the sand and radiation rumble. Get a Tesla rifle and tag EVERYTHING. Inspirational in charisma, canned meat stew, well rested. Most of it is just put in some time.
---
Right!  Most subs have that rule.
---
Beckett dropped me a one star fixer once, everything all allies drop is just scrip so far, no ‚Äòquality‚Äô or ‚Äòbest‚Äô to speak of.
---
Yeah the scorched quests I'm finding dull compared to playing the wastelanders stuff üòÇ I dont know if that's just me though. I'll try to focus a bit more on the scorched stuff now though!
---
Why does this sound like a porn title
---
*Me as a shotgun VATs  build, just ya know, waiting for the queen to don her with me with landing*
---
Interesting, seems extremely useful. It seems mobs have different enemies despite being in the same at times, could this be used to find rare enemies or is it the same mob instance every reset?
---
Explosive bait is crafted, it uses radstag meat and frag mines.
---
I actually just got an alt to 50 without double xp event. Get three perk points in charisma and get inspirational (5% xp per card, 3cards) when in a team.
---
Then level up intelligence first to desired level for class. 
---
Now do wastelanders to unlock bullion. When events pop up like rad rumble, go to them and tag enemies. Easy level 50. My first character I didn‚Äôt use inspirational and it took a lot longer.
---
You bet. It really is a lot of fun. You play music, turn the meat spits and gather meat from the area to fill the event bar. Can't let the meats burn, by continuing to turn the spits etc...
---
A lot of people usually show, it's rare to fail.
---
IIRC it only affects the duration of the buff.
---
The more damage you do the less Tank killer does.
---
I used it to build a "Meat cannon" but wouldn't say it has a "practical use":  
---

---
I have no frustrations Im trying to remove, I bought the game solely for its PVP aspects and I like Fallout. This was the game I wanted and the people who felt PVP was so unfair just ruined this game and made them make changes and waste manhours that could have improved real quality of life items and fixed other issues. There was no need to nerf PVP, to remove survival , and to listen to all the cry babies who lost their junk. 1st, stash your stuff regularly and you only loose 5-10 min of work. 2nd, everyday when you leave your IRL house you could face harm from people, what changed in the future where resources are less and there is no government and law enforcement? How safe do you think it would be then? ZACK shows us that VD will kill each other to get more rewards, so whats different and not lore friendly? I mean every other faction out there wants you dead, so why would your other fellow wastelanders want you dead too so they can have your spoils? If you want to play Fallout 76, expect people to want to grief you, that is even cannon role play!
---
Most damage sure but I think OP's point is that by taking out the inhibitor you can make the robots fight each other.
---
Best answer IMO.
---
Good to hear that most of the old guides havent changed thanks!
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the duration is different. I only got an hour well rested but 3 hour lovers embrace.
---
Genuinely much obliged. Also, you‚Äôre still a douche.
---
Am I a Fallout Dad if my children don't really play Fallout. I try to get them into it, but they can't be destracted from Apex, Fortnite, or Minecraft long enough to learn the game. At least my oldest is playing Dead by Daylight which at least requires a little more patience.
---
I mean if you don‚Äôt want to do them, I guess you can have fun just farming the Ash Heap and Mire for a while. I mean, you literally have to do it, or at least the Enclave portion, to even launch nukes.
---
Thanks
---
The real question is if you can still shoot the fusion cores out of occupied power armor like you could in FO4.
---
Scrip, boulion, 1400caps, then pvp.
---
Thats why there is NW....
---
Yup, I had her for awhile and it did get to me.
---
How much does intelligence actually effect xp gain? I didnt even know double xp events were a thing in this game.
---
If I do wastelanders up to bullion before 50 am I going to miss out on any good weapons or armour?
---
Awesome I love community events.  We need more. Like a once a month thing
---
Does he fart? I could've sworn I heard him fart once.
---
You can't get all three of those effects on the same weapon. But! Limb Damage will give you crazy damage if used in VATs. It's a *magic* effect that negates the rubber-banding.
---
Unfortunately FO76 doesn't have the creation kit on the launcher. I'm not sure if doing it from FO4 would work but I suppose I could give it a go.
---
Damage bug is still rampant, fucking how?
---
I'll certainly do them, although they arent as exciting as wastelanders I need to launch those nukes at some point.
---
Modders have all their accountability at risk because if they break a game, nobody will ever seek to use another mod of theirs again. Dev teams can hide behind the studio name and continue to work another day. 
---
Modders have nothing but time? The dev team is literally paid to work on these things. The issue isn't time, it's not even money, it's whatever direction the 76 team lead is deciding to take the team in. As you can see, atomic shop gets patched in a few days, and game breaking bugs take a month.
---
I'm not sure, i havent pulled his finger enough
---
Takes you 1 second to use a different word and no ones feathers get ruffled.
---
It is a creative way to communicate.  We need a way to Trade, or tell folks here are items we will sell only in trade (but a way to do that via the trade function).  We need a way to leave messages maybe on what else you would sell, but no room in vendors.  A way to say, I am looking for X, message me if you are willing to sell or trade.  All of that is outside the system at the moment.
---
I've had Lover's Embrace not count as Well Rested for the daily level up challenge.   Has anyone else noticed that?
---
If you mean the rubberbanding one where you shoot an enemy and their health completely goes and they should die, then suddenly their health bar refills instantly to 100%, I get this bug at least 5 or 6 times a day and it's a pain in the ass. Been around a long long time, we've been told it's 'being investigated' and 'a fix is being worked on', but no other updates.
---
Pain in the aaasssssss.
---
You can probably go without if you have a full set. The difference in regen time would be only a couple seconds. Test it out perhaps.
---
I've just dropped loot bags and it hasn't failed me yet. I tested with chems and non legendaries first quite a few times to test. Then I used scrip it wouldnt matter if lost. When I was comfortable enough, I started transferring my good legendaries. I haven't lost a bag or legendary yet, BUT there is no guarantee as others have mentioned. 
---
Server-side issues, client-side issues can always get in the way, so it's possible to lose items. I am just lucky enough to had it not fail yet. Fingers crossed. It really is easier than relying on a friend to be on to help. But just be aware it can fail.
---
that's good to know, full health gives you peace of mind. Bloodied builds breaking stealth chased by a pack of high-speed bloated ones, now I sweat a lot
---
You can get the red fire fighter helmet from whitespring it's exactly the same as the fire breather one just cleaner
---
Each point of intelligence gives 2.5~% extra experience.
---
I was a melee build at one point and I did what it sounds like you do, I charged in when she was on the ground to swing like mad. This was level 50 to 75 I think. One diff could be weapon choice. I used a bloodied ski sword that ignored 50% of armor. I used to collect loot with that combo.
---
It's a shame you can't have Sophia there at the same time so she sounds like a passive aggressive bitch about it.
---
You can place chimes that you have as long you dont scrap.
---
Yeah that's what I was going to do when I'm off work. Didn't know if anyone had already tried it. Hope it works cause those 3 perk pts would be clutch
---
Your build looks really solid. If you're not getting hit at all you can probably drop born survivor and add a point to adrenaline or add a point of grim reapers sprint to get more ap back after kills. Also, if you get a chemist backpack you can drop traveling pharmacy and add bandolier in its place to free up some more carry weight.
---
Actiongirl3 + AP refresh armor, my AP bar goes from 0 to full in about 6 seconds.
---
Subjectively, also seems to last slightly longer before it runs to zero.
---
I am a fallout Dad, I got my two boys into fallout (New Vegas) and they have been hooked ever since.
---
I love being online with them in the wasteland!
---
Sorry late reply, but yes, UNY damage wise only affects melee through the STR boost, except you get more hits+crits through VATS due to AGI boost with UNY armor. Other than that you survive way longer with Nerd Rage/Emergency Protocols in a Bloodied build, unless you're sneaking far away from the heat
---
It‚Äôs like 3-4% per point of intelligence. It‚Äôs a hidden stat for absolutely no reason. YouTube videos did the math on it. 
---
Tbh the wastelander special stuff is no big deal. They are worth a fraction of some of the big ticket items in other places in the game. You can actually pick up a set of the story weapons for like 5000 caps if you really wanted to. The final word is probably the best gun of the group.
---
Some effects are bugged and negate the rubber banding, causing the weapon to deal massive damage in VATs. These effects also work with high rate of fire weapons.

This is perfect, thanks!
---
Me too
---
Ooh yeah, maybe like you could put a weapon for sale in a vendor but it‚Äôs locked so they can‚Äôt buy it and there‚Äôs no set price. Like a message is pinned to it saying what you want for it or you‚Äôre willing to trade for something specific. Because some weapons have rolls that are worth way more than the cap limit. Legacy weapons for example
---
He'll eventually reset for you and you'll have to do the quests again.
---
Were did I say they could do no wrong? Why is it the default reaction to people not agreeing with someone is right to the "Dur your just a bethesda fan boy who thinks they can do no wrong"
---
It is honestly kind of pathetic that rather then address what I say you try to deflect away from it.  Please show in detail how fixing the armor bug is the same level of difficulty as fixing item spawn with goo piles.  Particularly when they have had a continual issue with item spawn in corpses for a good portion of the over all game's life span.
---
I had to do Ra-ra in my second character 3 times.  First time I killed the last boss, and went to loot and it crashed my system.  Second time she got stuck in the vent as I went out of sequence and then had to retrace but she wouldn‚Äôt come out.  Glitching but a fun part of the quest
---
Timezones/platforms would probably throw a wrench into those plans, but generally yes üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
---
Every gym has plenty of lead. 
---
Whitesprings motel, gym room, but looted dry very often.
---
Vault tec university, gym room.
---
Fire station, gym room. 
---
I'm a looter and reseller, i find plenty from just roaming around. Every pencil, wooden block has some, rat poison gives even 5 lead.
---
June 30th, it was confirmed by a developer.
---
I mean, we're no filthy casuals here (maybe some of us, but not all), but yeah, unless something biggish happens (Servers down, Vendors glitched, No ITV on a Thursday, etc), we're usually pretty calm.
---
Did you use armor or backpack that reduces item weight?
---
Nah. It‚Äôs RNG and you only need one to trigger it when you craft. Congrats on the great rolls so far!
---
I have no idea what a 'stable' price would be. I've seen them all over the place going for 2000 caps to 25000 caps. Best you can really do is just keep hunting until you find something you consider reasonable or better.
---
Sunnytop ski lodge i think its called go there and do the tadpole race quest over an over....
---
They have dimishing returns. It's best to use one each.
---
Complete the quest: Into the fire. Then you get a full set.
---
I just wanted to pop in and express my appreciation for them including this.  So many games put the same sort of progression on a relationship as Stranger --&gt; Friend --&gt; Lover.  More games should put friend and lover on the same level.  Not every relationship needs to eventually become romantic.
---
Even a lock on feature would be pretty cool
---
Yeah, let's call it Mj√∂lnir.
---
He hasn't yet since the launch of Wastelanders. I should be Ally today if not tomorrow.
---
Hey man, if you need help with resources I could help you out to farm and rebuild.
---
Really ?
---
Youre a dad, you play fallout, youre a fallout dad.
---
It also doesn't require effort or build knowledge. If you have the slightest amount of build knowledge - the PvE in this game is simple AF.
---
Thank you guys. I have now learned how to properly answer questions.
---
Thats fantastic. Must be a blast playing with them.
---
I have perks to ignore armor. Also I use cultist weapons exclusively, so is that why possibly? I'm around level 58 i wanna say, not at home rn so I cant say for sure
---
Pretty sure angry turtle has a video on the subject. It's one of his earlier ones you you may have to dig a bit.
---
A while back I got a quad explosive harpoon guy.  Added Fletchettes mod to it and it does crazy damage. 
---
Also got a Bloodied Explosive Minigun with 90% reduced weight. 
---
Last night I got a Junkies Explosive LMG w/15% reload speed.
---
950 hours in. Never heard of it
---
Join a team then take it in turns to re login after you have wiped them all out.
---
Yeah someone else just commented that link! Gonna give it a watch when I have the chance
---
I think you are referencing the solar scout armor which regens your and your team mates health when your health is over 60%, if that's the case then it's an end game set that you can only get after finishing the wastelanders quest line.
---
what are legendary modules? i brought one from the rusty puck but cant figure out its use
---
You would lose the original then though?
---
thanks! i opted for the grocer's mod as i carry a lot of food. The adrenaline was what i was getting doubts about, some people say 1 or 2 points in it is enough but i'm curious if it makes a great difference if i level it up some more
---
also if Gun Fu is even worth it, the automatic switching of targets in VATS is too slow for me so i just manually switch targets, does Gun Fu count manual switching targets?
---
Depends on your goal.  Excavator may be best if you tend to run overencumbered. (+100 carry out of the box, +200 carry if you mod with calibrated shocks) and doubles the ore when you mine a vein.
---
i was playing my level 55 unarmed character and coukd hit her fine with a pieer fist, didnt get any rewards tho and im not sure why
---
Yes I  understand that, but on PC with a public hack it doesn't require that.  They can push a button and spawn it in the world.
---
Yeah, what are considered rare plans cause i dont want to throw away a rare plans and you also commented on my rant about power armor and i found loose calibrated shocks for excavator and its quite high now and good point about the vanguard armor.
---
Thank you, your beautiful.
---
It puts the pointy edge to the soft bits and repeats the process extensively. 
---
Joking aside, leveling to 50 is easy. It gets harder later on. I suggest you simply enjoy the game do the quests you encounter and do events that pop up.
---
Some enemies attack using a sort of VATS. This was set up before marsupial jumping was a thing.
---
A good part to mention is the fact the effects stacks as more member get a whole set
---
I‚Äôve been rolling for the full set before getting any mods at all (other than the jetpack). I‚Äôve had all unyielding for a while, but honestly been using two pieces of other armor with fall damage reduced perks since that in itself is completely OP with the jetpack. Now that I‚Äôve got a bloodied gauss, I may re-roll my 1* SS armor pieces to get another fall damage one, I‚Äôd be satisfied at that point.
---
All RNG. Get your 150 scrip a day, do youre dailys for each faction and davenport for like 30 scrip. Than do enough regular dailys like the pumpkin house, camden park, or the watoga sqauters untill you hit 200 scrip. That gives you 4 shots each day at rolling SS peices. Its your best bet.
---
Me personally, I would take gun fu if I‚Äôm a rifle build and the next target is ready to go within vats once I‚Äôm ready to fire the next shot. With a commando build, I feel like I swap vats quicker manually and benefit more from more points in adrenaline. I would also personally not use the born survivor and go with 3 more  points to bring adrenaline to the full 5, but I don‚Äôt know how often you benefit from the auto stim. So for agility, I‚Äôd say go with 4-5* on adrenaline depending on how much you like the auto stim. 
---
My personal experience is that autostimming works best for me in my melee build when I‚Äôm constantly running to the next enemy and I‚Äôm not paying attention to my health or when I‚Äôm bashing the queen and some adds gang up on me from the back. For my stealth build, I tend to not take much damage in combat and I also tend to run and hide when I‚Äôm in danger unless I can take them out quick. Granted it‚Äôs a full health build, so I tend to have a bit more health buffer before I realize I need to hightail it.
---
Just my experience, you might find that it benefits your play style more.
---
For luck, I‚Äôd swap out the extra crit damage and change it to grim reaper sprint. I don‚Äôt think the extra crit damage is that impactful with my full health build and I would imagine you‚Äôre doing plenty of damage with a low health build. The ap refill, especially if you have a high amount to begin with and the low ap cost mods for your weapon (assumption on my part), would mean line of sight would be your only limiting factor and you‚Äôll stay in vats all day. Plus you can‚Äôt build your crit meter if your waiting for your ap to refill.
---
That‚Äôs just my two cents and this is more personal preference at this point. Your build is pretty good to begin with and I wouldn‚Äôt change too much.
---
For me Ra ra dropped the grenade... and then nothing happened. Maybe she choked on the dust in the vent. Maybe she found her true calling with mothman. Idk
---
The amount of people camp hopping and visiting vendors would drop dramatically if that was the case. I would only be ok with this if we had a marketplace or auction house.
---
Didnt know this. How do you click with a controller do you mean press 'a' anywhere between the brackets?
---
my go too is my anti armor explosive.
---
i have settler wanderer cause she is wholesome.
---
Nothing is more OP than mirelurk kings.  Pound for pound the toughest SOBs in the game due to poison damage.
---
Why not? Only the worthy can pick it up, in this case PA users. ;)
---
Wow ghouls are cannon fodder my guy
---
Pc, eastern here. 
---
I still think it would be fun to have a fleet of ships all on one server lol. I'll have to make a post on the settlemts board later.
---
Holy crap, that's good info. I lost my outfit due to a bug when the game first launched. I got it on the first try.
---
Honestly these should have been craft-able costume unlocks. There's an absurd amount of "one-time/miss-able" only content that really should be re-obtainable.
---
Which is why you'd have to remove the item entirely, and replace it with a non-explosive variant (as I described in my last comment).
---
Only way to stop them is to take it away entirely, at least until it can be fixed. Maybe make it unequippable for the time being (and add a workaround to Rose's quest, like using a regular Frag Mine on an enemy).
---
What is this trick?
---
I often wonder if this was just an excuse Bethesda used to take away another set of servers to keep development and server hosting/maintenance costs down. I seriously doubt the PVE community had that much of an influence. We gave the PVP gang exactly what they wanted, easy deaths while we were trying to do those challenges.
---
Exactly, but trading outside has its issues as well.
---
Yeah the combat inhibitor is usually a x2.0 damage multiplier.
---
Enemies don't have enough health to survive bring crippled there unless you are using a L1 pipegun.
---
Now that I didn't realize mate, thanks for the heads up, I've been considering rolling a set when I've finished modding all my secret service armor.
---
magical shottys?
---
I'm using her also!
---
They are used the craft the items you get via gold bullion.
---
Seceret service armor
---
Solar armor
---
Thorn armor
---
Strangler heart armor
---
Gauss pistol
---
Gauss shotgun
---
Gauss minigun
---
Plasma caster
---
Gauntlet 
---
Cattleprod
---
Its a pretty rare drop. My friend turned in around 180 TD and finally got the BOS Knight armor paint. I got it on my 6th try. So its all up to rng, my guy. You gotta keep trying
---
No problem mate, you're welcome.
---
Solar armor is the item set, but you need a full set (at this point it takes bullion to buy plans and scrip to craft). While combined with a group of is very strong, and it heals while in combat, the benefit versus other armor that is more readily available is debatable. This is truly end game grind armor and only works for non-Bloodied builds.
---
People trade these for other rare things more so than selling them for caps (but I bet someone would sell you one eventually). I had to check the trade sub and give up one of my crazy guy Fasnacht masks for the trailer and radioactive barrel plan (and was told that was a very reasonable trade)
---
No, the recolor is only applied to Heads.
---
The person who set it up didn't play the game enough to know not everything is weak to headshots
---
My Bloodied FFR Gamma Gun.  It just shreds most players in the event of PvP.
---
I agree with others. Targetting HUD.
---
**Lead**
---
Kids toys and pencils and wood blocks and paint cans 
---
Silo gyms(about 80 lead per silo)
---
Motel gym at Flatwoods
---
Charleston Fire Department gym
---
Penitentiary workout yard
---
Vault tech university exercise room - travel to Big Al‚Äôs Tattoo Parlor. When facing that door turn around and head to the red Vault Tech door and go inside. Gym is the first door on the right. 
---
Atop the Monorail Elevator.
---
Can chimes (6 are at Camden Park, 2 or more are at the penitentiary, a few at the golf course building). 
---
Ecavator PA and Lucky Holes mine.  This can easily yield 800-1200 lead depending on how many nodes you find and how often Super Duper is triggered.
---
Is there a list for that?
---
Those are one of crafting items needed to craft some end game items you buy with gold bullion. That is new currency you unlock with finishing one of settler or raider questline.
---
Turn your damage numbers on and see if the proc. 
---
You need to do like 1200 damage to get loot from her.
---
Thanks done it last night for like 30 mins and got a full set of t60 at level 45 though which is annoying and then half a set of t51b as well but just taking it at 45 as it‚Äôs still the set I‚Äôm after will just keep running it and hoping for level 50
---
I think this is The best way. Might not be the most effective xp wise but its easy to get burnt out IF you rush to much
---
We know. This is for people that deleted the full set thinking it wasn‚Äôt rare.
---
I honestly think the issue with survival was the balance of legendaries... Because being one tapped across the map is no fun for anyone.
---
That being said, I enjoyed the risk and didn‚Äôt mind the PVP... Until they added that stupid survival score. Don‚Äôt get why it showed people just doing their thing rather than people going for kills. 
---
I think it‚Äôd actually add a bit of risk if we got it back now, with shop camps.
---
Because different people play differently? To be completely honest with you I've seen no point to Tenderizer at all, seeing as I spent the better part of a day without it equiped and was still killing everything just fine. Going to chalk it up as another one of those 'It Just Works' moments.
---
Woah thats amazing, so could you get a full set of vanguards solar armor For everyone and tank?
---
What's the bonus for Lovers embrace?
---
Maybe take something like the tenderizer (as well as other existing huge weapons, maybe add a few others like the bumper swears or vertibird blade) and give it a small damage boost but make it a pa only weapon. That could be a good idea to make pa better and give it a benefit that regular armor doesn‚Äôt have.
---
Neither. They don't work
---
Pick up paint cans, can chimes, and break down weapons. If you keep an eye out for lead and iron veins, they're all over the map. When you find yourself repeatedly visiting an area, look around and see if you can't find some veins. If I need iron and lead ore, there's two locations I go when I visit the monorail elevator. You can hit these after you go to the Mine, but with excavator armor I still wind up with enough lead and steel just by hitting the veins outside. When you teleport to the monorail elevator, turn to face the road and walk downhill. The first cliff has three lead nodes, walk back and down the hill toward the next rock outcropping and there are three iron nodes there. There's also aluminum and copper ore there, on the little cliff directly across from the Fort Defiance. Plus, if you're really starved for lead, you can go to the top of the monorail elevator and find a bunch of weights and some bonus concrete.
---
Uhhhh try clearing HD space. I have a lot more than 100
---
I like this idea.
---
Looks like it yeah, and by the sounds of things would be even better if you were all wearing it.
---
Uniqe rewards is no worries, you will almost certanly get better gear from common legendary enemies and purveyor
---
5-10k way more common than the croc back pack.
---
&gt; player bases
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt have time to play on weekdays so I try to grind out enough treasury notes on the weekend to last all week but the queen fight is now cancer lol.
---
I'm pretty sure in this scenario you can close out of the map and return to your corpse. Then wait a second and try to respawn again.
---
Im not caps poor.. I never said I didnt FT...
---
Anyone who's using 3rd party software is a dumbass begging for his account to be flagged.
---
Those things are so easy to craft in large amounts that you don't even have to dupe them.
---
Guilty as charged - I bombed away players who were just afk during the Fastnacht Event.
---
I didnt know you could scrap flux.. learn something new every day...
---
lol thought the same
---
To me this sub is still enjoyable, even in times when issues coming up there‚Äôs still something to laugh together.
---
Ok! I‚Äôm gonna finish this base I‚Äôm working on now and make an album with that one too, been a couple months since I updated them, I want to show my best!
---
The area came with WL
---
Yeah, let‚Äôs turn our arena back into the glorious boxing ring it once was!
---
I think that was a lot of the issue. I got a lot of downvotes at the time for advocating to have levendary effects reduced/removed. Never seemed like a popular opinion.
---
Fallout isnt a pvp game, it hasnt been for years, it shouldnt be now. Nuclear winter is a broken game mode, if you cant enjoy your pvp there, why should everyone else suffer for it ?  Pvp was shown to he shit, before it was open to public, you had to shoot somone then be shot to fight. Call of duty, overwatch, other mindless shooting games, go play them if you want pvp. Fallouts engine isnt built for it, thier guns arent built for it. The game has an issue of giving pve players a challenge, they should fix that before even looking at pvp.
---
sure if they cost like 10x regular legendary perks..
---
crafting legendary gear should expensive af....
---
If your level 32 don't sweat it you would outgrow most of it by 50 anyways
---
if you get the cage you auto learn the doors. are you just wanting the doors on something if so i can help.
---
this isnt urgent.. and its already despawned...
---
Last time I said this I got downvoted back to vault 13. I agree so hard, adventure mode does not need pvp. Make separate servers for that shit or just keep it in NW. I feel like more than 50% of players dont care about pvp at all being in the game. Yet it‚Äôs still there and we all bitch about how shitty the pvp system is. They‚Äôll never take it out, so I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre at least making some improvements on this next update.
---
Only if nobody looted it and you join the same server
---
probably Vats
---
People wanted to use the stuff they grinder hard for, and I totally get that. It‚Äôs why people wanted the option to use a separate character entirely for survival - which is what should have happened from the get-go. Though that would muck up the free legendary weapon. 
---
I actually took a character from level 1 to level 50 in there, and it was honestly some of the most tense and fun fallout I played.
---
yeah I did not knew too, just discovered when I tried to upgrade my BoS underwear armor the flux was gone
---
Honestly, the legendary gear correlating to the enemy that dropped it. I know it‚Äôs all RNG anyway, but there‚Äôs so few 3* enemies, it‚Äôd be nice to get a 3* piece of anything from them.
---
It's the same XP bonus, just longer
---
TY. yeah that's what I do. I was curious about saving them up or rolling 3-4 per day
---
Every change they made, was designed to make it harder to kill someone who didn't want to PvP.
---
It was so ridiculously bad at the end, that it became nearly impossible to kill anyone without exploitative weapons.
---
I should clarify that I was referring to items such as the secret service armor where you can only craft legendary versions
---
Fast travel bug
---
How do you get the outfit I have the imposter outfit but how do you get that one
---
yeah but I need the stinpack at least :/
---
So you want to be able to choose all 3 of the legendary perks on a piece of gear?
---
Bold strategy but it will never happen.
---
[magic shotguns ](https://youtu.be/AHu4CErJXU4) by AngryTurtle
---
Targetting his was the best mod ever for vault94.  Having the insects highlighted in there was a huge boon.
---
oh.. still.. the more specific the more expensive it should be
---
Leg-Perk would still be too cheap IMO
---
yeah I have 2 fall damage. completely essential. need to roll better on my 1 and 2 star so looking at strategy
---
ty man. yeah it's really tough to save them hence my question :)
---
That's great
---
Laggy inventory/vending machines/stash boxes and trade menus.  T
---
Ah, that explains it, haha.
---
How do i go onto the same server
---
Yes, but I know kindred is 3hr, is lovers also 3hr?
---
Go play cod or another mindless shooter, fallout isnt a pvp game, 1-4 had no pvp NV had no pvp. The engine isnt built for it, no one should have the suffer to let a few people enjoy shit. You shouldnt be able to kill people whenever you feel like it, unless those people want the risk of dying whenever you please.
---
you can roll legendary effects on weapons and guns that can be moded. I have the secret service armor and you need mods to create the piece. what you get is random tho
---
It‚Äôs not the gun. It‚Äôs throwing a bait and using a program like Erectus to modify how many projectiles are thrown. So for example you can throw 1 bait and have 200 come out
---
A hub city for this sort of thing would be nice. Maybe Flatwoods or Morgantown.
---
Forget about it. if you're on xbox i can give you 20 of those supply requisitions. I've got like 170 or something. Never use them.
---
I agree with this, but I think theyd have to nerf the 3* spawn rate if they did this. And change guarantee 3 star spawns in easy challenges
---
me too
---
I‚Äôm level 196 rn and have over 300 stimpaks. What I do is I have the pharma farma perk (tank 3) and I just loot any chem boxes I find. I recommend hitting Tyler county fair or the ranger district office in the cranberry bog
---
yeah I was wondering why this isn't actually displayed to you in game it's kind of annoying but hey ho. So best idea is just not worry about the gear then.
---
I usually just run power into the dome using advanced connectors. You can power your vending machines inside the dome using this technique without having to stuff a generator inside as well.
---
i agree that its bold but atm all we have is end game RNG rolls which gets old very quick since it makes hard work and skill obsolete
---
Bro, don't worry about it. The best you get is a couple chems, some junk and a weapon you probably won't use. You'll be able to summon more drops easily later on also.
---
The best ally is Weasel when they actually make her an ally
---
It would also be cool to have signs like the ones in Watoga.  I think those are [split flap displays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display)? At least that model is already in the game.  I don't know if they already have a programmable system behind the scenes, or if they create a new fixed model for each one.
---
From a mechanics side, programmable displays like these would require a new data entry method to be added to the player interface.  I don't think anything else uses console or PC keyboard letter entry.  (Even player vendor prices still use a slider, which is a PITA for setting prices from 0 to 30,000.)  Seems like a natural for a camp terminal interface.  And those are already lockable.
---
I suppose they could have a manual up-down button on each letter, as well, although that would be more cumbersome and require some fairly precise clicking to use.  And hopefully it'd be lockable, unlike light boxes and lamps that can be changed by anyone.
---
The most upvoted post when the faschnat event was delayed was someone calling the devs monkeys, super chill.
---
Good for pvp
---
Just run around the forest picking blood leaf and soot flower to make healing salve
---
That seems to be the general idea everyone has, I just wasn't too sure if I was going to miss out on something and regret it later. Thanks for the help!
---
For real. After awhile caps start collecting like dust you don‚Äôt even know where you get them sometimes. I haven‚Äôt been under 10k in so long and fast traveling is literally pennies especially with travel agent I don‚Äôt even understand why it matters. Low on caps? Go kill like 5 super mutants, sell their weapons with hard bargain and there you go you got traveling funds for a day at least.
---
Without the sneak perk at 31 agility I sometimes get spotted.  So, sneak seems to have more impact than agility does
---
Yeah this is a common pet peeve. It‚Äôs actually one of the few things that doesn‚Äôt bother me, I find enough legendaries to convert to 3* with scrip (and am then disappointed with my bad luck). Bad mechanics bother me a lot more but this does seem like it would please a whole lot of people for what seems like minimum dev effort.
---
Well I suppose i'll jump on now and make a bit more of an effort with the quests now!
---
HUGE.
---
Great insights! i would try pumping up my adrenaline perk this time, as i also notice that i keep wasting my stimpacks on auto stim born survivor when taking minimal amounts of dmg from falling from heights or crossing spike traps. I would, however, prefer not to completely eliminate extra vats damage perk. Maybe ill keep 1 star better crits and transfer 2 points to Grim Sprint. This makes sense, right? I mean, 1 star better crit offers 20% dmg as opposed to the 40% if i pump it to 3 stars. Maybe its better to sacrfice a bit more damage for a little more sustain.
---
What‚Äôs the fast travel bug?
---
‚ÄúReduces damage while blocking by 15%‚Äù minor modifier. üòä
---
Dont think think it makes a difference. However i felt like when i did it daily i was getting lots of 3*'s. I recently started rolling peices again  tonreplace my righr arm after saving up max scrip. I got 15 1* pecies out of the 20 rolls.... so who knows
---
I have a really nice set right now:
---
LL: van,pow,sneak
---
RL: van, pow, sneak
---
CHest: chameleon,pow,sneak
---
LA: autsim, power,sent
---
RA : mutant ,psn, wwr 
---
Ive rolled my right arm over 90 times, ideally id like a vangaurd, poison, sent. But would be happy with any poison, sent peice. I run pistols,bandaleir and a chemist pack so i dont need any weight reduction effects.
---
It‚Äôs one of the things that make me bark aloud. ‚ÄúCome on, man!‚Äù
---
My go to weapon for the first 150 levels was a cultist dagger. I used to have to hang back until she landed, but I‚Äôve recently converted to a pistol build, which largely leaves strength untouched, so I just went ahead and filled it out with gladiator perks and now I can do both! Vats crit headshots with my .44 then when she lands, go and stab up her udders
---
So, no. Some of us enjoy pvp and participate in it anytime the opportunity arises. I'm built for it with entire top-tier gear sets devoted to it. Just because your food build get vaporized doesn't mean pvp is broken or that noone has fun doing it.
---
Obviously not around for the 48hr Fasnacht delay. So many unhappy bunnies promising to cancel their FO1st and uninstall the game...and doing neither.
---
Ah, those heady days of borderline death threats...
---
And bad design.
---
SPOT LIGHTS. Been broken for 2 games now...
---
No, as long as you have the original you can take a tattered dress to the crafting terminal in the mansion and get a new one
---
I don't pvp so it's gonna be going towards something. 
---
Probably a fixer or a handmade of some kind.
---
i go to Pt Pleasant and get mothman eggs to cook up and sell for daily caps along with whatever excess chems and junk I have on hand...
---
&gt; Modders have all their accountability at risk because if they break a game, nobody will ever seek to use another mod of theirs again.
---
You don't know much about modding, do you. Modders break shit ALL the damn time. They can just do a quick fix and be done with it. Devs have to submit the fix for QC checking, and approval for distribution. That can take months.
---
&gt; Modders have nothing but time? The dev team is literally paid to work on these things. 
---
Devs have scheduals they have to follow. Modders can spend however long they wish till they get bored.
---
&gt; As you can see, atomic shop gets patched in a few days, and game breaking bugs take a month.
---
Different people deal with those things. Atom shop devs are not general devs. They have no control over any of that. They are doing the job they were told to do.
---
You open the map, find a spot you wish to fast travel, click on it, click again to accept, and map just closes without any fast traveling. Rinse and repeat up to 8 times before it works.
---
The wastelanders patch notes it was in there then gone funny enough i thought i was imagining that till i read till i saw a few posts then a utube video about it
---
I want the red glare!
---
Oooo yeah I think that happened to me once or twice. That‚Äôs extremely annoying
---
gonna try that one, atm the punch line "I'm not be able to financially recover from that" makes a lot of sense
---
That one where back out of a crafting menu and it teleports you back to it
---
as i just dropped a Bloodied Magical Gauss shotgun, my game right now is to just stash my junk, wait for a griefer to attack me, one shot him wirh a shotgun headshot and imm√©diatly Alt+F4
---
lol petitions..
---
when was the last time a petition for anything worked?
---
working on that now :)
---
If your on PC I'll donate 25 stimpacks and 25 radaway plus whatever psycho I have. What flux do you need? I have some spare.
---
I tried to share the link for the petition but my post got flagged:(
---
I use junkies weapon my problem isnt damage i can kill most stuff with ease the problem is that i die super fast
---
Literally a few days ago to get Katie Hopkins off Twitter...
---
Seems, kinda strong
---
Yea it's a small thing but extremely annoying when you trying to go from point A to point B fast (like jump to some event that is propably just ending).
---
Ghouls can have VATS too!
---
cool story, got a link?
---
I‚Äôm guessing duping is happening again, came across 3000 mole miner pails in a bag at a train station, this is on pc.
---
I got all of them in about 100 turn ins, complete RNG.
---
God-fucking-damnitt. And here I was thinking I managed to come up.
---
Unintended duplication glitches/external STASH accessglitches/Display items being scrapped from CAMP cannot be placed glitch.
---
Separate the damned things into their own unique storage. STASH is STASH. Vendor is Vendor. Display is Display. No inter-connection to the STASH. At all.
---
Instead of chasing their tails trying to fix it every time it crops up, and it always does, *just do it and be done, already*.
---
I remember turtle saying something in one of his videos that the extra damage is less than you think and you‚Äôre better off firing more crits with the less crit cost perk you already have. Me personally, I‚Äôm bad with using my crit and I only remember when I‚Äôm plugging away at the queen. But at this point, it‚Äôs really splitting hairs. I would go with all 3 in grim reaper, but as long as you have some, you should be looking great. The auto refill is really great for vats users.
---
I'd support the option to change your start vault to any of the other vaults on the map and then that Vault would be your free travel vault.  I agree with a lot of the reply's that Foundation and Crater should be Free FT points, once you hit max rep.
---
I actually had this bug today, never seen that before
---
I need the violet one, but I'm on PS4 sadly, no one seems to sell those flux.
---
This would actually be nice for SBQ, to give some time to adjust/stimpack/repair weapons. Not like a lot of time, I‚Äôm just saying Heart of the Swamp time.
---
&gt; Every Fallout game had a maximum carry weight. 
---
Did you forget settlements from Fallout 4? Or boxes in your houses in FO3?
---
&gt; If you don't work in the company how are you talking about their capabilities? 
---
Easy. It's not hard to understand how databases work if you've worked a lot with servers or internet websites. Adding more numbers to the same value (IE Junk x20 versus Junk x21) does not increase server load by more than a few bytes, which is miniscule by every standard out there. The scrapbox has a negligible effect on server load.
---
&gt; I don't even see complaints about other games much. 
---
That's [completely irrelevant to what we're talking about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism).
---
&gt; How can Bethesda fix the real bugs if this is all people complain about? 
---
* People complaining about bad gameplay design is irrelevant to their ability to fix bugs.
---
* They reintroduced bugs into 76 that had been patched out of FO4, then had to repatch those.
---
* They make promises to the playerbase to improve things, then lock said things behind a paywall. This is them literally creating a problem and selling you the solution.
---
&gt; I was mad when Sony itself started charging monthly for internet services... But lo, I'm paying for the shit! 
---
I don't even know what you're talking about.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
---
&gt; Am I missing something or is there a page where people complain about the GTA P2W packages too? I'd like to see that... 
---
Again, not relevant. And yes, [people bitch about the shark cards](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/6ceaqk/shark_cards_what_am_i_missing_why_the_hate/).
---
I was stuck at captain for around 25, then I got Paladin and Elder in 4 drops. I dunno if captain is bottlenecked or something.
---
I could only really ever see it being used for the sbq or windigo. The draw back would be the movement speed. Like half as fast as when your over encumbered and the rapid drain on cores.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I might be able to help you out
---
The problem with that is is sneak isnt reliable at all when it works its great problem is i cant really use it most of the time
---
My sons base was obliterated yesterday. We said fuck this and went private.
---
Can you link here? I can't find anything on this. Thx!
---
I'm not dead and im overweight .
---
Obesity sucks
---
To which youtube or the reddit posts
---
Ah, fair enough mate, that's unfortunate, I'm sure someone on the PS4 will be able to help though.
---
The only thing I see you did thats kinda "dumb" is trying to do all this end game content at your level. You shouldn't need to enter a nuke zone yet. You also shouldn't be using a bloodied sledgehammer or trying a bloodied build. No wonder your out of meds.
---
Been seeing a lot of posts about PC duping making a return. Haven‚Äôt seen any on console yet though.
---
This is one of the big reasons that I have largely quit the game. Launching nukes at the queen and using the event to farm treasury notes was one thing I still liked doing.  This really killed it for me. Yeah I know she can still  be killed but strategy is largely out the window.
---
Also, Instigating, Junkies, Medic and Stalkers.
---
It gets real annoying. Just pray you don‚Äôt encounter it again.
---
Never happen as your asking corp to remove there engagement and retention mechanisms they borrowed from mobile gaming... Lmao, they very precise decision to add grind as much as they could into the game.
---
If you're on PS4 /u/Noisyss is having a bad day and would appreciate that I'm sure.
---
I‚Äôm sure they weighed the options back when they removed it and got rid of it for reasons. I highly doubt they would just be like ‚Äúwe‚Äôre bringing back a mode no one wanted when it was live the first time!‚Äù
---
Definitely as a max rep perk. I get that Bethesda want to make you work for it, but it would be nice to feel less like I need to move my camp near whatever is currently going on..  um.
---
wait a minute, I think Bethesda played me again
---
I‚Äôve turned in 100s and never got the drop. I‚Äôm convinced now they stopped dropping to be used in the broken steel rewards. In the last 2 weeks easily farmed over 100 TD
---
Yep.  It's a reward for the first Morgantown quest.  I didn't realize it was unique, so I either scrapped it or sold it, months ago.
---
Aye. just added platform. Xbone unfortunately
---
Yes exactly. I play on Xbox aswell you just press A when you highlight the brackets.
---
I feel like they should at the very least give us a guaranteed 3 star legendary from Scorched earth and the new wendigo colossus event. Since they are our big end game events, it should reward us as such right? Most of the time we‚Äôll end up with a crap 3 star anyway but at least we‚Äôd be guaranteed one.
---
Actually, WoW also had an outdoor PvP system.
---
The problem of FO76 is that there is absolutly no place you can take care of your personnal things safely.
---
Easy way to fix that would be to make camp zones and/or vendors zones pacifist zones, even if that hurts the original anarchic RP aspect of the game, in addition to the actual tag system which is ok IMHO.
---
That way, anyone who wants to pvp can do it, and if you dont, you cant get griefed.
---
Also, i think that the whole system of camp pvp, even if its OK RPwise, is totally useless because of ghe power level of players compared to the possible defenses you can build. And thats a reason for me to just completly remove it.
---
To balance it out even more have it heavily armored on the front but the back side is the weak point and make the repair cost really high.
---
Move the entire fallout Ip away from Bethesda to Obsidian.
---
 totally absurd ....
---
Ya said violet?  I'll be logging in shortly, see what I have on hand.
---
nah, mate I had this sledgehammer from lvl 10 reward, is(was) fucking stronger let me do a lot of content ahead my lvl, I happened to get the plans for the BoS fatigues lining and wanted that because the bonus on end and stre, 2 on each is good, and since as melee I'm always getting damaged I just heal on the end of each fight (at nuked zone I used the pa) and killed everything that moves, but not the yau thing he is too strong.
---
&gt;At lvl 900+ what else is there to do for entertainment? 
---
This completely undermines your attempt to portray this as roleplay. It's not about whether it makes sense in the world, it's about entertaining yourself as a game player and not giving a shit about others.
---
But the essential point is that this game's PVP sucks. It always has. There is no balance, the gunplay isn't up to par, and the rewards are lackluster. That's why it's being removed-- it simply isn't good, and there isn't enough interest to sustain it. Yes, post-apoc is a ripe genre for PVP, but that doesn't matter because Fallout is a single-player IP and it's been made clear, by player actions and words as well as Bethesda's own investigations, that PVP is not popular int his game.
---
Griefing others and masking it as roleplay is just a joke response. Find another game to entertain yourself like any sane person would do.
---
You're assuming the fallout universe has Vulcan canons, this sounds too OP to be a good idea, players wouldn't just use it to fight scorchbeasts, they'd probably do a shit tonne of griefing and you can get perks in the game that I crease fusion core duration by like 90% or something
---
I put both characters in the same spot and just drop. Its worked for me everytime. I've done it alot too.
---
Have you heard any updates on this? I‚Äôve submitted multiple tickets and get told to submit feedback which states you won‚Äôt get any further contact about the issue.
---
I think the is a niche out there who want it. The game gets stale very quickly when there is no excitement and if getting rushed by other players. The current game is far to soft and I‚Äôve been playing since day one. Its a chore to just log in these days
---
Travel between train stations wasn't free even when there were trains.
---
If you find a petition to keep survival gone I would sign that one.
---
I dont judge/blame you.
---
Its just a warning.
---
If I were developer king for a day, I would allow ...
---
1. Vault 79 becomes a free fast travel after the raid. It‚Äôs well off the beaten path, and is only a relevant destination after the raid, that this seems fair.
---
2. Crater and Foundation becomes free fast travel depending how you split gold. If you only split with your selected faction, you only get fast travel to that faction. If you split gold to share with both factions, you get the option to free travel to both Crater and Foundation. If you keep all gold, no fast travel to either. Gives the choice some added weight.
---
3. Free fast travel train station to train station. You have to be at a train station to be able to access the free travel railway system.
---
yep pure violet flux, if you happen to have 2 I have some caps I can give to you it would be awesome
---
Every game with loot drops uses rng mechanics to dish out rewards, Bethesda don't want players ruining the game by doing whatever they want with legendary weapons and armor
---
Sounds like you may have done the glitch that increases the mag size by firing a low capacity weapon the exact moment you switch to a higher cap weapon. I‚Äôll tell you, a single action with 200 rounds ready to go is a really big iron.
---
Get unyielding Armour, it works great for full health builds as you get additional damage when you need it
---
How about a fix for the only online multiplayer game to not have a text chat. That would be the best fix. 
---
 That may actually make me play more than 10 minutes a day.
---
Look I'm good. I'm obviously in the wrong place these days on the internet with whoever you people are. Just gonna continue my semi happy life. You all can continue complaining about everything you see.
---
Or if survival was brought back, just don‚Äôt play it?
---
If we could craft any legendary perk we wanted imagine how fast everyone would get bored of this game
---
thanks for let me know mate, I did some bad choices today I'm contemplating how dumb I'm
---
Why? It‚Äôs a completely different game mode and doesn‚Äôt interfere with adventure mode? It will get to the point where people are just going to grief others in adventure mode because there is no other avenue to play hardcore
---
Your right I am assuming they have vulcan cannons and does the fusion core perk work on plasma cores? To balance it out the movement speed would be slow so someone could flank around back and attack the lightly armored rear. Like I said it was designed for fire support not front line engagement.
---
I prefer the developers not split up to have to work on 2 modes. They can't even get one right.
---
Bethesda because hopefully they would trickle down into all of their games LOL
---
That's never happened to me on ps4, what do you play on?
---
There is a niche that wants it, the question is this: is that niche large enough to warrant spending resources on it?  Is there going to be enough return on investment?  
---
How many more copies of the game, fallout 1st subscriptions, and other IAP will move if they add this in?  
---
If the return on investment is 0 (or worse, they‚Äôd be losing money on it) why would they do it?  This may be why it was scrapped in the first place.  If the cost to maintain the server, rule set, and all the other issues from it was more than any potential purchases, they probably decided to scrap the idea.
---
ps4 unfortunately.
---
That's the attitude to leads to poorer and poorer game design, and more monetization. But you do you, I guess.
---
Epic!!! This is a game changer! Thanks for the info.
---
Ummmm play game and level to 50. Just playing the game feeds you stims and scrap and Meds and plans. 
---
For one your were over reaching with the sledge you had and 2 you were wasting all the mats anyway pre 50 crafting.
---
But hey you do you.
---
PC
---
I think everyone in this small community know the status of the game so people don't tend to complain that much. Much easier and nicer for everyone to be friendly and positive
---
Very valid argument dude. I think it would be good if adventure mode and survival mode could somehow meet in the middle.
---
I‚Äôm hoping it works like that for me. I don‚Äôt mind turning them in as I use 5mm and sell the 2mm, but damn the fast traveling is getting boring.
---
Oh but it does interfere with adventure mode. It splits the development team up.
---
 They can't even get adventure mode where it needs to be, why would you want them to work on a whole other mode?
---
 Survival failed miserably because they don't know how to implement PvP into a non PVP game.
---
Robot Combat 101
---
Gutsy/Handy: If you can't get the angle in vats to get the combat inhibitor, just aim for thruster and they are can't attack anymore.  If your a shot gunner and have Enforcer, just aim for the legs and move on, this triggers the self detonate protocols and has a chance to take out most of its allies (especially in a hallway fight scenario).
---
Sentry Bot: Vats the Fusion core.  Just dodge till it over heats and hit the core while cooling off.
---
Assaultron: Head then legs.  Head shot breaks the eye laser, and then the leg shot turns it into a T-100 crawling around and not deadly at all.
---
Protectron: Arms.  Once you blow of the arms, the Protectron will initiate the self detonate protocols (same as above).
---
Robobrains: Generally just headshot these.
---
Happened to me year ago with a dragon. Semi auto dragon was great while it lasted.
---
The one place I usually do it is the Blood Eagle base next to my camp, when I am busy with things. I check back every 20 minutes and kill all the blood eagles there. There is some variety to the Blood Eagles, but they are always Blood Eagles. I haven't tried it in a spot where the mob changes.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter, I did 27 rolls for an unyielding right arm.. nothing
---
First roll 3 days later unyielding 3*
---
I think a better idea than adding in a new weaponized power armor would be allowing us to call in vertibirds, the ones fo4 had the side mounted miniguns as well as front facing dumb fire rockets, it could work the same way too, throw the a flare and wait for it to show up but after you get on the minigun the vertibird will take off from the ground fly around the area where you threw the flare in a wide circle so you can use the minigun on them and then when you want to fly you just use your map to select a known location
---
Oh ok that's cool. I've seen several lower levels trying to run bloodied builds because they read online that they are "the best" and having really hard times. Good luck.
---
Caps/Scrip/Bullion limits.
---
Not just daily limits. Limits in general.
---
Endgame
---
You mean harder to one shot explosive kill another player because weapon and armor balancing? Trying to deter train station spawn camping? Yeah, do cry me a river, tough guy.
---
I can, in fact, spare two; PSN username?  I'll rec you, then change my setting so you can hop on my server quick.
---
If you are on ps4, I could walk you through some of this on mic. Inventory management is a big part of this game. Some people just don't know what is weighing them down or what is worth keeping.
---
A lot of the "useless" stuff can be dumped at a train station.
---
The 38 ammo can be used in a combat rifle with the correct modification, but lowers damage output albeit higher than pipe guns though.
---
Since you use bear arms, I wouldn't worry about heavy weapons until later. It's the other weapons you gotta look out for, shotguns and rifles weigh a bunch.
---
If you mod things down to standard they will take up significantly less space in your stash, especially if it has the 90% reduced weigh modifier. Or ultra light, in the case of armor.
---
I believe it's something like a 7% drop chance. Theoretically you should be getting one for every 14 technical datas you turn in, but that's just not how RNG works.
---
yeah I dont really stack mats only meds, I farm for mat each 10 lvl to change the gear so no worries about that and give me more content to run too :) but this time was a bad call use all the meds there
---
Hmm man PC has the short end of the stick when it comes to 76, you guys can get hacked easily, you seem to have way more bugs that are worse and idek what else
---
I did it for first time yesterday.  Amazing
---
Found the tesla user
---
Another approach occurred to me: What if there was a new display type: Marquee Sign and a new plan for Marquee Letters? The latter would be inventory objects (Junk or Miscellaneous items in inventory).  Hopefully the letters would weigh very little (like bullets and similar items), since they would be counted against both stash weight and camp budget when displayed.  I don't know how a displayed letter object would compare to the equivalent camp-built letter, in terms of camp budget impact.  Hopefully less than the 0.2% per letter that the current small letter camp items cost.
---
Placing the letters would then use the same pick-and-place display system we already have for other displays. Since the display system already restricts your inventory view to eligible items, placement just becomes a matter of scrolling up and down and hitting "assign" one at a time to form your message.  The marquee display would then show the letters in order of assignment, left to right.
---
It's more cumbersome than OP's approach, but the trade-off is it doesn't require any new interface mechanics to be created to support it.  Instead, they would just need to make a new display item and a set of letter objects to go with it.  Might be cheap enough to produce in terms of designer time that B. would consider it.
---
Whether you like it or loath it, it‚Äôs getting some traction and will grab the developers attention. Interesting to see what comes into fruition
---
Omg we need a petition for this weapon to come back it needs to be in 76 so badly
---
It doesn't take much to go from half assed to full assed bloodied assuming you have the Uny armour lying around and the right perks.
---
I usually go under 30% health wise for serendipity and then after I take a bit of damage nerd rage procs at 20%.
---
Even half assed with the right weapon it's overkill for most mobs anyway, after that youa re stacking damage for SBQ fights etc
---
Ever since update 19 it has been working great for me. I can even bump into things and they don't see me. However other times I will get one mob that has me stuck in [Danger] and even traveling far away will leave me stuck at [Danger]. The only resolution to that bug I've found is to fast travel. I only get that bug maybe once per week other than that sneaking works great.
---
till now I did not knew that was the best one lol, just happened to get the crane reward and a chest that gave me Regen out of combat. i don't search for builds but I try to creat my own so I know what is happening on each time and screen indicator.
---
So you use fast travel, but you want it removed from the game aside from going to 76, CAMPS, and events? You can do that already. Nobody is saying that you must use FT. If you want it removed then you can just not use it and walk to everywhere aside from the places you stated.
---
i think you need dr cards, basically just go for survival (and damage obviously)  since you will constantly have low health to proc the legendary effect
---
I have all kind of flux on my scrapbox and still can use it normally for any crafting. No offense but I think you are mistaken if not lying.
---
Why does everything have to be about nerfing what exists, and can't be about buffing everything else to bring it up to the Unyielding standard?
---
Every playstyle should be viable. That's what an online game is. There should be multiple ways to experience the content in a relevant manner for all types of characters.
---
Most people who want PA buffed aren't asking for other things to be nerfed. I just want PA to actually have a role.
---
Then you are very lucky haha have had mine reset multiple times now.
---
Targeting hud or int
---
I think it could be changed where you can craft a weapon/armor with a legendary module, but you can‚Äôt pick the legendary effects. Actually would be a nice feature without a legendary perk, since you can do it with the new Gauss weapons.
---
You can't. I have it stored on my scrapbox and I still able to use it.
---
Just happened last night to me! Right now my Railway Rifle has a 109 round clip in and my Bolt action Rifle has a 165 round clip. It happened when my Railway ran out of nails during the queen fight and I quickly switched to the bolt. I didnt even notice the railway till this morning. Not even sure how I reclaimed so many nails back.
---
I will try this out in a little bit!  I also saw a screenshot of it under light armor so maybe I was looking in the wrong place
---
https://massivelyop.com/2020/05/28/fallout-76-interview-bethsoft-on-one-wasteland-text-chat-and-other-radioactive-topics/
---
"Another big change for One Wasteland is the removal of¬†Fallout 76‚Äôs¬†negative survival elements. As it stands right now, if you don‚Äôt eat or drink for a while in the game, you‚Äôll find yourself struggling on with a heavy debuff. But in One Wasteland, there will be no penalties, only bonuses for those who take the time to quaff and scarf all they find. ‚ÄúWe want the flavor of survival without the drudgery,‚Äù Gardiner said."
---
you seem extremely intolerant of a point of view that differs from your own...
---
dunno mate, isn't here anymore, I'm not lying, wanna hope on my camp and see it? lol I can even screen shot what is left on my stash at least the raw flux is there.
---
You can't scrap stabilized flux, it goes into the scrapbox no problem. Raw flux is an aid item and can't be scrapped, it can however expire and become inert flux. So check for inert flux in your aid tab.
---
As for your sledgehammer, that's some bad luck. If you got hit out of the scrip machine you should be able to access it again and get the sledge back, but if you exited yourself it's gone.
---
Your doing it the best way then!
---
Yawn. Let's repeat the group think. Just another sheeple ready for the slaughter. Bah bah bah
---
;)
---
Yea to me I didn‚Äôt realize I need to ask Ra-Ra for help and the switch must be hidden somewhere in the plant, that took me hours to walk every inch of the building lol
---
I‚Äôm at whitesprings. I get 2-3 legendary items a day just from my missile launchers hitting ghouls.
---
"Weapon and armor balancing" lmao
---
You mean damage caps? Because they did f%$k all for weapon balancing, and the only armor balancing they did, was to nerf sentinal/cavalier. I have no doubt you were one of the farmers, crying over PvP, in a PvP centric server.
---
So save your ITG act.
---
Try attacking her head, rather than her legs.  I play a melee build and run this event pretty frequently and always get loot.   As other posters have suggested, turn on your damage numbers to make sure you're actually dealing damage too.
---
go bloodied.. everybody else does...
---
&gt; what i read in the patch notes
---
yeah I got and connection error, btw so if I can't scrap the thing where did it go my 2 flux?
---
The "Seasons" they're adding is not weather/time of year seasons, but kinda like a battle pass type thing.
---
It would be awesome to have seasons that you had to adjust to. Mutations and clothes and even weapon affected would be neat.
---
And any event completion awards you your caps back and few more making traveling there free.
---
there is a christmas event.. thats where all the duped presents came from
---
Rip can‚Äôt help you there my guy, hope things look up for you though
---
Yea i wasn‚Äôt annoyed at all, it was kind of fun after feeling lost a little. Actually when I restarted it, two of the protectrons spawned as three star legendary, that was a good scrip farm without going anywhere
---
If you died, it dropped in a death bag.
---
There's also an old but that was fixed, that still semi works. I'd love to mention it, but I'm afraid it will get fixed.
---
Not sure if it can be though, since it mostly has to do with their server tick rate delay probably. Let's just say if you manage to be in a certain area where the tick rate is horrible, you can spam a certain button &amp; get a fair amount of items. Then server hop &amp; repeat. Not sure what is going on behind the scenes technically. I guess the game thinks I didn't pick it up,when really I did &amp; then let's me keep picking it up.
---
Lately though my connection seems smooth,unless I'm in the scorchbeast queen event or inside of a nuke zone,with a lot of enemies and people.
---
Yea there are more hacks etc on pc. Also, i'm pretty sure this bug happens on ps4 too. But not everyone apparently suffer from it.
---
When I first started I assumed that's what those worthless terminals were for.
---
For rifles you want high perception and agility, and likely luck if you run mutated or vat. 
---
As for perks, rifleman/expert/master, tank killer, sneak, covert operative, adrenaline, gun fu, bloodied mess, serendipity, nerd rage, maybe blocker as well. Adrenal reaction mutation is also great.
---
For melee, lower the perception and take all the melee damage perks in strength instead, incisor etc
---
I mean, i complain to an extent but there is complaining and then there is having a temper tantrum while kicking and screaming and throwing ur poop all over the walls.  
---
One can be constructive the other isnt.
---
The seasons they're adding are more like a 'battlepass' or the seasons in Destiny 2. 
---
It's a certain time (like 60 or 90 days?) And you basically level a season rank for rewards like cosmetics, camp items, and currencies. 
---
I wish it were actual seasons though, patrolling the Mojave definitely makes me wish for a nuclear winter.... Metro style not ZAX simulated XD
---
PS you can buy your legendaries back for the same amount a scrip from the legendary exchange, but only if you don‚Äôt leave it.
---
Yes, I've had this only happen during the worst times like near a high level enemy or end of an event so I don't get the completion bc I'm back at V76
---
Yea ik that but I'm talking about music like add new radio stations when Halloween comes around the radio station is playing Halloween music and when it's Christmas that radio station plays Christmas music
---
Ra-Ra definitely has talent, I can see her replacing meg as the leader in a year or two.
---
Why do so many people have such a hard time paying a handful of caps to travel places?
---
 If you don't have caps to travel you are playing the game wrong.
---
Would you mind taking a few screenshots of your camp and posting an imgur album so I can look at it? Base building is one of my favorite things in this game and your situation intrigues me a lot. It sounds like you should have plenty of budget left to work with...
---
Have you tried respawning at 76?
---
If you have now inert flux on your aid tab, then it didn't get scrapped. It wasn't never crafted and the raw flux just expired like any raw vegetable/herb.
---
Speaking of people with no skill
---
Took ma about 700 tries to get elder paint.
---
really but is like an item, and yeah I died
---
Bro I‚Äôll give you some bloodied weapons.
---
Lol ik this but I'm just saying for like certain months like when it's December maybe they add Christmas music or when it's October they play Halloween music like they would have to add a radio station to the game during those months but when it's not those months there gone
---
There already are 2 game modes
---
OK if its public domain..otherwise who is going to play the licensing fees for new music added to the game?
---
That's got to be it. Stabilized flux becomes junk and when you die you drop all junk.
---
Some bum on a hand cart should role up on the tracks, and inform you the tracks are out at various spots so be expected to help carry the cart.
---
Well it's one of the few counters to stealth boy spamming pvp players. Yes i know about berry mentats.
---
Pvp in this game is so unbalanced this is just one item far down on the laundry list
---
oh yeah I died to the feral because I had no weapon and got the internet error
---
NW has completely different developmentteam.  I'm talking about splitting the adventure mode up into 2 modes.
---
That's what I was aiming for but had no luck with drops
---
Ik how the pass works but I'm just saying I think it would be dope for when it's Halloween we have a radio station they add that plays Halloween music same thing for Christmas and when it's not those months then we don't have have radio station
---
If you're on PC I'll craft you the level 50 version. I doubt I'd even need a material donation tbh
---
due to cunts like you we can't have nice things
---
Thank god, I had some guy in a golf outfit with a golf club come to my camo smacking me. I killed him but his buddy waited outside and starting raining hell on my base right after. Fuckers got me good.
---
Idk
---
I did not know that but now I'm glad I hung onto mine. I accidentally scrapped my responder paramedic jumpsuit and started a character just to harvest his suit. That is not very responder-like behavior but oh well deleted men tell no tales.
---
Lol doubt it‚Äôll make a difference. I‚Äôd prefer to keep PvP and not hear people whine about PvP in adventure mode and give PvPers a space even if it means ‚Äúsplitting up the dev team‚Äù.
---
well then the build is bad.. weapon shouldnt really matter all that much as long as its bloodied and the build underneath is is even halfway optimized..
---
Drop your build into [Nukes&amp;Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) and post it here.. maybe the bloodied bros can help you tighten it up some?
---
normally i dont point out typos, but "...and died to the scorchBEAT" sounds... interessting ;)
---
I've had them disappearing a lot more often lately.
---
Actually you can craft explosive bait.
---
thats the fatal flaw in "please add more music" posts.. 
---
music isnt free...
---
I was totally a farmer. I‚Äôll own that. I died plenty, and I never came on Reddit or anywhere else to whine or Karen for changes. I went to Survival, took my lumps, lost a lot of caps and aid items. All I read is about how bad PVP was in the end, and mostly it just confirms the PVP community is filled with wannabe demigod builds crying when they actually were forced to fight someone straight up and couldn‚Äôt just chameleon snipe someone spawning at a train station.
---
Dm me if it doesnt work, I'll help you get a new one
---
Legendary system allows you to scrap perks you don‚Äôt want for perk coins to invest into legendary ones
---
I have 2 kits I randomly found on the ground. One was at the top of the world entrance &amp; the other idr. I was wondering what those were about.
---
I guess they get stolen quite often, since I have 2 already.
---
yep I'm taking my wife shopping after work, bring the grenade launcher, see what comes loose
---
Leave before you see the complaints
---
Maybe only if you lose all your base,  items,  caps and scrap is agree.  It is a pain having to level up further just to swap builds,  but that's the game I guess.  If you lost everything but kept your levels and got to rebuild ous go for that.
---
The mechanics of FO doesn't lend well to pvp. It is all legendary gear based with no skill involved. 
---
Id play a survival pvp mode if the did away with legendaries and made you start a new character and lock that character to that mode.
---
 Still though I would prefer they stick to just adventure mode and get that where it needs to be.
---
had the sheepsquatch in the forest Free Range do that last night..
---
first time its happened to me on PC in a very long time..
---
This and "Knight Moreno" are burned into my brain lol
---
You right but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't cost them that much money for like a week to have the songs in the game
---
I have a new one as of this week, it only seems to happen at the imposter. I died, I choose respawn. I respawn dead with the option to respawn again. So rather than continue the loop I FT to another close location and I get that count down because enemies are close (I'm f&amp;$king dead) I finally have to FT far away like my camp to fix it. Happened 3 times now.
---
Looking for a bounty on someone with the GT: QuasarSilva. Heard they're kind of a dick
---
Roxy has some work I hear.
---
Yeah like 2 years ago lol
---
i just got officer the other day.. think there's two more for me to get
---
Regardless on your opinion on PvP in this game, we still deserve a space to be able to do what we enjoy, especially if adventure mode is going to be continuously neutered. And before anyone says it, no, not all PvPers like NW or battle royale lol
---
With the new lighting change they've made, it dont even matter all that much. I got the paint but you can barely tell the difference because metal is so INSANELY glossy.
---
I got them all eventually,  All I can say is that it was an excruciating, thankless, back breaking grind that took me months.
---
Ah yeah that's the glitch where the respawn option is replaced with fast travel, have had that a few times, last time it happened I was at sugar Grove!
---
kindred does not count as well rested for the level up daily btw
---
Gives me awkward chills that anyone would sign a petition to have a mode in a game.
---
Really?? I honestly thought those were only for the magic heavy weapons?? Except for Junkies. That works on a shotty. I might have to re-watch Angry Turtles video again. Lol. üòÖüòÖüòÖ
---
Ouh my mistake then! 
---
Though that would be pretty dope in my opinion. Some seasonal stations or at least more seasonal music on Appalachia radio when the seasons come and go, maybe the DJ could comment on the time of year and what not.
---
What this guy said. I literally run that exact setup.
---
I now get 2.4k damage with my gauss rifle sneak.
---
Kindred spirit is longer too. Apparently the ally ones don't count for the "level up while well rested" atom challenge, though. Haven't tested it but I've seen many posts here on Reddit about it.
---
Go to morgantown airport and loot the hangars.  There‚Äôs usually a fair amount of disease cures, stimpacks, etc there.
---
The healing factor mutation will likely be of benefit to you.  It‚Äôll heal you back to 100% (less rads) when combat has ended.
---
Google and YouTube are your friend, friend.
---
Ahh my favorite f76 youtuber. I use almost the exact same build as he does. Thx
---
(Weird that this vid didn't pop up when i was researching this topic)
---
Bounty hunting is a complicated profession.
---
if it was cheap as you seem to think music would be added to games of all kinds constantly..
---
I tested it this morning and it works but it is inconsistent: the explosive bait does not always explode when thrown.
---
good to know man, gonna get there asap
---
You are ruining my scalping operation sir. Delete dis :P
---
Hmm, I love me a bloodied gauss rifle. One shot city.
---
I thought it was a really nice addition too. Instead of being forced to be romantic with either one of them, you can get the same bonus by being friends with any ally.
---
Are they under other items? I don‚Äôt remember what‚Äôs in the set but say if there‚Äôs a couch, it might be in a set of couches where you have to scroll to the right.
---
The bear stand and WV Tables should be under the 'Tables' tab, and the lamp should be under 'Lights'
---
You still have workshops.  
---
The majority of players do not care for any part of PVP. 
---
Unfortunately you are part of the minority of the fallout fan base.  Otherwise survival would still be around.
---
Same for kindred spirit, from a lot of posts I've seen on here. Hadn't actually checked to see but I've seen many people post about the issue.
---
thats steep as fuck. you might as well start a whole new character. of course it would come at a cost, but everything you have built and worked to acquire? nah, way too steep
---
Think about the poor cap sinks! They will starve without fast travel!
---
I didn't say it was cheap but alrighty
---
I can kill a level 80 scortchbeast (Legendary) in 3 shots. It's fucking amazing.
---
It happened to me about 10 times starting yesterday! Why now?
---
You need to deal enough damage to get a reward.
---
BTW, intent flux is drinkable.  And it weighs less than. Purified water
---
Knight Moreno broadcasting to.... i guess, no one?
---
They said it was a bug but it was added exclusively to queen only in code so looks like it was on purpose and ones that said it would be fixed didn‚Äôt know it was intended feature so we do still need to make posts like this to get it changed back. Take my upvote and good luck getting this high enough to be noticed.
---
&gt;  pretty sure it wouldn't cost them that much money
---
sorry I misunderstood....
---
Yes it would be dope
---
to make those just need to let raw flux spoil?
---
Stupid question, but the Initiate Paint is still out of the drop pool right? I grinded Forbidden Knowledge awhile ago after they removed it and just wanted to make sure they didn‚Äôt add it back
---
I'm fairly certain I've found a full fire breather outfit in the ashheap before
---
I'm always that dick that makes it play though, can't help it
---
Believe it or not there are people who don‚Äôt know that you can scroll right to see additional objects of the same type in the build menu.
---
someone should suggest perk loadouts like the PC mod...
---
Oh the rigging is a masterful idea..     
---
    
---
Bravo.
---
It‚Äôs frustrating when you get a high level boss to appear and then just disappears. 3* legendary weapons barely drop as it is so it‚Äôs not fair, can‚Äôt count on the purveyor for shit either
---
I know that and I've tried that, haven't found them yet
---
I also always spam it and stay by it during each scorched earth, it's such a fun thing to do whenever the queen is busy doing her crop dusting/flying far away then charging back.
---
Anyone who wants get extra scrip do ‚ÄúPlay time‚Äù daily when it comes up at Berkley. You can do it as many time as you want on the same day and gives 7 scrip. Method is easy:
---
- Go talk to Chloe
---
- Collect flowers, meat, toys or attend play date
---
- Return to Chloe and DO NOT drop or scrap what you collected
---
- Once the daily is done fast travel out from the region (e.g. Go to toxic larry to collext acid
---
- Fast travel back and the event will pop up again, go to Chloe again
---
- Serverhop and you will be able to speak with Chloe and complete the daily again for 7 scrip
---
Important note: when you complete the event collected stuff will remain in your inventory giving the possibily to auto-complete the next round if you get the same task.
---
Funny because last time I checked my shotgun has all 3 of these effects, and yes buddy I know how vats works I have been playing the game since the beta.
---
good stuff
---
Yeah they all seem to work! I'm not sure if the armor effect works with Heavies though.
---
The Bear light is definitely where the table lamps are. Mine starts out as the one with the yellow base and white shade. When I scroll right, there‚Äôs the Bear. If you don‚Äôt see it you should send a support ticket.
---
It happened to me on PC yesterday as well. But VATS is working today for me, so idk
---
Lol, the beat was just to dope.
---
Also, it's 2020, can future fallout content please move on and stop using the word crippled?  Its been almost 30 years.  They definately should have known better in the 90s and they certainly are well aware it's damaging by now.  They could easily say, you've broken your leg or you have a concussion.
---
Bloodied is not just about the weapon it's also about the perks. 
---
Just posted this elsewhere but if you are running rifles for example, rifleman/expert/master, tank killer, sneak, covert operative, adrenaline, gun fu, bloodied mess, serendipity, nerd rage, maybe blocker as well. Adrenal reaction mutation is also great. 
---
You need to stack the damage, sneak is a big part of that as well.
---
The bloodied weapon is the icing on the cake.
---
Incorrect, try using a small gun bobble head with a handmade against someone, you will notice a difference
---
1500 damage to be exact.
---
(Also if any one is on PS4 and would LIKE to have their T-60 temporarily pained with any of the BOS Paints besides Initiate until they are able to get them, I‚Äôd be happy too paint them)
---
Both Meat week and Festive scorched are on the roadmap of the year, so i'd assume they'd happen around their usual times. i also assume Mischief Night will be returning even though it wasn't on the roadmap for some reason.
---
I eat them
---
But you'd still keep all your levels and would be able to respec as you choose. 
---
Maybe not lose everything then,  maybe just all caps and scrap?
---
Yeah those poison resistant armor pieces really come in handy if you can find 'em. Otherwise, massive DPS form stealth ts the best way.
---
Did you remember to poke holes in the jar?
---
I said it was there next day it was gone then people started asking wth happened to it as stated in my earlier post believe me or dont the info is out there
---
IIRC it's because of things like backpacks reducing weight. They don't count when you're dead so the game simply assumes your overweight because it's basing your stats based on their own, rather than factoring them in. Happens with my Chemist backpack when I die on occasion.
---
Not sure what you mean? Pretty sure when an appendage on your body no longer works it qualifies that appendage as crippled.
---
I think I see a black sheep of the bunch *wink wonk*
---
This is the story of my life.
---
I went inside the little area they have, there‚Äôs nothing there really, just a small interior cell. I‚Äôve not found any info or anything about it, so guessing it‚Äôs a future thing.
---
They could make it a camp add on but at best probably only get the mr handy model
---
How would one contest a workshop then? If I want the ammo factory but someone else has it then without PvP to force them out of the workshop I can‚Äôt have it. And if you want it you best be prepared to defend it.
---
Ok will do
---
I managed to get a 3 star uny chest powered and reduced weapons weight on my second roll ever and no other piece thru 40 or so more modules. RNG be like that.
---
No one cares about pvp
---
Cheers will have a look where I'm up to got all the sneaky stuff maxed out for sure
---
Valid point but still does way too much damage
---
It's part of the raider questline. Without spoiling I'll just say most people pass the speech check so don't have to go there.
---
Nope. More sloppy and unpolished work. Maybe they‚Äôll release one in the store that we have to pay for though.
---
Yep.  if not stabilized, a short time after you leave the nuke zone, it changes from ‚Äùraw (color) flux‚Äù to ‚Äúinert flux‚Äù
---
The inert is drinkable.  Has some health bonus, too (disease resistance, I think) and weights less than purified water.
---
 Oh - if you equip the green thumb perk, you gather 2x the flux. (Green thumb Also applies to other crops, flowers, etc)
---
give a man a fish, teach a man to fish.
---
A 4th legendary affix does not a 4th star give.
---
You're not wrong. They'd have to be entirely reworked. I haven't really given much thought to how they would work in a post-PvP environment. Maybe they could put a fence around them or move them indoors and make them all soft instances. Capture it for either the settlers or raiders and then defend as normal, with the help of NPC allies. Could turn them into true horde mode defense events that way. Since its instanced, multiple people could have control of the same workshop too.
---
'I was hoping for a pension, but all I got is tension.'
---
Oh for the love of God thank you. My friend constantly drags me into fights. Ill be handing out all the scrip legendaries I don't feel like carrying. Standing in the middle of a crowd with the present icon up (basically hanging my d&amp;$k out in the wind) and sh#t pops off and I'm not specced out for PVP. It always ends with my level 300+ character looking like a chump running for his life, and ultimately loosing it. 
---
Yet for some reason I keep playing with him. Looking forward to that fix.
---
 Excuse 3 star legendary creatures dont guarantee a 3 star legendary drop anymore. Also Bethesda nerfed the XP.
---
1. Two shot, the second bullet only does about 25% of damage I think so it's not great these days. 
---
2. They removed the vault 94 raid I believe. Not sure on the other one tbh.
---
3. Trouble shooter is great vs robots but that's highly situational imo.
---
Got a new trick in my bag. Time to blow up some food builds camps!  Yep I PvP + I grief. They‚Äôre always a way even w patch 20
---
You just have to favourite it. It won't change I'm the same match you favourite it, you have to join a new match
---
All the vaults should be raids or events I‚Äôm tired of escorting Esmeralda the Brahmin üòí
---
That‚Äôs precisely why I bought the stone campfire thing from the atom shop. I figured they‚Äôd do something dumb with those and not have it labeled correctly.
---
I'd use this:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f355eb&amp;d=p02pp2pi2ph2pg2eh2c72cu0a72ar2an2ao0a00a30l71lt2lu2l12sg2a51ib4&amp;m=051c29f3&amp;ad=a8015
---
You've been playing since Beta but you think you can have those three attributes on one weapon? Ha!
---
-
---
Also, i wasn't explaining how VATs actually works. I was stating how it can bypass the health rubber banding.
---
You can also do the heart of enemy daily as many times as you want without server hopping. Just do the daily, go to the terminal at fort defiance and start it again. if gives 8 scrip and 100 caps each time.
---
thank you
---
I don't think the patch will fix your friends.
---
Maybe make the per to have 3 stars so that all fast travels are free
---
Maxed covert operative adds 2.5 damage, which is huge if your base damage is also large, and you can go higher than that with perks like mister sandman.
---
If you don't see it under apparel in the atom shop then you might not have unlocked it. It should be there.
---
Do you still need the helmet? Pretty sure I have one in my stash
---
Yes lad, there are a lot of attributes you could have had on a day one legendary. 50% critical vats plus some other damage modifier is not hard to run into. Also I know how to bypass the "rubber banding" even though that's not actually the problem because it's not rubber banding.
---
TS actually splits the damage and makes both projectiles  do 62.5% damage, which is still pretty bad.
---
This is great, and I thought the sbq run I ran into last night was good. I hope one day to run into something like this, I really enjoy these organized events. They always give a good laugh.
---
Thanks for the clarification, I've been avoiding them as the consensus is they aren't great.
---
Oh that would be fun. Have the challenge rotate where you had to use a specific weapon for each match! Imagine running around with a black powder pistol ü§£
---
Poison+Acid resist perk is desperately needed.
---
That would be cool
---
While you are there, run collision course if it pops up.  IIRC, you get a couple of stimpacks and purified water as a reward.  And the loot box the cargobot drops usually has a couple of decent low level weapons.
---
Loot all the scorched you kill during the event, scrap for mats, and/or sell to the bot vendor at the train station.
---
From the train station, check you map, if its not taken, walk over to Gorge junkyard, capture it.   Loot the deposit near the gate for black titanium.  Enjoy the rewards.  Taking the workshop will open you up for PvP, so don‚Äôt stick around.   
---
Loop around the junkyard and head back toward the train station - you‚Äôll probably get a defend event before you crest the hill.  Go back to the rock outcrop on the hill just above the tugboat (its outside the zone, so no PvP concerns).  Use the sniper rifle you probably got from the collision course event....defend from that rock.
---
Enjoy the reward.
---
I generally play at 50% health, I run a bloodied build but dont really need all the dmg nerd rage boost gives you.. This play style helps in situations like Scorched Earth, or mobbed in the Capital Building..
---
all cards, chems and armour are in the last minute of the vid.
---
More the one where they don't drop a legendary  item.
---
Your post is regarding health regenerating = rubber banding.
---
You can't have three of those effects on one weapon. If you claim that you can, tell me, what's the Primary Effect?
---
Forgive my ignorance (I tried playing wow for a bit but it was just never my cup of tea) but is a GM strictly a customer service provider? It seems like the scope of their role is a little broader since my understanding is that they actually have to sort of play in / inhabit the world / server.
---
And I had to google this last part to be certain, but WoW GMs are, in fact, Blizzard employees and not third party customer service providers, so that would make a huge difference in the amount of training and general understanding of the product.
---
Interested in a potential answer as well.
---
Yeah bloodied is OP, even at that level. Still, nicely done.
---
What people dont realize (or perhaps dont care to admit) is that if you remove RNG from the equation, this game has DRAMATICALLY less to do. If you have a full set if godrolled gear theres nothing to use it on. Chasing the white whale of a godroll is what compels most people to keep playing.
---
It's not rubber banding it's how the game calculates damage output, first effect is the vats critical
---
You need to add it as a NW favourite from within the atom shop.
---
This ,this here is Fallout 76 . I love it XD
---
Make it an official day I say !
---
wow, gonna be rich in no time then, gonna make that my every day run till 50
---
Until they start to nerf the really op things pvp will always be this way.
---
I've always wondered what the actual difference is in levels in weapons. The damage number doesn't actually go up drastically between say 40 to 50.
---
where is this located at Whitesprings? or is it in a Vendor?
---
These comments are ridiculous. PVP is not broken. It is a very different ecosystem from the game's PVE content, though. The most important thing to remember is use a stealth boy. Run secret agent 3 or use mk3s but being invisible prevents you from being targeted in vats. Use a jetpack. Treat PVP as a competitive game of the "floor is lava". The reason is because splash damage and tesla spam will hit you anyway, even stealthed, if you are near a solid object. Conversely, use a tesla or explosive automatic weapon to do the same to your opponent. Damage calculation s capped in PVP, so use an automatic weapon. No semis or single shots, or you will lose. I also recommend assassin/sentinel armor but powered armor is decent too. When you get hit, spam healing and pray. Many people run cola nut 2 and use quantums for this, that can make you nearly invulnerable for several seconds. Also know that there's a bug that can make people unkillable and at that point just give up. Most good players will relog or kill themselves to fix that if it happens, but the douchey ones use it to their advantage. Just don't seek revenge and go on about your day, in that case.
---
I just saw that I have 126 inert ones, those flowers don't have a long life till spoil I thought that I could stack for some time at least.
---
In the kids store part where all the shops are
---
Yes!!!
---
Invest in a good off-hand rifle to swap to for SB and SBQ. My melee zerker has a Zerk-E-25 handmade that I use to take pot-shots when shes flying.
---
How does an autistic left arm effect you? :)
---
took roughly 70 modules for my 3\* SS UN set, 2 of the pieces were the result of less than 5 crafts. one was there result of 20+ on same day, still plan to keep rolling for better, esp if the magic damage gets fixed like I hear it is on pts.  
---
So my limited experience, its RNG through and through
---
Legacy weapons
---
Yes its a way for high level players to help a low level one. No worries and pay it forward when you can ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
u/valseek Any chance of explosive bait seeing the nerf hammer?
---
The consensus is correct. Only thing in my opinion that redeems it is, of course, explosive.
---
Remove them entirely? Or bring them back?
---
Adrenaline is situational. I put on all four when I'm doing Encryptid or the queen because there's plenty of mobs and that extra damage is important if you don't run bloodied. You can look in your pipboy to see how much you get, it shows in status. Try it in Whitespring or something to guage how useful it is for you. For general use, I usually only have one or two points. I've never used gun-fu, but I am considering it on a pistol build I'm working on because it's supposed to help in vats. But I would guess if you don't use the auto-aim that it's not giving you the bonus, so that's probably two points you could use elsewhere.
---
Awww. They used to be good.  So my two shot explosive lever rifle isn't that good then?
---
I love it when this game is fun.
---
Yeah there are no options to make another one in the terminal menu.
---
I have a problem with your use if the word "always". Bloodied,  aa, furious, etc can win in pvp with good gear + good play. 
---
Additionally legacies don't need to be junkies to decimate in pvp.
---
...Nobody complains about anything?
---
When I design a camp, I always try and choose a focal point. The focal point is usually either an interesting structure, or an interesting location. Your house is rather conventional (no offense meant) so if you really want your camp to shine you'll want the location to be interesting. Have you considered camping in the mire? Maybe a house in the swamp would be more fitting for a witch?
---
Make sure that you do not have any blueprints. When you move, you automatically blueprint everything. Make sure these blueprints are scrapped.
---
You dreamt it.
---
That's been his regular amount
---
No offense but that wasn't really my question.
---
Rubber Banding is the term for when the health regenerates, due to the game trying to calculate damage.
---
VATs Crits is a major effect, not a Primary/Prefix. So, again, what's your weapons Primary/Prefix? I.E. Bloodied, Vampires etc
---
Only once and it was the SBQ
---
I use mine mainly for my dailies to get atoms. Responders gear is a req for the level up daily.
---
Oh idk I changed the name a long fucking time ago so idk what the prefix is
---
maybe those are just soundwaves that the Scorchbeasts throw at us which we interpreted as sonic screams
---
thank you so much!
---
PA is easy enough to play as it is...
---
The bug with guns that use cores as ammo. Sometimes when switching heavy weapons back and forth, you‚Äôll pull out the Gatling plasma or laser and shoot a few times and it forces you to reload even if you didn‚Äôt have to.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too OP in PvE. The aim assist is nice, but plenty of weapons outperform it.
---
You gonna pay for the licensing?
---
I'm sorry. You laid out your reasoning for your spot and cited the fact that you were an RP'er. I thought you were looking for input about camp locations based on RP preferences, which I obliged you.
---
Wow imagine a multi million dollar company can't pay for a couple songs
---
So we are paying the regular armor butt hurt tax?
---
Naw there gonna do it with the money y'all spend in fallout 1st
---
Today, most of my front base was destroyed, 10 walls, and 7-8 other items. I had never seen such destruction to my base before... I thought maybe some super mutant wave or something but now that I see this... I think I know what happened. I was not afk though, I was doing events.
---
This is 100% correct. My bloodied commando build runs an AA FFR 25 lvc combat rifle as a primary weapon. Melts anything except SBQ thanks to the barrage of crits. Obviously a B FFR handmade would be better but I don't have one of those. Same with my guerilla build, primary gun is a quad explosive 10mm. Every other shot is a crit.
---
I asked for an opinion on if I should move it to the hill, not how you would do it because you're so much better at it.
---
well if were going there.. I prefer to call it the no skill tax..
---
Ah!! I knew you were talking shit. Beta player with a 4 Star Legendary... Nope!
---
So, just another reason to encourage having a nuke account then. Move all the gear and caps over to your mule, restart the character and rebuild as wanted, then move the gear back over.
---
I'd like them to make it so guns don't use ammo cos i have to keep finding and making and buying it. And then i have to carry it.
---
They did something like this about a year ago when they patched the system behind PA chassis which removed the parts from the frame and put them into your inventory.

---
Lol you thought.
---
Learn how licensing works.
---
Honestly either, they‚Äôre a pain for those who don‚Äôt have them, they‚Äôre stupid OP and ruins the game when people decide to use them
---
Oh. My bad then.
---
I'll see if I can make one when I get off work, and if I can I'll dm you to get it to you.
---
Okay, I see I offended you, and for that i apologize. As far as the hill goes, it looks nice, but the trees are quite dense. Maybe try and go there with an alt who can build and see if your house will fit before you commit to the move. It would suck to uproot the whole thing only to find that some trees will block the foundation. Space willing, it's a fine spot, very atmospheric as you said.
---
Walk in a straight line from one point to the other.  
---
Super easy to level up killing shit
---
I think the gutsy panic shot you, if i was a robot i'd be scared shitless if a thing like that was slowly floating towards me
---
You might be best off asking another question. Not because I won't tell you but cause I don't know them all &amp; it's not just my opinion.
---
You must be looking at the wrong sub lol
---
yeah I think Fasnacht and Meat Week are probably the best community-events so far
---
Just so we are clear, we are discussing the added dr, not the ‚Äúskill‚Äù of keeping health 2 so you one shot everything right?
---
This house didn't scream witch hut, to be fair. 
---
I like homes with a view, but also like homes that are tucked away. If it were me I would probably stay downhill.
---
Like I said imagine a multi million or even billion dollar company can't pay for a couple songs
---
food/water not filled up
---
I have a nice set right now but each day I roll for upgrades.  Was thinking about trying for all the creature resist ones. I did finally get 2 acrobat arms and 1 has ap refresh on it so I'm pretty happy. Lots of quality combos to try for playing full health junkies build! üëçüëç
---
ok let me know.  looking for the gun, too.  Will trade some pricey items that I have on me if someone is able to save me the time of running through the quests again with an alt.
---
Have you worked out the deets for this? Lol. Me and my crew are akin to smash heads. Hah
---
Nope, tried that.
---
That happened me, in the same event on a private server. I killed it and the mess was on the ground but no selectable loot to collect.
---
It would be nice if wearing PA would let you weild an otherwise uncarriable weapon, like something you ripped off an attack helicopter.
---
Yeah I'm still getting there. I'm about to do a redesign, and gonna go heavier on the fire and some other textures. Thanks for the input!
---
If anyone want to help me paint my PA with elder I can accommodate with anything lol I'm on PC btw
---
I like the old man. Mostly quiet and gives weapon case quests 75pct of the time. Actually got a tse lever about 3 weeks ago from his mission.  Nice little weapon I flipped for a bunch of ammo.
---
Get a clue
---
If you really think that they can't get a couple songs them why they have songs in the game in the first place, learn how licensing works o look at the wanna be musician
---
Yeah, he's my fave atm. I'm glad there's still a market for TSE stuff
---
They are, just have to die first.
---
Thank you. That IS part of the problem--I'm too much of a coward to uproot and redo the whole thing only to find out it didn't work out too well (I'm gonna do some light redesign on the house itself). I think the trees could work with my theme but only if I can in fact work around them. Finding the highest point might be hard too. I appreciate the input, so far the votes are for staying in the nook.
---
It's very simple. If you can solo the most powerful beings in the game, that's one thing. Maybe you should be able to eventually with a  really efficient build, a lot of skill &amp; time. 
---
If you can solo them and be able to take them down in literally a couple of seconds without much concern, then it's not that other effects need a buff but that bloodied (the build, not just the legendary effect) needs a nerf. 
---
It's not a popular opinion but it's the most reasonable &amp; logical one.
---
Ikr? Suddenly a bunch of us are going to be running around throwing grenades at display cases
---
I'm desperate for some split flap displays - I really like the one at Watoga and the station.
---
This might be a good thread to ask this in. I toyed with different Ally's but they wouldn't give me anything for days in a row. I went back to Beckett because at that time it seemed like he was more regular in giving me something to do. But then he hit a dry patch and for a week or two offered nothing. I decided to scrap him for someone else, and when I did I got a "quest failed" notice screen. I checked my quest line and saw nothing active or inactive for that name, I rebuilt Beckett, and a couple weeks later, still no active quest for him, no offer of one, and nothing in my quest lists? Ideas? I'm about to scrap him again and see if it gives me the same message.
---
How about buffing the existing shit effects?? There will still be meta but it might be fun to try some new stuff.
---
Since we are making suggestions I don‚Äôt want to repair my armor or guns anymore either. And let‚Äôs get rid of hunger and thirst too. And rads.
---
Ah, the things we do for fun these days.
---
Yeah it is gonna be supper simple im gonna send out the message later with the rules , how we determine winners and the loot that will be avalible
---
You can server hop to reset the glitch.
---
Why would the letters be in your inventory? Would make so much more sense to have them in camp build mode just like all the other letters
---
At least I know I'm not the only one lol
---
Ya, its a B+ prefix and people still want them. Win/win
---
Have a video where I kill a sheepsquatch and he just falls through the ground.
---
Ohh if you get the plan, you can max your vendors caps each day with ease
---
This happened to me last night. It was during a SBQ fight so I didn't want to relog. I read in another thread to hit "Z" from the map to bring up the menu, then cancel out of it. I was then able to click on Vault 76 to respawn.
---
I've had that a couple times. Seems to be when I give my ally something different to wear but I don't know if it's a linked issue. Scrap his bar, build something else for an ally then server hop. This worked for me
---
Has nothing to do with that. The cost of licensing isn't worth what they get back from it. Sorry sweaty
---
Sounds good. You know which day its going to be?
---
So you agree it isn‚Äôt a useful cap sink. Why is it there at all then?
---
Nukes you can launch without having to do anything but press a button.Oh and auto SBQ battles. you just get given the loot. And all the loot is 3\*
---
I carry a plain auto fixer into SBQ fights with my melee just to be sure I'm getting hits in on the chance she doesn't land.
---
No it doesn't effect the perks cards, which use your base stats. You can mitigate the stat reduction with class freak as well btw if you didn't know.
---
you lose the bonuses for the stats.. but you can still place cards
---
No, it won't affect that.
---
I'm honestly not sure what the -4 does in game.  Since INT affects crafting, hacking and scrapping, it doesn't seem to do anything when you aren't in your CAMP
---
Nope - you'll get to use that 15 int for perks. Anything else that uses your int score will be affected by the -4 though. Speech checks for example.
---
No. You can always equip as many ranks of cards as you have special points allocated.
---
The pvp mechanic is broken so while concept isn't bad, it's too easy to exploit. It's not a fair fight.
---
The game desperately needs a combat balance pass, let alone one specific for pvp before it makes sense to bring back pvp in any real way. Otherwise, it's just an exercise in futility &amp; frustration.
---
I don't roll that way bro sorry
---
If you play alone why wouldn't you use it? 20% less damage and 30% AP regen are both great to have. Still, up to you if you don't think it's worth it.
---
At least 1/3 of my encounters lead to disappearing corpses and loot.  Been going on before Wastelanders but is significantly worse since starting the new DLC.
---
It‚Äôs armor and or perks not calculating into carry weight while dead
---
Sure thing sweaty.
---
This is one of the main reasons I love it.
---
that stuuuupid respawn bug. when you die in a quest/event and cant respawn.
---
need to fast travel elsewhere and back... this sucks. if you are overencumbered you have to quit and rejoin! THIS is what i wanna patch!!!
---
So like did you think you would be cool if you added Yung to your name just like everybody else huh?
---
Yeah, it's a 50/50 chance that they're bulldozable. Usually the smaller ones disappear if you build on them, but every now and then Beth likes to make one permanent just to mess with us.
---
I'd settle for staying up 24 hours straight if I didn't have to listen to Daguerre's babble.
---
if you never team yes.. 
---
I run CHA @ 5 for Lone Wanderer and 1pt of Tenderizer
---
Do you not have the bug where every first shot misses? I love my bloodied but it got to be too damn frustrating.
---
I dunno, the gauss minigun looks pretty beefy.
---
You will throw away most of the named items you get from quests. I wouldn‚Äôt hold off leveling for a higher level on a handful of weapons.
---
I think it is a very useful cap sink for me.
---
 This game needs far more cap sinks as I ran out of things to spend my caps on. 
---
 I have already purchased every single plan from every single NPC vendor in the game.
---
 I find myself purchasing bulk ballistic fiber from NPC vendors just to keep my caps down so I don't go over the Max from people buying things in my vendor.
---
Word on the street is he makes donuts. Probably a static resource generator kinda like how the ammo machine / turbo fert work.
---
exp gained
---
I haven‚Äôt seen uranium fever pop up in forever ughhhh
---
With the Gauss rifle firing in VATS is buggy af, so you usually have to free aim, which I tend to do with a rifle anyway, so yeah I get that too with VATS at least.
---
I feel it would make a huge QoL improvement if enemies didn't do damage. I just wanna play my game without having to do all this healing and respawing. Maybe make them all squirrels.
---
Perk loadouts.
---
When you don‚Äôt even bother hacking, lockpicking, or crafting because of the inconvenience it‚Äôs a problem.
---
Int decides how much xp you get for kills, so yes, it helps if you are not in your camp :-)
---
you dreamin' bethesda nightmares
---
Thanks, I'll be home on the 27th, I'll be very thankful.
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too OP in PvE.
---
It isn't, not even remotely. Even a 10mm smg does more single-target DPS than a full auto Tesla. (No I didn't bother with any other comparisons, it hardly seems necessary.) It's fun, and efficient for clearing out groups of weak enemies, but not much more than that.
---
Ok sweaty.
---
Life Giver goes you more max health, so you would need 20% of your new max health. You would have minuscule amount more health than you did previously.
---
You'd think? Not tried it personally and we all no how quirky this game is.
---
can we also just give infinite health? I'm tired of keep having to heal when health gets low, and farming stimpacks take too much time.
---
For me, it's every time I log on for a new session. it says I'm overencumbered, but it eventually corrects itself.
---
This was my favorite CC content theme from Fallout 4. I hope this will be just as good.
---
They aren't terrible and if it's the best legendary you have it's better than nothing.  I used a 2 shot lever for quite a while and it worked well for me.
---
The biggest problem is that the effect messes up the guns accuracy, some weapons way worse than others. The extra projectile tends to go pretty far off course and you don't do very good damage if only one of them hits. 
---
If you use vats a lot then I'd start looking for something better.  For my lever I found that aiming down sights generally caused both shots to hit pretty reliably though.
---
It‚Äôs terrible. I got some diluted stimpacks and radaways for trade if you want to dump it.
---
You good or you special ed
---
They‚Äôre the best item to use for a pathway to an underground base, that‚Äôs about all I use them for
---
No worries not many caps either üëç
---
Here's what I use.  This character is bloodied heavy weapons with a focus on power armor use. However it has the skills and SPECIAL to use melee when needed. This character specifically uses fusion cores and ultracite cores for ammo so the batteries included perk is all you need for ammo weight reduction. It's nice not having to worry about the weight of ammo/explosives. If you prefer a different heavy weapon that's more ballistic you'll want to play with the perks. This character has max Strength so a melee weapon does amazing damage, so swap out the heavy weapon strength perks for melee perks if you're going to use a melee weapon.
---
Specific things to note: this character doesn't use weight reduction perks for heavy and melee simultaneously; it's either bear arms or martial artist at any given time. Because of this I tend to just like using Bear Arms and try to get melee weapons with the 3rd star affix of 90% weight reduction perk.

---
I go see him every Sunday morning and haven‚Äôt had any issues.
---
Same. Gives good room for a 3 star swap + Strange in Numbers if you group up too.
---
With the new public team system coming out very soon I think lone wanderer will be devalued. Will be so much easier to get a team and play together.
---
And what's with this whole levelling lark? Instant level 50 with premade builds please.
---
Confirms worked on PC. Mine didn't fly out of the case but was sticking out enough for me to get the pick up action
---
I just mathed it out, as it just happened to me again. What its doing is disabling my backpack chem mod, so my 200stims go from 20lbs to 200, and radaways factoring in too.
---
Survival was trying to do too much and not very well, I think. The heightened hunger, thirst, disease, death consequences, not knowing if the person you met would kill you or not ... all excellent in concept for a true survival mode. But the practicality is, it was just a slightly harder adventure mode that frustrated PvE looking for the equivalent of Fallout 4‚Äôs most challenging difficulty and PvP thinking everyone there wanted to fight all of the time. In reality, they needed Adventure for casuals, Survival for those looking for more challenge living off the land, and a true Wasteland Warfare mode that was dedicated to PvP with NW, arena fights, and persistent open world PvP danger, and no option for pacifist. Had they done all this right, we could be arguing about something else today.
---
I sell a ton of fusion cores for around 50-90 caps and no one buys them. I'd rather they change it so they don't weight like 3 lbs each.
---
Disease or mutation?
---
Your Rocksy wanders around the Crater?

My Rocksy went to some hut under The Vantage

---
An improved version of what we currently got would be nice. An option see if a player have: Leggenderys, for sale maybe?
---
I always skip the terminal part. I'm glad to learn this as it's so easy.
---
so how does that affect shotguns 
---
im a shotgun build myself and never heard of this magic 
---
message me if you wanna share some appalachian secrets
---
If you click a quest icon on the map screen you have an option to hide all quests but the one selected.
---
It doesn't. But it does have dimishing returns.
---
If you don't want difficulty in the game, why do you play?
---
Re; Let Mr.Fuzzy live!
---
Yes AngryTurtle post the live stream so you can check it out...    https://youtu.be/KQC3K6QI-2c
---
That's how I read it too. I was a little confused.
---
Maybe I‚Äôll pull it out of my stash and give it a second chance. I fell back to my bloodied lever action rifle because it was more reliable in vats.
---
Yeah it's not bloodied that's really op, it's sneak bypasses armor. The anti armor of the weapon and perks doesn't matter when you're stealth. Seen that online calc some guy made this morning, he missed it in his calcs. Was going to post that, but there's been so much posted lately.
---
It's nice to have aa when your running though.
---
better than hunter/hunted quest
---
The biggest difference I've noticed is the item health. As for damage it's more about perks and buffs than the actual weapon.
---
Yep same - i just make sure i meet one of the other criteria now. It joins the list of other things that don't work for it....like getting silo codes etc
---
Ok fair enough, but is it noticeable?  I don't think anyone stacks INT for experience as a build.  
---
I was generalizing, but I meant the difference from -4 isn't going to affect much outside of what you do in your CAMP (Power Armor, Crafting ect).  The 5 points in Gunsmith seems to be the norm for people.
---
The gauss rifle needs to be a power armor exclusive
---
If you want to keep what's in your stash, gather up all raw materials before crafting. The game takes from your inventory first.
---
Encrypted drop, fairly common, you get the mascot head separate from the mascot outfit :-)
---
 If you want to keep what's in your stash, gather up all raw materials before crafting. The game takes from your inventory first.
---
Responder policeman on responder fireman? if it's the policeman and you're on PC i'm pretty sure i have one you can have
---
I'm just getting to the point in this game where I can start working towards my SS set, but I haven't bothered spending any bullion on it yet as I am still saving up for the jetpack to get that out of the way. I know that you use the legendary modules to craft SS armor once you have the plans. Once you have all the materials is every individual craft action an RNG of getting a 1-3 star random SS piece? Or you you have to spend more legendary modules per craft to get higher star rated rolls?
---
He's prob talking about the Public Teams change re: flagging team mates into PvP.
---
Good news about strangler heart is you don‚Äôt have to buy the mods with bullion since they are ultracite mods. 
---
The bad news, the good mods are really really hard to get. They only drop from the queen and calibrated shocks and emergency protocols are super rare drops. We‚Äôre talking hundreds and hundreds of queens and you still might not have them. (Edit: sorry I didn‚Äôt see someone already posted this)
---
Also, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs intentional, but the strangler heart clips through some PA skins now, which on the right skin looks awesome. Strangler heart war rider is something to behold.
---

---
It can spawn 1 or two, it‚Äôs random
---
Tenderizer works only for melee? Or Ranged too ?
---
Not according to my Effects tab in the PB.
---
While I agree on the state of PvP, pacifist works just fine.
---
Does that give well rested even with an ally in camp? I bought it but haven't placed it yet because of budget issues
---
No, we need a gauss cannon as a power armor exclusive
---
Reckon i've done free range 30+ times and never seen more than one D:
---
Same for me
---
I think I'm just going to start a new character and try to transfer it over.  Thanks, though.
---
I think they should make it where outfits you obtain from quests are craft able after you get them. I wanted the responders jumpsuit and couldn‚Äôt find one so I made an alt and completed the quest line to get it. The very same day, after giving it to my main, I did the alpha wolf event and got the responders jumpsuit as a reward. üôÑ
---
Yeah I have gone askew with the direction of build
---
I read it as all damage.. it just says "attack"
---
Lots of vats cards in this - isn‚Äôt two shot kinda useless in vats cause the accuracy goes to shit?
---
I know they said it was a bug but the queen is already easy enough, isnt she?  Making her even easier to force into landing would make this event even shorter.
---
Could you please explain?
---
Wednesday starting at noon to 1pm EST time

YOU'RE FULL OF JUICE

---
Fixed it
---
TY
---
wish the outfit was able to be re-claimed from the firebreather vendor, i mean it makes sense he would sell you a replacement in case yours gets "damaged"
---
Epic. Ill be there for sure then.
---
What about the power armour then?
---
Remember 400 lb. stash?  Better before my ass...
---
If you click at the right moment after the first shot, you can make them shoot more than once. It does consume ammo with each shot.
---
Definitely. I'm not sure about this grinding gear either. Maybe just have a bot drop some off at my camp when I log on.
---
Max Per and CF will help with that. CF3 is bugged and gives +20% accuracy per shot, so he'd only miss a couple before he was landing headshots anyhow.
---
Ok thank you for being honest and ive chucked alot of my plans away and ive went from 360 weight with perks to 324 without perks which is a massive step, now im trying to find a home for my weapons
---
I've gotten the clean salt shakers, tins, pepper mill, reclaimed desk fan and all of those Teddy's/Mr fuzzys and scrapped them bitches so many times. You are someone's hero today
---
The two shot fatman I just got should be ok then?
---
How much caps do you get from completing it because I ended up with 3000
---
Got them all on two of my characters - the last one for one of them relatively recently. 2300 hours logged so yeah, not common but they do drop. I tend to turn in between 2-4 a day on average.
---
So basically it is a worse Water Purifier that costs 750 gold?
---
Unless its quad
---
Im on ur side dude.
---
If you go back to building in FO4, it's really *really* painful. I miss very little, mainly being able to pick up an object &amp; run through where it was. That allowed you to go through doors &amp; walls very quickly. Now if I forget to open a door when building...
---
Oh? Huh... Last I'd seen people talking about it, it sounded like they were saying it was a vending machine skin... which.. probably does make more sense, sadly. A static resource generator like you're saying would be far more interesting, but if it's an Atom Shop item, people would probably flip out again about it being "pAy To WiN.."
---
#MORE JUNK. FOR THE TRUNK.
---
It's not so much about the damage number as DPS. The Minigun has a much better rate of fire and better recoil.
---
I think that it should go, if you are flagged pacifist, you and things inside your CAMP radius should just take zero damage from players.
---
Oh, then I have no idea. I'm just basing it off reddit hearsay anyhow.
---
Ty for reply please consider supporting cause
---
take a look at the build they posted.. help is required
---
Do you have the Grounded mutation? Alot of people get it for the 100 energy resist, but forget it cuts your energy weapon dmg in half.
---
I roll my 3-4 a day and then recycle the bad rolls for scrip immediately, its part of my login routine, my main does nothing but purchase modules for scrip and rolls SS pieces (have my weapons already) while I transfer my trash legendaries to by 4 alts who then turn in for scrip and roll weapons with Mumbles to try getting some decent rolls. Have obtained many useful weapons this way. After a month FYI have 2 'great' rolls on the SS, two 'good' ones and one that needs to be replaced. its the new grind
---
Probably not. Its more forgiving on automatics.
---
Instead of getting a ‚Äúgood deal‚Äù on something every 5 days, you‚Äôre getting a more ~fair~ deal everyday. You can start developing efficient ways to farm materials with confidence that you will quickly profit from your work. 
---
You can then then turn around and spend those hard earned caps on another fair deal instead of getting screwed by someone else‚Äôs ‚Äúgood deal.‚Äù
---
Even plans for camp sign posts with pre-filled out text like "wanted:" or "Seeking:" that you could then fill out with tiny letters would have a much lower camp cost than spelling out those words letter by letter that  would be great and seemingly easy to implement. the only downside (besides the unnecessary cost) is how many times I see homemade signs at player camps with missing letters because they disappear into the object they are applied to so even then its not reliable. How great is it to have it still take up your camp budget but not be visible.
---
I tried making a sign near my vendors this weekend stating that I was seeking Halloween Plans but gave up after continually running out of camp budget.
---
Thanks! Upvote if you can so this doesn't slide down the sub. There is at least one bot blanket downvoting.
---
To be safe id watch the beginning of the video for the gun that rara finds, just so you at least know what the room looks like without spoiling anything else

Does this work for her party hat, too? I saved mine, but I want multiple display cases full of them.
---
But not everyone \*wants\* to play in a team. I doubt Lone Wanderer will lose any value for those people.

I make back whatever caps I've spent fast travelling by just, selling stuff to the train station vendors whenever I pass through
---
Lovers embrace is also 3 hours, yes. It has the exact same effect as kindred spirit. Just a different name.
---
Ah that‚Äôs a shame, could have helped out if you were on ps4
---
Yes. It gives it to anyone who sits on it for long enough, not just the person who owns the camp.
---
I would honestly love this so much. and theres so many places in both towns that could have an interior cell setup. They even have solo interior instances for quests, all the parts are there. I hope this happens
---
Yes time to take every workshop from low levels and now only have to fight them on their alt if they dare try and do something. Thank you Bethesda üñ§
---
And its bugged, if you drop below the health it gives you it tries to instantly replace it if the hot doesn't out right kill you.

Obviously for a workshop like the ammo factory you'd need something more challenging. BlackBerry Honey Crisps at least.
---
This is a very friendly and happy almost Animal Crossing style suggestion for someone with a Raiders flair after their name. üòÇ Jokes aside, though, as all corn soup in the game is identical, it would just end up being either completely random or a popularity contest when judging whose is "best."
---
But I wanted to hear more about this new effect.
---
Its all good man. Lol i appreciate the thought tho
---
Really? People babyraging over pvp is 10% of every thread.
---
They mentioned something about fallout 1st members getting bigger budgets in private servers
---
Ahhhh, you killed the self burying kind.... if you listen closely you'll hear some somber music in the background.
---
Two can spawn if you're lucky (or unlucky, given that it was on a low level alt in this case.)
---
Yes agree, we can not have gun control in Appalachia until workshop are friendly space for all.
---
I got one as a quest reward for forbidden knowledge a few hours ago. Not sure which one, but they are definitely still in the loot pool.
---
only once bandwidth is optimized, dont really like the idea of splitting input to more devices on a network since the servers can barely handle the information it already transmits
---
Let's not forget minimum of 4 pieces of Unyielding armor.
---
Everyone thinks it's so easy, go ahead and try to get the armor to compliment the build.
---
Happened to me yesterday for the first time, too.
---
Well, the goal is to have a signage system that is easier to update than manually spotting letters on a surface in the camp editor.  If B. comes up with a new object type that lets you store text data directly, that would definitely be better!  Best case, you build a sign, then activate a keyboard to type in a message that appears there.  But that's a new UI interface element that isn't used elsewhere, so would be more work to implement.  Thus it might be less likely to be built for a non-essential like a camp decorative item.
---
I was just thinking about how to do it in a way similar to items that already exist: display cases showing items stored in stash inventory.  Then B. would only need to make a new display case model (a marquee sign with space for a couple dozen letters) that only holds one particular type of object (marquee letters).
---
I agree it's not nearly as good as a type-it-in type sign, but it's considerably easier to implement by B.
---
Good to know, thank you. I'll have to make use of mine in that case.
---
Yeah xbox seems to be quite smooth and not... How this guy is describing it
---
I did like raider life but I change my ways, now want friendly times in Appalachia. Please support cause so all the nastys go off server. Thank you
---
There are some stuff under the mole lady's floor behind the gate that can fly all over the place. I just never put the time to yoink any of that shit
---
So I just published a post going over some of the language for you to read here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/hdybn1/future_fallout_content_should_stop_using_the_word/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I'm bedridden today, so it took about an hour and a lot of effort.  Essentially, not only is the word cripple an incredibly offensive slur, it's used to describe people with permanant physical disabilities.  Fallout uses the slur to mean "injure" describing minor injuries that can be literally cured with a single injection.
---
Its happening to me ever since i added the backpack mods from the settlers.
---
I would replace all the code to something Bethesda could copy and paste without fucking up anywhere near as bad.
---
True, assault rifles need to be banned!
---
(Because they suck)
---
Intelligence +10 ,charisma -4
---
It‚Äôs why I use the tent. i can set out with just over 100 in kit, drop a tent, get wiped by a random 50 + bat need to land at 76, still have around 120-130 pounds on me of armor gun and ammo, and pick up maybee a few junk items out of my bag
---
I love the idea. It would give people more of an insensitive to keep interacting with them when the gold quest is done.
---
I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs necessarily true. The BoS were founded originally as a group that separated itself from the US government. The scientists at Mariposa all said they were just following orders. Orders that, as far as they know, came from up top. While the BoS might not yet know that the enclave is the same group, this remnant shadow government that was pulling the strings behind the scenes, they very much do hold a grudge against whoever allowed those experiments to be conducted. That‚Äôs made clear in the holotapes of the conversations we have between Paladin Taggerdy and Elder Maxson regarding the formation of the BoS and its identity. Remember the whole, ‚Äúsome general or politician somewhere is gonna step out of a vault and start the whole damn thing over again‚Äù bit?  They know there‚Äôs a chance parts of the American leadership are still out there. We also know from the soldiers that we meet during the settlers quest line that MODUS, an Enclave AI, identified them as US Servicemen and contacted them. ( I forget the specifics of this encounter). I would imagine that since Maxson‚Äôs rebellion was seemingly public knowledge (to atleast some degree), given the fact that Lt. Taggerdy is aware that Maxson is a traitor by the time they come into contact, MODUS may be atleast able to deduce who the BoS are as well.The groundwork is laid out for them to go the direction of confrontation between the two factions if they want to. Idk if it will happen though, it depends on what the fallout of fractured steel events will be.
---
Should not have weapons anymore just make game for friends farms and food only please.
---
I find it pretty useful, although I've shaved a point off Charisma to use elsewhere.  I'm currently on four, three for Lone Wanderer and one for Travel Agent.
---
There‚Äôs a hotel in flat woods with a gym. The prison yard has weights scattered about. All the nuke silos have gyms near the entrances. Lucky hole mine with excavator power armor is the best spot though.
---
Yeah, it's specifically tied to the grocer's mod.
---
Yeah, I see that now thanks to the other posters calculations sheet. Thank you.
---
Now we just need the helmet! The gas mask version lol
---
Also it seems Stabilized don't work that good on energy weapon, meaning the current Gauss Minigun is not yet as its full power
---
This map should help, at least until the One Wasteland  update changes the way stuff spawns.

At level 25, you should be staying on the western side mostly and probably down towards the Ash Heap if you have already been up north to the Toxic Valley. Rose will take you to Top of the World if you follow her and for most, they get to this way too early since things can spawn there anywhere between level 15 and max. Best not to start venturing over that way other than short forays when its safe.
---
I've had that happen to me on PS4. It'll say I'm over encumbered at least ten pounds below my limit. I'm a pack rat, too. Usually reloading clears it for me
---
Caps have never been worthless for me, I don't have all the plans and recipes, and I've been playing since B.E.T.A!
---
Yeah it's hovering around 10. PC not PS4, but at least I'm not the only one.
---
Because I'd rather spend those caps on plans and ammo!
---
Agreed, there is no pvp but also the OC edited out that bit of his comment - will delete mine now
---
It's on the [roadmap](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/6uGykyguCRz6hvvNUhZ5f0/61fd56348e4350f5ca4eb3106752fd13/F76_2020_Roadmap_FULL-SIZE.png) for Summer.  
---
I'd bet on either July 4th or Labor Day, personally.
---
And what's with these damn quest lines? My new character should exit his room and walk directly into the gold operations center where a pallet of gold bullion gets dropped onto the scrochbeast queen's head instantly killing her.
---
Check dutchess.  It rotates Through her inventory
---
Dumb question, but does Raider punk give you quests too? I was thinking of getting him next. Just wondering how you increase Rep using him.
---
Signs are a good idea where text on them doesn‚Äôt count towards camp budget.
---
Only from the quest. The overseers one isnt supposed to be obtainable, itll likely get patched out at some point.
---
someone do me a filthy edit and include  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m\_cwHnQ7Xsg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_cwHnQ7Xsg)  on it for... reasons
---
You can actually get your account flagged simply by having a window names Ida - open.  Even a folder.   FO76 anticheat is incredibly dumb and hasn't changed since beta.  In fact someone even did a whole youtube video detailing it and how incredibly simple it is.  It doesn't even check for the current public hack.
---
I loved having bases with no doors that could only be accessed by grabbing a wall running through and canceling STAY OUT OF MY ROOM PRESTON YOU CREEPY FUCK
---
has it?
---
Sad face indeed.
---
I get it. Satire
---
I used to do this all the time in New Vegas with the Securitrons guarding access to the Strip.
---
I'd go way down the road and go into sneak, away from anyone who could see me, and snipe the convenient antennae sticking up off the shoulder and watch them start fighting among themselves.
---
I'll keep checking! Thanks for the tip!
---
I always run rank 3 LW, its a great skill. If i team up i swap it out for rank1 tenderizer, rank 2 supressor and  strange in numbers.
---
Don't know of others, but moving usually does the trick. Also make sure you aren't taking rad damage because that will prevent fast travel.
---
maybe as a friendly perk, since if your maxed out you have less reason to go there
---
I also threw all the stuff i wanted to keep into the vendor at 30k so no one buys its
---
That is elaborate and impressive. I was patting myself on the back for giving my camp a frog theme by placing frog jars all around. I also put a radtoad head on one of my external walls with a smoke machine behind it so it looks like he's exhaling a huge bong hit. I put up a painting on the wall next to my vending machines that has Lilly pads on and spelled out with letters on it "Welcome to the Smoking Toad"
---
PS. I also have a cultist basement in my camp accessible through a key card door and then using a magic bass to glitch under the map into a walled in space with a door that leads into the abyss.
---

---
I don't recall when I picked mine up although I definitely didn't buy it, but I did note that although it shows a helmet and face mask it does not protect you against the airborne particles or diseases.
---
I can personally verify that it was most definitively \*NOT\* fixed on the most recent ptr, as like normal I would strip down to the minimum gear for a scrap run, and was forced to Rez at 76 with less than even the minimum 155 weight. I suspect what‚Äôs going on is that one of the debufs  you get hit with is a carry weight debuf and you get the map options before it drops off. I have reported it so hopefully they fave fixed it since friday.
---
yes I‚Äôm being sarcastic. Given bugs that have persisted fom beta it‚Äôs obvious that they will take a While.
---
Why keep any of the mistress of mysteries quest items? They're garbage, and you can barely afford to collect in this game.
---
Yep I have seen this many times. Its more frustrating when you loot and it disappears meanwhile. Something must be. Its the second post of bugs that I posted and got down voted. Hope it gets enough attention and got it fixed.
---
That‚Äôs pretty well themed too, sounds cool! Try putting a radtoad mount right above a chair or a bench that‚Äôs against a wall. When you sit, your upper body will become the toad. I‚Äôve got that at my camp and don‚Äôt see that setup enough in the wild.
---
Actually there's a fix ask someone to send team inv or wait like 5 mins it'll eventually let you fast travel again
---
If you don't mind a new one, the Whitespring has it in the toy shop. It is a random occurrence since it took me several days to find it but was able to purchase it.
---
I found it in the overseers home! Use power armor guys!
---
There is one on or near a skeleton on the vault tec side of the bridge between vtu and morgantown.
---
What if workshops were places where anybody could build. like player built towns.
---
That shit was so fucked. This sub isnt chill, op is circlejerking or something.
---
THE HELMET IS IN HER CASE TOO!! GUYS USE POWER ARMOR TO GET THROUGH THE CASE AND PICK IT UP!
---
I waited an hour and a half, it didn't let me, had to abandon the server, I really wanted that SBQ loot too! I was in a team.
---
The terminals were useless to begin with.  They were intended to let people know when their dailies have reset and to provide an "in game" way of releasing news.  The problems being that dailies reset at the same time every day and it's easier to just post news in the notices when you log into the game.
---
How does bake sale competition work if shared space? This does not work with plan please try to support correct cause or PVPers win.
---
This does not mean that there is dupe method out. It can mean, and is more likely, that people are just seeing how the prices are getting lower and lower and start putting their plans to market so they get the best prices possible while they still can. People tend to hold on to their plans and wait awhile after events to get better price. But when prices start dropping people panic. Thus mass flooding them. Prices will always drop with time and/or fluctuate.
---
That would definitely work, but I think Survival Mode should still come back for those who do like PvP. No extra XP, no unique rewards, nothing to draw in PvE players. That way only people who want to PvP bother to play it.
---
Plus, it keeps them out of Adventure, where they would no doubt find a different way to circumvent it and get their griefing done.
---
Awesome, thanks. I'll have to check that out.
---
This post is so helpful. I'm still learning which cards to use and how.
---
No you need the person to leave a team and reinvite you
---
You have a valid point, but Ive even seen Deathclaw masks popping up for less than 20k. 
---
I tracked one account and they listed 5 different times with croc backpacks, all very cheap. Not saying he sold 5 times, but it is suspect.
---
Yeah wasn't possible, none of the buttons did anything, I had a respawn button, It did nothing, the game hadn't crashed as  I saw people still running around, and they could still launch my body with explosions!
---
I‚Äôve turned in probably over 200 at this point and I‚Äôve only unlocked the first BoS T-60 paint job. I thought a I had some how messed it up because I didn‚Äôt get that 1 till well over the 150th time
---
This is what I'm working towards. The perks I have slotted are for commando (automatic rifles) but can be swapped out for non auto or bow/crossbow. The nice thing about this build is with a bloodied The Fixer weapon, and an armor that makes you harder to detect while sneaking, along with the sneak perks, you're so hard to detect you won't actually need much damage reduction. I have Lone Wander slotted in, but if you're on a team, change those out for Inspirational and Strange in Numbers perks.
---
I put in the build the mutations I'm going for (but your mileage may vary). I don't find it necessary to use Class Freak but you might want to swap it in place of Psychopath if you can't handle the low strength from the mutations. Class freak does help a lot with AP management so if you don't use it, probably drop the Scaly Skin. I find the fall damage reduction on the armor pieces to really come in handy and negate the need for birdbones mutation, but I still like the floating fall. 
---
Weapon Weight reduction on the weapon itself isn't a bad 3rd star to look for as rifles don't have a perk to reduce their weights. However, the armors have a 3rd star where weapon weights can be reduced by 20% which can help alot when you have a couple of armor pieces with that effect. The effect does have diminishing returns which is why I stop at 2 pieces with the effect instead of looking for more.
---
This build is a lot of fun and does crazy damage.
---

---
This would actually be really cool. Maybe not all workshops but they could add some separate spaces where we could do this. That would be really neat. Multiple players could set up vending machines and create sort of a bazaar. Maybe some town defense events to draw multiple players in to protect the space from mobs.
---
That's what I tested: Quad with FFR fired as quickly as I could pull the trigger. Quad without FFR fired as quickly as I could pull the trigger. No difference. So I concluded that FFR is a useless effect on a crossbow, Quad or other. Maybe if someone had a faster trigger finger than mine it might make a difference, but for me, I'd not pay extra for FFR on a Crossbow or any semi-auto weapon that fires with each trigger pull. The only non-auto weapon I found to benefit is the Lever, which does seem to fire slightly faster with FFR. But I have not tested every semi-auto weapon as I do not have a FFR and non-FFR version to compare as I did with the crossbow.
---
Absolutely. The sooner I can get on with moaning about the lack of endgame content the better.
---
Spouse came across a camp three days ago selling a stack of 11 croc backpack plans for like 100 caps each.
---
Seems legit.
---
Because nobody is bying them masks. They are not worth the amount people are asking for them. Very, very few people want them as collectibles as they have no real value/use.
---
Diseased Vicious Wolf is my first child's name.  The amount of therapy I've had to pay for is outrageous.   Come on Bethesda.
---
I‚Äôve seen the Croc plan reduce in availability, meaning there are less in circulation. I‚Äôm still trying to get one my chances are getting less and less.. haven‚Äôt seen any for caps at all, just trade.. 
---
Something that has decreased in value are the two Western outfits, saw one for free last night in a vendor!
---
Power armor is fine, but with the right legendary armor, you can outperform it generally. It still has its place but it could use a buff, like adding legendary effects or some kind of set bonuses.
---
Yes! I'm on PS4 and will use vats to sneak. 95 percent option yet I miss. Now the enemy is alert. It's not accurate at all.
---
*Begins preparing itemized list of grievances*
---
Yeah no way they farmed them all themselves. If they did they should be buying lottery tickets.
---
Still on my hunt to find her but this thread is very helpful
---
If I remember right 1 point of int gives \~ 2% more XP, so a high int build with 15 int (hw for example) will gain 20% more xp compared with your 5 point gunsmith one. Exact fomulas were posted a while back, can't find it right now. 
---
If you use bloodied/unyielding, appropiate underwear, maybe +int on armor and food like brain fungus soup... we are talking about \~70% bonus xp.
---
I recently got one on PC while leveling an alt, if you're still looking.
---
I stopped carrying a billion pounds of stuff around and it hasn't happened to me since... Once I adjusted my carry down and stopped relying on the 90% reduced weight stuff it hasn't happened to me in weeks.
---
Also I know I said that the build is so sneaky that you don't really need damage reduction, and I often double down on that and swap out the Ironclad perk for things like fireproof (in case a car goes off) and aquaboy, because let me warn you: When you operate with so much of your HP filled up by Rads, it doesn't take much extra radiation to kill you. Aquaboy helps a lot.
---
My cha is 6. I use lone wanderer and field medic. And I swap out lone wanderer to hard bargain and travel agent when shopping. When I'm in a team I use something else that works with whoever I'm teamed with.
---
I run a bloodied build so yeah I understand where you're coming from.
---
The armor can certainly be a pain to collect, true enough. You can usually find basic 1* stuff at player vendors for about 1000 caps though, at least on PC. That should see you though to start with.
---
Keep an eye on the main trading discord, they are showing up there every hour or so, and most are very cheap compared to what they were a couple weeks ago. 
---
I have two, but I can't sell for the prices they are going at right now. Well I won't, I would just use em before.
---
Gonna have to try that one.
---
Someone choosing to be offended when some is not intending to offend them is possibly the biggest problem with modern society.
---
Looking now, I didn't realise one had been posted.
---
Display
---
Where is the black sheep??
---
I've seen many sell for 30k in a flash a week ago, not sure now.
---
I fixed it by switching from Bloodied to PA Heavy Gunner. Haven't had a FT fail since then.
---
Not saying that people should switch their builds, just saying that it seems to affect only Bloodied builds and if more people can confirm this maybe Beth gets an idea on how to fix it for those poor sods. It's most likely the insane amount of rads Bloodies have to sustain the low health that somehow confuses the engine.
---
If it added a free fast travel point for them that would be really nice. Sick of running back and forth between crater and foundation for daily quests.
---
&gt;And another one where you don't even get the respawn screen, you have to close the game down entirely to fix that one!
---
yep. came to add that one. where the camera just sits fixated on you, saying press A to respawn, but it does nothing. easily one of the most frustrating and prominent bugs.
---
seriously, how the fuck are these still around??
---
Community built CAMPs, no locking of resource nodes, its a free for all, first come first served.  PvE only defenses.
---
Age old CAMP problem solved.  Remove PvP from the game except for Nuclear Winter.
---
I like those and the Bass. Although the Bass is a bit more subtle when viewed from above.
---
That looks like a pretty solid build so thanks a bunch! I‚Äôm going to either use all unyielding or unyielding/bolstering armor, so strength, and really all the specials will be boosted
---
I know there was one but i dont know if he made it in any of my screenshots
---
I find if you into your aid menu, then straight to map, then fast travel it works..
---
awesome. only took almost two years
---
I thought i MIGHT possibly may be kinda sorta able to kill the sheepsquatch by myself. And then a second one climbed out of the ground and i noped the fuck out of there.
---
They now come from the Pleasant Valley Claim Ticket. A *lot*. In about 30 tickets trying for the Fancy pump shotgun, I got 5 western with chaps, and 7 plain western outfits. Kept 2 of each for myself and SO, then tried selling the rest of them off in my vendor for 50 caps each.
---
*ONE* sold in 4 days. Ended up dumping them at a train station just to get rid of them..
---
These were always a problem but seems more common since wastelanders. And no that one I wasn't on a bloodied build, this was junkies heavy weapons character!
---
Or a Main Battle Tank
---
Id had it last week where I couldn't respawn anywhere not vault 76 or the location of my death so had to quit
---
It doesn't as far as I know, there's just a diminishing return so eventually you're just shaving off an extra second or so.  With the right combination of buffs, gear and perks you can get your bar to full in a little over two seconds, I'm currently down to between three and four seconds unless there's lag.
---
Nevermind.  Found it.
---
In all fairness, the original power armor lore from fallout 1 specifically stated it had a power supply that could last for 100 years.
---
All travel should be free or at least explain to me where the fuck my caps are going when I travel. At least have it make sense and not be so arbitrary.
---
I'm gonna stand up in my couch and applaud you.
---
Its a nice fast route to run, especially for several of the daily and weekly challenges.  When you add Prison Break at grafton dam, feed the people at mama dolces, and the Escort steel heart mission (also in morgantown), and a locked terminal to hack inside the airport, you can knock out several of those dailys rather quickly.
---
When the kill mirelucks shows up As a challenge - theres about 10 of them near grafton dam.  Or the destroy liberators challenge (mama dolces)...
---
Bonus tip: theres at least 3 PA spawns And 2 cap stashes scattered across that loop, too.  
---
Happy adventuring :)
---
Where can I find the link to this discord? I‚Äôm trying to unload these caps on something.
---
That‚Äôs where I found my first one with chaps after a year or so without seeing one anywhere..
---
What's your setup?
---
Yeah I don't believe there is any one thing that triggers it. Not a bloody build, not wearing unyielding, and no weight related perks, yet I've had it happen to me twice this past weekend.
---
Yeah, I agree they are kinda pointless as they stand now.  I just expected the new Wastelanders dailies to start appearing there at least.
---
I was under the impression that the terminal news tab was there to provide in-game bulletins (as opposed to updates from Bethesda to players) for events and such, although I think all they ever did was put in a pointer to find the tourist for the camera quest.
---
It's unfortunate.  They could have done more with it.
---
True, but the mutations I included give a default -8 Strength without Class Freak. That comes out to 40 missing carry weight that a lot of people just can't go without :p
---
And as for the Armor, I HIGHLY recommend unyielding over bolstering. The SPECIAL stats being as high as possible for higher AP and maximum sneak. *Lean into the sneak.*
---
I get 700 at full health, use all the damage perks, the differences are night and day.
---
I can't believe I just watched the whole thing. Well done! :)
---
I‚Äôd love to have a suite at the Whitesprings which can be a reward for completing the main storyline.
---
Okay there's quite a lot there that isn't optimised. 
---
I was going to list what I'd change but mocked up something for you to work towards instead, take a look at this.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5d347cb&amp;d=pd2c72s12ii0ar2an2ao0lu2l71sg2pk2pl2pp2p00eu0eh1la2lt2a00a30a72ir2s01&amp;w=pg2ph2pi2&amp;m=c&amp;am=-152335--18223a-&amp;n=Bloodied%20Rifle%20Basic
---
I'd also add adrenal reaction, marsupial and speed demon mutations to that, at least. Plus you will need a full set of unyielding armor and a bloodied weapon.
---
*Edit - Don't mix commando and rifleman, get both sets of all the damage perks and run one at a time.
---
Feel free to change what you like, but the reason you aren't doing the damage is that your current build is way off on the damage stacking perks.
---
you know posting this stuff is how they take our vendors away. idc if they dupe them let em. then i can finally get one. but dont go starting no duper posts im tired of reloading all my vending machines and displays over and over.
---
I prefer this one but it doesnt work as well as it did in 4, its hardly useful in the light
---
bet this is fixed before actual issues that affect gameplay.
---
I like sneaking so I‚Äôm going with it anyways, but thanks for the info, making a full unyielding set it is :)
---
Wow!!!! Thanks for sharing. Damn thats so inspiring!
---
Enemy health rubber banding.
---
feel free, but dont put too much effort, most of those free floating item around 76 are not item but objects, so they don't function the same. But some are so we never know just by looking
---
If duping runs rampant, vendors will be worthless at the end of the day. 
---
They only removed vendors because duping was tied to them, now if you are saying the new dupe is tied to vendors, then yes they will remove vendors. 
---
Is the new dupe tied to vendors? Because you seem to know more than I do about this dupe.
---
oh wow what a bummer. i trashed all of those items because i assumed you can re craft them. not at all a huge loss but stupid and disappointing.
---
People bought mole miner pails in huge quantities with the caps they got from duped presents that they duped before it was fixed. It's very likely we are seeing the result of this. That's not to say that it's not possible that there is another dupe going around, but it's also possible now that the event is over people are trying to sell their plans before another dupe gets found and the prices drop too much.
---
I server hop west-tek, usually takes about 10 - 20 mins to reach the daily limit.
---
And to expand on that, if you're using Fallout 1st, the crafting system will pull from your Stash Box ***before*** it pulls from your Scrap Box inventory.  So even if you have 1000 pieces of scrap steel, it will break down any junk in your Scrap Box to use for crafting first.  Pretty annoying.
---
Brilliant idea. No meta. No legacies. Just skills and perks.
---
Crappy server. It also happens sometimes transferring items between friends. You pass them over, they are in your friends inventory, server crashes...they gone. It sucks :( sorry that happened!
---
When it wont work, I open my favorites menu and exit, then try again. Seems to work every time. Not sure how or why.
---
Thank you again!
---
How much did you spend? Please tell me no more that 250 each
---
if you cant replace them let me know i think i can make them all.
---
It could. 
---
I just used croc as one example though, many other items are crashing.
---
Yeah, I didn‚Äôt think that asking for a change to the way power armour originally operated in the games was asking for the world, I guess I should go to magical jet packs run on hopes and dreams vs. Fusion cores so I can go higher too.
---
Oh my god that would be a huge help! I didn‚Äôt have the recipes so they were my one chance at getting them
---
i don't know nothin. if i did i wouldnt say nothin. and dont go dming me wanting to know something cause youll get nothing.
---
Same with ally‚Äôs quest for me.
---
There's gotta be a sub for that.
---
Yeah me too for the most part. I think the issue arises when people check him multiple times a week, as supposedly that resets him. Is it bullshit that happens? Yes. Can you prevent it by just remembering when you went to see him? Absolutely.
---
Did you run in immediately after the nuke? That often happens right after. Normally I wait 10-15 mins after the nuke drop to give everything a chance to respawn but I‚Äôm sure someone on here probably has the exact response times.
---
They actually have two daily quests: Retirement Plan and The Importance of Communication. The system will only give you one of these quests (at random) per day. If you have either of those in your Pip-Boy's Data tab, then there's a chance you may not get a new daily as the one that was assigned to you for that day hasn't been completed yet.
---
Are you Italian btw?
---
Ah you are correct, I missed that part.
---
Ha that's a good idea! I'll have to try that. May have to rearrange some stuff. I maxed out my camp budget with my current design.
---
Beckett‚Äôs and Sofia‚Äôs questlines are unique where as the others are more generic. if I had to chose who is a better CAMP companion it would have to be Beckett because he has the Bar or the Settler Wanderer for the music. Sofia just complains about headaches all the time and the raider punk is always talking about lights in the sky or whatever the hell he hears on the radio lol.
---
Again, you do not understand the idea of downvoting or of the difference between opinion and fact.
---
I have the head - where do you get the body costume?
---
Ah. That makes sense. Thank you.
---
seconding this. Nuka and I dropped a nuke there yesterday, and waiting the full 15-20 minutes for respawns really helped bring the ghouls back into the zone!
---
Someone downvoted you, lots of salty people on this reddit, I upvoted you to counter it. 
---
They also downvoted me.
---
This unfortunately makes it impossible to say, keep The Importance of Communication open to force to give you Retirement Plan.
---
ill be online when i get home from work . gotot do my dailies and see if smily will sell me gold. whats your GT ill send you a messege when i get online i get home around 4:30 p.m. cnt
---
Someone downvoted you, salty people on reddit. I upvoted to counter.
---
I knew about that but I have both completed and i still get no quest for the day.
---
And people says there are no real consequences of dying. It's been like that for months. 
---
And that's how it works in real life. You die and instantly gain 100 lbs. The more you know.
---
Should be Action Boy, Lone Wanderer and two or three ap regen pieces.
---
Its starting to get pretty frustrating.
---
HavkGaming, thank you so much
---
Yes. I have also heard that if you‚Äôve been mean to her at all leading up to the raid, she won‚Äôt help you get in that room. Cannot confirm, as I was nice to the kid and she readily helped me. But yes, there will be a prompt.
---
Gotcha. Thanks.
---
Yess worked first try. Helmet didnt come tho. Only the firesuit and mining helmet. (Xbox)
---
Thanks lol but that‚Äôs the way it goes around here, i expect it at this point.
---
Same mods as what‚Äôs on the combat rifle
---
what does that matter to you?
---
Do dailies, I get a bunch of my scrip from those
---
Because you sound like part of the family.
---
You could build around a suitcase or toolbox in the world and use that. I'm not sure about loot bags though.
---
I buy from vendors. Alot of people have stuff at cost. Just buy and scrip it.
---
Silly question but you've actually gone to Crater?  Quest only shows up when you go near the settlement unlike most of the other dailies.
---
In case anyone is wondering, this also works on PC.
---
Anyone know how the actual numbers work?  I mean like the base refresh rate (XX AP per YY seconds) and how multiple additions are applied.
---
It would also be good to know if "+25% AP Refresh" and "+25 AP Refresh" (no percent sign) mean the same thing- perk cards list it one way, status effects list it the other.
---
That [Angry Turtle YT video](https://youtu.be/EA1Svkvpw6I) floating around (the one u/Daemoni73 linked) is helpful in general terms, but I'm hoping for the actual mechanics.
---
I wouldn't be able to do that at my camp though.  Unless I give them a location as the prize.  That's not a bad idea.  Thanks.
---
Still would like to know if there is a time decay on dropped items or if there's a way to place a "take-able" item in our camps.
---
The filter system that Bethesda would have to implement would be catastrophic and break the game.
---
I got rid of her gun because it got too low level for me before finding out about upgrading :(
---
Queen Fights, Encryptid &amp; Riding Shotgun...on a good day, I can have 20 or so crap legendaries for Scrip.
---
see you in a bit.
---
Sadly I did spend more than that... I thought 400 (some 450) was cheap enough bc I only come across serums that costed thousands. I bought bird bones, eagles eyes, speed demon, and healing factor
---
Not normal,
---
It‚Äôs inside of a green tent, on a hill that overlooks the Charleston Landfill workshop. The outfit is found inside the tent, honoring a grave.
---
Wtf did I just watch?
---
Seems to me the Power Counter is broken :z  
---
It always emit power instead of waiting for the right count.
---
How did you tame a single wolf whenever I try there‚Äôs like 3 or 4 together
---
It looks like my armor wasn't loading properly. Recently it's been doing a weird thing where it looked like it wasn't on the frame as I entered.. taking loads of damage.
---
Today it's loading at all times; tanking SBQ blasts n crap without issue.
---
Yay for Bethesda bugs!
---
i give away mine to a random dude in beta lmao
---
A vendor with stuff priced at zero. Seen it a couple times.
---
Got to run around where legendaries spawn
---
And even then you can swap it and use the charisma points for a team perk I guess
---
With a couple hundred hours in the game i've only encountered a few griefers. Worst case scenario you can block them and/or server hop to avoid them.
---
Literally just started the game, have probably 10 minutes total, with 9 of it spent inside the vault. How do I enable passive mode, and are there any downsides to it other than not being able to kill other players?
---
That shouldn't be a thing, you shouldn't be able to die, especially since you cant enter pvp until level 5. That said, report that guy, he is using a glitch to kill you!
---
Not the norm, but sadly happens too often. I started a new player and at L7 was blasted by a L200+ because...?...
---
Lotta angry trolling virgins right now, because the PVP mechanics are being changed, so they're taking their frustrations out on players whilst the skin on their winky regrows from chronic masturbatory habits coupled with friction burn from cheeto dust. They need something to self hate abuse in the interim.
---
I assure you not everyone is like that and right now it's a bit of a weird time. I don't know whether it's active by default, but you can turn pacifist mode on in options to prevent PVP damage unless you attempt to attack back (mostly). 
---
What you're saying though sounds like the explosive bait bug potentially, I didn't think you could be PVP until level 5 at all. I don't know the details fully but I know that item can detroy bases and initiate PVP potentially even when pacifist and not retaliating. 
---
If you die to something or someone like that, take heart that it is definitely NOT the norm, and relogging from the menu screen will likely put you in another world. I believe you can also block players from the social screen to prevent you interacting in any way with one another. 
---
I'm sure someone more experienced wil lcorrect me or offer you more info in due course, but don't be downcast, that's not the normal player behaviour from my and others experience on the whole. Best of luck!
---
Just no. Why is it when someone suggests a simple solutions for quality of life, someone suggest a fanciful overhaul of an entire system as grounds to dismiss it. "Let's make lock pick passive! I disagree, here's why... let's lock perk loadouts and keyhole everyone into rolls!" Get out of here!
---
Isn't PVP completely disabled until you are at least level 5?
---
Thought I remember seeing a notification pop when I hit level 5 saying 'you now can be attacked by other players unless you enabled Passive in Options' or something.
---
U cant even pvp till level 5, btw go into the options and tyrn on pacifist mode. No more pvp except if u take a workshop
---
I agree with you about the instansed pvp mode, but when you say that the majority of players have no desire in pvp, can you tell from where did you get the numbers to say something like that.
---
Did you do a poll or something ?
---
Is it based on this sub?
---
FYI this sub probably is only 10% of the player base and it is filled with entitled pve players that just downvote anything related to pvp.
---
Sort by new and you will see what I am talking about, they are actively burrying any topic about about pvp.
---
So this sub is just a big pve cluster fuck.
---
Also you can look at it this way,this sub is 200k users  and let's just assume all of them are active players,
---
Well this game sold millions of copies.
---
Yeah thats usually the first thing I do.
---
Oh how sad...no more asking legacies for a plan . Damm that blows
---
thank u !
---
Depending on system in game options. Not really. You‚Äôll get into many activities with other players, so it‚Äôs better to have it on and not damage them. There is other things that will make you open to pvp, but it will say so on the screen.
---
you immune to damage @ lvl 1 you are auto flagged pacifist. you not even eligible to pvp till 5 or 6
---
You can activate at it at level 5, should not be possible to engage in pvp below. He probably used some kind of glitch.
---
This is pretty much my CHA lineup too.
---
Oh i‚Äôm all for difficulty in the game, lets keep having to eat and drink, lets get rid of the explosive legendary perk on weapons and add an exp debt for dying.  Fusion cores dosn‚Äôt increase or decrease the difficulty factor.
---
That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm turning in all my automatic weapons
---
Yeah but thats half measure. She has damage resistance in flight, so now the fight is a recourse sink. They should make her land more if they are not gonna fix the crippling. Dollars to donuts they make her immune to cryo next.
---
raider punk!!
---
Yeah, I mean, Events are pretty much LFG for that Event and people still complain that some Events are empty of participants.
---
Maybe they were using a rad based grenade.
---
\*Mii music falloutifies\*
---
Of course they farmed them themselves.
---
It also has nothing to do with luck, it's the dumb RNG and the loot pool size the game can chose from. The higher your level, the bigger the reward loot pool. The lower your level, the smaller the pool. So, basically, farm the pails, move them to a low level alt, open the pails with that, done.
---
Not everything has to do with duping. Not ruling it out but in this case it's most likely not.
---
bullshit
---
Pretty much 1 of my 3 early must have perks (Action Person and Concentrated Fire are the others).
---
Appreciate that will start working towards something like that my best weapon is a suppressed gauss rifle atm but just basic damage
---
Oh shit
---
The mods you learn for the Combat Rifle apply to The Fixer as well.
---
Had a slocom Joe‚Äôs Diner in all my settlements in FO4!
---
Once you have a few levels under your belt and do SBQs and higher level quests and events you will start getting high scrip value items more regularly. One SBQ run for me yesterday managed to get 2x 40, 2x 24 and a couple of 9s...basically a days worth in 1 event even before adding the daily rewards from other events and quests. That 150 scrip scrap limit a day is a killer!
---
How?
---
I've had bags of dropped crap stay upwards of 3 hours, I'm not convinced they have a timer. They do vanish when depleted of content or if the owner is disconnected from the server.
---
Containers I'm less certain about. They definitely play by different rules(compared to how they normally are) after a player deposits something in them(it's key to transferring items between characters on private servers), but I have no idea what those are. I would err on the assumption they aren't reliable past a few minutes just to be safe, tho.
---
Right of passage
---
Step out of vault - get ganked
---
You know what? I'm wrong about the rep. He does give you quests but they are meh. There is a mothman quest but I've never gotten it. I thought It was giving me rep after his quests. You have to be at a certain faction rep to recruit them, but I don't think it's much rep. I got him pretty fast if I remember correctly. 
---
The best way to get raider rep fast is to do Blackeye - Mirelurk meat (Ohio river adventures location) once a day, then the  daily raider quest (importance of communication or retirement plan -whichever is given), and also completing photo opportunity (overseer's house, pick foundation and sell pics to kyomi at crater). That's three rep increases a day I think, plus maybe a random encounter or two?
---
There is also the rep glitch with Rocksy that is on youtube. It still works. I spent weeks and was halfway through neighborly when I finally caved, I'm sorry to say. 
---
If you split the gold at the end the rep doesn't get dinged as much so its less of a hole to crawl out of. I split the gold because I wanted the rep to be less of a grind.
---
The griefing community has ways around Pacifist.
---
This is also why they won't be missed when their modes of choice are finally trashed for good.
---
Do you have starched genes equipped?
---
I do
---
They was using a exploit with a specific item it's the only way they can harm you at that level however if you run into one of these people you can just hop servers
---
I was surprised not to see these news at the top of the feed, it's so unexpected to have Vault Boy in Smash xD.
---
Yes it's great fun! I am still the highest level player! They often criticized me for not going bloodied! But I eventually went junkies at lvl 340... we are often in a party of 5 or so, when the seasons start we should be back together again!
---
*UPDATE* it took a few minutes but I got the serums back somehow. Thanks for the support tho!! Much appreciated
---
I got them back! Thank you tho
---
Switching weapon and firing once seems to work for me too.
---
There can be two Sheepsquatchs, but there's seemingly no pattern behind it.  You could have 1 player or 10 and it never seemed to make a difference, unfortunately.
---
Yeah but it fits theme for me. It wasteland not organised capitalistic civilization with highly developed and efficient market.
---
Ha I loved my little place at the baseball stadium in FO4 :)
---
This is it.  Nuke mines/grenades cause environmental rad damage, which would/does cause death in low health characters.
---
That yields the tatterd dress which looks the same but isn't.
---
As another person commented, that was most likely a bait bomb. It's an item that counts as environmental damage (like when a car explodes or the like) instead of being counted as a player's attack. As far as the game knows, you were killed by some random explosion and not a player. 
---
If you're on PC there are other hacks I don't know about that may or may not be able to kill someone without PvP being initiated. I'm on PS4, on console there are very few ways aside from bait bombs to kill someone who's in pacifist mode- and as you were under level 5 you were automatically marked as passive.
---
That said, these instances are rare and more often than not, people will help low level players rather than harm them. Many of us who've been playing since the initial release have made an end-game hobby out of helping new players once they leave the vault. Just server hop when one of these idiots attacks you, it's not likely to happen again for quite awhile once you're on a different server from the occasional hostile neckbeard.
---
You mean my super OP food build is basically unbeatable now? 
---
Perfect. 
---
The Wasteland will fall before the fury of my Fritters. As I don my Bloodied Chef Hat, Apron, and pull out my gloriously OP Rolling Pin (3* Nocturnal/Damage Reflect, the most Broken kind obviously, I'm playing to win here,) I'll craft Fasnacht Donuts in mass, using my UNDUPED ^tm Cooking Oils, the likes of which workshop goers, hungry traders and general good clean folk have *NEVER SEEN.* 
---
Many will cry that I'm griefing. "How can my build built for damage and survival and my hard earned weapons hope to compete with you're raw cooking prowess and general Food Build superiority?"
---
And I'll just laugh and shove cobbler down their throats. You don't get to decide anything anymore PVP nasties.
---
Watch this https://youtu.be/iOdT8nXbDdo
---
Theory: Could this bug be happening when your health/rads are shifting? I.E. Regen Armor, but you're not at full health yet. Just taken damage / rads / Stimpack. Etc
---
üòò
---
I am telling you it is a combat rifle after other people have already answered your question
---
yeah, 11 plans with like a .02% drop rate for the plan. So 55k pails to just be at odds of getting 11.
---
Go to the stairs  and put your power armor on the side of the railing then get In it (see the legendary in freddy fears basement for more info on power armor glitching) the go through the wall by the stairs where the case is move slowly and spam the pick up button . YOU WILL GET STUCK AND HAVE TO DIE TO GET UNSTUCK
---
Hey, it just works!
---
It's not hard to make a few caps for fast travel... I think the 2 settlements at Ally could be free as a perk though
---
Not me, sorry bout your luck
---
It all depends on what level you are, what build/perks you already have compared to what you want, etc.
---
If youre very high level and dont have a bucket of levels saved up.. it depends on where the current toon is and how much it needs to change to get where youre going..
---
You have to do the ‚ÄúStings and Things‚Äù quest to finish it I believe. You need radroach meat, stringwing barb, botfly gland and tic blood sac. Might need one more, but I‚Äôm pretty sure those are all you need.
---
You are correct friend. This is the new way many of us have been preparing all our lives for. The food builds will enherit earth. The prophecy is now.
---
How can u live without bandolier....?
---
ill like level 63 I think, and im bloodied melee and want to go to bloodied commando
---
That‚Äôs absolutely not the norm. 
---
On the contrary, this community is generally considered one of the most welcoming and friendly out there. I‚Äôm actually surprised you weren‚Äôt greeted by a high level player dropping you stims, plans, and useful starting gear.
---
Whatever platform you‚Äôre on, I‚Äôm sure there are people on here who would happily help you out.
---
With how much money they pull in from cosmetics it‚Äôs not impossible.
---
400 is perfectly fine. Selling serums to a vendor with Hard Bargain 3 nets you 420 per serum.
---
im bloodied melee and want to go to bloodied commando, 0 levels saved up and none specced into commando directly
---
Nope. You can loot the corpse but the dress is no longer an item at that point
---
Yes it is. You can loot a new tattered dress and restore it at the fabricator.
---
Thank you please turn in all weapon at left and pick up kitchen utensils to right on the way out.
---
It's one of the strongest perks in the game, on par with Fireproof. Unless you're a stealth sniper that doesn't get hit or use VATS, it will be very beneficial.
---
Holy mother of christ....
---
I used [this](https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg) map to find random encounter locations. The red dots are the encounters that include tameable animals. For me, I set up my tent next to the red dot that's closest to the top right compass (&amp; right next to the yellow dot) and server hopped for about 2-3 hours until I finally found him.
---
I can't speak for the other locations, but I know for a fact that one works. It can also spawn faction NPCs for a small amount of rep &amp; the occasional legendary Sheepsquatch. As far as tameable animals, I saw a deathclaw, megasloth, mole rat, radtoad, radstag, &amp; my wolf. Oh, and for whatever reason, the wolf was surrounded by mannequins, so maybe look out for that? lol
---
Hope that helps!
---
no matter how you slice it.. adding new music is not going to translate into more money in zenimaxs bank account.. and thats the bottom line..
---
Yeah, gunna stick with it.
---
Nope . It's very limited to what you can get. Like you can't get every kind of mirelurk. I've only had a softshell. Only had normal deathclaws. You can only get sluggish sloths. I think bethesda should expand on this feature
---
Its just random. For about a year I turned them in regularly and found only one. I took a break for a few months while waiting for Wastelanders. Within the first 3-4 times I turned in the tech data I got two more paints. It should just happen eventually as you keep turning them in. Luck might help a bit.
---
IMO, not only worth it, but ‚Äúmust have‚Äù. What other expenditure of 3 SPECIAL points gives you more bang for the buck?
---
Lone Wanderer has never left my perk slots since I started my main.
---
Wait no I‚Äôm thinking of the veil.
---
I disagree, everyone‚Äôs seen wanting more and more free fast travel points, eventually everything will be free fast travel and that would be stupid and boring
---
I would name my dog Diseased Vicious Wolf!
---
you could probably do it easily by the time you make it to lvl 90-100..
---
so the question is.. spend the next 25+ ish levels dedicated to switching over builds.. or start a new toon.. ?
---
No I‚Äôm level 347
---
It's a delicate balance, but I don't have to switch:
---
Strength 9
---
Perception 14
---
Endurance 5
---
Charisma 3
---
Intelligence 4
---
Agility 13
---
Luck 8 
---
When I wear PA I swap demo expert out for stabilised.
---
üëç
---
Hmmm. I‚Äôve seen a technique where you place a short pillar in the center of a foundation and then the next foundation can be snapped into it to create a half high next level. The wood stairs can be snapped into the raised base to get you a mostly longer stair way..
---
I think you could get there in 20-25 levels. I switched from rifleman to heavy gunner at about the same point. I guess it depends on your balance of your build. Do you have like 2 pts in Perception? Or more like 6?
---
Every time I think about starting a new toon, I think about the slog of those middle levels trying to get to 50 and how much I couldn‚Äôt get done. I just can‚Äôt bring myself to restart. But it really depends on where your build is at now, and if the situation is dire enough that you need a clean slate to work with.
---
Yeah i gave up on this game again, stupid god mode bugs, stupid high DPS cheated weapons, legacy stuff making pvp a no go. Also the game play loop is basically the same as Raid shadow legends, do your dailies to slowly gather resources.
---
Also, did you do the rep grind for the factions already? Cause I know I wouldn‚Äôt wanna do that again if I did lol
---
Thanks is it the spot with the crashed vertibird in the pond?
---
But I think it‚Äôs funny when they do even if it‚Äôs irritating lol
---
There will be target areas on your map to find all those insects and you can travel to get them. But you don‚Äôt need to get them in the place they indicate. If you find them elsewhere it works fine.
---
I still have the dress and pendant, but I don‚Äôt know where, when or how I lost the veil. I‚Äôd like to obtain that again.
---
I've got nothing of any usefulness to add I guess.  I did have one day last week where the raider daily didn't pop up but the settlers and Davenport's did.  I just changed servers though and that fixed it right away. Doesn't sound like that is going to work for you though.
---
I started farming for the T-60 Brotherhood Paints in January of last year, because I did it before they ninja'd the drop rates, I managed to get every single available paint in roughly a week.
---
I know I turned in thousands of Technical Data. I wish now I hadn't learned them all and had just farmed the crap out of them.
---
It would make sense for the Wendigo because of there long arms but yah..
---
That sounds like fun except the parasites! Mine is less effort, they go in this room and then die
---
That's the one. Best of luck to you!
---
This so hard.  I love this game but I would stop playing completely before I started a new character and had to redo the grind.
---
The friends list. This shit is infuriating. Friends requests are broken on PC, names don‚Äôt display right from steam, and when people send me invites I have to add them back manually or if I get a team invite it pulls up the wrong name and I accidentally join a friends world... speaking of adding friendly manually when I navigate to the place to type it in with my controller plugged in I always have to enter their username twice.
---
Theres a static spawn in one of the tents near thunder mountain.
---
If i would you i would just slog through the levels and get your guy high enough to be able to have a super toon
---
Excellent! Much appreciated.
---
Better yet, delete the Tesla Rifle, add in the Tesla CANNON
---
Just make a new character if you're gonna have that drastic a shift. You might get tired of melee and miss the commando too. Its refreshing to start over and have both at the end of it.
---
I agree. PvPers are horrible people and everyone in this subreddit is correct in saying they are all griefers and worse than murderers or rapists. A cook off would be a good PvP replacement to promote positivity instead of allowing scum to ruin our game.
---
Yeah not sure what to do other than maybe contact support.
---
How about remove the Workshops all together and replace them with Faction Outposts. Half are Raider and half are Settler. They randomly spawn Public Event's that are Horde Mode, i.e. Line in the Sand, style events that pit the Outpost up against Mothman Cultist's, Blood Eagles, Super Mutants, Scorched, etc etc.
---
Whole point would be to build up defenses and keep the Outpost from falling. Upon successfully completing the Event players are rewarded with random junk, experience, Faction Reputation, Treasury Notes, and a random level appropriate Legendary.
---
There's more BOS stuff at Appalachian Antiques as well. Ad Victorium.
---
How does this look for my new master build. I didnt know if I needed all the Night time perks but hey there's nothing else better to spend the perk points on!
---

---
You can remake the garb o mysteries.and the weapon.useless though.
---
Pacifist mode is enabled until lvl 5
---
Also the Shower room in the Whitespring houses on the south side of the resort and IF you have done the quest, you can craft a new Garb of Mysteries
---
Anywhere from 250-400 is average price for serums. That‚Äôs not too bad.
---
Fact of the matter is that people farmed pails, transferred them over to low level alts and got the rare stuff by the shedload.
---
They weren't rare at all, they were just drowned out by the absurd amount of potential reward plans for high levels.
---
I opened around 100 with my main. Got zero event plans.
---
Opened 40 with my low level toon, got 3 croc plans. 
---
Next time one of these events comes around, try it yourself.

I started a new Character with Wastelanders and after 2 weeks of solid play I did the quest and realized I needed to get my main going to start earning faction and bullion.  I sit now at 118 levels on the new character and 299 on main.  So those dailies and doing events to get bullion leveled up the new too. Right past that 25-40 ish problem.  My main went from 272 to the 299, just doing main wastelanders quests and dailies/events.  I didn‚Äôt run around helping settlers, etc and I did max both sides of quests before choosing a side and have one of each.
---
I have 2 other characters 1 at about 100 and another at 148, but I don‚Äôt like the builds as after nerfs they are dead and hate playing what they are as you need to get another 25-40 levels to get all the perks for the new build.
---
Long story is if you can still have fun on existing toon and level I would consider it build up until you get all the cards, then do a switch.  My main can be about anything now.
---
For about a year now... so nothing to get worried about.
---
I'm sure it will be "fixed" in due time... though said "fix" might well disable combat by accident. Or all enemy spawns. Or the ability to login.
---
Ain't working. If I die in this scenario, i cant use the Button to respawn. I am just lying there, on the ground. Only thing I can do is restart the game.
---
Sheepsquatch day?
---
Yup that is what they did
---
I‚Äôd definitely take some cobalt  flux though
---
the "513" and "475" includes the 60 rr from the chassis. The chassis has been broken for who knows how long.

---
I got the marine helmet plans this way. Wasn‚Äôt getting shit with my main, made new character and gave all my pails for him to open and got it.
---
I've been that last person vs a full team. Ended up popping out of the bush next to them and dancing. They danced for a quick second and then proceeded to bludgeon me to death. Good times.
---
It happens about every 2nd time. Pretty frustrating
---
They are so nasty, like yes I know pride months but I'm sure those f words are deserved because they are the toxic player base and everyone knows it.
---
If you disagree with my statement please cite any lore that shows us that the BoS knows anything specifically about the enclave (not just corruption in the US government, military, or West Tek) at this point in the timeline.
---
The government, and the Enclave, are two very different things. Since we are citing 76, I'd also like to point out that there is ample evidence in 76 that even some of the highest members of government were unaware of the enclaves existence or meddling, even right up till the end (the enclave gunning down members of congress and other officials at the whitesprings)
---
Think about it.
---
"We'll let the dev team know, thanks!"
---
"We'll pass this along to the dev team"
---
"We're investigating this issue"
---
That's all we ever get unless it's a monumental, game breaking issue like mass dupe waves or combat being completely broken (good ol' DR250 "fix"). Everything else is either outright ignored or we're given pablum. Yay.
---
Just look at the mountain of fixes that Wastelanders and update 19 were supposed to fix. Yet we're in a worse state than pre-Wastelanders with just as little content (outside of new grind atop old grind).
---
From other comments I've seen there is a bug that seems to count budget when nothing has been placed, so I followed some people's instructions and scrapped my entire camp, did a number on my materials but now my camp only takes up 50% of my budget
---
 Need to get rid of "If an  item is labeled as "junk" it will be broken down automatically into the  crafting supplies needed at the time of creation." 
---
Greetings,
---
Thank you for contacting Bethesda Support!
---
**Please  be aware that we are currently experiencing high contact volumes due to  the impact of COVID-19 and you may experience increased waiting times  when contacting Customer Support.**
---
Crafting  supplies is pulled from your inventory, Stash and Scrapbox. If you are  crafting and do not have the materials needed in your inventory, junk  items meeting your crafting needs will be used from your Stash. If an  item is labeled as "junk" it will be broken down automatically into the  crafting supplies needed at the time of creation.
---
Thank you for your patience and continued support.

Best regards,

You are patriot and example for all. Thank you.
---
Ahh that would be great. Sofia gave me a weapons daily in the caverns, and there were like 4 Mirelurk Kings in there. I died so many times.
---
What they should do is have shop items or decorative items not take up storage space.
---
I watched the stream last night, it was hilarious! :)
---
You tell me... it's especially awful with high ROF weapons with good per shot damage (FFR Fixer). I can quite literally shoot a firefly, land 3 100+ damage shots shown on screen, any of which should have killed, get exited from VATS because the game registers a kill and said firefly just keep ambling along with zero damage. Or unload a full clip into a Scorchbeast with 25 shots (full clip), nearly half of which are crits... and have the health bar move \*ZERO\*.
---
I only glean light from your Glorious Example. All hail the Master Chef.
---
Hello, my name is Karen. I'm a mother with 3 children and I see that you said the word master. Master is very closely tied to slavery so replace it with something less rascist like first-in-command or boss.
---
Given the current buggy state of the game, I imagine we'll get at least 2 like last year.
---
Heck even Team based pvp in open world could be accomplished given the right tools. Bethesda hasnt given us the right tools though.
---
Like retrieve missions similar to the freight bot but with opposing teams also fighting against each other. Or one team having to defend while the other team needs to retrieve something.
---
During such missions both teams could simply be flagged as pvp for each other and thus not interfere with bystanders.
---
I actually think this could result in interesting fights to watch as an outsider.
---
Wish you luck. Game crashes on PS4 when I try to sign in now. Frustrating because downloading it all would take probably 2 weeks. If I have to I'm just not gonna bother.
---
*full health drains in a matter of seconds*
---
‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the bloodbug proboscis?‚Äù
---
I'm not sure what you mean. I am suggesting removing PvP and replacing it with something else.
---
From the moment they were released, yes. The functionality they claimed is barely there and has seen zero updates since release.

Happened yesterday during free range for me

My camp has been 1 cap away from crater since a few weeks after launch, and i want the tent so bad just to put it near foundation lol i hate going down there
---
Considering the pip-boy is vault-tec issue regardless of the equipped skin, it would kinda make sense.
---
It's happened to me once so far. Had to back out of the server. Iddly enough.....trying to make this reply to you I hit the post in upper right corner of phone one time and it says I tried too many times and try again in 6 minutes. Grrrr
---
Unfortunately, there hasn't been much of a community list detailing these "one-time" items.

This is what I can think of from the top of my head.

---
There's are more weapons &amp; armor out there (got tired of looking into it). You'd have to look into the Fallout 76 Weapon/Armor list to scope out a good chunk. Unfortunately, there's not too much going for some of these items other than collector's sake. Only a handful of these weapons/armors actually have a unique skin. Would be nice if they all had a custom look to them, for base decorations etc. Or better yet, these just unlock crafting options for the standard variants.
---
Great, glad it worked
---
*friction burn from cheeto dust* 
---
You painted quite the picture in my head.
---
It‚Äôs just a game.
---
It‚Äôs fine.
---
nah. It's just a game. By that logic, we should get jail time when we kill NPCs
---
If this was something that came out recently, then I would agree. But if this is something that‚Äôs been in the game for a while, I don‚Äôt see it is tone-deaf. It‚Äôs not like Bethesda can tell the future.
---
 If anyone thinks that this game is real life... maybe they need to be hit with a protest sign
---
I put this together many months ago, a lot updates since then so don't know if the drop rate has changed, but based on comments here it does not appear to have -

Ok to start off 99% of the community is amazing, seriously one of the best online communities to be a part of. Like high level players dropping weapons, ammo, plans, and all kinds of useful stuff for low level players. I‚Äôve only ran into 2 assholes in my whole playtime(lvl 100) if someone did somehow do something to your camp, theirs a repair all option that just costs some scrap but that‚Äôs not a big issue in the community.
---
thankfully
---
Firstly, i would call Bethesda a solid B class studio at best, secondly, Bethesda always releases buggy games. They have just traditionally relied on the players to mod and patch everything and clean up their laziness. The problem with this game is they dont want us modding it (for obvious reasons), so now the game isnt being polished by the loyal modding fanbase anymore and has to stand on its own shaky legs.
---
Brilliant idea. Maybe make some prize as well?! And how you gonna check for cheating (mutations, food etc)? Let‚Äôs make it happen!!!

Ngl, the thought that the enclave, the literal former government of the US, and the Brotherhood, the group that‚Äôs main goal is to collect technology, would trade in coal is hilarious to me.
---
Area chat is sort of annoying, team chat is a necessity. The discord link in this sub had a lfg chat, separated by platform. Currently, you have to tag an enemy for loot, but they're supposedly fixing that in the June 30 update. I don't know about watching someone build, I've never been into that. There are griefers, but they're rare; particularly since there's a rare set of circumstances which facilitate griefing (and they're supposedly going to fix those too). Watch out for people who use bugs or exploits.
---
Built above a pit or hole.. There lots of them in the roads....
---
Group chat is cool, I use a mic, and if the others dont answer its ok.  Not everyone has a mic.
---
What you collect is yours.  If you want to share, be sure to talk to whoever you are playing with because there isnt a way to force them to share or return something that was picked up that you wanted.
---
I collect junk to scrap all the time, but dont usually team up because if the area is cleared, you are safe.  If you are looking for safety from other players, I have only been targeted 2x since I started playing at launch, and both times I refused and they moved on.
---
If you are watching someone build, ask to team up and you can help.  I have never had anyone attack my base.  The only scammers I have seen are people duping weapons illegaly.
---
Welcome!  (Im RedKing on PC. If you see me, come on over, my base is in flatwoods behind the church where the vendorbot lives.)
---
Coal can used to power some of those technologies.
---
It‚Äôs not like they are gonna get more Coal elsewhere in the wasteland.
---
Nothing is perfect, what can you do.

Aside from that,  if you see me about..gt same  as username... feel free to tag along and explore scrap etc.  On xbox btw
---
Btw, items within a box are unique to that person who looks in it.. so you could see a fan,  i could see a teddy... unless someone has left summit in there for you then everyone will see it.    Items lying around on shelves etc are there for anyone to take and everyone can see it.
---
nope.
---
The world is still burgeoning with real life nuclear weapons in many countries, by all accounts we are only a software glitch, or a crazy leaders hairbreadth away from a real nuclear Armageddon.
---
By your logic this whole game is 'tone-deaf' in bad taste and should not have been made. 
---
You will I hope delete your Fallout accounts in protest at Bethesda's political incorrectness.
---
I always wait until there is a bonus xp or community event. Makes the grind a bit more bearable.
---
Every unique quest reward in the game should be re-obtainable indeed.  
---
What they should do is that once you complete the faction/quest chain for a particular region like the stuff in Ash Heap, or Raider stuff at Top of the World, the vendors will begin to have a chance of carrying extras of the unique quest rewards that also scale with you.  Stopped using your Black Diamond because it was low-level 25 variant of the ski sword and you're now above level 50? No problem, now the vendor carries it at level 50 that you can buy if you decide to get rid of the original one.  
---
And if not that, they should at least be put into the pool of event rewards so you can find them again, unless it's already like that and the chance is so minuscule you're unlikely to ever get it again, in which case, maybe the chance should be increased.
---
In a perfect world, that's what it should be, but I know Bethesda won't.
---
True words
---
Yep indeed they will
---
No. If people are offended by it, then I don't know how they get through life on a daily basis.
---
Check if the effects of the mutation are not supressed, happens sometimes when you  use rad x
---
They do stack.  You either are not low enough health or just not noticing. 
---
But it's easy to see.  Use a bloodied weapon,  then a non bloodied same type of weapon.  The bloodied will deal more damage. 
---
Also, cure adrenal reaction. Damage will decrease. 
---
All assuming you are low health.
---
This works, but WOW is it finicky. Worth it, though :)
---
No, in the game the protests relate to automation and robotics taking over people's jobs. If anything, the game highlights this very real issue that people will have to deal with over the next 10-20 years.
---
I love this game and I think the camp building is one of the most fun parts. But I don‚Äôt see that many people with mics, but when I do I usually plug mine in and they still don‚Äôt talk too much except during events. I‚Äôve never actually heard anyone say anything mean or ignorant, just talking about the game or the legendary weapon drops. Talking won‚Äôt make you annoying, I can‚Äôt even hear people unless my mic is plugged in
---
Wish it were like the fo4 build system.  Oooh, with sim settlements and snap and build mod as well.
---
Whatever currency they might come up with, it will either be new or collecting it will start counting after a quest is triggered. Think about technical data, which is useless until the corresponding quest is triggered. No need to worry.
---
Yes
---
Gotta be some place in the mire, a swamp would be a perfect place for a witch hut.
---
That is a stretch. Comparing shooting ghoul protesters in a game to real life protests about police brutality and equality? Give me a break.
---
I always see new players shocked with how helpful and friendly pros are when they sit outside 76 waiting to give new players plans and radaway, so this is a nice change of pace.
---
I had a glitch the other day where I could only respawn at 76 but it didn‚Äôt work properly so I was respwarned dead at vault 76 and it wouldn‚Äôt let me respawn a second time as the travel map acted like I was alive.
---
I had to quit the server and say goodbye to like 5 possible 3 star legendaries from a SBQ fight.
---
...tbh, I was just glad I didn‚Äôt lose anything out of my inventory.
---
It‚Äôs a mercy for the scorch that didn‚Äôt quarantine properly. Tho funny how a lot does seem to match with current events. At least it can‚Äôt get any worse ü§™
---
Me and My Scorchbeast crew dealt with this so freaking much, we'd shoot down a lvl 80** and then it would clip through the map or just flat out dissappear
---
This happened to me, i was like level 80 and managed to switch my character to a bloodied build at level 100. just be sure to farm xp with bonuses, like well rested 5%xp meat stew 5%xp and cranberry relish 10% xp, manage to save levels and choose perks wisely. üëçüèª
---
But coal with enough force becomes a screw
---
I think its annoying that you pay caps but the caps aren't pumped into the economy and since the vendors all share the same cap limit it just breaks the whole economy even more
---
Isn't it how everybody power levels? West tek, White springs and server hop.
---
Or even better
---
Get a friend, kill everything together (use strange in number perk, share it if possible) and then make him back out to main menu and join you again.
---
Boom everything respawn.
---
Works best on nuked whitesprings.
---
I have a second veil of you want it in xb1
---
I agree with this.
---
I'm still a low level (lv13) so still playing through the main storyline etc. Happy to add you so we can team up and wander around. I don't play with a mic though!
---
I didn‚Äôt think you could kill cheswick II! That‚Äôs very upsetting. I was so excited to see him.
---
&gt; Why do so many people have such a hard time paying a handful of caps to travel places?
---
&gt; 
---
Lazy new players. Fast travel to certain locations doesn't need to be free, hunger/thirst doesn't need to be changed, etc
---
I want this, but with Sutton. The Overseer should make good on her promise to make it her first settlement. It can be focused on 76 vault dwellers with player shaving their own home there.
---
Next time try searching a little around the mess and see if the loot text pops up.
---
I find that the game sometimes has the enemy explode from bloody mess but also spawns an invisible corpse that you can loot.  
---
Once you loot the invisible corpse it becomes visible...sometimes you can loot the pieces as normal and then thyou corpse appears...it‚Äôs a weird bug.
---
...I hate having to run immediately to a killed legendary enemy to loot the corpse before it disappears.
---
Seeing how popular they were I think it is very likely
---
Also I‚Äôd say reddit is the place to find other players that are into finding scrap and building camps. And for scrap the person who grabs it is the one who gets it, it does respawn eventually and there‚Äôs plenty of scrap to go around.
---
No problem mate.
---
He was like a little beacon of hope üò≠ I just found his lifeless body by the window he always waits by...waiting for his family to come home üò≠üò≠
---
You can do the same with the Hemlock chef. Just bring a few hundred radstag meat and tatos. Put both on the grill, then serverhop ... do this again and again. Even though you only get 3 scrip its still faster than Chloe.
---
Just as long as they're actual weapons and not some stupid-ass skin for a baseball bat or super sledge available only on the Atomic Shop. Bethesda needs to stop that shit.
---
"I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill 'em all!"
---
I also miss being able to have your weapon showing when it's holstered. Always loved having a bad ass blade or assault rifle on my back
---
Can you imagine doing that, the rep grind must have put the breaks on so many people ever bothering with making new characters again.
---
Me and one of my younger kids friends were bored(before wastelanders) and so I said "Screw It! Oregon Trail Time, no stimpacks, you can only eat and drink what you find and if you die you die." We went from the top corner by the lumber mill all the way to the Savage divide.
---
You'll receive the Responder Police Uniform after completing the quest called Final Departure.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen croc packs, but I am seeing bear arm plans all of a sudden. Most want 25-30k caps but I grabbed one today for 5k for my alt.
---
Probably a nuke grenade that causes rad damage, which counts as environmental damage and not pvp damage.
---
Or exploding bait which as cheaper workaround/bug.
---
You‚Äôd think as a quest giver he‚Äôd be a little less buggy.
---
Stick with the same toon and just level up more in my opinion. Why redo the entire story, gold and rep farming, plan farming, etc. Just keep playing in the endgame and change it up when you have enough levels saved.
---
I saw the first hour or so of the stream. It looked really fun. I like AngryTurtle's channel. Tons of good info.
---
I want to know more about him. Where is his family? Who does he belong to? Did they know cheswick I? Is this like a pet semetary type situation where he is cheswick i and was just reanimated? Too many questions
---
It doesn‚Äôt? I was saving bullion and flux to get it on there instead of PA
---
Hell yea dude. 6 in charisma is great 4 lonewander. 1 tender and 1 supp. Easy and works for pretty much any build.
---
Yes, from time to time. The PS4 version seems to be poorly optimised, as it also makes my dashboard/messages load very slowly too.
---
Morgantown/VTU is actually better way more ghouls
---
Edit: spelling
---
Personally I'd create a new one. It doesn't take that long to get to 60-70 and dial in your build, especially if you use a build planner and know what to pick at each level.
---
Plus, you'll still have your melee character for those times when you just want to go all smashy smash.
---
They still drop, it's a low chance, I've read someone said about 6%.  That seems reasonable.  I just finished &amp; got the elder paint last week.
---
Leather coat
---
There is information about his family. I've picked up plenty of notes
---
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty normal
---
Not the norm of the community at all.
---
Just someone with issues using an exploit that is being removed in the next patch to grief people.
---
It‚Äôs much more common for someone to give you a bunch of stuff.
---
(I like to give people a full set of upgrade armour (including a dense chest piece to protect against explosions), a shielded underarmor, a fully upgraded gun. (With 1-2k ammo) and random aid items.
---
It makes the game much more enjoyable as a new player if you‚Äôre not constantly out of ammo on your best gun.
---
Yeah it probably is :)
---
Supp?
---
Okay, ty
---
I add Charleston DMV to that route.  It is more efficient than even the golf club (non nuked) in terms of XP/Minute.  Westek is still king though.
---
A really cool idea for trains a while back was yo have an event similar to the power plant events where you (the character) is tasked with restarting part of the train network. Once the task is completed you can use the train to travel to a few stations along the line. This would be temporary of course.
---
It‚Äôs a vendor, at least that‚Äôs what the datamine said
---
Why?
---
Awesome!! Glad it worked!
---
Only the vaults should be
---
Scrap box
---
Survival tent
---
Free atoms
---
Damn!
---
I switched from rifleman to bloodied heavy gunner at level 50 or 60, it wasn‚Äôt too bad actually and I enjoy it much more. Now I‚Äôm level 100 and my build is almost perfect
---
Higher level enemies at whitespring and west-tek...plus added bonus of guns to scrap at West-tek for steel AND a seemingly higher chance of legendary enemies.
---
Hey, sorry this was your first experience. Not normal. Community is (mostly) very helpful. As others have said, lots of temper tantrums going on rn due to some upcoming (but good) changes - don‚Äôt think too much about it.
---
What system are you on? If you‚Äôre XB1 I‚Äôd happily make you some armor, weapons, ammo and stuff to get you going.  Made some cool friends a few months back who helped my fianc√© and I out when we were low level. Close to level 100 now and will happily pay it forward. Hopefully we can change your first impressions of the game.
---
Lol.
---
This is why I always stash my junk before entering camps with a bad vibe
---
Yea, the propeller blade in Edge of Tomorrow looked badass.
---
Oh snap, feel your pain, even though I dont like how it looks its a really rare item, hope you get one back.
---
It was a very long time ago....
---
player camps should cost less to travel to. ive often traveled to a player camp to by stuff from their vendors and i suddenly have 3 less caps than needed for a shotgun or some shit
---
Explosive bullets also work for this!
---
You only need like 9 levels to get the commando perks
---
I have at least one of all of the outfits now....including two Red Asylum dresses
---
Wow really??? What other perk card would you recommend?
---
Thats why the first serum i bought was  grounded. That 12% damage reduction is pretty spicey. So when its time to get sweaty ill just pop a grounded serum and im good to go for an hour.
---
The private server is nice too.
---
Nice camp decor
---
Or just target the body and kill them in 1-2 hits.
---
That depends on your build and damage output obviously.  Gutsy‚Äôs aren‚Äôt an issue for me...Encryptid is just a gutsy slaughter
---
You can buy most of the plans from other players who still have them but they're somewhat pricey, I normally see them going from 5-20k each
---
What perk card gives you 15% extra damage G?
---
Back in beta, I had lucked into two scout masks. I scrapped one intentionally to learn plans... Didn't of course. But later I got click happy and scrapped the second @_@.
---
And recently, i had two imposter sheepsquatch outfits vanish from my stash. I had obtained three complete sets ( one for me, one for a friend, and one to sell). I don't know when, or how, but two outfits have vanished from my stash. I know I didn't vendor them, drop, trade, or scrap them. -_-
---
I'm sorry.  That is simply not true.  If I was driving home and had to pee, and the most convienient place for me to pee was in your front yard, you would be pretty pissed off.  Or if I needed to run into the bank and only thought I would be in there a minute, so I parked in your car in when you really needed to make your next appointment.  Or if you were calling the hospital to get an update on your sick child and I just left you on hold till someone hung up because I forgot.  What if I just never replaced the headlights in my car and I didn't see you crossing the street? You would be upset because the impact matters.  Sure nothing was meant to harm you, but it did in one way or another.
---
Now imagine the final scenario happened.  I did hit you with my car.  You go home, and like me, you can't walk.  It's been weeks in a hospital of nurses and others talking over you like you are just a piece of furniture.  Your family doesn't want to visit you because they judge you for using a wheelchair even though your doctor has advised you that trying to use crutches at this point in your injury would only make it worse.  You find that, you can't get into your own bedroom, the door is too narrow, so you have to sleep on your couch till someone can come and help you.  You bruise your wrist trying to get onto the toilet in your own home.  You feel humiliated.  You go to make yourself dinner.  Your packaged food that has not gone bad while you were in hospital  and it is in a cabinent too high for you to reach.
---
Sorry that happened to you, but trust me that is super rare. Keep playing you will find many helpful players.
---
Actually they shouldn‚Äôt, simply because we aren‚Äôt dwellers of any vault except the beloved Vault 76
---
Awesome, I'll try it!   Idle Explosives, Play Time, Queen of the Hunt, Waste Not...am I missing any?
---
Dismayed, you push back to the couch to pick up your phone to call your girlfriend and ask if she wants to pick up food and come over, after all, she wasn't allowed to visit while you were in the ICU or rehab because the hospital didn't see her as real family.  Crying, she tells you she is breaking off the relationship because she is worried about judgement from her friends and family and she doesn't think that cripples can have sex.  By this point, you are feeling quite defeated and it is quite late, you decide you will have to order food delivery.  You make a few calls and find that, the few places that delivered to your house are already closed.  You realize you are gonna have to suck it up and go pick up food yourself.  
---
You push outside and realize you haven't been able to put hand controls for your car yet, so you roll down to the curb and hail an uber.  The driver says he will be there in 4 minutes.  You finally see a car with a little light in the windshield turn onto your street.  Finally salvation.  The headlights fall on you and the light turns off, your phone buzzes and tells you the driver has canceled the ride.  You figure, huh, that must be a fluke, so you try again.  New driver, 2 minutes go by, this time a red Suv with the little light pulls onto the street.  Ride canceled, your phone says.  You think  maybe, it can't be.  You push behind your car so you are hidden and try again.  This time the car stops, and when you roll out  you see the uncomfortable face of the driver.
---
Man youre lucky. My glitches include dissapearing of a whole armor for a while, thankfully only visually, when i get out of it, frame glitching out on the side while getting out, taking out an armor, and putting in place an empty frame, parts appear in the middle of getting in animation, getting in armor, but kinda next to it, as in i dont get in directly to tge armor when animation triggers. Everyday i fear im gonna loose some parts, i got around 10 full PA's and i live in constant fear...
---
been having the one where they just die out of nowhere in front of you and you dont get any loot. mostly ghouls, theyll be sprinting at you then they just flop over dead
---
LOL man I thought I was the only one.  I have hit ghouls at the golf club for 3500+ 10x in rapid succession only to see them live and my clip run out.
---
Suppressor i think its called, lower damage by 10% for 2 secs. Coupled with lone wanderer, dodgey and serendipity youll be pretty chonky even if you dont have the best armor. Just make sure you got your well tuned buff/food buffs and ur gtg.
---
Indeed.  It makes loot runs actually viable.
---
You transfer into his backseat with some difficulty as he taps his foot impatiently, it's only the second time you have ever done this and it is way harder than you thought it would be.  The driver awkwardly throws your chair in his trunk.  It was $12,000, insurance only helps with costs every 5-10 years.  You quietly hope it's okay, but you are too scared to say anything.  When the car pulls up in front of the one 24/7 diner you know, you have to ask him to leave room for you to get out.  He gets annoyed, but leaves just enough of a narrow strip for your chair.  You wait, looking at eachother expectantly through the rear view mirror for the longest 30 seconds of your life until you realize you need to ask him to grab your chair for you.  He does, gruffly tossing it down next to you.  "Those are my legs," you think, but you don't say anything.  He pulls away the minute the door closes, not even waiting to see if you make it to the sidewalk okay.
---
You roll the 80 ft through the dark street to the nearest curb cut, hoping, praying that another car doesn't come out of the dark.  You've never known that kind of fear before.  You finally make it, then the 80 feet down the tilted sidewalk.  Pushing with one arm, braking with the other, jumping over little cracks you know will send you sprawling on the ground if you don't land it perfectly.  You remember you haven't learned floor transfers yet, so if you fall, you're down till someone decides to help you.  Your brain on fire eith the burning sensation in your left shoulder from the tilted sidewalk, you swallow the lump in your throat.  You finally get to the diner and you finally remember that thing that has been nagging at your brain the whole time.  There are 2 steps to get in.
---
"Of course," you think.  "This business has less than employees, so they aren't required to serve me.  Thankfully it's 2020 and I have a cellphone."  You call the diner and place a to go order.  5 minutes.  Thank god.  
---
You call the line 5 minutes later and get the busy signal, you try again, still busy.  You roll back enough to see in the window that the cashier is having a very emphatic phone call, but there is the food sitting on the counter next to her.  "This could be a while," you think.
---
I figured it was intentional as staring into a campfire is quite relaxing.
---
Up doot
---
Wow, im still missing 2 leather coat s and 3 red asylum than, kudos to you friend.
---
I had an instigating swing speed combat knife with atom paint that I accidently scrapped.  Not a once in a lifetime roll or anything but I was bummed.
---
How
---
You spend the next 10 minutes trying to grab the the attention of various people going into the diner.  A young couple, a man coming in from a bar, a group of teenagers coming in from their theatre rehearsal.  Not one of them looks at you.  They just walk by.  
---
You finally give up and try the line again.  The call goes through.  Finally.  You try to explain the situation to the waitress on the other end and she says that she's swamped with all the people who just came in, but she'll get to you when she can.  You wait another 10 minutes.  You call again and when you get an answer she hears your voice and asks you to hold.  2 minutes later, you get an answer.  It's the manager.  He tells you that that's not something they usually do.  He'll bring you your food this one time, but not again.  He doesn't want you scaring his employees.  He brings out the food with a big smile on his face about the kind thing he is doing and then goes back inside.
---
It is then you realize you didn't bring a backpack.  You have no way to both hold your food and move.  You awkwardly set it down in front of you, push forward a few inches and pick it up.  You repeat this process until you are out of the view of the windows, for fear they'll call the police.  You eat your food on the dark sidewalk.  It's cold, but at least it's food.  
---
You remember that there are wheelchair accessible cab companies.  You google and call the one in your city.  You are greeted by a recorded message that says they only operate durring business hours and you have to make a reservation at least 17 hours in advance.  You decide to try to take the bus home.  You will have to go a few blocks on your own, but maybe you won't have to deal with the humilliation of canceled cabs.  
---
You wait at the stop for 10 minutes.  The bus finally comes.  The driver, disgruntled, puts down the ramp.  You feel the eyes of everyone on the bus staringbat you.  They're annoyed, it's late and they feel that you are forcing them to wait longer to get home.  You go to wheel up it, but you don't line up right and your handrim bumps the edge and grinds you to a halt.  You back up an inch to correct, but the driver has grabbed you and is manhandling you onto the bus.  It's illegal.  It's assault.  You feel humiliated, but you don't say anything.  When the lights turn off and the buss moves again, you quickly wipe off the one tear you let fall on your cheek.
---
"That'll Do.. "
---
And here I thought it was the girls doing the blocking
---
30 minutes of awkward bus glances and uneaven sidewalks later, you finally make it to your door and pull yourself up over the bump to get inside.  You go back to the couch and lie down.  This day has been aweful and humiliating.  By no fault of your own, everything has gone wrong.  You don't even want to know what to think about how interviewing for jobs in a few weeks is gonna go.  You open your phone to call your girlfriend and vent about the day you had, then you remember.  
---
You set down the phone and pick up your controller.  At least your favourite video game makes you feel better.  The new expansion, Wastelanders, came out while you were in hospital and you have been so excited to play it.  You log in and see you still haven't finished "Heart of the Enemy" from the DNA sample you picked up durring what you didn't think would be your last SBQ fight for a while.  You figure you might as well take the free XP before you head to the Wayward, so you pop into Vault Tec University to press that mighty h0pe4fUtuRe button.  This time all the ghouls aggro on you at once.  What a pain.  You take out 3 with your shotty  but the other 4 still come at you diving low in their cheesy lunge animation.  Then you see it in the top left corner.  "Your leg is crippled."  How do you feel?
---
This is how systematic oppression works.  All of these small encounters no-one meant to be hurtful add up.  Things that might seem small or trivial are part of a bigger system, all caused by people's often subconsious devaluing of disabled bodies and lives.
---
I have been disabled since childhood.  I had abusive parents that gave me dozens and dozens of brain injuries and just mocked me every time I struggled from them.  I'm now a 25 year old (till tomorrow) woman dying of dementia and I deal with these things every day.  I understand that it's difficult to understand and hurts to believe that a society that treats you well treats others so poorly, but it is unfortunately the case.  
---
So yes, people don't mean to be offensive, but it is completely riddiculous to say that people being offended by these actions is far and above worse than the damaging actions themselves.  In an era of facism, violence, and oppression, someone earnestly sharing that something hurt them is nowhere near the most damaging action out there.
---
Well, I had my first clownshoe. I labeled the vendor "LV 1-15 MESSAGE ME" and had the vendor turned off. Apparently, a glitch turned it on when I loaded in and a level 108 named "one80oneday" came in an cleaned out the handmades and the legendary that I had in there.
---
So yeah, I may end up scrapping this plan as a result.
---
So checking the market pages would be best?
---
I found the half suit recently and was excited!
---
Up ranking Rifleman, Expert Rifleman, and Master Rifleman from (each) rank one to rank 2 (each) is three perk slots and +15% Damage (30% to 45%)
---
Ps4 here too. It happens right when I log in but then when I check my pip boy and just look at items, then back out it will fix itself. But if I don‚Äôt I will walk as if encumbered for a min or two till it clears up on its own.
---
That sounds great. I'm running a full on Bloodied build. I have full uny/sent but it's only wood :( even with dodgy and serendipity the shitty defence of wood makes survivability a bastard sometimes.
---
Anyone you can take bets?
---
Oh you know what I have those! So you said the more damage I do the less tank killer will help me? I didn‚Äôt know that!
---
Well, ill go and give it a try, ty all
---
I would also allow players to pay for encumbered fast travel that gets more expensive based on encumbrance and probably level.
---
It would be a way to remove coins from the environment in a useful way and would scale up so that high level players would still get a meaningful ding to get that flux back to camp.
---
West Virginia dreaming my friend
---
Scrap box alone is amazing. Private server is great. You can take over power plant workshops and farm fusion cores to your heart‚Äôs content.
---
It would have to be honor system, unless the awareness perk card could be used to see someone‚Äôs buildout. Wouldn‚Äôt that be fun for PvPing. Maybe that could be a legendary perk, PvP awareness.
---
How good would it be to get a new Fixer or Handmade with the same effect as the Perfect storm?  I'd be thrilled.  Like a Perfect storm on steroids.
---
It‚Äôs where I usually afk lol. I‚Äôve never had guests though...
---
And today I'm offended by \*rolls dice\* Fallout 76!
---
Sadly it doesn't get a skin, but it's still worth getting that jetpack as it only takes action points and not a fusion core, you seem to be able to fly further too!
---
Hell yes betting. What good is sport if you can‚Äôt bet on it.
---
I would love one and am on Xbox.
---
Finally a cause i can get behind!
---
C'mon in the water is fine but a little buggy.  You can honestly solo the entire game with minimal contact with anyone if you want.  Just make sure you have pacifist on and you will be good to go.  If you enjoyed 4 you will like 76 imo.
---
Well your circumstance seems unfortunate. Crying about someone‚Äôs use of a word does nothing for you.
---
Yeah inventory loss is still a thing, when a bag dropped I've noticed guns or armor sometimes ends up inside it, thankfully my friend caught it for me!
---
[4.286%](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/chances.html?patch=P19&amp;formids=0050E3FB-0050E3FA-001B200B), but is conditioned on not knowing the recipe.
---
LOL this happened to me last night.  I at least did get rewards.  Had to force close the game to get back online and lost the great group of event mates that I had been fighting with all night.
---
thanks for the link!
---
I got the rare fireman outfit from the wolf pack event, thought it was junk and dropped it. After readingg on the reddit here, turns ouy it was a 0.2 drop chance or something along those lines, was pretty angry with myself
---
I feel you dude
---
Yes, the more you do, the less Tank Killer does because your raw damage value is causing the armour to do less. 
---
So Until you have 9 perks in Rifleman don‚Äôt use Tank Killer, even than Tank Killer isn‚Äôt helping that much.
---
HOW DARE YOU SIR
---
That is very weird. My first thought was maybe they built an underground with roofs that you‚Äôre standing on, then threw a switch to activate a flamethrower to destroy the roof on the ground causing you to fall in. But you still wouldn‚Äôt go through the ground that way. And the boards fell on you? They weren‚Äôt just placed above you, like, they were moving??
---
This sounds really cool! I‚Äôve never really met anyone like this through my play throughs and would love to bump into ya at some point!
---
Are you on PS4?
---
Yup, it happens right when I log on, too. Instead of reloading I'll just walk now. After checking. Thank you
---
Oh okay I see! I def appreciate the info I‚Äôm prob gonna make tank killer 2 stars so I can add one last star to expert riflemen!
---
Haha yeah how to make an OP weapon even more OP, why not.
---
Bethesda‚Äôs response, ‚ÄúHey, here‚Äôs a free Nuka Cola cap in the atomic shop.‚Äù
---
"single grenade." Not saying it's impossible but sounds like a bullshit sob story for empathy. "Here buddy, come to my server ill give you 3000 caps and a bloodied weapon! Don't let those experiences get you down!"
---
Now that you mention it, I had a lot of Scout mask for some strange reason and scrap ones and others dropped by accident not knowing they Were going to be so valuable. (Crys silently in corner)
---
My BE has tremendous damage with just the standard nozzle.  So do my bloodied ones. If I change it, the damage becomes shit.  I know about the barrel swap thing, but I've had the best luck with the standard nozzle.
---
Yeah give us a Megaton apartment style spot and we'd be happy as clams
---
Jackson Polcock
---
I used to happen when I ran a bloody build all the time. After I switched to Junkie it doesn't.  It has to be rad damage or something similar
---
This is a pro tip.  Friendly fire perk plus shiskebab for healing any friendly npc during events.
---
That vamp handmade is a great leveling weapon for low levels for sure.
---
It honestly amazes me just how much buggier the game is since Wastelanders.
---
Mine seems to do it when I have to change worlds a lot from not being able to put my camp down. It's only happened twice, but it is kinda annoying.
---
Does give me chance to wonder "what was I thinking?" with some prices and items for sale, so I can refresh the stock and clear out my stash properly, instead of carrying 400lbs of stuff on my back because I can't jam even one more lump of a fog crawlers eyeballs into my little vault 76 box of wonders.
---
It‚Äôd be a grind to respec ESPECIALLY if you don‚Äôt have the commando perk cards and requisite ranks already as that means getting them AND moving points.
---
You could a start a new character, give your new character a leg up with gear and ammo (and a fixer plan if possible) and go from there...still a grind to get to level 50 but less so (in my opinion).
---
Of course, to move items and plans across means either having a second party to hold them for you OR using a fallout first server to put the items in a container with your current character (usually a suitcase at a train station), leave the server, then immediately log into to a fallout first server using your new character (who should already be at the train station obviously...so make sure you‚Äôve got that set up).
---
It should log you back into the same server and your stuff from the other character will be in the suitcase.  It usually works BUT there is risk involved so maybe move a few items at a time...but it‚Äôs better to use a friend if you have one that plays the game.
---
Note: I haven‚Äôt done the above yet but plenty of people have without issue...but some have been unlucky.
---
same, I miss affecting the world in these large scale ways. The whole MMO thing still stinks. I miss building whole economies and cities. This whole one house thing is the lamest.
---
Harpers ferry is good if it spawns with super mutants.
---
If I one shot everything anyway I guess it doesn't really make sense to invest though.
---
Holy crap, I been doing that event for like a year and nothing has dropped, I guess its really that rare, Sorry for your loss.
---
I like this idea. Could be a lot of fun especially with a few people there. Placing bets too
---
If he is a brand new character it will take next to nothing to kill him.  (Or her).
---
You‚Äôre right, it sounds HIGHLY unlikely...but it is perfectly possible.
---
Beautiful.
---
I hate the inventory lag, especially whe. Selling or dropping items.
---
B2525 Handmade
---
ONLY if you play for more than 3-4 hours at a time. If you play for like 2 hours a day not worth it at all. Also if you don‚Äôt hoard scrap no. Private servers are nice only if you do a lot with workshops (i don‚Äôt really have trouble with doing public workshops though). I had it for 2 weeks and then canceled because I could only
---
play for 2-3 hours a day.
---
Just had this glitch. I helped my bf do the Foundation side of the mission so he ran ahead on my Raiders mission and killed some enemies further ahead. I think that's what did it.
---
Yeah but is your other participant willing? Your attitude (food build slander etc) actually confirms exactly what I said. Thanks you actually helped my argument. Now get back in your hole.
---
1,000 % agree.  I was confused when the first vault I found after 76 was NOT a free travel point.
---
Father Winter Helmet from Fachnact Event. It wasn‚Äôt considered a legendary like the other masks. It had a 1% drop rate and would sell for 30K caps easily.
---
Nerd rage.
---
Yeah, this really only appeals to the lazy/cheap side of me.
---
My base is down by Foundation, so FT to the crater always has a level of sticker shock.  But now that I'm getting towards late-game, FT is basically the only thing I spend caps on, and it's by far the cheapest too.  Now I find myself purposefully walking really far just to enjoy the map and finding new things I never knew existed.
---
Now, the hunger and food (while it does get annoying at times) would really piss me off if they removed it.  It would mean that I wasted several perk cards dedicated to carrying and finding food.  After lvl 50 it does t really matter since I have plenty of extra cards to swap out, but pre-50 it could mean the difference between an extra 30%+ damage or not having my extra food spoil and/or weigh me down, which is what I was opting for early game.
---
Since my incident, I know scrap armor from the armor modding option. Learn the hard way @_@
---
You could always build a camp on the road from Vault 76 to Flatwoods and put lettering outside that says, "Survival Training", or something.  I bet you would have all kinds of new players looking for tips and pointers.  Good Luck!!
---
I got a +1 strength 40 percent power attack damage and a random 3rd star (I scraped it I know I screwed up)
---
yeah 2-3 AP regen pieces does a lot, my bloodied sniper has all this and 5 Unyielding pieces and it's full in a few seconds. I don't know if stats from the unyielding gear affect it, though, but his Agility is like 32
---
That is rare but right now there seems to be a lot of extra turds out there trying to get in their last jabs before the update tightens up on the griefers. Personally if I'm by the vault and see someone new I give them some stuff to help and generally most others do that as well.
---
There is a rumor, that selecting the "Stay in this world" and then manually going back to main menu and trying again will prevent this. 
---
Havent happened to me again, after started doing that and not letting the game find a new world automatically...
---
There shouldnt have even been pvp in this game to begin with. It would have totally eliminated griefing and opened the door to so much more possible coup quests. Why they even waste their time with NW is beyond me, especially since so much of the base game needs tweaking.
---
Idk if it is the same for rifle, but I know for me I just have people give me free stuff in game when they see me. A lot of it being illegal items. 
---
The vast majority of the time I don't take it, but on occasionally it fits with my build quite well or the diver suite is just such a meme from the burrows picture that I wanted it. If I got banned/it got deleted I would get it
---
Although what other illegitimate items do I have? I am pretty sure that is the only one (outside of legacy items)
---
literally all that i'm saying is that nobody is forcing you to use fast travel. if you don't want to use it in certain situations, then don't. almost everyone else is fine with ft as is.
---
They don‚Äôt have matching roofs just FYI, in case that matters to you. The matching roofs come with the spring bundle
---
So.... avoid dying and file a ticket?
---
Check final render on yt that dude does like 90% build vids with tricks like your asking for.. And does acouple of things with wooden stairs he can't stand them having gaps
---
Just have 4 Charisma for lone wanderer...and swap out to 3 hard bargain and one travel agent when selling to reboot vendors
---
 Now that you mention it, I scrap the PA versi√≥n m√°s thought would get the plans to upgrade to high level versi√≥n,  but dos not happen -_-,
---
Glad I'm not alone and thanks! Yeah it has its place, and that place is an arena or map where the participants are ready and WILLING to fight and not just working on their CAMP, probably with Contractor equipped etc.
---
I love events like these minus the amount of ammo I go through. I also play destiny and I‚Äôm just a fiend for any cooperation raid type mechanics. But yes very frustrating.
---
Look at all the posts from people that are pretending to know something about the game.  Pretty typical around here.
---
Pretty sure he‚Äôs doing it for the XP 
---
More enemies = more XP
---
I‚Äôd love it if, like in ESO, you could buy a house that you can build in.
---
Ohh okay, thanks for the advice
---
If you find a long enough route no need to server hop.  Just don't log out in a place or it will spawn lvl one. (Game considers you level one when you log in while it spawns the location your at)
---
Because otherwise they won‚Äôt get their nocturnal lead pipe and fedora if they didn‚Äôt spend 5 minutes tagging it, duh
---
People get too excited and don't read the instructions. Lol. That event can be quite hectic and the ol' assaultron blast is generally a 1 hit ko, not to mention the gutsies armor piercing rounds.  
---
The ones are run are either really smooth or really rough depending on the group that shows up.
---
Negative.  I knew it was a trap house, I was able to access the first vending machine and it had 30 hatchets for 25k each.   So I checked the building more closely cause I was determined to wipe them out of the ammo on the other machine.  I got on the roof, nothing.  The building was near Whitesprings in the main road.  It was just weird
---
I'm a bloodied build and no one wanted to grab the damn pylons except one guy so I grabbed 2 of them and spammed my stimpacks like crazy, there was 10+ players there and no one wanted to grab a pylon. Bloodied builds have no excuse.
---
I used about 10-20 stims because like I said, bloodied build deal very fast damage so I dont want to see "BuuUTt I Haz nO StIMs"
---
Why does someone ask this question every day?
---
LOL on the railway rifle and the clouds.  That's why I switched mine to semi with gun fu.  It is great now though.
---
Oh I didn't know that. Yeah that's fine I just wanna get  the walls. Thanks. Btw how much will the bundle or the walls cost?
---
Pretty sure they were in survival if u weren't there u missed out on something that could have rivaled fortnite in toxicity
---
Wish you had that on video. I love camp building and like to understand how some trap camps operate. I don‚Äôt use them myself but it‚Äôs always good to learn new building tricks
---
Yep, check the market page.  Most are going to be 5-20k each like Tex said.
---
I miss the old sandbox. I definitely feel less connected to the world of 76. MMO's suck hard, I want to build cities that permanently affect how the plot moves.
---
it does not work on energy damaging weapons like the gatling plasma. Gauss minigun does ballistic damage
---
If this question gets asked everyday then why do people still not actually help the event. I‚Äôve failed more times than I‚Äôve succeeded because no one understands how it works or just doesn‚Äôt want to help.
---
You get nothing for failing the event though
---
Idk what fallout game you were playing that had that functionality.  Literally you could bring settlers with 5 dialogue lines to certain spots of the map that's it.  The wasteland didn't recover, there weren't suddenly more trade caravans, there weren't dynamic settling areas...
---
Literally the settlements had 0 function outside of some item generation and quest exp.
---
Let me build a base that actually fucking matters for once.  Make it ACTUALLY IMPACT THE STORY.  Fucking anything.  The fact I can't even build in the only real settlement in the game (Diamond City) makes it all even worse.
---

I‚Äôm 34 and a female and the last time I played video games before this year was 7 years ago and I didn‚Äôt play online. I‚Äôm so thankful I was always into fallout (I loved 3 and NV) because everyone is seriously so nice and if I had started playing COD or something of the sorts I‚Äôd be so turned off (although I do love gta, just don‚Äôt play online that much). Even NW is fun, I‚Äôve only been called a cunt twice and I play almost every day since December ü§ì
---
Some guy I went to had a normal looking set up but I assume he was hiding inside the house in chameleon.  When I booted up the machine he dropped a stack of punji boards on me.  Definitely not very creative. I kinda get  kick out of the trap bases but this was just lazy.
---
No way man, you are kidding me right, was it during a trade or did it fell trough the floor?

Wait.. you mean I didnt have to spend thousands of gold in ESO if I just walked to a way shrine to teleport...
---
I think there are a lot of people who don't know how to do most of the events, or they don't want to contribute and are only there to leech.
---
Dont they have a player name filter, Wouldn't it just carry over ? It would still break the game it is bethsda afterall.
---
I've seen bags that I personally dropped vanish in front of me hours later, and they don't automatically disappear when you leave the server (at least private). I think they're either on a timer or maybe refresh in sync with something else, since everyone claims they're unreliable.
---
It's a good start, a little rocky but I enjoy it.
---
Just keep getting the daily free atoms from doing the challenges, don‚Äôt spend any and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get there.
---
SSW of crater i nabbed a spot that you can just barely fit a lead and junk deposit into your camp radius. Found that a few weeks after playing the game and just never moved. Quit playing for over a year and a half until last week and i see no reason to leave haha

If you wait 10-15 min, it lets you respawn. Sucks, but better than loosing legendary loot!
---
lol @ ur use of ‚Äútrap house‚Äù, unless it‚Äôs got to do with a junkie build
---
Sorry to bother you, but my Google skills have failed me. I can only find info on the terminal to turn in the DNA, because apparently everyone skips that step even the wiki. 
---
Where is that terminal, all I can find is the folder you need originally. Please help.
---
Yep And the fucks i give. 0
---
Travel Agent needs another perk level that makes train stations and human settlements free to fast travel.
---
Or Bethesda could just stop using fast travel as a cap sink
---
...That was sarcasm. That was heavy sarcasm.
---
No prob, if it doesn‚Äôt work for u my bad. Lol
---
Add me and come on this adventure tonight or sometime soon. My psn is the same as my username here
---
You can travel between wayshrines for free haha. At least you know from now on!
---
I own all three versions of the PS4, so I'll break down my opinion on how each runs.
---
Slim seems to have the most issues, with the most crashes, more lag, more frequent frame drops. Idk if it's related but my girlfriend seems to encounter bugs more frequently than I do on my Pro and OG console.
---
OG console runs a fair bit better than I expected and other than an unrelated lan cable issue I think I may experience the fewest crashes with it. It loads in noticeably faster than my gfs slim but over-all frame drops and lag are about the same. Menus (like pip boy and the map) seem to freeze less frequently, but I've heard that may also be inventory related.
---
Now finally for my Pro. I use an external SSD with it so I get really good load times. I can pretty much load in to two different servers in the same time it takes my OG to make it into 1. I don't notice many frame drops except for certain instances like 20 people at the SBQ filling her with energy and lead, or Fasnacht when everyone is throwing explosives around for shits and giggles. It crashes more than my OG, but I also use it more so that could play into it. 
---
I always recommend trying to rebuild your database and clear out any unnecessary data. After that if you're still experiencing frequent issues and can afford it I'd highly recommend an SSD. It really seems to have helped the over-all performance of my system not just for 76, but for just about every game I play.
---
What if they changed up the Perk Travel Agent to instead make a list of fast travel locations free instead of the discount? I.e. Crater, Foundation etc.
---
This is hilarious. ü§£ i cant believe people are actually buying into this. I love the sarcastic approach, you show them foodies.
---
Yea I know this event is just SUPER frustrating and I‚Äôm sure there are people that think like that, so it was a comment towards those players not necessarily you
---
If it's SBQ or Scorchbeast, then usually fast traveling to Watoga Station delivers the lootable corpse right on you =)
---
Thank you, stranger.  Luckily, still have my veil.  Am on PC anyway
---
Anytime if you need anything else I sent you a friend request and chat message. Have a good day
---
Well if you put 3 luck points into bloody mess and 1 pt each in commando, expert, and master, then 3 points in tank killer you‚Äôre pretty much there.
---
Thanks for this. I made the scrapping mistake just a week or two ago and thought I was sol. This worked well though it took a few grenades.
---
Yeah, when this event first came out it was great. Everyone actually read the instructions, everyone went for a pylon anytime a conduit went down. Now you've got one or two people forced to take all three pylons and fight the sheepsquatch while 10-12 others hover around the outer edge of the event area refusing to do anything at all to contribute. Leeching has gotten really bad in this game over the last few months since wastelanders came out.
---
The Great Appalachian Baking Show
---
I never said I cry over it, I'm saying that the game could easily move on from shoving a damaging slur on the screen constantly and it would take little to no effort.
---
All great ideas.  No reason they couldn't be unlocked as true crafting recipes upon quest completion.
---
Oh I had expansions and a series of mods called settlers. The game really needs all that creative functionality to sing.(edit)
---
It seems silly that for all the cost to the game to make it MMO, it isn't leveraged in a very social way. Most c.a.m.p.s I happen upon are basically the same. With all the event joining I do these days, it feels more like Destiny (blegh). The perk cards also make the build choices more inane. I think I mostly like building and populating towns and micromanaging the decor. I also really enjoy tower defense. I'm well aware that most of my favorite features are impossible to implement in a balanced MMO. When the developer wastes all their time trying to balance and deal with the most cynical player, they make a cynical game. If I wanted a cynical game I could go back to living my life XD
---
Sorry but, lol, I almost drop mine too by accident because I had to many normal ones. Still Sorry friend.
---
I'm always stashing things in random places for people to find! Today, I stashed a bunch of chems and ammo in a mail box. I don't know why, but it makes me so happy to leave it there for someone to find. I'm on PS4 and check everything because I know I'm not the only one who does it! :)
---
Angry turtle on yt has a full breakdown on all the mods for it
---
Yeah but higher level enemies also = more exp. I might be wrong (I don't actually know the approx exp difference between specific high and a low level enemies) but I'm sure killing 5 level 60 ghouls gives more exp than 10 level 10s.
---
Proving my point. Saying the word cripple is a ‚Äúdamaging slur‚Äù is an obvious misstatement. It‚Äôs just a word. Should people use it as an insult? Probably not, but you choosing to be offended over using a word to define something that it accurately defines is petty.
---
Actually I'd prefer it quite soon into meeting them. As you level up with them you can unlock custom room designs, like how they used to do it in Fallout 3. 
---
I get we can build our own stuff, but itd be nice to get some detailed set ones.
---
The Tesla rifle its the only weapon that is used in combat because you don't have to aim you know what they should just remove it and people who have it should get a Legendary weapon
---
Forrest camo jumpsuit. Just did it today...
---
Quick hijack of helpfulness thread. as a solo player looking for help completing the tadpole/possum questline and need to revive an ally.  anyone able to help, or need it for themselves as well, will return the favor.
---
xbox gamertag - alexdepies
---
thanks.
---
As u/Kantusa said, Appalachian Antiques is a great place to find random Brotherhood items such as the BOS Hood, Science Scribe helmet, Welding Helmet, Brotherhood Lab Coat, and Brotherhood Fatigues.
---
As well as finding the BOS Scribe Hat at Thunder Mountain.
---
The rest of the Brotherhood items are all found from turning in Technical Data at Camp Venture.
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
If people are actively farming for legendaries then it‚Äôs not too hard to get.
---
It‚Äôs a bit boring though so I just look for events or slowly do quests I haven‚Äôt done yet.
---
Don‚Äôt get caught up in the fear of missing out on scrip, or bullion, or anything else...just enjoy the game
---
Can someone explain to me how allies work? Since Im doing the astronaut one  and all her quests are kinda the same.
---
I fucking hate campers/leechers that sit. It‚Äôs not a hard event if people work together. It‚Äôs the idiots who continue to hunt gutsies when the imposter is able to be attacked that frustrate me too. 
---
Ugh! Haha
---
Tossed dozens of scout masks since initial release because I didn't know they'd become a rare item. They couldn't be worn with a hat back then either so I didn't much like them. Still had one stashed when wastelanders came out though, so I didn't get rid of them all.
---
Hahaha salty PvP player detected, git gud.
---
I guess I‚Äôd lumped legacy weapons into that category, because 99% of them are duped.  I don‚Äôt really think of you as an illegitimate player, barring the odd dev room item or gift, but I have suspicions about some of Rifle‚Äôs gear.  
---
I seem to remember one of his videos where he had a fairly low level character decked out in a full Strangler suit pre-Wastelanders.  It‚Äôs possible he had people carry him through the raid, but the sheer amount of vault steel needed for the full suit would have likely leveled his character to at least 100 just based on completion xp alone.  He could have had some just give him the suit, which would be cheating since it was never intended to be traded.  I could be wrong, but I think it‚Äôs unlikely.  
---
I really don‚Äôt care, aside from the idea that players look to you guys for info and it sort of sets a bad precedent when a YouTube personality has illegitimate items.  It helps to perpetuate the idea that duping and cheating is acceptable behavior.
---
I scraped my leather coat by accident recently, And I sold a forest scout mask to the vendor bot way back when you could buy them from the enclave bunker.
---
I placed an imposter sheepsquatch outfit for a low level to find.  He put it on right away and seemed quite pleased with his new look.
---
Are u on Xbox?
---
I usually skip it when I see it now cause people usually fail it
---
Do I ha e to do it in the same session? I know I‚Äôve completed that in the past.
---
Nooooooo,  I recently got one but put it on favorite and still I have almost accidently deleted it twice with that option.
---
You know what, have a platinum. First time ive ever given someone an award. But you deserve it. Lmao
---
Makes the whole point of paying for fast travel obsolete
---
Don‚Äôt tell them!
---
I scrap and toss mine, really regret it.
---
Yes I actually just got it last night from scrapping!
---
I am swimming in caps. No.
---
People understand how it works. I‚Äôm level 380 and a bloodied build. I decrease my rads and have put on full troubleshooters armor but as soon as I take a pylon I‚Äôm instantly killed. No matter how many atoms I take. Respawn and same happens again. And again. And again. Why waste my resources when you don‚Äôt even stand a chance.
---
For the love of Atom, make another one please!
---
Oh really? I had found notes about #1. Didn‚Äôt realize they added new notes with wastelanders.
---
I haz a 3\* Junkies one o'they (don't remember off hand what the other 2\* are)...haven't gone Junkie yet, but I'm thinking about it...
---
haha i just never stay on a server that my camp won‚Äôt load into. Too valuable for dat
---
I just realized that's what's going on with me. These levels in their 30s are taking sooo long.
---
Not normal at all, as many people have already stated.  One of the most popular griefing techniques is to join someone's party, then they'll attack one of their non-partied friends which automatically flags everyone in the party for PvP.  You won't be eligible for this until you hit level 5, so once you do, I would avoid joining a stranger's party.  
---
That being said, there's also a lot of people here saying that what happened to you was BS.  I actually had this happen to me this morning while I was idling in my camp.  I run a low health build and while I happened to be afk making coffee, someone wandered in and lobbed nuke grenades at me to increase my rads.  He probably would have killed me if I hadn't come back when I did.  So, it happens, but this is the first time in 700+ hours of play for me, so I wouldn't sweat it.
---
This could have been among the legendary perks. Like a 1 point perk card unlocked vault 79 free travel. Also it should be passive not counting in the SPECIAL and regular cards.
---
Even worse. My 2 year old grabbed my controller for like, 2 minutes while I was AFK. I was about 2 seconds too late. I went back and saved the recording of it.
---
https://youtu.be/wRUabW6zyUI
---
That would be such a nice place to have a base, and so convienient for shopping
---
I love the one of the  roller coaster at camden park! LMFAO :D
---
That thing seems to wish to be deleted. Sorry for it.
---
What console
---
Omg. I forgot about that weird.  Always remember the cloaked super mutant leader in fo3 with that special one.  Bring it back!
---
I feel pretty sure there's mixed dmg in it, the gauss rifle get both Ballistic and energy boost from those beers ( ballistic bock and high voltage )
---
Must be the ammo interaction 
---
And yep Stabilized work on plasma gatling and lasers, just not as intended
---
An easy rifle starter build is double dipping into rifleman and gunslinger and using pipe revolver rifle and pipe bolt-action rifle. As both damage cards count for them, it is giving you a headstart in damage with weapons that are easily available. I started a new character like this with Wastelanders release and transformed him into a bloodied build.
---
With level 300+ I still use a silenced bloodied pipe revolver rifle. A sneak headshot from it does around 3.5k damage (without any boosts). You can oneshot most enemies, but some like mirelurk queen and scorchbeast need 2-3 shots.
---
my current build: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f446eb&amp;d=p02pd2pk2pl2pp2eh2eu0c72i82ir2la2l71lu2lt2ad2ak2al2an2ao0s01a00&amp;n=Pipe%20Revolver%20Rifle](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f446eb&amp;d=p02pd2pk2pl2pp2eh2eu0c72i82ir2la2l71lu2lt2ad2ak2al2an2ao0s01a00&amp;n=Pipe%20Revolver%20Rifle)
---
Yeah my first try took about six when I saw it moving slowly. Now I try the back right corner facing it and get it on the first boom. Your welcome! :)
---
I have to build down so it doesn't seem to work but I didn't know of that trick. I can see that being very useful in future builds!
---
Platform?
---
I think there are like 3 or 4 notes...I'd have to check my notes
---
They‚Äôre not lvl 10‚Äôs tho. Try it out you‚Äôll never nuke white spring again(jk you prob will) but ur not wrong abt the higher lvl/legendary guys they‚Äôre just so many more in Morgantown so it makes up for that
---
I'll give him a look. Its crazy we have to preform tricks just to do basic stuff
---
I was pampered with all the building mods in FO4. My favorite was the place anywhere mod
---
1. Scrip Limit!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It ruins the endgame grind by making you wait a day to keep trying new rolls.  It makes your stash weigh a ton holding on to crap you just want to scrip.  I hate the scrip limit.  The caps and treasury note stuff is minor in my opinion.
---
I think the way stash works is number 2 by a wide margin.  Duping, lost inventory, displays, etc, etc. It's just a huge problem.
---
The number 3 thing is the content.  They need to freshen things up and start giving away worthy rewards to all the big and small events.  This would really help people expand their horizons and try out some different things.  But why do it when the rewards are trash. Just simply adding in a few new items and pulling rewards from the purveyors loot pool would really be a good thing for Fallout 76.
---
4th floor bos terminal in the room that has the power armor station near a kitchen.  This terminal kicks it off.   You have to view the entries in the terminal... not sure which entries...
---
No that‚Äôs just a dick player he‚Äôs the 1%
---
Just finished it on my alt last night on PC. No issues.
---
Power armour has hidden resistances for Dr/Er and rad resist
---
I believe its 15% rad reduction per PA piece for a total of 75% rad reduction, and then the actual rad resist number is used to calculate how many rads you take
---
Could be wrong on the exact numbers, but thats how it works
---
I did that when I first started my rifle build, it‚Äôs a good idea to do it for when I start my bloodied one, I hadn‚Äôt even thought of that. Thanks for the info and the card setup is much appreciated!
---
100% agree
---
I know how to do the event its easy on paper..but it is bloody hard.  I take a pilon and get swamped by bots or even worse the bloody sheep from hell.  If you're lower than level 50 you just get hammered.  Think the event needs to be only available after a certain level.  I was following the quest line the first time and didn't expect that event.
---
And fix them when they die like we do our turrets.
---
Each craft is a 1-3 star chance...
---
Yeah, sorry but I'm not speced to survive the pylons nor do I carry a mountain of aid to make sure I can dope myself into invincibility. I've got 10-20 Stimpaks on my character MAX. I try to take even one pylon and I'm mostly spamming what few aid items I carry trying not to die. What I can do though is take out the ISS in well under a minute without anyone elses help firing at it if someone else has the pylons.
---
If I try to play the roll of Tank and DPS simultaneously I wind up doing a terrible job at both. If I'm able to focus 100% on DPS though, the ISS goes down as quick as any normal enemy. High health players don't have nearly as much of an excuse for not filling the roll of the Tank.
---
The damage the player takes is reduced by a flat 7% per piece on the frame, while the radiation damage reduced by 15% per piece, so a full set reduces damage by 42% and incoming radiation by 90%. Damage and radiation resistance provided by each piece is then applied to the remaining amount, making power armor the¬†best¬†protection against direct damage bar none.
---
Taken from the wikk
---
[Solo Encryptid ](https://youtu.be/HTZMHMd1wBs) 
---
I‚Äôve done hundreds....
---
Because the event is designed to kill bloodied builds.
---
Which makes sense. A lower level person would have a really hard time and also get killed fast. But I‚Äôm talking about the 100+ level people who DO know how to or at least SHOULD, but still don‚Äôt help
---
My main's camp is on one of the peaks of Seneca rocks and on the roof are 3 banjos. When exiting 2 of them you land safely on the edge of my base's foundation, but the other one drops you to your dead at the bottom of my base.
---
Though I only do that with friends who can refetch their scrap, wouldn't want to hurt my valued customers.
---
I haven‚Äôt failed the event in 6 months.
---
Only in the mire location. The other two spots will only spawn one.
---
Same here activated it when i was lev 50 awile ago i did know what the hell was going on lol
---
Well that explains why my rad resistance isn‚Äôt as good as it seems like it should be..kinda upsetting they put hidden values in power armor instead of just outright giving it enough rad resistance to not be misleading for other armor. I feel like instead of 25 rad resistance as a legendary armor effect it should be 25% or 15% so I can actually use it in a nuke zone.
---
I have similar ones I made before this on my channel! and I shall keep making more!
---
But when I‚Äôm level 103 and my 53 and 94 friends have to keep the event going when there‚Äôs 3 other 150+ people there that aren‚Äôt helping it gets really frustrating
---
it. You forgot the **it**.
---
When someone else tries to grab a pylon, I start yelling at the screen...
---
Uff,I feel you Man, so it wasnt just the 2525 that got lost in the process. Sooo Sorry.
---
These days I just grab the 3 Pylons and hide in the cabin roof, spamming stims with first aid and field surgeon equipped, I don't even care if I don't tag the imposter since I only go because of the quick treasury notes/fixer plan chance.
---
Isn‚Äôt that the Chinese spies during the war?
---
Just be a new lore or was probably just due to the event.
---
The English dictionary says they are ‚Äúrevolutionaries‚Äù
---
Yeah,  mine consisted of:
---
Sim settlements
---
Clean and smooth settlements
---
Snap and build
---
No build limits
---
Place anywhere
---
Uso..I think
---
Ammo work bench
---
99 settlers
---
Improved artillery
---
Modern firearms
---
Modern firearms damage reduction
---
Zombies
---
Resource containers
---
Immersive gameplay
---
Darker nights
---
And a few others I forget
---
I loved the mods.  Lol
---
It‚Äôs a sort of ironic commentary like the uber-patriotic cliches.  I don‚Äôt view that as offensive
---
Personally ive noticed that with rad resist it seems to reduce rads in stages
---
A shielded vault suit with 5 Rr, will take the 10 rads you get from standing in water, down to 6 rads
---
Then add on the 60 Rr you get from the lead lined mod and that takes that down to 2 rads
---
Sounds like a nuke grenade/mine and a karma syringer.
---
Just because something doesn't bother you, doesn't mean it doesn't bother others.  And it is damaging.  It contributes to normalization of dehumanization and normalization of dehumanization leads to violence and mistreatment.  If you ultimately believe noone should fire the gun, why make the bullet when you can make something else instead?  Like I am fine with you not caring, but I don't see why you think of changing it as negative.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure this is what happened to me, just can‚Äôt figure out where the boards came from cause they fell from the ceiling, yet I don‚Äôt see how.
---
Thank you I must have missed that one. I tried the rest. You were my last hope.
---
I'm on PS4 too. When I go on FO76 with friends I set up a private chat party on the PS system. If I'm playing as a lone wonderer I have the mic and voice settings turned off. However, I use the emotes to communicate with other players I come into contact with during my adventures across the wasteland.
---
That's why I just do my best to tank the pylons myself. Some of these players...smh.
---
I‚Äôm running stealth commando almost since launch, this is my current build:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f333fe&amp;d=sg2p02pi2pp2ph2pg2eh2c71ir2a70ar2an2ao0a12a00a30a51la2l71li2lt2lk2&amp;w=lg2&amp;m=051c2f8a
---
Wear shielded raider underarmor, a non-legendary the fixer and full shadowed heavy leather. In nuke zones you can use the stealth suit. 
---
Irradiate yourself until nerd rage triggers. This will give you huge damage boosts from adrenal reaction and nerd rage. If you have a bloodied weapon, this will boost damage even more. 
---
You can take down any enemy solo (including the SBQ) in the game with this build. No need for a single legendary item (though legendary weapons and armor will make make it significantly faster).
---
I mean at least some of the NW skins work on it
---
üòÇ
---
And I‚Äôm that video the Sheepsquash was actually staying vulnerable, but when I was doing it, the boss only stayed vulnerable for a couple seconds at a time
---
I don't think they can be traded.  Picked up a few and tried to move to a mule, no luck.  Tried to drop, but said I could craft a replacement at work bench, but dropping would scrap.  So scrapped it learn the plan, nothing.  Now I only have two on this character.  Dropping PA frame might work, but thought that was patched b/c of strangler heart.
---
Yep! Lost a three star Sheepsquatch in the Bog on Saturday to thin air. Just vanished before my eyes.
---
I think he's in the upside down now.... Giving the mindflayer some grief.
---
Yes and also the settlements haha
---
I have the same issue, perk card lvl 3 power smith, all materials, I have the plan unlocked and red rocket jet pack is grayed out on crafting. In fact, all my armors with jet pack learned is grayed out.
---
It‚Äôs seems like they just forgot to include ultracite armor in the earlier PA skin packs, all of them from wastelanders on seem to apply to all PA sets.  But I agree how hard could it be to change that nuance.
---
I think they go to build mode and just drop them on you.
---
It's the most difficult event that gets triggered unexpectedly.  I've seen 3-4 people in the 3-400 level range get battered over and over again.  I tried helping by taking out bots, but even that was hard.
---
Definitely submit a support ticket. I had only heard of people losing weapons at Radiation Rumble. Wow.
---
As far as I can tell, it's because explosive bait deals its damage in two stages. If you look at it in your pipboy, it lists its damage as only 1 single point of damage, but it obviously does a lot more damage than this.
---
That's because the rest of the damage seems to count as environmental damage. So only that 1 point of damage is negated due to pacifist, and the rest of it deals full damage.
---
Because they‚Äôre going to die and I have to grab the pylon to replace them.
---
Yeah, I guess if you're launching a nuke. But I feel like even if you prep before going into the silo and speed through it you'll probably still earn more exp just repeatedly running West Tek and server hopping with far less effort involved. It's boring, but efficient.
---
I've been to a nuked Morgantown (someone else's launch, not my own) a few times and never find that many enemies. Not sure if it's just really bad luck/poor timing or what.
---
At this point the only time I launch a nuke is when I want to goof around and kill the SBQ. I've got so much stable flux and my camp is 3 caps away from West Tek so there's not really much for me in the nuke zones anymore lol.
---
The prototype skin (yellow) is very nice yet somehow I‚Äôve only seen one guy wearing it. I constantly run into people just to stand right in front of me to take a closer look at it lol.
---
I‚Äôm using a shielded bos jumpsuit and I have two SS pieces with 25 rad resistance plus rad shield and glowing blood packs and it still barely keeps me alive in a nuke zone which I think is dumb..especially because for an extra 260 resistance that drops to &lt;1 rad a sec with hazmat which leads me to believe it also has hidden stats.
---
Awe shucks üíú
---
Too bad the daily atoms will be gone a week from tomorrow. Gotta cash in while you can.
---
Going back in 76 to explore and hang out in your room would be awesome.
---
Yeah,  people that don't help annoy me.  I mean I tried my best at level 50 and when level 400 people are doing feck all and sitting there watching...arrgh
---
The pylons stays attached to them after they die in my experience. I often have to get all 3 but will have to die a couple times in the process
---
I run solo way more often than I‚Äôm on a team, so - 
---
 3 charisma
---
2x lone wander and 1x Tenderizer.
---
You get better pricing at vendors with higher charisma, but thats what hard bargain3, booze and grape mentats are for :)
---
This what makes Fallout good and entertaining!
---
Literally made my day. Lol.
---
Me too, I was hoping somebody could explain it.  I don‚Äôt have an issue with them, if your really want my useless junk go crazy, I think the only thing of value was I had one stable blue flux.  I was able to get everything back I lost doing a run through Fort Defiance.
---
I know how you feel. Ive managed to break both fo4 and skyrim lol I think its the amount of 4k retexure mods I use
---
I grab all three...then sit in her face until she‚Äôs dead.
---
I‚Äôm done so many of that event that I have 19 Fixer plans in inventory....and I‚Äôve sold dozens more.
---
I couldn‚Äôt get in for days.   I just loaded another game. After about an hour I could load into FO76. I swear you have to ‚Äúremind‚Äù the PS that it knows how to connect to a game
---
Explosive bait kills through passive.
---
Why is someone downvoting all your comments? Lmao
---
That's a really popular spot. I think "they" know already
---
You probably saw/heard the floor beneath your feet being destroyed by a flame trap. And you fell into a pit of punji
---
My record is 12 events in an hour and a half.
---
Just you?  üòÅ
---
Even boring npcs add a bit more realism to the game.  Not everyone in life is interesting.. I've met some reeealy boring people.
---
Pacifist mode is enabled automatically til level 5. The most likely scenario is that this player was hit with a nuke mine or explosive bait. Probably explosive bait at any rate.
---
I cant remember where i read it, but im sure the hazmat suit and chinese stealth armour just reduce the rad damage regardless, so the 1000rr it shows, is just for a show
---
Happily be proven wrong though if someone has more info
---
You should be a fast travel point
---
Foundation is a bit bland. I do wish we'd see some raider v settler battles in the wastes
---
Cool story you‚Äôre not the majority
---
It would be cool but they would probably change the vault since 76 is the starter point and in the lore of 76 they cut off the air and power.
---
Explosive bait kills through pacifist.
---
You have got to go

It‚Äôs not just bloodied. My hubby runs full health and has FT issues as well

3 Star BE Handmade

Hit up the market sub, you should find them pretty easily. Since the Halloween plans are "stackable", they proliferated during the display case / vending machine glitch and are now pretty easy to get ahold of.
---
You are the insurgent
---
Zombies is the best one to break fo4.

You can get it to create zombie hoards of like 100 zombies.  Soon as you get one in the city the fps goes to like 2
---
The stealth suit?  I don‚Äôt think those can be dropped or sold. Account specific. You can earn rep with the settlers and purchase later
---
Nope, I may be almost unique.
---
She‚Äôs dead, every time, in less than 2 minutes.
---
Explosive Bait is a thing whether you like it or not.
---
You need more love
---
Ok thanks for the info
---
Yes well it‚Äôd be cool to see the factions going at it at their bases every now and then.
---
Account specific and cant be traded.
---
You'll have to save up the 4k bullion to buy it unfortunatly
---
Because you have shitty friends
---
There is a mod on the gauss minigun that does energy but only minor. Although the gun does ballistic damage for the most part, it is considered an energy weapon just like the rifle
---
Yeah that's true. I'd prefer for it to be a new location rather than the starting point for sure. Could add a decent questline getting the new vault 'set-up'. Maybe even have a rent feature for a few caps a day.
---
It is, if you are ready rich like richy rich
---
It only takes one player who knows what he‚Äôs doing.
---
My friends just started playing this game. But the randoms I played with are twice MY level and didn‚Äôt seem to know what to do
---
Pipe revolvers and bolt action are pretty OP actually
---
Well... I haven't had a chance to do it yet because it never seems to be up, so I'm sure I will suck when i finally get a chance to do the event.
---
Bethesda said they would not replace weapons so, what's the point. They know it is happening
---
We all do
---
I am at 22 hp out of 315 and I have a vampires 50 cal and a bloodied 50 cal when I compare them they do the same damage still
---
Damn straight
---
Then clean it
---
They've been spawning 2 at a time in that location.
---
I have to go? I‚Äôm just voicing an opinion.
---
Oh yeah.. definitely.  I'd love to walk into a massive battle between them. I'd Sit back in my pa on a cliff eating some Blanco brand mac and cheese taking it all in.  
---
Wouldn't  get rid of em though
---
Hot damn that worked. Thank you.
---
I run a melee build and since I read someone in here vouch for enforcer I can't take it out. 
---
Scorchbeast I can't melee ? Enforcer, now it's on the ground begging me to end it. 3 stars Legendary creature when my teammates aren't near ? Enforcer, now it's not moving and I can spam the "come to me" emote. Anything spooking me ? Enforcer, now it's a puppy.
---
Yeah but I really want that slocums joe pack supposedly coming tomorrow
---
Sigh , was it for the vendor glitch thing? Or did fell trough a floor?
---
The rules say that the first instigator be respectful of the initial reactor and progress. Following the post enbalmer the breakfast centrist will for go the land leveler. Rinse and repeat
---
tbh that was my first time doing it there
---
I‚Äôd love to make a vault as my house.
---
You reckon?  That laser from its head is devastating though.  You need a really good build/weapons/armour.  Not summit a lower level could do.
---
I'm on PC, sorry, I should have clarified in the post.
---
Like, if I have enough quantums, I can just spam those and make it.
---
Sorry, I should have mentioned that in the post. I'm on PC.
---
To this day I still don't know... I tried to forget but never will...r.i.p. Be handmade lol
---
Yeah I can't blame you for being surprised.
---
Then ask in r/fo76. Oh shit, you did
---
It tickles...that‚Äôs about it.
---
Nah dawg, thanks for asking though
---
Wasn't what I was curious about op said that the explosive bait flagged as a hit from the player but I've never seen a grenade initiate pvp
---
I thought I was the only one who couldn't see. Lmao
---
Okay thanks, I‚Äôll give it another shot tonight then!
---
Sounds like settler talk
---
If you can't figure out what sub you're in, maybe you should take a Reddit break. They're good for you!
---
Well that definitely lowered my expectations of SS armor, it‚Äôs still the best for all resistance but I guess I‚Äôll have to stick to PA for nuke zones. Thanks for the info though regardless of whether it‚Äôs 100% correct or not it still helped. üëç
---
No, you can still equip 15 plints of cards.  The end value is calculated internally and show on the stats page of your pipboy.  
---
the final number is internally calculated and is offset by weapons and/or armor that increase that category.
---
For example, I‚Äôm 15 STR W/15 points of cards equipped.  That 15 is reduced by a few points for a mutation, but some are added back for class freak2, then added to again for armor/underarmor, so the stats page shows me with 17.
---
Int is similar, I just don‚Äôt know the exact numbers off the top of my head.  I think its 11 base -4 (mutation) +1 (Class freak) +1 (armor) for 9.   But the 11 points of cards still do what they state they do.
---
Ah, food builds are a crutch....lol (sarcasm)
---
Gotcha
---
Different opinion here...had lone wanderer on all my builds. (4)solo player.
---
All but my tank/unarmed it was easy to not depend on it. With the  right gear/mutations. I don't miss it.   Saves me perk points I can use effectively elsewhere. Given, I did it after obtaining high level legendary gear. So to start it's great.  Charisma for solo players it's a dump stat. Cheaper prices can be achieved by chems or alcohol.
---
You just made me keep the lot and I feel SO guilty! I love Meg :(
---
Because they are morons who don‚Äôt think analytically.
---
Yeah the sun is way too bright, and those sun beams coming down make it harder to see during the day than at night
---
Wait the fire breather and garb of mysteries was a one off? If so I‚Äôm lucky I still have them
---
Expand the map, add new areas, new vaults, instanced housing that costs massive caps in said vaults.
---
Instanced camps are coming this winter so maybe that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre planning
---
You forgot to Honor the central mothman.
---
I am drunk.ni can always help. Enkid42 on PSN
---
That's why I kept them all. I also saved every paramedic, cop, and fireman uniform that weren't responders that I could find, I kept holding onto hope that they would bump up players per server, and give us clans/guilds/factions that WE could make. I wanted our uniforms to be ready and waiting!
---
Edit: I also have the super rare Responder Fireman Uniform, the black, blue and white one, with matching helmet.
---
The faction dailies are still some of the quickest/easiest ways to earn Treasury Notes so there's still good reason to travel to either settlement at max rep. It also would reward the players that have reached that rank with an extra little bonus. Even if I don't have business at Crater it would still be great to be able to use it to travel to the top of the map for free.
---
Yeah we need something to spend caps on for sure, and a permanent 'home' would be cool.
---
 Congrats.. but you're level 499 with a vampire minigun by the looks of it.  You couldn't do it solo at level 50 without that gun.
---
Apparently you don't know about Season 3's reveal where you find out Foundation are actual aliens.
---
Oh marsupial will be fun
---
i have a 2 shot mirv and i love it i dont kill anything with it just be toxic every now and then
---
At their feet? I suppose that makes sense, considering the explosive nature of it. I've used the cards you mentioned when I tested the weapon out, and I was able to get kills faster, but certainly not in one shot when people were using better armor and relevant DR perks.
---
It's pretty obvious when the survival instances got removed an age ago along with a bunch of the griefer friendly mechanics.
---
Get bird bones too, you'll fall so much slower than a power armor jetpack.
---
Also if you use the bottom floor based spiked board trap on the roof or [highest camp position] you can launch yourself sooooo far!
---
506 now....I was doing that with a different gun more than 100 levels ago. It‚Äôs about experience and examining how an event is run.
---
I also offered my services, for free, to allow dozens of players to complete that event,
---
Same! I called my space ‚ÄúMy Condo‚Äù. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Ask nicely
---
I‚Äôve been progressively working towards getting all the serums recipes, they‚Äôre just soooo expensiveee
---
I'm an artist/designer so I really miss building out the whole world. It is sorta precluded by this recent shift in medium (which is part of the message). I imagine it would be too difficult to balance and host. Which is the bummersauce of the MMO-ization(?) of my favorite games ('thesda). I also have some really interesting ideas about how they could at least use the engine they have to create a fast-paced mining experience with meaningful perks (cluster-spawning (think molerat/radtoadegg) veins of ore that have different movement patterns, perhaps tracked by different mining tools (like energy damage type but to loot the ore, buff loot outcomes)). Then you could add a layer of opportunity cost to most dungeons (didn't bring excavator? huge difference in mine-dungeon loot-outcomes) by an entire factor without any meaningful changes to the engine or new meshes. Like I have a million of these. Why do our games still suck?
---
Other players could visit, but only if they're in a team with you!
---
I hate that you are right
---
Shop around the players, they usually sell each individual serum for 250-500 caps!
---
Broke: complaining that people don't take the pylons.
---
Woke: getting a full set of troubleshooter armor and super stims/quantums and just holding all the pylons yourself.
---
Ok... I challenge you to do it with a level 50 character without a vampire gun... solo.
---
Im pretty sure people stole by accident or did it on purpose,  a vendor glitch because I saw a lot of items sold by really low prices, I instantly log out and close vendors till this date. Thats why I started trades here.
---
Even after he claimed the workshop he was still able to deal damage?
---
I‚Äôve seen them occasionally, not too much recently.
---
That is a typical strategy. Some guy with a mole miner gauntlet kept swatting me. I knew he was baiting me but I didn't care. Just killed him.  Then his buddies with legacy weapons killed  me and all my team mates.
---
I was pretty much expecting that but didn't care. Felt good to kill the guy who was being a pest.
---
I didn't care because I know better than to carry junk on me. I didn't like that his buddies with legacy weapons could wreck my whole team though.
---
Aside from a few higher level cooperative events, there really isn't any way you can upset anybody by interfering with any strategy they're working toward. In the open world, generally people just shoot every enemy on sight. Loot in containers is instanced so you can feel free to grab all that without worrying you're taking things from other people. Objects visibly sitting in the world in the open, however, are up for grabs- if you get it first, others can't. But everything respawns and it's not that hard to find scrap items so you won't likely upset anyone that way either. 
---
Voice chat is up to you, most people generally only use it in the console party system, you don't see many people talking within the game itself. Mostly to avoid hearing kids blaring music into their mic or some such. I only use mine with people I've gotten to know.
---
Feel free to add me if you want, we're the same age (well a year apart) and I'm always happy to help out other players if they're decent. My PSN is lyrical_theory
---
I wouldn't be surprised if either you or your teammate were seeking revenge every time you respawned. Seeking revenge autoflags you for PvP against the player (and their team) that killed you. Your best bet if you're looking to avoid Workshop PvP is to avoid Workshops entirely. They're PvP zones primarily. Next best thing you can do is server hop and block the aggressor so that you have a better chance of landing in a different server where you might not be bothered.
---
Until patch 20 hits be careful of who you group up with. There are many ignorant players who will drag their team unknowingly into PvP and also players who will use it as a tactic to gank you.
---
What level are you?
---
I was under the impression that this shouldn't be possible, and is not how things work. Unless you chose "revenge" each time he killed you - that will leave you aggroed.
---
I have a little f festival post with tassels outside my camp where I just throw a bags of random health and ammo treats under it when I log on.  I go around playing for a bit and and it's always gone when I stop by to repair stuff - so as long as I keep playing, I throw another bag down.  It's right by the overseer's beginning camp, so I like to think low level players get them.
---
I just hit level 20
---
Look, if you weren't some boring wanker who likes to grief casuals in a non-PVP game you'd have realized why PVP is bad in this game and why it will never be good, and found something better. A real PVPer wouldn't need it explained to them because they'd have seen the issues and left long ago.
---
 Sure I read summit about them adding private camps into the next update. Like under ground vaults... so you WILL be able to soon.. if I read it ... reddit... right.
---
Didn‚Äôt they do just this with wastelanders?
---
My closest alt is level 17...going to be a while before she‚Äôs ready for that. Until then, I‚Äôll keep jumping in to make sure any Encryptid event I see succeeds.
---
If I throw in an ‚ÄúUwU‚Äù will they accept me?
---
You should now have a quest telling you to tune into the overseers radio station i think (should pop at level 20, May need to head back to the forest I‚Äôm not positive)
---
Forcing PvP into a traditionally PvE game did them no favors.  If it was wanted by more then a small fraction they wouldn't have abandoned survival and drasticly curtailed it in adventure.
---
Awh that makes me so excited!!!
---
I believe Customer Support said it was a bug but dataminers found that there is a new unique line of code for SBQ where it makes her immune to cripple damage. So it's probably intentional and won't be fixed.
---
Ah okay I did see a quest about that - I‚Äôll check it out thank you
---
Every time I see a post from this sub is "xxx should be yyy". I didn't quit for a particular reason it's problems and repetitiveness made it fall behind in my game order rn. Plus I'll never be able to get the good shit and beat the queen with my lvl 127 so why keep going. Sad to see the game still having so many flaws.
---
Crater and Foundation should be free as well, or at least as a perk for having Friendly/Ally status with those factions(Making the tedious grind more worthwhile)
---
üòÅ if you do manage to do it solo at level 50... no vampire or special legendary weapon... then I'll give you the best legendary weapon I find for free.  
---
You are on console?  No mods allowed if you can mod on pc.
---
This is what I'm thinking happened. Im willing to bet caps the lower level player kept seeking revenge dragging OP into a loop of PvP. 
---
It seems like a lot of players don't realize the difference between seeking revenge and respawning. Ive seen it happen many times before.
---
76 seasons and bug fixes i think theres another cool thing coming but thats all my brain can process rn
---
Any chance youde be willing to share one of ur perk cards as I have them all maxed out but I only have 3 slots in charisma
---
I agree with you, but for the people not reading the instructions, how?? The game spells it out for you: ‚ÄúActivate the pylons!‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Imposter Sheepsquatch is now vulnerable! Attack!‚Äù and if you actually look at the loading screen, it tells you that the imposter sheepsquatch won‚Äôt take damage in stealth mode. Why is this so hard for people lol
---
XBox...I‚Äôll start thinking about how I‚Äôd do it.
---
 Don't take my comment as definite. In sure I read it though.
---
Sandwich
---
I am bloodied and can still go full health or wear stealth armor and kill everything with a fixer. No commando perks needed. I only have 3 on perception
---
30th, if it doesn't get delayed.
---
Yes - it is graphically and performance wise reeeeaaally wonky.  Still a fun game, but imagine what it could be if they cleaned it up.  
---
I wonder how long bethesda can go on  using the same engine....  I cant imagine the new Skyrim (years from now) will be using ths same janky software.
---
June 30
---
nooooooooo thats so far away but thank you for the info
---
There‚Äôs also new bugs, but those are a surprise for us all!
---
Survival got removed because Bethesda didn't want to put recorces into balancing pvp. Not because players are not interested in it.
---
They were and still are a shit ton of exploits in their game that allowed for unfair fights.
---
They tried to lazy fix it with the damage cap but then they just give up and said fuck it and scraped the whole mode.
---
Plasma caster... what's that?  Please tell me it's like the one from predator that goes on his shoulder? 
---
Ps... not really looked into the updates with wastelanders so not sure on any new weapons.
---
No they've done an overhauled with lighting but they left daytime too bright and nighttime too bright
---
I die every time no matter how hard I‚Äôve tried. I always make my sister do pylons she‚Äôs like the fucking champion of pylon tank. She‚Äôll usually beat her down while we are waiting for the pylons to be activate then I can kill her in less than one clip with the BE laser. I swear that gun is like her kryptonite. I can end the event in less than 3 minutes....If my giant power armor chad sister will help that is üòÇ
---
I've just got an extra ones on Xbox... so useful to know
---
Questionable..I use rad shield sometimes with full SS and it seems like it does resist a lot more than any other armor but it also still says I take +45 rad damage from each hit and that number never changes?
---
Damn, was hoping it produced arrows.
---
Lol I ran Rad Rumble a few days ago with a JE combat shotty and enforcer.  We hit that point where the deathclaws jump you, maybe it was 6 of them.  I just mashed the trigger on Janice the junkie and they all went down.   Half a dozen death claws feebly gimping around on their bellies.
---
I have a friend that I've been playing with a lot that is a Power Armor Melee build. This would be perfect for him hahah!
---
Same, got them all, initiate to elder. happy to paint them on ps4 for anyone interested.
---
^and Public Teams
---
It‚Äôs not exactly a ‚Äúnew‚Äù weapon. I mean new to the game, yeah. But it was in the original Fallout.
---
Next update will include social grouping as well as Seasons -   
---
Basically a big rewards system that'll give you some new loot for playing along a linear scale. You can learn more about it here...   
---

---
As a instigating shotgun user this happens on every enemy that survives the first shot
---
Every single time
---
Takes probably 8x as long to kill a sheepsqatch then it should
---
Was it?  When you say original you mean 1,2,3 or 4 or nv?
---
Noone wants to pay for fusion cores because they are quite easy to farm if you want.  A couple hours with all 3 plants up and running will give you enough cores to last a long time.  But yeah not having them weigh 3lbs each would be nice as well.
---
I bet! It makes sense and another class of weapons would be awesome. I really hope all the datamines haven't pulled up everything and the BoS update is coming with some big upgrades. All my fingers are crossed for *something* cool. haha
---
An Insurgent is what you call someone who fights against authority.They're part of an 'Insurgency' which is a violent rebellion against governments / authority figures.
---
Depends on the day üòÄ
---
While they may work as intended, the two things things that affect my play the most are stash and camp budget limits, with stash being the top.
---
I'd say it's two reasons, fallout has never been PvP and that it's dang near impossible to balance kit that works in both modes.  Balance is the biggie, very few are willing to bother when no balance.
---
Messaging others sounds utopian already. With Bethesda social on PC there is no way to communicate with other players outside of the ingame voicechat, as everyone is only identified by their Bethesda social name and there is no messaging functionality built in.
---
For the rare occasion that I do actually want to stay in touch with people I've met ingame, this is always a real bummer.
---
Original as in the original game. There‚Äôs only one original.
---
That's the original main quest. To join the raiders, you have to do the Wastelanders main quest.
---
Two different quest lines. Really weird when you run them concurrently, especially when the game randomly selects the second dialog first. Rose will say something, that you shouldn't know about, and then tell you the thing that would've made the first thing make sense.
---
That doesn't make sense. You seem preoccupied with the idea that everyone else needs to play just like you do. I don't and won't. The game has a basic flagging system, just like carebear WoW servers. If you can't or don't want to fight, don't. It's that simple. Now get back in *your* hole, foodie.
---
Well this is confusing because on my normal settings I use for other games I can't see a thing at night, like literally falling off of cliffs dark lol
---
How's that? It only ever pops once a day for me. Usually when I fast travel near fissure prime. Is there a trick?
---
Or have really fat legs like Little Lotta.
---
Again.....survival mode was shit. Adventure mode pvp is better. All we want is adventure mode with no slap damage. No leaderboards, no choosing 3 people to be on map. Just fallout with pvp. Not droppkng stims, literally just Adventure.
---
Super annoying. First inventory, then stash, *then* scrap box. I feel like that was done on purpose.
---
ah! theres your problem right there! youre actually *buying* ammo! yeah, dont do that. why spend 1k caps on 100 rounds when u can make like 20k ammo in 1 hours worth of work?
---
And man is she a beautiful gem in the rough
---
Sounds like you were choosing the seek revenge option instead of the ignore and block option. I recommend going with the latter in the future.
---
I‚Äôm at the lead deposit 4 caps from foundation and my tent is a quick walk to the crater
---
I can tell just fine. It's a post nuclear apocalypse where there's no light pollution. You can see the stars and the moon. I mean, it is weird that every night is a full moon. 
---
Actually, on XBox, it's always dark. My PC does day and night cycles just fine.
---
I was thinking more along the lines of a Vault ‚ÄúHotel‚Äù sort of thing, maybe related to Whitesprings upper floors where people can purchase or rent suites that they can decorate different than their camp. I love the idea though good post OP
---
Yeah same. And the PA light / PB light add crazy glare. Best I've found is the PA blue light. Slightly illuminates with no glare.
---
Missile launcher durability
---
Inside whitespings golf club, theres one in the open room beside where the glowing one/wendigo spawns, just use the book finder perk and it‚Äôll take you to it
---
I don't really understand why everyone likes the raiders so much. Sure the "main" characters from crater raiders are more interesting and fleshed out than those from foundation settlers.  
---
But once you're done the quest line, both sides main characters lose all their interesting charm for bland acknowledgement dialog.
---
All that's left is foundation flavor NPC's being chipper or slightly moody, or raider flavor NPC's  being slightly moody or just condescending and berating you left and right.. All the time.
---
Why is they appealing to so many players? At least with foundation, it's just Ward being a condescending jerk instead of... everyone.
---
Hoping someone can help me with their point of view.
---
3-4 rolls a day is such a game loop breaker. My inventory is always bogged down with legendaries I can't seem to ever catch up with that low scrip cap
---
Too bad they didn't get more scrip back when you buy from them. Would balance it a little bit more since you sell 150 scrip worth, make three things, which gets you back 72..when the scrip resets
---
I feel like I wrote this terribly I hope it's understandable lol
---
I'm guessing if anyone can claim the insurgents uniform it's the free states, that breastplate carrier on the outfit looks too American to be Chinese
---
 How many levels did you go up?
---
Buy ammo from players 1 for 1,not the vender prices!
---
I'm going with the free states fighters, they were rebelling against the government so it would make sense
---
just doing the Ally quest (if it isn't freaking bugged) the two factions and photo op is nearly 30 scrip. toss in any other low hanging fruit daily like heart of the enemy or squatters, and it is pretty easy to come close to 50 scrip in dailies before scrapping a thing. most of them award 5 to 8 scrip a shot on top of other stuff.
---
I wish I would have, i think it was just a visual glitch but shocking when you see that come up on the screen!
---
TBH that crowd is what sold me on 1st as well.
---
There are random encounters where raiders and settlers will go at it. It's weird, because if you're friendly with both sides, you don't really know who to shoot.
---
I love the ultracite power armor, it looks so similar to the power armor you get in Fallout: a post apocalyptic survival game
---
Keep it for yourself, it‚Äôs way more worth it. You lose a little tiny bit of reputation. Keeping it all I worth it way more
---
Lol that's what I did when I had an mirv, I would look for players with bounties and yoink them from existence
---
Can confirm that this works 90% of the time.
---
 Think I would've jumped with excitement with that much xp popping up. Would've been gutted if it didn't give it me though. 
---
Never seen that though.  Not in 76 anyway.  Had it in fo4 where xp kept going up and it did give me the levels.
---
from the disappointment of the last one, i started making my own treasure hunt event.. uploaded a few pics to imgur to let you see some of what i've found  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/61nuMAc](https://imgur.com/a/61nuMAc)
---
Awh thank you! It's my first legit reddit post so that feels good :)
---
I was doing that quest where you have to escort the little kid through the vents and then kill the legendary sentry bot.  I was pretty weak and did not have any special build or anything and was squishy as hell and I had to keep stealth and hiding after shooting but finally managed to kill him, then he explodes and falls through the ground.  Pissed me off, all that work for nothing.  
---
Seems like legendaries have a high chance of falling through the ground or disappearing...
---
Idk the server was lagged so maybe when I get back on later I'll be a higher level lmao. Just freaking nuts! This was on xbox too so no crazy hacks or anything.
---
 If laugh if you got back on and were level 999
---
Right, I've got video of it popping up as well. Its on xbox so no hacks or cheats.
---
The only issue is that the stars and moonlight don't give off that much light. It literally looks like an overcast day, not a starry night.
---
i wouldnt even buy ammo from players tbh, 1 cap per round is a huge ripoff. you can find someone on a shady discord server that will do like 100 rounds of 556 per cap... that can be useful, but other than that very specific situation... id never buy ammo. you can seriously just farm lead and scrap some guns to dump 10k rounds of anything in like 1 hour. not worth wasting 24 hours worth of caps when you can do 1 hours worth of work for 10 times the amount u would have spent caps on.
---
3 star enemies dropping 1 star items.
---
Is the Dracula vault boy one of those plans?
---
Problem is most everyone ive seen in adventure mode does not want PvP.  I've been playing on and off since release and have never seen the PvP events even get two people to join.  Workshops if some low level caps them then I've only seen, or experienced, high level folks popping in to curb stomp.
---
Collect legendaries, get script , get modules roll armor piece test in pvp repeat after 2k hours this is all ive got left to conquer
---
Ah yeah the Int probably helps a lot since it's like +30 or 40% xp
---
Wtf did I just watch
---
How do you make caps? I play for quite a bit most days and never once reached the cap limit
---
I have an I/E 10mm that absolutely shreds everything west of the savage divide, great for saving ammo.
---
Even a lvl 68 super mutie will get melted in a clip, if the instigating glitch kicks in.
---
I just got super sad when I saw the PS4 part :( 
---
This sounds amazing though, keep it up the wasteland needs more like you!
---
Go to areas that tend to have legendaries (west tek etc).
---
Do events that drop legendaries as part of the reward (e.g. scorched earth)
---
Do events that have a guaranteed legendary (uranium fever, free range etc)
---
Ally daily is for a legendary weapon.
---
Put subtitles on, legendary enemies that talk (scorched, super mutants etc) show up on the subtitles as legendary. So you know if that scorched you can hear is worth going to find or not.
---
The dailys now give scrip, so theres some easy dailys that you can quicky get scrip from
---
To be specific against enemies not players.
---
I think Bethesda needs to implement a bank for our caps, only allow us to carry 30K but let us keep like 300K in the bank
---
Keep it. You lose barely any rep and it doesn‚Äôt effect anything but one conversation. 500 gold in game to get would take wayyy longer than earning back the rep
---
It's def slowing down. Soon I'll have all the bullion stuff (that I wanted) and will have rolled decent SS armor. After that not sure whats left to do.
---
But you only need to travel there constantly to do brainless shitty chores as long as you're NOT ally...
---
That's a lie to put psychological pressure on dwellers to go out and rebuild Appalachia, air and power doesn't get cut off in a specific time and date
---
Because theyre not worth the time as it stands. Pvp rewards need to scale woth the fact that pvp is harder than pve. If my reqard for all my armor breaking using a few hundreds rounds stims stealthblys etc. The reward is.like 6 missiles 4 purified waters and some cram.
---
I have a massive water farm soley vendoring water for caps
---
I know that ones my favorite :)
---
Who do you sell to, players or like the npc vendors?
---
or you silently watch them. most online games i have played had GM's and they could watch everything you did without you knowing. i know kinda 1984 but it worked.. an actual human looking in to things.. strange concept
---
Me too his channel is really good
---
Ok :(
---
It's still a function time/money.  Nonclue what the numbers really were for PvP events or survival, obviously wasn't enough for them to spend time on it outside of rolling NW.
---
Red Asylum Uniform hunting
---
Currently up to about 65 hours of hunting. 
---
i could buy one but there's no fun in that.
---
At which point itll be OP and the devs with finally remove it for balance.   So heres to AT and their videos!
---
Thank you! It felt like I wasn‚Äôt on the right path - I started playing 76 when it was first released but quickly quit. It wasn‚Äôt until recently when a couple friends bought it that I started playing again
---
Yeah, I had the whole "slow motion running across the room screamin noooooo!!" thing when I saw him doing it. It was pretty rough.
---
20 per hour is most certainly an exaggeration. People are notoriously bad at estimating time. That said, there are a lot of pretty well known farming loops that if you are a fairly stout build you can have a fairly reliable shot at getting 5-8 legendary enemies a run, in a more reasonable 30 minute time frame. Whitesprings, west tek, generals, then do the main sites around the cranberry  bog can have a good yield. 
---
Also, running spawn events (violent night, for example) can spawn multiple legendary creatures. if you slow play violent night, as in only let the juke box play and run the timer way down so more ghouls come in, you start attracting legendary ghouls. I have see 3 to 4 pop up a couple times.  Line in the sand can spawn legendary scorchbeasts. Obviously SBQ can spawn legendary mobs and scorchbeasts. etc. 
---
Then of course, vendor hopping. most days somebody will have some crap legendary weapons for cheap.
---
On ps4 mostly late nights est. Weekends im on alot. Always willing to team up or help.
---
It was an event organized by a youtuber angryturtle where everyone would have a sheepsquatch mascot outfit equipedand using only pitchforks
---
Worth a try.  Never dealt with them and it doesn't sound like they are the best but who knows.  Seems unlikely that you would only be playing on private servers exclusively but if so maybe try a public one (assuming you even have first to begin with). Wish you luck and hope you get some type of resolution.
---
Fuck I didn‚Äôt realize that was happening so soon, I haven‚Äôt been playing much recently
---
I do mostly craft my own, but with more free fast travel points, I'd be more free to give the economy a boost, I know every ammo type that I put in my vender 1 - 1 always sells, even the .38!
---
Oh god there goes my atoms. I hope the beer signs come back, all I have is the old possum beer
---
This is the worst idea in fallout history.
---
i think that pvp in fo76 is like prohibition in USA in the early 1900s... you can make it as hard to pvp as u want, people are going to desperately seek out ways to pvp anyways. if they have to download a bootleg 3rd party program to kill a lvl 1 outside the vault, then they are going to do it.
---
i have to admit, im in that number. give us survival mode with no legendaries and a fresh character. that will solve SOOOOO many problems and its sOOOOOO easy to do. just fucking do it, todd. DO IT YOU LITTLE BITCH!
---
GIVE US BACK SURVIVAL! WE WANT PVP! BURN THE SETTLEMENTS! RAID THE VAULTS! APPALACHIA IS FOR THE RAIDERS! \*ahem\*... sorry bout that... but seriously, give us a fresh survival server where we have to create a new character and make that server have zero legendaries of any kind. maybe allow the quest legendaries, but no others. the best time to pvp was at release when nobody had legendaries or stacks of stimpacks and ammo... best moments of my playthrough were pvping 3v1 and running out of ammo only to battle them with a melee weapon... i would be on fo76 24 hours a day if they gave us a non legendary survival server.
---
weird flex
---
Heads up,  a full rack take a lot of your budget and if you get every magazine it takes 5 racks. I had maybe 30 or 40 from just exploring and completed my collection from searching player vendors. I got every mag I needed in just a couple days doing that.
---
My experience with PvP was one side or the other dead within a few seconds at most.  As for rewards, that's rarely been a concern for me.  God knows I've logged obscene hours on various CoD/Battlefield games simply because it's fun.
---
I got it up to 565 damage with bobbleheads and chems. That's without adrenaline. That means it was hitting 282 uncharged against 0 dr, charged shots easily one-shot against marine armor. Once adrenaline started up it was easily one-shotting uncharged. 
---
Explosive damage bypasses any armor/damage resistance. So marine armor doesn't do much against a gauss shotgun and does absolutely nothing against other explosives.
---
It sounds like you‚Äôre doing things the right way, I also had the Incisor perk maxed out, so I can‚Äôt tell what might be the problem. Maybe put your earned Legendary Scrip into getting a better melee weapon from the purveyor. Do you have all the Gladiator perks maxed out?
---
ITS A FEATURE!
---
No body want to fight an unfair fight, it is just simply not fun to go against someone using auto aim Tesla with stealth boy active or going against players using legacy guns.
---
Of course the numbers were low to justify running the mode but again we are discussing if players would be interested in pvp not that the fact that fallout 76 is completely unbalanced and have a lot of exploits.
---
I would love some instanced pvp mode with at least some balance.
---
Any idea when update 20 actually drops?
---
Make alts and try different builds, each character gets to make its own caps and scrips, voila your playtime is suddenly multiplied. But yes those limits suck balls, at least they should double the quota per day.
---
Aye, obviously... thank you!
---
I assumed by caps limit they meant vendor caps we can get each day. I mostly play solo on 1st. I stopped trying to sell to players when the vending machine stopped working for 3 months.
---
Makes me wonder why the CAMP module doesn‚Äôt include more vault related items in the build menu seeing as how it was developed by Vault Tec.
---
Only failed it once, and it was because I joined late (literally teleported into a quest failed screen, so it's not my fault and I don't count that one).
---
Every other time I've played it, I grab all 3 pylons and die a few seconds later. Respawn, repeat. With enough people, it's possible to brute force it even if nobody else takes any pylons.  
---
As far as I can tell, there's no penalty for dying. And even with 20+ deaths, the event still succeeds. Can confirm from experience.  
---
Besides, once you stop giving a shit, it can be quite therapeutic and hilarious seeing your dead body ragdoll repeatedly with all the explosions and other chaos.
---
Am I playing the event wrong? I dunno, I'm still beating it.
---
Don't get me started on the quest rewards though. They need to look at improving these to actually make the event worthwhile.  
---
I've only ever gotten mascot outfits and fedoras, and some shitty legendaries. Makes the whole thing mostly a waste of time.
---
Your mom is a fast travel point.
---
They did a patch prior to 19 to fix this issue.
---
I still get it but not as much.
---
Only solution is to to a database rebuild or holdout for the new console.
---
Wish there was more they could do to fix this issue as of sucks being in the middle of an event and DISCONNECT
---
Completed all the quests on 4 characters with no glitches, Todd has blessed me
---
Worst part is that it was an innocent thing from the little guy, if It had been my 12 years old nephew that did it, would had been a totally diferent story.
---
Maybe it'll work tmr after the ps4 has a nap lmao
---
You can‚Äôt get rid of it. It‚Äôs the only holotape left in my inventory.
---
This has been around since beta.
---
I'd already repressed that! Now I'm having flashbacks...Stop reading my subconscious mind!
---
But the how would they drain our atoms further other than by making new skins for the secret service armor and jetpack? Lol. But yeah that would be awesome, great suggestion.
---
It unfortunately is an atomic shop item
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3ikCA2Cdhfl09FNTxXFOAE/atomic-shop-update-14-items-and-sales-october-29
---
Now I wait for nobody to show up :(
---
God forbid you decide to craft
---
Without calibrated shocks, which are all but impossible to get, Ultracite PA is useless.  I''m Lvl345 and haven't used my Ultracite PA since low 100's for that reason. Probably close to 200 SBQ fights w/o the plans for Ultracite Calibrated Shocks.
---
That's what I've been doing minus the pvp
---
3 rolls a day isn't very rewarding though, but from the sound of it we're just waiting for some updates to fix or add stuff
---
It's a veapo from New Vegas.
---
I meant the cap limit actually, the vendor cap limit doesn't bother me. Usually just reach that from water and meds
---
I have managed to get past that wall, and sadly, you cant pick up anything. Their names appear however when you pass your crosshair over them tho, which I thought was interesting since it means that they arent just items/props with the same texture as the armor, but they are actual armor that you just arent allowed to pick up
---
Upvote if you believe no one would listen
---
I have to upvote üòÇ
---
I collect all meds I find and sell those along with purified water to the vendors.
---
I sell bulk junk to players, and that's it lol I don't know how much I make per day or whatever but I haven't dipped below 20k ever really. The only cap sink I can really use is the bullion for 6k a week
---
Very rarely something at a players camp
---
Was it in the mail box near VTU towards the back end?
---
Free karma, hell yeah
---
I really hope they add more weapons or items in general for gold bullion.
---
Bought everything I care about, even some I don't, and currently sitting at 3530 with nothing to spend it on.
---
I hear ya!! Most people don't pay attention in life unfortunately.  Lol
---
I wish I was into it enough to care for those rolls, since it's my current goal. But 3 a day while my inventory gets cramed with legendaries I can't sell yet breaks that loop pretty hard for me
---
dunno how well it would work in your scenario.. but would still make a solid emote..
---
I'm sorry i have a bloodied build i cant activate the pylons :(
---
I've tried this a few times and in the end just unlocked enough cards to do all the builds I'd want with my main character lol
---
Except one though, so I guess I can do that
---
Next update is tomorrow
---
I got lvl 100 last night and have about as many hours in the game, so I'm still relatively new. But I've yet to see anyone even bother running this event. Can't say I'm even motivated to try with all the negativity surrounding it. I keep reading people saying how easy it is with troubleshooter sets, vampire, etc. Meanwhile, I can barely keep myself with enough ammo to do the occasional SBQ. I just feel like my gear isn't relevant enough for all the hassle.
---
Because that‚Äôs a pvp zone and it was someone else setup. If you are In The zone you can be killed
---
Nice! Ty !
---
Hey if it keeps you playing why not right? Unfortunately the real low drop rate stuff I don't care enough to purposely seek out, since I'm always at the cap limit I can buy them if I run into one
---
What even would we need 300k for though, I can't even spend 10k easily
---
The scrip limit is worst imo
---
No i understand the rules of PVP and owning a workshop and all that. 
---
My question more pertains to the physical ability of a minigun to instantly kill me from 100 yards away before i could even draw a weapon.
---
All the time.
---
Also quick travel rarely works and I have to do it several times or move first before I do it.
---
That still doesn't explain the one-shot kill.
---
One-shots just shouldn't be a thing in pvp.
---
The game wipes things when there is too much memory being taken up on the server. Legendary enemies take up more memory because they have an individualized item on top of the regular loot, so it seems the game prioritizes removing them first on busy servers. This is also worse now because wastelanders introduced the bug where enemies will often drop their loot as a world item instead of just a meat pile/corpse, which lags things up even further
---
It's done like a million times a day, how do you think no one knows how to do it?
---
Can I get an emote for "stop shooting your rapid fire hacked missile launching minigun through the door of whitespring station while I am inside and trying to sell things to the vendor bot".
---
Happened this morning and I have to admit I was laughing while it was going on but ????
---
wait fr
---
Got Elder yesterday on the same run I got the red asylum outfit.
---
Why for that specifically? Not like you can even force her to land anymore, that would be completely useless for that specific purpose. A better emote for you would be a "get off that damn roof"
---
Happy to help
---
Meandering around collecting and hunting anything remotely useful while I procrastinate my quests, which have been piling up to where I can never decide which to complete first... Makes the content feel literally endless. In the good way? I don't know.
---
Not everyone uses bloodied builds and there was someone who uses a bloodied build that gets rid of the rads specifically for the event.
---
The Broadsider
---
If I encounter little free gifts left around I always add some gifts of my own, even if I don't take anything. I love seeing stuff like this in the fallout community!
---
It was accidentally leaked on twitter about the update Tuesday, it was last Thursday or Friday.
---
But understandable that you might not wanna do that
---
That made me crack up laughing.
---
I cant have my base demolished by fog crawlers if I live in a vault. Just dont see the point.
---
Why? Does she only land if she‚Äôs ignored?
---
Some people will just ignore it, other people don't care or pay attention to emotes whatsoever, and others will see it try to stop and realise that no one else has stopped and will then go back to firing too.
---
Common drops I sell at a quarter of the listed price. So, usually 750 caps.
---
Almost everytime I do it, there are high levels that act and/or are clueless as to how to do it
---
Platform maybe? lmao
---
Interesting. My nights have been super dark since wastelanders. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm on Xbox or my tv?
---
They're pretty good for what they are, but they're going to *eventually* fix their stacking damage and then you'll be doing more damage per shot with an auto handmade
---
The mire is fine least.
---
It has good drops, just people struggle to do the event properly so you don‚Äôt GET the rewards. Also for the ammo situation invest in Ammo Smith and Super Duper
---
Was just about to write something very similar. Or "get off the fence", which would work for that and diplomatic issues.
---
In case you didnt know, the power armor you get in the orginal fallout is on fallout 76, its called T-51 (good luck trying to find all the parts on level 50 lol)
---
There‚Äôs a damage cap, it‚Äôs like 160 or 180 or something and if you‚Äôre below that health you can get one shot veryyyy easily
---
It also dropped from Mischief Night. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm6iyp/full_list_of_mischief_night_rewards_odds_of
---
Thats how I got mine.
---
Edit: I'm a dummy. Ignore this. Other user is spot on.
---
Ha! I did that for a long time too. Launched my first nuke after 400 hours lol
---
You must have weight reduction perks on armor pieces that unequip when you get into your PA.
---
I talk to, and try to talk to tons of people. Basically the only way you're going to find out if someone wants to interact or not is to try talking to them and acting like a normal human being.  
---
Stupid stuff like asking if you can come into someones camp or acting like you are knocking on their door is a great way to break the ice and get people talking.
---
You know what, that makes sense. I do have a piece on. Thanks!
---
3530? Wow I've been slow going here lol
---
I tend to mostly wander around, too bad you can't find treasury notes in safes rarely or something
---
I have both those perks. I hope the raider ammo generator from wastelanders off sets my usage. I'm already meleeing most enemies as is.
---
K that isn't just Bethesda I almost never get disconnected, but some days it's shit as there communication code isn't very robust any jittering by your isp or problems along they way will bork it. 
---
hell  one bug is Is any issues with dynamic IPs and the game boots you as your logged in from another machine and it looks like your being hacked..  Not that every other online service can  handle this shit mostly fine.
---
But it's real simple Bethesda can't or won't fix this shit(not cost effective) either you find stable working solutions or accept it as is.
---
3 a day what? Takes 1 module, can roll 10 in a day if you wanted. Can script like probably at least 10 armors per day too, since it only returns 3,9 or 21.
---
I can't see how that's gonna clog your Inv.  Save your other Legendaries to scrip on days that you don't have ss armor to breakdown or transfer em to a mule.
---
I got all of them in the last month or so as I do my circuit grabbing lead and other things.  I probably did something like 50 runs.  I've held off learning the Elder because I don't know if that would prevent me getting more of them or not.
---
Of course. I have had to do a double take because of that before!
---
And a real timescale while we are at it, the current one is insanely immersion breaking.
---
Pc duping is being done by using third party hacking software!
---
It worked and I am surprised that is new.  It took me about 10 turn ins doing the two each on two characters but I got one today!
---
Could be, your equiped armor, the weight could be different while you're wearing, as opposed to in your pockets. Also any pocketed gear alters the carry weight, the backpack also unequips when in PA. Could also be related to the actual PA, the chassis is always 10.0 where the separated armor can weigh more.
---
Hope something here helps.
---
You can only get 150 scrip from selling a day so that's 3 rolls
---
Sure you can save scrip and do a bunch all at once, and end up with a bunch of stuff you can't sell because of the scrip limit. Tried that once
---
Unless I'm missing someway to get another 350 scrip a day to buy the ten modules
---
I'm taking donations
---
I got a good laugh out of thinking about people trying to resolve diplomatic issues in 76
---
I need to get it. I decided to get the jet pack first but then realized it‚Äôs a mod not just an equipable item
---
I used to scattered some croc plushies around my camp and have little letters next to my vending machine saying ‚Äúcan you find all 7 of me?‚Äù with arrow pointing to the first one.
---
Pretty sure there's a sign outside near VTU and Mama Dolce's that has two skeletons hanging onto it, each wearing party hats.  I think it might be the "now entering Morgantown" sign.
---
I don't know where you've heard that, but it doesn't sound right.
---
I run around at full health at all times. When messing about in workshop areas I know I've gone from full health to zero in a single pvp hit. I've had it happen on a few different occasions.
---
Are you sure you're not thinking of the grim reaper vault boy cutout? Because Dracula is not listed on that link anywhere
---
Edit: Vampire Vault Boy Cardboard Standee
---
Yeah i get that due to PVP the armor unequips when you step in but i wish it did like fallout 4 where PA adds to it. Like my character in the middle of a fight gotta put it on pause be like "yo queen, hang on i gotta strip first." Like Ace Ventura in that rhino.
---
It pops up once a day but after doing it you can go to the scribe's terminal at the top floor in fort defiance to start it again. If you remember where you killed the scorchbeast you can get the dna again without killing another one.
---
This is trolling right?
---
I‚Äôm more than a little nervous to go into the details about not shooting the queen while in flight. I feel like I‚Äôm going to invite a shit show. I will say that it is best way to take a queen down fast. For those that don‚Äôt know about not shooting the queen in the air I beg you to read about it and implement it into your queen runs.
---
I‚Äôll gladly prove it to you if You‚Äôre on Xbox, what‚Äôs you‚Äôre total HP when your full health
---
A bunch of different ways, depends on the gun build stats stims gear mutations, the if he did a vats /crit. You gear /level. 
---
Damage output isn't really a an issue with people soloing sbq......
---
Maybe I imagined this, I don't know, but I thought I read somewhere that they shortened the night time cycle.
---
You get technical data from war room in bunker.  Very common.
---
If you don't find any, server hop.
---
If you've emptied most of the desks, they should reset by looting 255 other things or waiting 24 (20?) hours.  [https://youtu.be/YUGQ0xvqT-0](https://youtu.be/YUGQ0xvqT-0)
---
I used to be afraid of the dreaded armour piercing Gutsies but then I found a quad ammo pump action shotgun and gave it a prime reciever. 
---
You won't hurt anybody anymore Gutsy...
---
with 300 health in power armor?
---
edit: sorry, 340 health
---
I'm all for instanced CAMP interiors.  You'd put down something that looks like an entrance to a storm shelter/fallout shelter and when you enter it, you'd have a basic entry room that you could then build more rooms onto using the same build-a-vault pieces from the Fallout 4 DLC.
---
you‚Äôre gonna carry that weight, carry that weight a long time
---
Fasnacht really helped tbh.
---
Still handing in treasury notes every day + buying gold from smiley every week, I was sitting at \~340 treasury notes when fasnacht ended. I was overencumbered like crazy during that time because of all the legendarys that were dropping at the end of each parade, so I wasn't doing any other events.  I've since fleshed out my stash and can fast travel again so I still do events, but I'm sitting at 3530 gold bullion with 206 treasury notes right now.
---
Do they already own the plans? Once you have them they stop dropping completely
---
You probably got 2 shot or crit, unless they had a bugged laser or your on PC you can‚Äôt get around the cap
---
I arrive at the event and get murdered by a red death ray within 5 seconds. the event is no fun for me as i don't have the 'optimal setup' required to do this sucky mess of a mission.
---
Btw i'm 274, full set of ss armour/T51B power armour and still melt instantly.
---
I found out what is happening. I am wearing some vanguard reduced weapon weight armor and because it unequips when i get in PA, my actual weight goes up. Didnt realize that before.
---
That looks about right for Bethesda..... :)
---
Neat, thanks!
---
I remember the first time I set foot in the Whitespring Bunker.  I was like "Holy shit!  An entire Vault all to myself?!??!  This is SO cool!!"  I would give anything to experience that again.
---
We also need "wait" and "go" emote
---
I did the bullion and faction stuff a tiny bit but I agree it's kinda weak. Would be cooler if you can repeat them, I don't mind having a random map objective to walk towards during my wandering
---
But once a day makes it real slow
---
Pairs nicely next to the commander's console, shame I couldn't clip them together!
---
Eh. Fuck me. You're right. My first google showed me the Dracula one as the Grim Reaper.
---
I could have swore I had that Vamp one though.  But clearly I'm mistaken. 
---
Sorry about that.
---
Fully agree. I'd be buying more of the power armor paints if it included them. I really like the West Virginia paint that's up right now but I can't use it for my favorite PA so there's no point to buying it.
---
Ultracite also needs headlamp mods for crying out loud lol
---
Cool! Thank you
---
Updated. You're on the right console
---
Just for display? Huh. Seems frivolous but hey, you do you. If it was a worthwhile gameplay piece, I could see wanting it back, but yeah, it's pretty useless otherwise.
---
When there aren't enough random encounters in game, *become* the random encounter
---
That makes sense! It gave me a huge boost too. Let me get those ss arms legs and mods for those things
---
Don't really need anything else with it atm since my initial complaint of only 3 rolls a day prevents needing more things to roll haha
---
Ooohhh yeahh. I haven't noticed that perk. Thanks for the update and new intel for me.
---
Yes, scrap stash.....Well worth the $$$ I paid....
---
So 1-2 MINIGUN bullets can kill me from 100 yards away, you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúyes this is possible‚Äù? 
---
I‚Äôm not here to argue or anything i‚Äôm genuinely curious if it‚Äôs possible and how.
---
