Build a kill box for a Brahmin and have yourself and a couple of friends shoot it with a bloatfly syringer from above. Repeat for all resulting bloatflies. Throw a grenade to kill them all when they start to escape or become a pain in the ass.  Loot the piles. Repair and repeat.

---
Edit: bonus flux crafting mats if you have a friend nuke the place your camp is before you join the server.
---
---
---
I have this problem with all door types but not all the time.
---
I‚Äôm assuming you meant nerfed, not buffed....
---
Science perks should not be used unless you are crafting. Get Batteries Included.
---
Luck of the draw is weakest on heavies. Not worth.
---
Lock and Load is only good on Harpoon Gun.
---
Gatling Plasma is pretty garbage if you're trying to deal real damage. Get an explosive one and take advantage of explosion exploit
---
One of the best camp decor mods for Fallout 4 was that it added recipes for junk items that cost that junk item to place them as decoration in your camp!
---
Have it on a wall with wallpaper? I've found it works fine with unaltered walls but phases through wallpaper.
---
Should b unlimited range. So it would b fun to see multiple artillery rain down on the plains in a queens fight
---
They can have this reasoning when they make the base game free. For now, gimme those free atoms, Todd.
---
The problem is, not every person that plays is as intense about the game, they don‚Äôt go to reddit groups or investigate that much of the game, they are more casual about their gameplay, some of them really have no idea if the weapon they are using breaks the game (because why would it??), this is more a Bethesda blame, not a player blame
---
Damn. Bethesda should really fix that.
---
Same. After last update.
---
[deleted]
---
I do but I tested it on a wall without wallpaper and it still sunk into the wall.
---
U serious? Cos I got a bloodied roll on this...
---
using jetpack and emergency protocols at the same time would be awesome üòÅ
---
Thank heavens it isn‚Äôt. Many of us need a break from feeling like we have to play every day. Me and a few others I know have moved on to other games for a bit, or just NW.
---
Junk shield adds DR. It is worthless.
---
Serendipity grants 100% damage reduction. It is the strongest defense perk in the game.
---
Lone Wanderer grants 10-20% damage reduction.
---
Damage reduction affects incoming damage before it is reduced by your armor ratings. This makes your armor rating reduce the damage even more.
---
Damage reduction is better than any damage resistance (DR/ER) stat.
---
I've checked. They aren't in there.
---
What does asbestos do
---
Two shot means you're shooting two projectiles at half the listed damage. It gimps you a bit against armor. I rolled a junkies/aim damage gauss pistol and I'm pretty happy with it on my pistols/shotguns character.
---
What I've also noticed is that it's tough to get a headshot - there's no scope and it's explosive so the projectile often detonates on the body even if the reticle is centered on the head. If you aim for the very top of the head it does a little better (which is a pain in the ass if your armor is turning you and your reflex sight invisible...) I still carry an instigating explosive .44 for when I need to be precise.
---
I made a covid test at my camp, if you survive being flung off the cliff your covid free.
---
Do the main quest, from the wayward, and flatwoods all the way to getting vaccinated. then keep going from there.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also pro-tip, the first player to enter a cell (area) dictates the level of the spawns. So if you need to go somewhere and its all level 50+ stuff, just log out and log back in real quick. Its annoying but its a work around, its not worth the extra XP from the high level enemies. you'll burn too much ammo and stims. If you're fighting super high end enemies it means a high level player passed through recently and caused high level spawns. Log out and back in.
---
Please say there are videos
---
The asbestos lining negates the embers falling from the ceiling
---
I've seen bloodied Gauss pistols kill her in seconds back in the day
---
Upcoming spec ops outfit? This is the first I've heard of it but it sounds cool
---
Yea but that was sort of my point, say you start loading in like a second before the timer starts and you are not at your camp. By the time u load in and everything renders. Death from above pops up with just a : and says completed. You look on the map and hey presto ‚Äúcampo destructo‚Äù....
---
Old World Blues was the best Fallout DLC ever.  The best part of it had to be when you played as a dumb character and had a conversation with your now intelligent brain.
---
You get 4 distinct racks to pick from that take a group of magazines. Missing one, well, you can't build that display. You could always have the empty one and load it up on your own at an increased budget cost.
---
The only time I really see people using plasma gun is with the flamer barrel mod.
---
The only time I really use it is with a +33% vats accuracy modifier and split beam, which turns it into a very accurate, glitch damage adding shotgun
---
No one knows.
---
We dont even have a release date for the PS5.
---
Some of the better rewards happen early
---
I wish my dude :(
---
It also break Uranium Fever aswell, during my experience of seeing 3 people using Teslas.
---
Using the chemist backpack, bandolier rank 2, and batteries included rank 2, and you wont need to worry about ammo and chem weights, i carry around 200-300k ammo, and its nothing.
---
It can only be obtained through enclave events afaik with an extremely low drop rate. It hasnt been a vendor item in more than a year.
---
Not entirely free, it‚Äôs for for fo1st members
---
Jukebox =/= radio 
---
Jukebox's play tapes. They have a button next to a text that would be the song and artist.
---
The more sensible thing you should be demanding is that they should release new tapes of music that you can then upload to your jukebox. Financially, there's a huge incentive to introduce new music, as most players are tired of the of the 20 something songs, so economically Bethesda would see a return from the costs of having to pay for licensed songs, all the while, the in game item would actually be a real, functioning Jukebox. But that's more a Shelbyville idea *winks*
---
You're using two-shot. That reduces the paper damage by 50% per shot. Without armor penetration, you lose substantial damage to the targets DR.
---
Scrap it and get a better one, like Stalkers.
---
I didn't realize it until recently but cigarette packs and cartons scrap to plastic too.
---
Trade for it or complete Savage Divide Events and hope the RNGesus is good to you.
---
It‚Äôs a vault jukebox, has the vault tech logo and matches the vault steel texture.
---
This game hates your role play. You're using literally unplayable gear.
---
Modus no longer sells it. Its possible to get it from events i got mine from Palace of the winding path. But I've only ever gotten  it 1 time in 2 years as an ebent drop.
---
Oh yes, mine glitched up into the ceiling,  spent over an hour trying to find it,  even glitched under the map to look around for it to see if it was in the ground somewhere I couldn‚Äôt get to.  Sure enough it was UP in the roof of my bunker (it‚Äôs a prebuilt structure). With only a small portion of the legs visible,  I finally was able to carefully remove it when I realized this.  So yeah best places to look are straight up and straight down.  If you can‚Äôt find it you‚Äôll have straight up move your whole camp.  I suggest blueprints.  I was reading up on my options before I found mine.
---
Ohio river adventures, you‚Äôre able to turn different types of mirelurks foods in for rep after helping them defend against mirelurks
---
Sooooooo annoying!!! When my store is open the door is deleted, and i put it on to lock it up.
---
How do you start it
---
Can I add line in the sand to that? not because I have performance issues, I'm just tired of not being able to loot the meat piles because some dude was zapping away.
---
I sure hope everyone is reporting it as a bug through Bethesda tickets. That is how this gets fixed especially if everyone floods them with reports.
---
You just go there and talk to a few people, I believe you turn the meat in inside the shack there
---
K
---
The thing for me is, until a couple of patches ago, I never had those issues.
---
No weird minecraft effects from the tesla arcs, not FPS crashing from ash piles.
---
Like 2 or 3 patches ago, it all started for me.
---
Is this issue recent? or Has it been there for a long time?
---
This is a great idea maybe it could be craftable like the frog jar thing
---
Interesting. So it was just lucky me who runs into the Sheepsquatch completely unprepared, while doing a Mr. Messenger event.
---
In the past, they had to spawn alone on a red dot location on this map:   [https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg)
---
I've been all over this map on 20 different servers the past 2 days and only saw ONE tamable creature (a lvl 1 radpup).   The only exception was a deathclaw that spawns as part of an event where he takes out super mutants but his level was beyond what I could tame if he was tamable.  Taming seems broken right now.
---
Tell bethesda to fix this problem instead of getting mad at the players. Even without the Tesla rifle it had a massive fps problem.
---
September is close enough time to get spook
---
I am almost certain that if each season will last 10 weeks then the break between them will last 3 weeks each. 4 seasons and 4 breaks would mean 52 weeks so one year.
---
Season 3 would start 5th January and I believe this pattern would stay. At the beginning of the year the season would start while mid/late December break would start. There wouldn't be any complaints from players about grinding during christmas since season 2 would end at 15th December, so  week before it's x-mas. Of course this is my assumption.
---
Edit: Season 2 probably starts 29th September and ends 15th December.
---
Not just for player vendors though... For every menu
---
That's great, now it sucks for both parties.
---
Bitch damage? Can you elaborate? What does it do to the damage exactly?
---
Edit: glitch damage. Autocorrect. Whattaya gunna do. *Facepalm*
---
For sure. I just submitted one.
---
It is for me. And can still do a different spooky build for October.
---
Trades.
---
I'm sure you know this already, but there are the dailies that you can do. Either retirement plan or the importance of communication.
---
I‚Äôve heard from others it started around then as well.  Someone just broke the server at Line in the sand as well,  so it‚Äôs anywhere with large amounts of respawning mobs.
---
Yeah but I didnt know if there were side quests
---
That actually makes a lot of sense, never thought of it this way. Thanks!
---
4 piece UNY with carry weight 10 on all pieces, all the right mutations, Radicool. Base strength is pretty high up there
---
Welcome to the club, brethren!

Love this!!!!!

---
Thank you!
---
Joking aside, I love both these ideas and would totally be down for either!!
---
Help random raiders in a fight, than talk to them after the fight. This is a random encounter. If they don't give you rep after you spoke to all survivors, shoot one of them and talk to them again.
---
They need to give us something for sure, i finished over a week ago and all the dailies are literally pointless, give us a combo of atoms, scrip and gold.
---
Shame they never fixed the auto complete bug and refuse to help any players affected by it!
---
It shouldn't take 2 minutes to load in. You should have at least a full minute to check where the nuke is landing before it hits.
---
To deal with projectile lag, you would need to be one-shotting enemies. Not even that though, even people using the hacked 3000+ dmg ones say its pretty shit and stick to their other hacked weapons instead
---
Ah thanks for the heads up, wont be spending the caps on a cool hip looking jukebox for it to play Beethoven lol

Someone ruined it for me too with a tesla. People shouldn‚Äôt be using energy damage weapons anyways. Earles energy resistance is almost double his ballistic resistance.
---
Nice
---
She asked me to donate Nuka-Cola, where do I take it!? Haha
---
I‚Äôd love to go on a quest to help her find her lost brother. Maybe he can become the DJ of the classical station. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt end like Colossal Problem and her brother is a giant mothman in some cave. Wait, on second thought that‚Äôd be sweet.
---
It‚Äôd also be cool if we could help the 76 team license more music and pay the voice actress to do more lines. I‚Äôd totally buy more songs and voice lines in the atom store for 300 caps each! Bring back some of the old Fallout 3 songs.
---
That is the only NW tesla that exists. "The good ones" are hacked weapons that don't use tesla attachments
---
I want a Sunset Sarsaparilla version.
---
Literally says ‚ÄúValentines bed‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm so glad that I hung onto mine just ‚Äòcause. I was actually thinking about just scrapping it before I saw someone comment on them.
---
This is why I love this community! Mostly good people helping out others and the cycle continues. Good stuff! Have an upvote, friend.
---
It also happens to me during that event if I open my weapon wheel.
---
Shame those all auto complete too, the weeklies too!
---
Yes, it's an intended feature of Heavy Weapons.  Meant to balance them, the original idea was that Heavy Weapons hit harder and have bigger ammo pools than other weapons so they had increased VATS costs.
---
But a Heavy Weapon build that doesn't use Power Armor can go Bloodied and have dps.
---
In Power Armor there is no Unyielding effect, so our stats are relatively limited in combat.  No +30 agility  with +155 AP for power armor users.
---
The main point though is not the AP drain, the problem is that it ***ALSO*** drains Fusion Cores at an alarming rate.
---
I wish I could build something like this....!
---
You can get the raider tent by buying the raider bundle
---
I was trying this out today and kept killing the ghouls in Radiation Rumble.  Do you use vats or just point at the legs?
---
Misha actually does a good job on portraying Mark's Lucifer, just a little bit more dramatic.
---
The rockstar and the president though, not so much.
---
The Jared version sounds like some lost middle school kid.
---
It was an exclusive. Its the nukashine wallpaper. You had to redeem items from the atom shop to get it. It was a mystery gift promo or something i forget the exact promo.
---
Or even XP is they're not going to do atoms again.
---
Does armor still sell well? I figure everyone is crafting their own now.
---
And for legendaries!
---
Also show the players lvl in the header
---
And maybe fix it showing blank.
---
The straw bales made it much easier. Last year I used only fencing. It was near impossible to get things lined up
---
Season 2 rewards look so bland. :(
---
You don‚Äôt find the scout mask it finds you...
---
I wonder if there will be a higher chance of encountering flatwoods monsters in the forest.
---
Or if the game crashes on login, this also happens regardless of the time of log in!
---
They're going to dole it out one at a time, watch.
---
Pretty shit that an always online game is making fans want to take breaks from it. What could have been for this game.
---
I    NEED    MY     MARINE      ARMOR       !!!
---
Already been through the ropes with that one. I have done all the trading I need to do
---
Same. I went to the beach today instead.
---
Underrated comment. Upvote
---
Great news! I started on Xbox games pass so I‚Äôm lvl 90 now, hopefully won‚Äôt have to spend many atoms to finish now.
---
I started last week but am level 70, do I count as a new player? I could use plans lol
---
They'll fix it eventually, maybe sooner rather than later, and pistols are getting a boost soon with Tank Killer effecting them. At the end of the day, the game is really about playing what you think is fun rather than what is the most min-maxed (or finding a middle ground between the two). I've been half tempted to respec to a pistol VATS build and run around with six guns like I'm El Duce from the Boondock Saints. Why? Because that's fucking rad and earns you *Style Points*.
---
With ALL daily and weekly challenges, yes, that's the total score available.
---
Yeah and as is that's not bad enough the Garage Door is actually on backwards when its created, at least it is on my PS4
---
I know right? Last night i played a colossal problem where more people jumped in front of me in 15 minutes than the other 1500 hours of game play combined, like seriously WTH?
---
Has Bethesda ever officialy explained why they think jukeboxes can only play classical music i cant find anything on it
---
Meh. I got the stuff i wanted, even if i didnt finnish it.
---
Ty for the heads up tho.
---
It needs something. A timed deathmatch or larger teams. The one life and done is not fun. Its just hiding in bushes and waiting in the vault. 15+ minutes for 15 seconds of action or at least if the last 4 people are on the same team make them fight it out.
---
You can get 1 and 2 stars from it, I know I have been!
---
Did you go to the training camp, find the claim ticket in the soldiers locker, and exchange it for the uniform at the machine? I‚Äôm not sure what point you‚Äôre stuck on the quest.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Recruitment_Blues
---
That‚Äôs awesome I hope you make it! It was nice to be done with the run so I could play a little more freely but honestly I can‚Äôt wait for the next one already. Seeing some of the rewards got me hyped and I‚Äôm already thinking of new camp ideas! Keep that grind going and if you can up your intelligence as much as possible for that extra xp!!!!
---
It's been a recent issue with these last few patches. Them modifying how ash piles work (or in this case, *don't* work) really fucked things up.
---
What do you mean redeem items from the atom shop? As in, buy more stuff from the store? Or redeem items for free?
---
Thats the best part, 1600 atoms for $13, and get the scrap box, and get the tent, and get exclusives, and a private world, and discounts, name another game wher you get more for $13, op is nuts lol.
---
Got 2 of those.  Wasn't aware they were piss af rare.
---
Same. I used to play everyday and enjoy it, then the season came and burnt me out. I don‚Äôt even want to log on now lol
---
No evidence here..... but I have my doubts that the crew responsible for that fix are still working there after almost 2 years of being publicly crapped on for being told to release this thing ASAP.
---
Incorrect, you still need a card, you don‚Äôt need the launch code for the same silo done during the week.
---
Before patch 22 my sneak commando used to be able to do 460 damage with his fixer against the SBQ now he can't seem to do more than 22, so sneak seems to have been broken...
---
Same, I don‚Äôt wanna play another grind.
---
Bloodied Combat Shotgun.  But really, any shotgun should do.  The Combat Shotgun just happens to hold a lot of bullets per magazine.
---
No
---
this^^^ taking advantage of teams and CAMPs would have really helped me earlier on. idk how exactly the INT XP bonus works w/building, but playing on teams/team challenges the past few weeks helped me get to lvl 55. I try to stay with lower level teams but they can be hard to find
---
An exosive shotty works best. Just free aim at their feet. 
---
You might have to remove some damage cards to avoid one shotting them
---
It‚Äôs been better for me the last week or so but yeah I‚Äôm on box as well and it can get bad depending on the server and how many players are on. When it gets like that I try and hop to a less full server but it doesn‚Äôt always help. Sorry that‚Äôs a bummer!
---
Nice run, add a Capital Building run to the mix.
---
I did game QA for a short minute... I got paid to try to break games :-P
---
Wouldn‚Äôt the dense mod be better for big daddy earles attacks tho? I‚Äôm asking I rly don‚Äôt know
---
At least you can stack that one!
---
It doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve loaded into nuke zones about a dozen times, nothing‚Äôs damaged or dead.
---
Anywhere in the Toxic Valley. Love that area.
---
Grafton Steel might be better than West Tec!
---
Or the prison!
---
I believe this was around St. Patrick's Day. They put free items on the atomic shop. I didn't get them all, but I got a mini keg, a nukashine player icon, and I'm forgetting the other right now, but yeah, it was just a limited freebie thing.
---
I wish that were true, but I own said bundle and I do not have that tent.
---
Or the stand it sucks so hard when people do. Just use a shotgun to tag
---
Hopefully September. I would be surprised if it's on time.
---
Shotgun type weapons with secondary effect of +50 limb damage or +33 vats do extra unintentional damage when used in vats. 
---
It's like 5 to 10x more damage than normal and only occurs when you use vats. It's a bug. Some will call them "magic" weapons.  It has been around for so long that people often use these weapons without knowing the bug exists
---
That would be amazing!
---
That's also a fair point. By the time I realized I perk'd my first character wrong, I was pretty much side quests-out.
---
There were five daily free items. After you canines one each day, you received the wallpaper and a player icon. 
---
It‚Äôs not currently available. It might return one day.
---
I was going to yield, to both you and /u/KerrSG1. But I really just don't see this ever happening in any universe. At least not in one where Bethesda is developing Fallout 76.
---
First, I'm guessing we would all agree that we would much rather bug fixes and new content than the ability to be able to display magazines "cheaper". And with the number of bugs we have, and the small dribbles of content we get, this feature request is never going to happen.
---
Second, even **if** they did this for bobbleheads (which although it's a good idea, it just won't happen), I just don't see them expanding it to magazines. Because whatever they did, almost no one would be happy. It doesn't appear to me that there is any obvious simple way to group these magazines. It looks like there are 13 different types, with anything from 1 to 13 issues. So whatever order is forced upon us would have someone not happy.
---
Just looking at the list - someone's going to say "well, of course you would group *Guns and Bullets* with *Scouts Life*" while another would say "Are you crazy? Clearly *Guns and Bullets* goes with *Tumblers Today* \- are you daft"? It's just a lose lose situation.
---
well.. i found the thing in the soldiers locker.. the sergeant robot just stands there when i go to turn in the quest to him.. ive completed the 3 trials.. its like the sergeant gutsy has gone cold on me when i go to actually get the ID pass from him
---
Yes, it increases thw rate in which they cripple. But no it doesnt to extra damage to the enemies HP
---
Where at?
---
Yeah I think Grafton Steel will become a hot spot, a lot of people will be fighting for that Workshop haha
---
Arena Deathmatch with 12v12 matches, 1 life per player and there‚Äôs plenty of already existing places to host it. Valley Galleria, Watoga, Watoga Underground, Arktos Pharma, West-Tek Research Centre, Whitesprings, Vault 94 any of the power plants and so on
---
Well you have a masterpiece now üòÅ
---
i didnt exchange from the machine.. but the quest specifically told me that that part of it was not required and as such the dunce robot does nothing when i go to complete the quest.. basically locking me out of the brotherhood
---
Thats what i thought but didn't know if crippling the head was a thing
---
I have ro buy the skin but I have t-65 with jet pack mod and emergency protocols so I‚Äôll see if it works EDIT: (((does work)))
---
Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs ever going to happen..
---
Literally the one building set I‚Äôve been looking forward to since day one. I‚Äôll be tempted to spend my way to unlocking it early.
---
Dense protects from explosions, and explosive weapons in your own hands (with the exception of legacy explosive energy weapons). I‚Äôm not 100% sure but I think Earle‚Äôs attacks are either considered fire or poison attacks. I was running fireproof last time I did the event which seemed to help, but 3 of my armor pieces have 25% poison resistance, so I can‚Äôt say for sure. I‚Äôm testing running asbestos without the fireproof perk next (replacing it with revenant) since I‚Äôve got 75% poison resist in my armor. 
---
The asbestos lining pretty much entirely negates the debris falling from the ceiling which will kill you faster than Earle‚Äôs attacks.
---
 Also I had the pneumatic mod on my chest and the spawns were staggering me regardless so it seemed like a no brainer (to me at least) to go for the asbestos.
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt have anything more concrete than that at the moment. TYR has some really good videos on running ACP on YouTube right now worth checking out.
---
Cool. Thanks man!
---
Nukashine beer hat was one, I only got that and the keg, glad I didn't miss much if it's only an icon, the wallpaper is okay but there's enough of them to use I'm not too fussed, would grab if it becomes available again though.
---
OK... yes. If they made a specific smaller "Backwoodsman Display Case" for example, I could see that.  I was more focused on how it would work with the existing racks - and there's no logical way to organize the existing magazines on the current racks - it's just going to end up looking weird.
---
I feel like Bethesda would only do this if they could charge Atoms for it. Which is fine, but I feel like most people would be annoyed that they have to "buy" the rack, and then go out and collect the magazines before they can even craft it. But I could be wrong - on all of this. :-)
---
My guess is that Bethesda's answer is "Instanced Camps - leave us alone about budget" and that will be the end of it from their end.
---
I dropped a power armor frame and a bunch of 20% cores (stupid gatling bug) and this happy little level 2 just started dancing.
---
Beam Splitters give some energy weapons the same "magic" effect as certain Shotguns, where each pellet is committing the full damage, rather than having it divided across bullets.
---
Sadly, it's one of the only reasons Shotguns are viable, and the same is true of the Plasma Gun.
---
Gotta claim it in the atomic shop
---
Are you talking to the right gutsy?
---
And I thought I had a bad name
---
Bethesda really doesn't care, I've sent them a ticket for every daily and weekly I've lost, they stopped responding after the first ticket and now just auto lock them as soon as I post it!
---
I've resorted to publicly posting bug reports on their Facebook page so at least other people know!
---
I‚Äôm looking for the same.  Just wasted two cards.  üò¢
---
Thanks for this. Saved me from logging in.
---
Over here wasted 5 üò£
---
I like the idea of being forced to continually upgrade gear when starting out. Keeps things fresh.
---
I've been pushing this for months.    
---
"Great" decision Glitchesda.
---
Now that just takes the fun out of owning an explosive weapon.    Nobody will kill you faster than you
---
Sorry mate. That's the code on Nukacrypt
---
That is pretty good info
---
I‚Äôm not looking forward to it honestly. I like a sense of progression in my video games. Level scaling is boring IMO
---
Alpha didn‚Äôt work either..
---
Guess no nukes dropping tonight lol
---
Archer and swimmer are also easy. Mammologist isn‚Äôt bad either.
---
Also, do photo oppurtunity for dave in the overseers house and turn in photos of foundation to the raiders.
---
So they gave you led and wood for wood.
---
How do you get the t65
---
Should be 3 total for raiders to improve rep.
---
Same here. I wasted 2 cards. No CWendigos for me today. (Sadface)
---
Anyone know if bravo code is right?  I don‚Äôt wanna waste another card?
---
Wasn‚Äôt even aware this was what was causing that to happen. Thanks. Informed my buddy
---
Thanks. And I suspect it might even work with any 'container', meaning you should be able to reload, drop the core, fire until dry, pick up the core, reload, drop the core, repeat
---
Make a nice CAMP that uses a pre-existing structure, those are harder to find after the patch..
---
You get the armour through the main quest by buying it at vault 79 for gold bullion, it costs 6,900 for a full unmodded suit
---
Wastelanders
---
Carefully
---
It‚Äôs very obviously for the ‚Äúclean‚Äù aesthetic. It‚Äôs unrealistic to expect new songs from this 500 atom cosmetic item. If anything, you should be petitioning Bethesda to offer additional songs for atoms...
---
Uh, no.    
---
For many gamers like myself we don't have the time to grind nor have upwards of thousands of caps. In fact, respecing should be easy.    
---
You could have a damage loadout, group loadout, healer/aid/chem loadout, etc.    
---
This game REEKS of MMO at it's core and time sinks are everywhere.
---
So if i buy the skin i can apply jetpack to anything?
---
I just finished today ü§™
---
You claim it on the last page where the specials are
---
Nuclear Winter is so much more fair and fun on console! I sincerely hope we never get cross play with pc!
---
This. Archer, swimmer and athletics are the 3 easiest. Medic is IF you can find 3 stimpack diffusers.
---
Hravy machine gun. Decent damage and I don't have to run power to them.
---
The rewards for it aren't that great vs time having to play for rewards.
---
You get the tent, but not all the skins for it
---
no
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone does the code break...We all go to the same side.  I know Charlie code doesn‚Äôt work either I just wasted 2 cards trying.   Haven‚Äôt heard bravo tho.  Don‚Äôt wanna waste the card to try.
---
Looming forward to doing leader of the pack and getting something worthwhile instead of scrip and low level starter sets.
---
Just like fo4
---
All turrets do is eat up budget and shoot at each other.....
---
Yeah any piece on t-65 if you have the jetpack mod unlocked for 65
---
Rip lost 2 at alpha üò¢
---
Oh ok. Never knew that. I have like 6 different tent skins but never paid extra for them. Must of been free for a while.
---
Someone launched nukes from bravo and Charlie in my server. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è idk
---
Play other games.    
---
Made most of my ammo, plans, and mods ) caps last night. Might make gear if I have the spare mats or someone could bring them to me. I can make the Fixer and have a PA station.
---
You know it's a bad problem when people are getting cussed out for using it, tbh. Had one lobby on Xbox one and this 94 decided a Tesla was the best thing to use. The other 6 players in the lobby were not impressed and let it be known.
---
Felt a bit bad cause the kid just went AWOL after that.
---
The ammo factory as I'll be needing so much more ammo!
---
u/nukacolakindaguy
---
With fallout 1st there's an item every month for free and also with the wastelanders dlc we get the raiders and Steelers skin. I'm expecting we get a BOS Skin pretty soon
---
(Cough) You misspelled "features". (Cough, cough wink).
---
I like the lasers cause it‚Äôs quit, but I do use some rockets for the heck of it
---
Ah so that's why I one shot wendigos I'm vats
---
Well in that case I'll install turrets and flamethrowers in case the Wendigo Colussus decides to drink my Nukashine
---
Explains why mine wouldn‚Äôt work and no ones launched a nuke today for me
---
we need an option to disable goo and ash piles. this would effect only the person changing the setting .
---
"A TOASTER IS JUST A DEATH RAY WITH A SMALLER POWER SUPPLY!"
---
Take my goddamn upvote OP, I lived and breathed for that toaster in NV
---
I don't care who comes to my CAMP at this point. They eat up to much weight. I'll be on again roughly 10 p.m-ish CST.
---
I totally agree. This was disappointing, as I was hoping for at least the same options that we had on our pip boy. In fact, I would have liked to hear more of the music on Rosie's radio station. Sadly, this is a dud.
---
Or the jackass that has "242" plans, but 240 of them are the Santa Crash...
---
I had this same discussion in my head only an hour ago... thanks for letting me know I am not alone in the wastes.
---
I just tried Charlie.    I don‚Äôt wanna waste another card. Lol
---
Just launched at Charlie on xbox. Code used 73412010
---
yup.. hes the only one upstairs and now the quest has dissappeared from my pip boy and doesnt say it has been finished or that i ever got it
---
Do you have Fallout 1st?
---
Cailbrated shocks isnt that great though. Its just a +1 to strength and that gives what +5lbs carry weight?
---
My dailies were all auto-completed, which I've seen twice now, but I logged in at noon and this is my first time that my weeklies were auto-completed as well.  I started late, but now I cant finish the season.
---
Personally, I'd rather we go back to outfits.
---
NP dude it's only Bethesdas fault they put these things in the game to be used and they can't be. I would like to use my Tesla in events like that so other ppl could focus on the boss but I can't. It's just very bad in that event and line in the sand etc.
---
Around 6900 gold bullion. For the entire set. If I had that much, I would do it. But, I bought everything else first. Either way, good to know. üëçüèª
---
Amen
---
It must've gotten fixed then. It broke maybe two updates ago for me. Great news!
---
Thank you for sharing! üëç
---
People will argue otherwise, but as you level, each camp piece costs less budget, up to a point.
---
Yes ive tested it. I had full budget. After gaining a good 30 levels i pulled ever roof and wall piece off my large base and replaced them and after that i had empty budget space
---
That isn't the case anymore since patch 22, I knew the blast was originally there as I had launched it on a different character changing to an alt wiped out my base, thankfully I didn't have a rad arch in my base.
---
Yeah.
---
I do lmfao, finished today and deleted the game, i know im dumb for forcing myself to play but i just felt like once started i couldnt bring myself to not complete it, deleted the game for repetitiveness reasons tho
---
i like rocket turrets because explosions
---
Yeah I just put it on after finding a post that was asking someone to test it and was super suprised because I accidentally bought the jetpack for the armour and thought I messed up ended up saving myself in the long run
---
Damn did you calculate that?
---
It definitely is. I've had my poor 1080 TI chugging out FPS in the *single digits* after a Line in The Sand event that used a survival tent in a creative fashion.
---
[https://roguetrader.com/#/](https://roguetrader.com/#/)
---
this site has the right codes.
---
i tired all 3 codes on [nukacrypt.com](https://nukacrypt.com) but wasted 5 cards
---
the one on rougetrader worked the first time
---
Is this the atomic shop camo skin?
---
This.  And they do decent damage compared to the others.
---
Harsh, but true, and it's only going to get worse in the Patch 22 rebalance.
---
As it applies to Daily Ops and the bosses, or any kind of enemy swarm, you simply cannot deal enough damage quickly enough with single-shot Revolvers (or Rifles, for that matter).  We've mentioned this several times in the PTS, but Bethesda hasn't done anything about it.
---
I had to cut off the name displays because it was making me physically ill whenever I was in Limsa. Just recently turned off everyone else's battle animations so I could see the damn markers in the latest trial. Good help anyone who wants to play and is at risk for seizures.
---
Yes sadly
---
It is. Only happened to me a couple times of over 2k hours of gameplay. But when an enemy cripples your head, everything goes ‚Äòfuzzy‚Äô. Once, I got all of my limbs crippled at once. It was kinda funny. The on screen animation of your body in a full body cast, is classic.
---
I feel like most people that feel that way are the ones who kept grinding for that repeatable xp too hard.
---
My first time doing a colossal problem so many people used Tesla rifles and Gatling lasers that my game crashed
---
Well let's hope they switch monthly between both outfits and workbenches, I'd be happy with that üëç
---
Of course! I was doing it wrong this whole time!
---
So you would rather have to lvl up several times to respec(which could take way more time), and waste potential perk coins? because that's the only other option available atm.
---
Don't get me wrong, I would also like an easy/free respec option, but that's highly unlikely to happen, maybe the Perk Loadouts coming in the future will include Attribute changes too, but so far they haven't said anything.
---
If you are trolling, then, cool. If you aren't, let's say the Tesla is one of the best weapons in the game, good for events, PvP and all-around playing.
---
I was hoping for different Variants of it, not a reskin of the same exact Jukebox.
---
Every week would be good too but that's just dreaming lol
---
So gonna try this next time!
---
It's awful. I had to turn off the names of other people because Limsa would make me nauseous whenever I went to the aether plaza. And who the hell thought putting the job gauges in the middle of the screen was a good idea?
---
Do you know if you can change the skin paint after the jetpack has been applied or does it need to stay the new camo one?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Survival_tent it‚Äôs not available dude
---
But they will keep all the spawns off the people who _are_ fighting Earle. Besides, not everyone needs to be shooting him, he's not _that_ spongey. 
---
I've been in an ACP with only 2 people and taken him out, both of us using Vampires Ultracite Gatling Lasers. Still had 12 minutes left and we had even stopped to farm screws...
---
Love it!
---
I‚Äôve done it maybe a dozen times. I‚Äôve only died in one of those attempts but it just kept happening for that event. I hit that timer. No idea what was different. Every other tine, no issues.
---
People have said theyve done this and it had no affect, all i can say is it worked for me
---
It shows up as the camo skin one there‚Äôs no other option for a regular jetpack sadly
---
Thx for the tips my dudeüëç‚úåÔ∏è
---
Just finished it too, did realize thanks to /timeplayed on steam I've been averaging 32 hour weeks all summer on it.  I'm definitely out of things to do.  Been trying to speed run a nuke silo without ceiling jumping or power armor cheese balling(my times suck, 2 deaths 20m is my best using a bloody build, need to abuse vats or vampire weapons more), even that isn't fun anymore.  I've collected 20 bugged heavy weapons and tested them to death.  Can't find a B/E heavy to save my life , though I have tons of furious explosive ones.  Till today I have been on a 4 week nothing but scrip drop rolls.  The RNG is what kills me and keeps me hooked.
---
I'm glad my PC isn't broken. I've never seen that in any other game.
---
Not too much of a loss, bonus jetpack is definitely more useful anyway haha.
---
It is my ACP perk. That and my bloodied lever keep him crippled. You won't freeze him, but he won't be moving as he does when healthy.
---
Remember all those ‚Äûit‚Äôs impossible to reach 100 I did the math‚Äú posts?
---
I member.
---
Lasers ! But they are trash against high lvls...
---
Yea I was happy about it because I missed out on protocols and jetpack on my strangler and I actually had everything I needed to get this one on my 65 suit
---
If you really want to move your camp, join a friends private world, point out your camp, and tell them to place their tent in the place of your camp when you leave. Then rejoin!
---
Thank you for your response :) can you tell me *why* Junk Shield is useless? Do I have to carry a lot of junk? Or can I just have one junk item (or a few varieties) to get the bonus?
---
I actually had someone come through my camp, look at my stuff and then give me a bobblehead I was missing. Rare to be sure!
---
"You can never have too much gold" (because I will never sell you enough to have too much gold muhahaha)~ smiley
---
I thought there were, but I guess they're only part of a particular quest. I don't actually know.
---
THANKS SO MUCH. Sounds like nukacrypt fixed theirs too.
---
The ones who felt that way are people who wont admit to themselves that they're super casual players.
---
Bethesda: ah yes, Malaria vs Lyme Disease.
---
Sooo a bear arm?
---
"What is it you Desiiire~"
---
Yes I can also make the tenderizer all three versions bear arm fixer marine mask once I get rid of this stuff in my machines I‚Äôm going to sell mostly what I can make
---
100% DR would be invincibility, I don't think that's what you meant :) Can you explain to my ignorant brain *why* junk shield is useless, though?  Do I have to carry a lot of junk? Or can I just have one junk item (or a few varieties) to get the bonus?
---
I started ACP tonight, and when I arrived and watched the nuke fall, there was no event notification.  I went into the mine anyway and the event started for me, but there was still no notification on my map.  It never showed up at all.
---
You‚Äôre very welcome :-) happy nuking!
---
When I have a 25% VATS cost fixer and one frame I have max AP and the next I can move I have 0, there is an issue
---
I agree, I‚Äôm ready for round two.  I find it extremely fun
---
Haha, just tried it, gave every piece a jetpack, oh god the noise when I use it (it stacks) also the AP use, 0.5 seconds and all my AP is gone xD don't even get any height.
---
Think I will keep an arm with the jetpack, that way I can put something else on the torso.
---
Trust me it needs a serious buff it‚Äôs horrible
---
Well, when the options are going full wendigo or roasting mr. Fuzzles, that beer butt feline starts to smell damn tasty..
---
I'm with you. Just finished. So casual. Played my game and if things got completed that was awesome. The only ones I went out of my way to finish were the easy NW (like placing a camp). Never tried to grind for xp. Had a lot of time to play though because of covid.
---
Lmao yeah I put one on my left arm and put emergency protocols on my torso so I‚Äôm still tanky and I can fly
---
Another reason I prefer gattling Plasmas to gattling Lasers, much easier to keep it fed and still use power armor!
---
Npüëç
---
Flamer rocks. I have a furious one, really fun to use until (and I quote) 'you realise you are going to suck dick for copper' because ammo goes fast.
---
Curiously, the weapon is affected by RIFLEMAN perks. And that includes Tormentor.
---
Can you replace it with a different mod?
---
I've taken him out with two other people too and I even appreciate low levels that just kill the adds. But teslas are broken right now and it's particularly bad in this event. It was the same with people in strangler heart armor crashing other players to crash at the queen fights. It just ruins it for everyone and doesn't help the fight. Just put the Tesla away until the event is over and tag the enemies with something else.
---
Why are people downvoting this? Do you really think ‚Äûwe‚Äú actually managed to donate all the cork earlier?
---
Yea.... no.
---
Oh yeah and NV itself had the best dlcs by far, especially played in story order. Wish I could replay them for the first time again
---
That‚Äôs not true. If you inserted a card and for some reason either crashed or left the server, next time when you launch at the same silo you won‚Äôt need to put in a new card, nor the code, if done before the codes expires.
---
People will sell anything.
---
I can't judge.  I sold a "Youre the dumbass" for 1k.
---
It‚Äôs got 2 slots for mods ones just has the jetpack I believe. no option to make it standard
---
There was similar mechanic in Far Cry 5. It was essentially a mission to collect various record collections. Each time you managed to grab another collection and return them to the DJ, the in-game radio would add those songs to the mix.
---
Raider Punk would be perfect for this....
---
That's fair. I've shelved my bloodied Tesla that I used for tagging and replaced it with a quad explosive pump action. Effective? Not as much. But it gets the tagging done until I can find something that fits my build.
---
&gt; After gaining a good 30 levels-
---
Between then and your 30 levels, couldn't it have been because of an update? I know they did something with budget a while back.
---
Mostly likely it will get updated because fallout 76 a service game 
---
, if it free or not we don‚Äôt know yet
---
Ah man, just watched the video that is so frikin cool. Well done üëç
---
I just finished it, and it certainly began to feel like I grind.
---
Because it's much smaller for its actual purpose, which is to be a player icon.
---
You can replace it with another mod. i replaced my biocommmesh with it and then swapped back
---
Thank you so much! It is a lot of fun!
---
Gosh, this is so cool!! I wish I had a PS4 ... guess I‚Äôll just have to make my own on Xbox ;)
---
Fall is my favorite season, and I knew that Fall 2020 would be the best time of the year for that reason, even if it‚Äôs still going to be crappy lol. I love going to corn mazes IRL and I‚Äôm terribly sad I can‚Äôt go to any in person this year, so your CAMP cheered me up. Luckily there are still plenty of COVID-safe ways I‚Äôll be enjoying fall! I‚Äôm going to take some time off work to go camping during peak fall colors in a local area that would usually be too crowded over the weekend. (I have social anxiety so I‚Äôve never been to this particular location, even before the pandemic). I‚Äôm also knitting a fall scarf for my best friend! It is orange (her fav color), gray, and has a cat on it. I‚Äôm hoping that there will still be some fall left by the time I am done haha.
---
Intentionally bad. What‚Äôs yours I‚Äôm very curious
---
nuke 3 times on a server
---
swap to another server
---
????
---
profit
---
Just looked at nukacrypt, shows 98469385 for Charlie now.
---
Trust me. I have 2300 hours in, over 700 levels and probably 15 tesla rifles stashed, with different effects and mods. The only downside is ash piles.
---
It is a fantastic rifleman weapon at medium distance, and a brutal commando weapon against everything.
---
Ah, well looks like I‚Äôm grinding for more gold then. Great.
---
I saw the holiday one yesterday..I neeed it!!!!
---
Hopefully so, they should do a month where all the old items come back for a limited time. I'd re-sub so fast.
---
Thats the kind of people I want to find
---
Did I ask?
---
Little bit stupid that I need to do that get rid of the jetpack
---
What platform are you on?
---
Yeah, I started 4 weeks ago and I‚Äôve made it to level 84 now. To be fair, they did that math with the information available at the time.
---
This is in the past 2 months, i wouldnt have lights in my base otherwise
---
Aw that sounds wonderful! Someday I want to give camping a try. Fall weather would be perfect for it. And you should totally build one! The best part is when people stumble on it in game and switch to area chat or send friend requests because they‚Äôre so excited lol.
---
What does this even mean? The issues a Tesla rifle causes aside, it's the ideal weapon for crowd control on the unending swarms of Wendigos.
---
Jeez, that's pretty crappy then. :\
---
That‚Äôs kinda what I was leaning towards just reviving someone in water might be tricky gotta see if a random will help
---
What about them legacies that leave goo piles or ash piles everywhere.
---
use a legacy explosive energy weapon and have died because of some jack \_ \_ \_  jumping in front of me killing me instantly.  i avoid standing near anyone now.
---
Yeesh feels bad for them
---
Thank you for posting this, i didnt see anything new when i went on earlier, have to jump on now so i dont forget.
---
Xbox
---
Oh and the music fits quite well üëç
---
Not sure why this is post worthy.  All you have to do is look at the LR board to see how many days are left for Zorbo to get to the end.
---
I guess you could try pharma farmer and go somewhere with lots of medical cases, maybe Watoga Emergency Services?
---
Not sure how great it'll be, I've never thought of farming for stims
---
True. It was still ridiculous and quite obvious that it will be easily finished by most players who actually play the game.
---
You made out like a bandit. I hope you didn't giggle too much..lol. Congrats.
---
That makes sense as to why my auto launcher breaks so quick on gunsmith 5
---
Its been a bit since i used that trick i forgot about it.
---
I got 100 for ya. Give me a hour or less and I‚Äôll jump online. What‚Äôs your gt
---
Indeed.
---
Does having the contractor perk make much difference?
---
It's effectively a quest reward, you get it added to your inventory along with whatever other things you earn for completing the 'quest' of completing the event.
---
Just like the other events are now (sometimes) awarding legendaries, only this one apparently is a guaranteed 3-star.
---
Rubber banding.  When I use my shotgun in ACP, the Spawn take exactly two torso shots to kill. It kicks me out after the first, because it's exactly the amount to "kill" it.  If I drink a ballistic bock first, they stay dead.  I'm guessing it's because the damage threshold is passed for death long enough, but it's a theory without evidence.
---
Edit: missing comma
---
I added you! I‚Äôm chiken
---
This.  I want some death tambo skins! My bloodied death tambo is boring the hell out of me. I want a cowbell skin!
---
Yes, it is, at least in PS4. Can't talk about PC. I of course recommend not using Wi-Fi, but a real, old-school cable.
---
Well id rather just have a farming method again lol. I like making them üòÇ
---
Well, I won't complete it since I started to play a couple weeks ago (now level 62), but at least I made it through half of the  chapter 2 part of the Legendary Run
---
Why would that keep them from being able to use music that's already in the game? Is the bureaucracy really bad enough that it limits which model radio can play what?
---
clowns
---
I think I ate one once.  Whats sp great about those things anyway?
---
I'm sure it was a high level with nothing else to spend caps on, just looking to do something funny.
---
I'm tired of jumping server after server finding 1 or 2 teams with 1 or 2 people doing pretty much nothing .
---
I hope they drop the bombs on you
---
It makes building cheaper
---
Lol okay. I get all mine from doing events all the low level areas seem to give out stims or supers
---
It‚Äôs one of those songs from childhood that I just had to use. (It was on a sing a long vhs we had on repeat)
---
That‚Äôs so fun! I‚Äôm a huge camping nerd, both in Fallout 76 and out, haha! I always tell people who want to get into camping to check out REI‚Äôs website, they have wonderful checklists and articles to get people started. Packing always stresses me out no matter how much I do it haha, so it‚Äôs nice that there‚Äôs a checklist for all the stuff you‚Äôd want to bring. And then I recommend going to a nice state campground or using the app Hipcamp (it‚Äôs basically AirBnb for campsites!) to find a place to go.
---
Thanks that worked for me!
---
Yea it makes me feel like some kind of doctor when i make them üòÇ
---
I was thinking that because you‚Äôre using say half the materials it takes half the space up
---
Doing the event twice a day means I am selling enough acid, fiberglass and screws to reach the 1400 limit eaaaaasily.
---
Codes reset every Tuesday at 8PM Eastern Time (GMT-0400). When this weekly reset happens, sit tight for 2 hrs or so before using nukacrypt to find the refreshed nuke codes.
---
Because the new owner of the music may not want to it to be played without being payed more money. Things change, I really don't know the details.
---
I love the toaster from NV so much.
---
Omg Right? That would be the perfect NPC to distribute it too, "I picked up blips of a new record on the scanner, go check it out" sort of thing
---
It doesn't happen every event just when the specific weapons or conditions are met.
---
Two Shot weapons degrade fast as hell. Especially if its explosive or has a 25%FFR. So anybody who uses those must be constantly repairing them.
---
I have multiple explosive weapons I want gone out of my inventory. Problem is I doubt ill get the non explosive variant in return.
---
My camp is about 300m from there on a lead deposit. Great spot.
---
Was one of them cursed?
---
They‚Äôre ‚Äòrare‚Äô of you try to get them from the machines. 
---
If you know where the static spawn is, they aren‚Äôt rare.
---
It‚Äôs irritating, which is why I traded mine away.
---
I was wondering why I was lagging and then when I was looting, I started seeing ash piles... And those ash piles also hid meat piles. I had to find that single pixel on the edge of the ash pile where the meat pile is lootable.
---
Thank you so much for the suggestion. I‚Äôll check out the app ASAP. Curious what‚Äôs in the area and what‚Äôs interesting.
---
It's already being played?
---
How are you supposed to find these out in game, anyways?
---
They're super rare.  Like a 1/1000 drop
---
some of us have other shit we need to do, my dude
---
Tea Time. That event spawns a lot of Ticks at the Water Tower pipe. Make sure you add in Chemist &amp; Super Duper 3 when crafting for maximum yield.
---
You get a decent amount from looting wendigos during ACP.
---
So did you already complete the quest? I can‚Äôt tell what your issue is from your post.
---
I'd like to see it I have a somewhat Halloween base
---
Do riding shotgun.  It's easy and almost all the enemies drop stims.
---
Add me up if your on xbox. In the UK but I'm always looking to drop some nukes/Shoot that skanky bat thing in the face. level 285/200 Commando/Heavy
---
Same name as on here
---
Chuck Norris doesn‚Äôt have a Wendigo Rug. It is still alive it‚Äôs just to scared to move.
---
Then go for mamologist!
---
Encrypted has water and people are domed all the time in that event btw
---
Ahhh one of my favorite rabbit holes is browsing that app! And NP hope you have fun, you can always look me up and shoot me a msg if you want more camping advice when the time comes :)
---
Yep, got the cursed harpoon gun for completing the event. Got T fire axe off earles body. Got the fixer as I transitioned out of the cave, then the event completed and got the harpoon gun.
---
Cool I will
---
This. As far as I know, most of us were not aware of any way to reliably do 3 primal cuts at a time on a single character.
---
So it looks like nuke crypt made an oopsie they swapped the alpha and Charlie codes around
---
It actually says "Sleazy Heart Bed", but your point is still very valid.
---
But if they (Bethesda) sold a device (new jukebox) in the Atom shop that made money (real money) because it had particular song or songs on it. The original holder of the licensed song may, and most likely would want a cut.
---
I started a colossal problem and no one joined in. I almost killed it to but he started falling through the ground. So im good
---
Hopefully a new tent. /s
---
No, teslas cause actual bugs and start to break events. Like, everything turns pixelated and the word "chain" appears everywhere . Legacies cause temporary lag because of all the explosions, but they don't break anything.
---
Funny thing. I have another one that I am putting in tonight. üòù
---
? Doesn't happen with me, it seems rn it's just teslas. Legacies lag the game if you get shot with them.
---
That was easy, 5000 daily x 7 + 16000 of weekly's.  Also, the total score to get from level 1 to 100 was about 220k, if you were curious.
---
Haha, yeah, I guess that is kinda what I was asking for. 
---
But it‚Äôs all about aesthetic. The bear arm is just a big gnarly skull you wear on your arm, whereas I‚Äôm more imagining a bear claw, more akin to the death-claw gauntlet. I just feel like it would look a lot better than my current set up, but I see your point!
---
Ts adds minimal damage to shotguns compared to other weapons while adding a massive accuracy penalty. 
---
There's better options.
---
Whatever happened to a scheduled nuke falling on Earle? I thought that was going to be a thing
---
I hope you sell that one as well. 
---
I've got 25 for sale at 250 each and they've been sitting there for months. I think I'm just going to start handing them out to low levels.
---
I‚Äôve done the event 20-25 times. I‚Äôve only seen this glitch like 5 times? And even if that‚Äôs your issue, you‚Äôre there to farm... you don‚Äôt need to complete the event.
---
Why not? Stalkers is the perk
---
Yea but i wanted to solo a world boss and feel good about myself
---
This is awesome.
---
Instead of this masterpiece we got the random meme stuff that Bethesda thinks we want for some reason.
---
I believe this to be true.

Wouldn't happen to have a YouTube link to the song? (Vhs? Lol, how many people remember them I wonderüòÅ)
---
Looking forward to the Halloween event this year as I missed last year üéÉ
---
Too tedious.
---
Just experienced this glitch and went immediately to Reddit! Lol
---
&gt;Is it just me who preferred Mugsy?
---
That seed machine aroused my many tiny penises on my hands and feet.
---
Try it again. Invite a friend.
---
It's more complicated than that.
---
It‚Äôs called Grim Grinning Ghosts :)
---
Oh damn, you‚Äôre right. In thought it had said valentines before.
---
All of my friends are too casual lmao
---
Thanks!
---
Stop by anytime
---
If that's too tedious then you must have a really short attention span üòÇ
---
Bruh he literally says that explosive miniguns are better because they double the fire rate
---
Just went. A bit disappointed with the terminal in there.
---
Exactly. There‚Äôs no need for a higher-res version of the icon when you wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell the difference anyways.
---

---
I've had to do this with every garage I find!
---
I won't be on till tomorrow but I'll pm you my psn so you can add me so I can see your camp
---
It is if you put the accelerated barrel on it. It might work either way considering the explosive effect
---
Thank you, kind sir or maam! I just wasted 4 cards trying to get a Earl run going... 
---
Also, I can definitely confirm that the nukacrypt codes for all 3 silos are wrong right now. Please upvote the OP so people know about this!
---
It drops to like 5fps, the audio even lags
---
Thank you :)
---
Is it better with accelerated? Feel like I'm doing something wrong
---
You need to test any gun you think is magic.  Stalkers is.  You can put and accelerated barrel on there for a faster fire rate.  Im not sure but i think the explosive effect may screw with it though.
---
Angry turtle said yeah but it doesn't feel like it so much
---
üëç
---
I got a chally backpack plan for 20 caps :)))
---
Well that's the proper way to complet it though.
---
In my case, i came back on the game 2 weeks ago, after 2 months away playing Destiny 2. I really would like to get my hands on that secret door, at the end of the legendary run, for my secret Enclave base. 
---
I'm not gonna lie it starts to drain me a lil. I like doing stuff at my pace, playing on different characters, testing different builds, working on my characters camp. And i can't right now. It starts to drain me.
---
But today i realised i'll not be able to finish it, the presure started to go down. I'm just excited for the next season so I can do stuff at my own pace and unlock everything while enjoying the game as i like to. I just hope i'll eventualy be able to get that secret door one of there days.
---
All that just to say that...most of us aren't rushing the legedary run for nothing and it's definitely not the proper way to do it...
---
SO THATS WHERE MY CAMP BUDGET WENT
---
I feel like the guys making wastelanders just finished watching bandersnatch on netflix and realized it is so much easier if you only write line for a single ending and giving users a choice makes them feel like it could have been different.
---
Yeah try putting it on. Any minigun with that barrel has over 200 fire rate. Angry turtle shows that with a vampires bashing damage minigun in his video
---
The health rubber banding causes this to happen to me a lot. I run a stealth vats build and vats closes after 1 shot or a crit, even though the mob won't be dead. Gun-fu might be a work around since it's supposed to target another enemy, but I haven't tried since I'm wanting to save my perks for legendaries
---
3 legendaries possible/normal
---
1 off earl
---
1 as a event reward 
---
1 as cursed weapon reward
---
If you carry 34+ stims then pharmacy gives you more benefit, plus you don‚Äôt have the hideous DR/RR penalties. That isn‚Äôt even considering any other chems. Super stims are 1.5 weight each without reduction...
---
Chems drop like candy. You must be dropping them every 5 minutes if you don‚Äôt see the benefit in pharmacy reduction.
---
Angry turtle does a great video on damage resistance and diminishing returns. Once you hit around 425 resistance, further gains are tiny. A full set of vanguard SS armour is over 425. So it‚Äôs better to use perk cards that add to damage at that point. And my advice is to never carry junk, it‚Äôs heavy, you lose it when you die, pointless to keep it with you. I love fallout 1st for this, when I get some junk I put down my tent and add it to my unlimited stash box.....
---
Muggy I have returned...... I bought coffee cups
---
Was an old bug where some daily quests were granting perk card packs in nw
---
It's not you. For whatever reason the cursor speed went down  the drain and lags to all hell, which wasn't the case when the season first started. You can see the damn thing stuttering while the audio lags behind in the menu too. Was frustrating as all hell before I finished and never had to go back to it. Hoping they fix it next season.
---
Sad day! Nukacrypt has never failed me until today!
---
I stand behind this. Also, thwy should do what practically any other online RPG does and allow for vanity options that way you can wear what you want but still get the DT from armor you own
---
Also your internet speed/ server latency is a factor.  When i am on my wifi the magic effect doesnt trigger most of the time.  But when I am on a Lan cable, I can get it to trigger almost always.
---
I would like better things than the workbench or sleazy bed... more outfits!
---
What do you mean? My Tesla is literally the only weapon that works against anything. It does twice the damage of my higher lvl/star weapons so it's all I use now
---
Looks like nukacrypt updated theirs and they match now.
---
I just use power armor for battle, I'm over encumbered while wearing it but I don't need to be that mobile in Power Armor as I can just run around with unyielding, a backpack and either a gattling gun or plasma Caster outside of power armor.
---
You deserve to be nuked.
---
yeah its a bug.  just roll with it.  It will make up for when you get the SCORE auto complete bug.
---
I've gotten 5 from the machines but there's also a spawn on top of the westek bundling if i remember correctly so not really "rare" if you know where to look.
---
Yup, I‚Äôm super casual, don‚Äôt play NW, and often didn‚Äôt even look at what the challenges were. I‚Äôm like two spaces away from the end.
---
Glad you pointed this place out. It's always happening. I stumbled upon a war between mutants, blood eagles and a sheepsquatch all duking it out among the odd car explosion.   
---
If you're getting staggered by the sheepsquatch, enter the info center to shoot it; can't reach you and it will try to attack you anyway,
---
Welp. There goes my atoms. And gold. Does the jetpack stay when you change the paint?
---
Lol. It was clearly marked.
---
46 pieces or more gives you the max.  You should not be carrying junk though, this is why it is useless.  If you are scrap farming, when you have cleared an area immediately go to a stash box and dump it all.  If you run out of stash space then carry your extra aid items or even weapons and armour, not your junk.  There are perks or backpack and armour mods to reduce the weight of these things.  Never keep your junk on you.
---
If you really feel you need the DR there are much better options.  Barbarian if you are a high Str build, Evasive in Agi, Ironclad in End.  Without knowing your build or what you are gearing towards it is hard to recommend anything.
---
U know those ghoul officers with the backpacks that have the red blinking light on them? They drop code pieces. Not sure how many pieces it takes but you gather all the pieces for a silo and then decrypt it I guess. I believe there are a couple of walk-throughs that tell you how to figure it out if you want to do it just so you can say you did. Personally, never have
---
That's a good idea. It made me think about a cargo bot, like the one you destroy to get nuclear keycards. Throw a cargobot grenade wherever you are and it comes down to you with the 200u shared stash.
---
Wow I didn't know the total was 220k
---
Makes you realize why are there bundles of repair kits in the atom store.
---
I think I added you to the chat
---
Nukacrypt codes worked just fine for me and I used them before you posted this

---
I'm betting you've played A Colossal Problem since the last time you played NW. There's a connection there.
---
I just do heavy machine gun with spotlights by them. They do well.
---
Just put a couple in your camp
---
I feel the same, really like the armor bench design. Would look good to have them all matching if possible.
---
And risk getting banned? No thanks.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
any gun can be magic with a 15% block effect on armor, I've found explosive can mess with it, just a simple vampires ffr with accel barrel does the most damage i've found, even more than just a one star bloodied with accel barrel.  Minigun does seem to be the best since you need to hit the same area to trigger it and it has the least spread.  LMG can be great, but you need to keep it from walking all over.
---
I just bought a roll of toilet paper for 15k out of bordem. They really need to raise the fucking caps limit. 30k is a joke.
---
I‚Äôm on my 2nd Month of first. It‚Äôll be my last. What would get me to keep it?
---
If we had larger camp budget - maybe.
---
If our private worlds were persistent so I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs a waste to claim a workshop - probably.
---
If our ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù was across all zenimax games (so hop between TESO and f76 from time to time) - probably.
---
I really don‚Äôt find the first benefit great - and actually the scrap box is kinda a scummy way to make people feel it‚Äôs essential.
---
The building set has never been sold outside of the bundle and probably never will
---
Grow up simp.
---
What do you play on, PS4?
---
I have been playing on and off since launch. And only couple days ago i got one from the vendor machine, in Watoga. 
---
"YEAH! Who won the lottery? I did!" said i and our lucky friend from Nipton before running into Giant Radscorpion home base.
---
Also there is fixed world spawn for it, if you know where to look.
---
I haven‚Äôt tested that yet but when you put the mod on it paints the piece so it might not but idk for sure
---
Nahh doubt you can get banned for that mostly for duping and god mode
---
Nice.  I‚Äôll check this out.
---
&gt;  -but for some people they were legitimate weapons that they spent time grinding for.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; There is no way those should be removed ..
---
&gt;
---
&gt; Sure if Bethesda can locate and remove dupes that is one thing but removing legitimate weapons Is the start of a lot of issues...
---
Like what? 
---
Doesn't make much sense to me. Just cause you got a broken/overpowered item legitimately doesn't mean it shouldn't be nerfed/changed/replaced.
---
Problematic items should be removed/changed. Warframe went through a similar thing with their Riven mods. I know for damn sure that WoW still going through it every time a new gear-grind update hits.
---
Impressive! I got mine with the first ticket I used.
---
I got a temp ban for being gifted a weapon, and I've seen people get banned for having the blueprint for that ammo factory!
---
If you are in need, and on PC, hit me up, ill drop you 100 for free. I dont know what to do with them anymore, i dilute 100 for myself and that lasts a long while, since im bloodied build, i dont get to use them that much.
---
I always do archer, athlete and hunter. They're short and relatively fun. For archer, bashing stuff with a crossbow counts towards your kills and degrades the crossbow quickly, so you can repair it. Head to Morgantown for lots of scorched and feral trash mobs to kill.
---
What do you mean by magic in vats? I have the harpoon with flechette but it‚Äôs just ok.
---
Im running four machines ill see if I get suspended but I doubt it
---
Bethesda - "You have the bottomless Scrapbox &amp; Tents, shut the hell &amp; be happy plebs"
---
Oh ok, thanks. Done the event about 8 times, first time getting 3 legendaries.
---
Lately, Forest because I like stocking my vending machine with some stuff for low level folks and I don‚Äôt have to worry about getting nuked. 
---
For a while I had my camp way over on the east edge of the map north of Tanagra (for farming acid) and it was surprisingly quiet.
---
Yah. I agree. I have bought every serum recipe but one. Running out of stuff to buy other than ammo from player vendors.
---
Imagine riding into blast zone like that, while everyone is blasting at SBQ. I think even she would stop in mid-air to have a WTF moment.
---
Especially since it tethers all of the enemies together so I can take down multiple at once
---
I am pretty sure the raider power armour or even the junkyard is a low level
---
actually its making me really interested when it comes out this month (I think) and plan to make a new character and turn my old one into a full crafter
---
Why not? The Tesla is stronger than half my higher level weapons right now
---
Track down code pieces from Scorched Officers, then deduce the number sequence after typing figure out the right letter word.
---
Sure
---
5000 is the limit...so no "we can never have enough gold" ...because of bethesdas mobile game rules and timegates. As I sit on 1200 treasury notes....up the limit BGS, enough with only turning 20 notes in a day bullshit... I would like to turn all these in someday....
---
Ts is ok for very high damage weapons, but really hampers low damage per projectile weapons against armor. I haven't unlocked the gauss shotgun on my shotgunner yet but so far the best shotgun I've used/run the numbers for is a quad double-barrel.
---
Raider PA can be used at 15.    Camden park is a good place to find some.
---
You are not missing anything. I bought them as soon as I saw them, but they are hidden under armour, don't work as an outfit. 
---
Also, they are considered casual, so shielding them gives the same benefits as a shielded Vault 76 jumpsuit.
---
I think even t45 is gated too level 25; at which point, might as well get excavator (the quest miner miracles). In the meantime Blackwater mine has a pa frame, that sometimes has raider pieces, and is a good place to farm black titanium. Also gorge junkyard has a titanium deposit.
---
Are you kidding me?? I heard Earle pisses his non existent pants when he sees a white fedora.
---
In my experience, not building turrets may actually lessen the chance of aggro-ing mobs. And their range sucks anyways and take up lots  of budget.
---
Try to give that spot another chance. That lead node imo is the best camp spot for a mid-late game build. I camped there for many months when I was lvl ~150-300. The routine everytime i start the game would be to get the lead scrap, then head north, join the event (very often are the faction rep event or a sheepsquatch spawn). Get the nukacolas. Head north, clear the blood eagle camp, kill the static deathclaw spawn nearby, the you reach westek. A very efficient xp farming route.
---
I feel like this post is indicative of the kind of jerks who are most vocal in this community. Everyone constantly crybabying about how they couldn't collect 500 screws (that they'll mark up 500% in vendors) on their 50th run through the event or how lower levels should just sit it out despite all the try hards having their "magic weapons" that can annihilate everything in 2 minutes. Play how you want, use whatever weapon you feel like. People like this don't own the game.
---
Sad thing is, you probably felt smart typing that.
---
I‚Äôve been thinking about building in the forest and starting a store of sorts. I have a couple idea swirling around!
---
If I can aim with a 10mm perfectly fine, then I'm only using it for the fact that it tethers all the nearby enemies so I get a 2 for 1 when I break it out
---
Not everything camp-related from the season is for sale though, but chicken coop is definitely there and also lunchboxes.
---
First at your level there is only the raider one that you can actually use, next in line is T-45, but in both cases you need to find them low level but they can spawn any level. Best bet is to ask someone to craft you a whole Raider level 15 one, or that you wait for the one level 25. In theory you could start thinking and heading for the Excavator one also since you basically get a complete one (or the plans can't remember) doing the quest for it.
---
Fun Fact: To save up space you can remove pieces from frames, go in frame to take ownership. Get out of it, put pieces in it and voila, you can stash pieces of any level in frames no matter what.
---
Everyone else can pressure the devs to fix their busted ass game.
---
I'm trying to get a full set of heavy metal armor with decent legendary perks 
---
If player vendors didn't exist I would be going insane trying to do so lol
---
Recall Keycards are a good purchase if you run out of things to buy.
---
Dollar Bill Blues - Townes Van Zandt
---
Thing is, I have one for sale and throw away the rest: I save the scrip for heavy items. 
---
Three successful events mean hitting the limit. The rest is sold to the boys at Foundation for 30 caps.
---
There a pie vending machines all over. Mumbles even has one in her shop.
---
switching guns while in a large fight like sbq or earl can cause your guns to get this glitch with out you trying to do it. one of the biggest things that causes problems in this game is lag 
---
remember that before trying to assign blame to someone for the glitches in this game we all have to deal with
---
I don‚Äôt like doing Encryptid as a Bloodied Commando.
---
i kind of agree with that tbh.
---
otherwise whats the point.
---
huge fan that they are sticking with bullion currency additions.
---
I agree with you but unfortunately we are in the minority, at least on this website. 
---
I look at it like...why the duck should they give us anything? We finished the season, we got all the prizes, end of story. People are so ducking entitled these days that they think they should get shit for just being alive. You received your rewards. Maybe next time don‚Äôt finish so fast or just enjoy the down time. The world is not going to cease to exist if you don‚Äôt play for a day or two if you are done and bored. Not to mention there are other things to do in the game.
---
It‚Äôs on PTS - I think it‚Äôs coming with the next update. I could be wrong though.
---
Sounds like we will be able to find the mole miner just about anywhere enemies spawn, not just the ash heap!
---
Yeah I‚Äôm just stuck on finding the camera I can‚Äôt find any accurate guides either
---
And the funniest part is that some of the best Fallout DLCs are not made by Bethesda.
---
I also dislike when there's an update and have to re-equip my flygirl emote.
---
I don't believe that you can use them at your level. I'm currently playing a character at level 18 with a full  set of raider power armor but my higher level character built it and had it muled over. I can craft you some things if you are on xbox, and if you can contribute to some of the resources needed. But as to where to find pieces, I can't help out much, because I never really pursued that with my primary character.
---
Yeah, ik, i got lucky on one there. Others, not so much.
---
Next up:
---
Maps full of players with non matching pa pieces. (Me being one of them)
---
Sounds like an o.c.d. nightmare!
---
Frame rate determines if it's going to go magic or not, magic kicks in around 50 fps
---
I'd be happy just getting my damn persistent workshops and expanded build budget... My anticipation for those features were the main reasons I signed up to begin with.
---
Two or three decent players can do it. You need to have roles and stay organised. It will take some time, but it will happen. 
---
Also, smart perk usage can make a difference. Share healing, keep the mysterious stranger close, etc.
---
I have very slow internet and still manage to play. You'll likely experience rubber banding and lots of "waiting for server" notifications - doesn't stop me though!
---
You don't need a camera for those three, but if you get wastelanders started Davenport will tell you to check your camp terminal for the camera quest start location.
---
Tesla‚Äôs have been broken since last patch. You and anyone that uses them knows they ruin events and break servers with lag.. so why are you trying to justify that to me. Explain it to the poor bastards that have to deal with it when they are stuck in an event with you and your Tesla makes the lag so bad they can‚Äôt shoot anything. Tesla‚Äôs are trash for trash players
---
Never seen that
---
I'd be so happy if the mini nuke plants were added back as well. It's been so long since their last appearance.
---
If you still need one and you're on PS4 add xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero). My vending machines have multiples and I'm happy to cut a better deal if you show up &amp; send me a message =\]  
---
PSN GISchmo is a camp neighbor who also has multiple as I type this &amp; I know he's also quite happy to be added for purposes of vending, heh...
---
I didn't even know they were broken or that they cause lag since I mainly play solo, I just knew they are a good gun to get rid of a crowd quickly ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Cliffwatch is the best place, but is likely to take you 20-50 server hops, FYI [https://youtu.be/l7NadAG6wlI](https://youtu.be/l7NadAG6wlI)
---
The left arm and left leg are the hardest to get it to spawn. Just keep server hoping you will eventually get it, but can be very tedious .. there are some other places, like the truck at Georges workshop, the mountains behind fort pricket also has a truck which is locked and Camden park but in my experience cliff watch is the easiest and least work to get it. What platform are you on. You might just want to ask someone on LFM first or the check the marketplace to see if someone is willing to sell you a set for cheap, this would be the least frustrating way.
---
It says 9.8....
---
Clearly says 9.8 though?
---
Jesus thank you I was getting frustrated it wasn‚Äôt showing up in my terminal. Gotta do the wastelanders thing then
---
If you‚Äôve used it in any event since the update then your playing dumb. The lag gets so bad so fast. Just don‚Äôt do it
---
I recently discovered the Red Rocket garage's rocket, that is on the roof, actually has a flaming effect on it. I was saying to myself "hmm I really like this garage but that door issue isn't worth the hassle or the price"
---
  
---
Yeah they really need to fix this. I feel sorry for anyone who spent real life $$ on the garage and didn't realize this problem.
---
So basically it makes you Iron Man.
---
It says 90% reduced weight.
---
Perhaps
---
I don‚Äôt know what you mean by ‚Äúworth it‚Äù. If you want  mods for scout armor it‚Äôs the only place to go, same with serum recipes. I would never buy specific serums though, those are overpriced.
---
Reading... is uh... hard?
---
After the 90% weight reduction.
---
Mods not count towards the 90%
---
I don't understand why the hell they make the Jukebox play classical. Like no jukebox ever plays classical. I love the aesthetic but I don't want it constantly pumping classical music in my CAMP. 
---
And it's a Jukebox. Which implies multiple music choices. Yet we only get one. 2 radios. One Jukebox. Why.
---
Because you didn't read the 90% reduced weight?
---
You have the healing factor mutation?
---
Ahh this makes sense!
---
Yeah, if you‚Äôre shopping here for serums you‚Äôre losing caps. A lot of people sell serums for ~500 caps
---
It's okay, but they really need to up their game on the free items for subscribers. And why they aren't putting them under the fallout 1st section is just weird.
---
Mire, ambience is pretty amazing
---
Thanks for sharing I just tried this...too bad camo is kinda ugly but the only skin change that worked for me was captain cosmos...
---
On a post earlier people said magic armor does not work on anything but shotguns.
---
Until One Wasteland hits and then explosives will officially be useful for nothing but fireworks.

Oh, ok

Didn't realize we'd get double SCORE this week, only five more levels to go.
---
After I get to level 100, I want nothing to do with Fallout 76 until Season 2.
---
Not common, but it definitely happens.   
---
I vendor hop regularly. My motivation isn't as much about hunting for things that I need... I'm into building camps around in-game content so I like interesting &amp; unique camp builds. Most players who aren't pricing accurately are significantly overcharging vs undercharging... but not all. I've purchased all kinds of rare plans, outfits, etc. for shockingly low cap values. It's possible that those players are just trying to be kind and have an abundance of items. But I'm not buying them to resell them so it doesn't feel unethical... it's super exciting to find a crazy deal.   
---
I absolutely sold alllll kinds of legendaries that were worth significantly more than I was charging for them before I discovered fed76's pricing tool. At one point a guy actually got on the mic at my camp and yelled at me about how I was screwing up the economy. I assumed that meant he might have great items for sale so I got all excited and followed him to his camp... only to discover a bunch of the not-at-all-rare mounted head plans which he was attempting to sell for 300 caps and that sort of thing. I tried to tease him about it in a friendly way but he couldn't take the heat and immediately logged out =P
---
There are Enclave vendors?
---
What? I'm not
---
It is just really fancy plywood.
---
Actually he is doing the right thing. He only sells you 300 so you have no choice but to come back for more.
---
Any other weapons that work then? I'm literally level 80 and the only other decent weapon with a fast fire rate that I have is an Assassin's 10mm and it only does 1 damage a shot to Earl (I also thought the lag was just due to being there with 7 other players all shooting at him and the amount of wendigos that spawned. Like I said, I only ever played solo until recently. I also don't read the patch notes on every update)
---
I really liked the mire back when I played on console. It was constantly getting attacked by things like supermutants and deathclaws though. Started to get pretty old after awhile despite my love of the swamp environment.
---
In the toxic valley now. Nowhere near as cool but it's a lot more peaceful. Very rarely get attacked.
---
Raider only at ur level.  Check Camden Park, the underneath west side of Gorge Bridge, and try and fast travel up to the little arena by the cabins near Top of the World.  Offhand, those are the ones I know to check for Raider PA.  Might be some at the station by Mama Dolce's.   
---
 Otherwise, give someone mats to craft it for you or wait til you hit 25 for other PA to open up to you.
---
Well let me know what you are looking for I might have some
---
yes i do have that mutation
---
Reminds me of the far cry 5 shovel launcher.
---
Really tho. I'm only interested in playing legit but I've always wondered how bethesda can catch them
---
There is a low level Raider PA spawn in the top of the tallest building near the clarksburg shooting range, and there used to be one on the roof west of the (west) point pleasant bridge. I don't know if it still spawns or not since they updated the town to have Blood Eagles.
---
IIRC there might be one under the roller coaster at camden park.
---
Someone else already mentioned Cliffwatch.
---
Never built in the Mire. I have been tempted to build around the lake in the NE by the power plant!
---
I wasn‚Äôt even paying attention to that ngl. My bad

Lol. A right leg with -15% damage from X enemy with 25 poison resistance on pc
---
This.  At 25 go for the Excavator.  If you really need a jetpack, the Red Chinese Armor skin in the atom shop lets you apply a JP to the excavator.  It was there last week, not sure if it still is.
---
You mean you don't want 14 40mm grenades, 3 fragmentation grenades, and two fusion cores every time you finish line in the sand immediately making you over encumbered?
---
It is bugged.  Either get used to having to walk a distance and keep trying, or remove the mutation.
---
I've noticed this has happened to my vendors and displays during every ban wave but never randomly for me. Inventory scanning maybe? Not totally sure why ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I personally like it even if it‚Äôs bad. Sad it‚Äôs not close to the classic but I prefer it over those ugly disgusting dome ones. The only thing I want them to add is bubbles, and Appalachian radio to play when it‚Äôs on.

thank you for the help i appreciate it!
---
Lmg mini 50. Honestly if you don‚Äôt have much better weapons I don‚Äôt know what to say other than trade and vender hop. But yes your and everyone else‚Äôs Tesla‚Äôs create ridiculous amounts of lag. Don‚Äôt even have to be in an event man. Go to whitesprings and buck a Tesla, eventually you‚Äôll be at 2-5 frames and it‚Äôs unplayable
---
Can you break down the Be15rl acronym?
---
I just left the bog. The proximity to end game material, SBQ, and Fort Defiance were pretty nice.
---
Well thank you!
---
Lost 3 at alpha trying to figure out why then nukacrypt updated
---
Put in ticket tell them you want your atoms back they refund you
---
I tell them. You've been reported.
---
It‚Äôs a pain for me with four fully stocked vendors with discounted prices. I just threw it back in at default prices.
---
Thank YOU! My husband and I shout that phrase at each other all the time thanks to you haha! ü§óüíô
---
Would be cool if the lamp turned on/off.
---
It is speculated that there is some sort of bot that scans inventories and watches for certain items or multiple item gains within a short time that should be impossible.  Treasury Notes, Legendary Modules, Gold Bullion Weapons/Plans, etc. will get you hammered quickly it seems if you attempt to circumvent the legit system of obtaining them.
---
I'm sure there are many ways they track this other than that though.
---
Yes. In the Enclave bunker. 
---
Long ago, each vendor faction only carried 200 caps and you have to visit all seven factions to get your daily 1400 caps. The Enclave was one of those vendor factions.
---
That's not very nice now is it
---
Five bucks says they wanted to name him Sonny but remembered they had three robots with the same name.
---
‚Äùdammit....just name him...Smiley, I guess?"
---
I don't have mine where I can post it but I'm fine with mine. I have seen all of the Legendary Perks and hope we get to choose these. I don't want some explosive or PA crap ones when I'm not going to use them.
---
I agree fallout 1st items should be put in the fallout out 1st section. If it wasn't for posts on here I'd probably would of missed out on items that where discounted for members. Should be made more clear.
---
Yeah, that's good they're adding something new to buy for players who don't know what else to buy. Lunchboxes would help a lot being an infinitely farmable resource starting next season. I used to consume them carefully previous season and ended up with 26 excess ones :D now I'll definitely play with guaranteed 2 hours of double xp every day (+ what new seasonal reward and previously stacked lunchboxes will give) and better xp rewards for lvl 75-100 mobs to finish that season in two weeks or so.
---
Me? For what
---
They can look at my account idc
---
Yes. It works by giving you a chance at 100% damage reduction (damage reduced to 0) when under the conditions.
---
Ok, so junk shield is bad for a few reasons:
---
1) it requires you to carry junk in order to work. This puts your junk at jeapordy constantly and is counterintuitive for fallout 1st.
---
2) it kicks in based on the amount of junk items in your inventory, rather than weight. You need 46+ items in your junk tab in order for it to work at max benefit.
---
3) the DR boost caps at 10/20/30, which is extremely meager for the weight of those items as well as DR calculation in general. The higher your DR goes, there is a point at which adding more becomes redundant. Enemy damage is generally low and you can reach that redundancy curve without DR perks  or effects like Vanguard/Bolstering.
---
Other rank 3 DR perks, like Barbarian, dwarf this at +80 DR. And keep in mind, I consider Barbarian to be a complete waste of perk points.
---
4) Enemies do not have any access to armor penetration like we do, so there's no reason to pad your DR. Colonel Gutsy is bugged to completely ignore 100% of your DR when firing his .44 combat rifle. No amount of DR will save you. Only damage reduction can let you tank more than 3-4 shots (in like 3 seconds) from max hp.
---
5) This very underpowered perk takes up slots in one of the most powerful perk trees. Taking this perk prevents you from taking other Luck perks which are insanely overpowered, like Serendipity, Starched Genes, Bloody Mess, Good with Salt, Better Criticals, Critical Savvy, etc
---
Even if you run a max HP build, using these 3 points to run Serendipy (100% damage reduction, 45% of the time) will be much more effective.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Junk_Shield#:~:text=A%20base%20Junk%20Shield%20perk,more%20pieces%20of%20junk%20carried.
---
Read this page for a list of other DR perks that you should never, ever take.
---
I was worried the other day cause I played through the reset. Nothing happened thankfully.
---
Bloodied Explosive +15 reload
---
spending 25.5k on something you can find for free in a fixed location is clown like behaviour you cannot change my mind.
---
And Bloodied explosive works but it's a slow reload so it's a nice perk.
---
Uh no.
---
One of my favourite builds was in the Ash Heap but I'm a compulsive CAMP relocater. üòÇ
---
As mentioned already bloodied is best for dps but you need to get the right perks for it and if you are a low lvl char there is a way to get a really good bloodied weapon for free. To do this you need to save the turn in for The Elusive Crane quest that is started at the wayward till you are level 50. The reason for this is at the end of that quest you get a token that can give you a 2 star legendary item that is around your level from 1 of multiple machines and each 1 gives a different item. The 2 handed melee machine is the one you want because it gives you a 2 star bloodied swing speed sledgehammer which is a really good weapon but even if you do not want to do melee build you can sell/trade this for a decent price (it is not named like most quest items and therefore people can not claim it is worth less then it is (most people will do this with quest items). At the moment I wrote this the [https://fed76.info](https://fed76.info) price for that weapon (99% of traders in the game agree that sites prices are accurate and fair) is currently Quick vendor sale price is probably around 7000. Finding right PC buyer could yield 13000-21000. Niche buyers could pay over 26000.
---
I usually set my price in between the quick vendor price and the low number on the pc buyer (that would be about 10000 caps using the info above). and I never have a problem selling my stuff (I sell it on discord and/or 1 of the fallout markets on reddit). Honestly, I never use bloodied for 2 reasons. 1st off I have set my perks with other things and dont want to lose anything and the second reason is bloodied is squishy for me (I perfer junkie).
---
Quick update: just ran the event with the asbestos lining chest mod, no fireproof (swapped it with revenant), and the event was considerably easier. The asbestos lining makes a massive difference.
---
I had this bug as well!
---
I am unarmed melee. One slide Earle is there, the next he's nowhere to be found.
---
Maybe you should have written something about it, honestly you come off as the idiot here
---
Had no choice but to read this in an NZ accent
---
That is so cute to me. I was half asleep and angry when I wrote that post. I expected to be ignored haha.
---
It's the frogs.
---
Even if the numbers are being faked it still shows Bethesda that for the right rewards and easy to obtain junk we will participate but if it's crazy and not worth it then we will pass.
---
Blame Bethesda for giving crap rewards in all the events except Earle and Scorched Earth.
---
Cooking badge is pretty easy if you plan your ingredient farming right!
---
Only level 43 here, me and a friend grinded all the way to seconds before the launch for some guys to come in and Jack it from me ...why wouldnt they stop this from happening, you shouldn't be able to waltz in at the end and launch
---
The enclave is part of the main quest
---
It tickled me pink! I think it's hilarious as fuck!
---
Seems like people are taking a break until the new score run comes.  Or earle.  But yeah I did uranium fever solo on a public server which is nuts.  
---
I still prefer the SBQ for the repair kits.
---
Because there was never a date stated when it would end other than "mid September". It could have got to the end and then still been active for another week or so for anyone knew.
---
The valley is good for all the over spawned animal hordes too lmao, I'm not there anymore but when I was it was meat week every week.
---
You definitely don't have to finish the main quest, you can go directly to the location in the mire and it should trigger it. What level are you ? You might have to do the first few missions at least, but might be worth going to the location, I forget the name, Abandoned something. Pretty sure I did it fairly early on in the game on my alt characters.
---
I place that last item in my camp, step back and think, ‚Äúwow, it‚Äôs perfect. Exactly what I envisioned... okay time to move!‚Äù
---
Unfortunately, no. Wish there was a discount for items already owned in bundles.
---
Hmmm it never occurred to me to sell notes..
---
Yup! This is me to a T.
---
I'm with you there it's alot harder to get legendaries to turn in when you have to farm them at random locations and hope for a spawn. And I actually like doing events...just not by myself.
---
Abandoned Waste Dump.  Kill the Deathclaws and loot the nests for the holotape that enables the elevator.  I won't spoil it by giving you any further info.  You can start it any time AFAIK.
---
I‚Äôve actually been doing all the other events BESIDES  acp...it‚Äôs too much of a drain on my resources
---
I built in the savage divide because the enemies are low level so my stuff doesn‚Äôt break a lot and I‚Äôm right next to atlas for the donations and I got a fair bit of vendor traffic after ACP dropped
---
Wait what, you dreamed about actually playing it? Whenever it's happened to me it's as if I'm actually in the world destroying the shit out of anyyhing as one normally does.
---
Hey please add me so I can check it out!! Psn is Daddy_Dani_
---
It‚Äôs going up on Atomic Shop tomorrow - LadyDevann confirmed earlier
---
I‚Äôm on my fourth month of 1st and not one tent has been available since I joined. If alternate tents are going to be a thing, it should be possible to get at least one without a time machine.
---
Sounds like you tagged them first at some point, and they were retaliating.  Keep pacifist on to prevent your issue from recurring.
---
"You're the Dumbass", "I'm Watching You" and "You have been Insulted" are the ones people buy.
---
I am currently Level 33, is that a high enough level? And thanks for letting me know about this.
---
I could have held your hand and said something about it, yes.  
---
But that doesn't change the fact that I was replying to someone that said, "reading is hard" despite them, in fact, NOT reading.
---
Thank you kind sir
---
Was sitting chilling watching X files and you made me go back on and check üòÇ I agree would be awesome if the lamp above the bench was brighter, there is a slight glow from it though. Similar to the tinker's workbench.
---
Good to know I‚Äôll check to see if I still have those... definitely have the insults...
---
&gt;Don't have pacifist on
---
This is the root of the issue.
---
Could we also get a Fallout 3 or NV styled Nuka Vending machine that doubles as a vendor? First off I loved its design compared to the Fallout 4 and 76's Nuka Cola Machines. Secondly I would just love the idea of some wastelander waltzing up to my soda machine, putting in some caps expecting to get a ice cold nuka cola or quantum, but getting chems, a legendary, etc.
---
That‚Äôs one of the events that you definitely should have Pacifist mode on for!
---
Your Rambo. Congrats man .
---
Would be nice to be able to turn on or off though.
---
Yeah I'm 3 away, so i should be able to finish it off on Saturday thankfully.
---
You don‚Äôt buy them from the shop, you get it from having fallout 1st a certain month. So they aren‚Äôt coming back
---
Oh, yeah! I forgot about those.
---
Yup, it's what my grandmother rocks.
---
I‚Äôm conflicted on this, should anything enclave related have a spoiler tag?
---
What is the CAMP module skin, is it like the train car or the bunker? I have this problem too and trying to fix it.
---
Your grandmother is awesome.
---
Yea, it kind of sucks, but st least it plays so quiet you hardly hear it's on. I bought the new one, it looks really cool. With my lead extractor, I can barely hear it.
---
Why, hello, "consequences of my own choices"!
---
Truth
---
Thanks. Probably did tag them with mini gun accidentally
---
Being centrally located is great for saving caps on travel!
---
You can never have too many NV nods.
---
Also, give me a holorifle. &lt;3
---
If you're on xbox you could buy a plan from me.
---
Has anyone every actually dreamt of being in the fallout universe? Just curious!
---
Yeah!
---
Why is there a random fusion generator on the trap
---
You should be fine, you going to need to take out 2 deathclaws or sneak past them. They generally only level 21 so not too hard.
---
Doesn't it make like 200 rounds an hour? It's a few seconds of shooting.
---
Nice work!
---
How much ammo did you go through?
---
ha.   Sleazy bed
---
Tbh they should just make the jetpack a limb mod. It's not as useful as emergency protocols and arm mods are barren.
---
Makes this grumpy old woman even grumpier, too.
---
I believe it's still random whether it spawns in any of the locations on your server, so you might have to check back at the terminal multiple times, but it beats having to server hop checking all of the locations by hand.
---
This is very tempting. I bought the red scare for excavator jetpack. Might buy this one so I can use other chest mods on t65.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt got much agility and core just get drained when using it so I‚Äôm prolly not gonna use it much until legendary perks are out
---
I rocketed up lvls with Events teams. If you are going to do events you may as well get extra xp
---
That is very impressive!! üî•üî•
---
Yeah I admitted I was wrong well before you shared this but thanks üëç
---
I knew it was you.  REPORTED.
---
Ummm i think around 1500 or so
---
Your FBI agent saw you and told Bethesda
---
GOD EXISTS.
---
Um
---
Rad. Congrats. My B2525 10mm pistol is my favorite gun. I love the smooth reload. Can bring down any enemy as you have clearly shown. üòÉ 
---
With B2525 everything you have you challenge yourself in the game these days. And even this gun is OP. Lol
---
I‚Äôm level 530 stealth commando and I still can‚Äôt get so many damn crits. Oh I love that sound but wish I heard it that much. 
---
I run crit savvy better crits etc. Secret? Is it Four leaf?
---
LOL
---
It just works.
---
I have a keycard and would like to participate, I‚Äôm a low level and from my last experience years ago I was obliterated by level 59 Gutsy robots :/
---
No problem. They are definitely there for me. The only thing I can think of is maybe they must be claimed at certain times? Like they are on offer and if you miss it, then you can't select it later?
---
As someone who‚Äôs done multiple low level play throughs of the game, I‚Äôm glad to see that low levels won‚Äôt be dealing with level 60 enemies *cough cough* **WHITESPRINGS** *cough cough*.
---
On the other hand, low level legendaries will practically cease to exist on the market.
---
&lt;sound of rubber gloves being equipped&gt;
---
Same. Went through way too much 308 rounds last time. And all I got were two pieces of shitty raider armor for my legendaries.
---
Avoid?! We're having pulled windego sandwiches tonight bois! *clack* *clack*
---
Hey man if your on PC feel free to add me :) I do all the events when I can SBQ/ACP/Encryptid and am more than happy to help ya through silos :-)
---
I think it must be that they are offered at certain times and if you don't claim it you miss out, maybe?
---
I'll try to get a photo tomorrow to show you guys what I see.
---
Go to Emmett Mountain Disposal Site. The friendly npcs in the hazmat suits can be killed. They do not fight back until they are very low health typically. They drop stimpaks, ammo, and almost always 2 weapons. Go inside and there is 3-4 more npcs and a workbench. Scrap the guns, hop servers and repeat. Good way to gain XP as well.
---
I had my camp on a lead deposit at the savage divide for over a year.
---
now at the forest.  almost 6 months now at tbe same spot. no nukes. no scorchbeasts. just crickets chirping, noobs hanging around, calm and quiet.
---
You can just make the ammo normally
---
I do this to annoy the hell out of high levels, I dont grief the lowers though, but the 300's who think their legacy plasma is good against queen who tag me get killed instantly
---
Thanks. Where in settings do u turn it on again?
---
Nice. Stealth is definitely the way to solo earle. Everything is practically blind in there. On the J pistol, do you notice "magic" damage? 
---
I ask because I wonder if you've noticed how much that contributed, since my QE 10mm will do tons of buggy damage if I have a 15% reduce damage while blocking armor piece on, despite the low fire rate.
---
Cirt savy rank 3 and 16 luck. Gets me a crit evwry third hit. 
---
30 luck will do the same thing without crit savy.
---
Crit meter fill formula is : luck x 1.5 + 5.
---
Lol that would make me feel hella bad lol
---
The game itself can be kind of a shit show, but what makes it fun for me is the great times I've had with my friend
---
I am!! My name is the same as Reddit. I‚Äôm on now, I work starting tomorrow but am usually off around 4pm Az time. lol.
---
Same lmao
---
Adding you. I‚Äôll be back in game tomorrow eve. But you can drop by anytime.
---
I‚Äôve been fortunate to never have this happen to me, the only thing I can suggest is joining a team that has a mic and ask them to come with you, they will be less likely to hijack your nuke run if they see a whole team of you :-)
---
It'd be sweet if they'd add the ability to scrap weapons and armor into the scrap box or a small scrap bench in the survival tent.
---
Thank you! Will do!
---
No magic for me, dont have a 15% peice right now, been rolling ss armor trying for a powered one. 
---
Ive been trying to get a a Two shot FFR lower vats 10mm to mess around out and see if i can tirgger the bug.
---
Sorry about that I forgot what sub I was in.
---
Game play I think. Settings isn't big, you'll find it.
---
I apologize from time to time but I am mostly dead inside now... Just like all those friendlies I murdered for their loot.
---
There‚Äôs no reason to keep collecting it. Don‚Äôt forget your sun screen.
---
What Gnarkole and AFUSMC74 said, it‚Äôs also worth mentioning you can start a quest for tracking down specific silo code pieces and a cargo bot which has a nuclear keycard from the terminal in the Command centre..? When you reach the rank of General for the Enclave at the Whitespring bunker :) I believe you need 7 pieces and one keycard
---
Yeah I‚Äôm all that. Feels like I don‚Äôt get the noise when it procs as much I‚Äôve seen like yours. My DMG melts so not sure.
---
People dont show up because bethesda has trained us to only play for dailies so there noone playing to show up to events. Honedtly i see 3 types of players nowadays. 1 type are the noobs, people still doing main and side quests actually enjoying the game necause they arent to the grind yet. They probably wont show up or if they do they arent much help. The second group of people are those who only focus on the legendary run and just do dailies and look for decent xp gains. Those people might show up to events but will probably keep server hopping westtek until they end up in a server with the SBQ or earl running. And then theres the people have nothing to do. These people usually just sit at their base and talk to people. Maybe theyll show up to earl if they can be bothered, but really nothing in the game excites them and they just sign in for the sake of liking the franchise. Eaither way you cut i havent really come across anyone excited to bounce from event to event in a long time.
---
It can happen with any event now.  We all get a chance for a purveyor pool drop from any event now.
---
Heres my build

Prime receiver plans drop from regular SBs, not just the Queen. You can also get them from the Atlas rewards.
---
Hey I friended u
---
And it‚Äôs not even close with other dlcs
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/excitement-nSkIv4g54tFni
---
If you have the plans to make a .50 cal prime reciever, you can make ultracite ammo. All you need is stable flux, which anyone can make at any time if you have mats.
---
Ok thank you...and my skin type is burn in the shade so I‚Äôve got my SPF 60!
---
Alright I‚Äôll add you back :) I‚Äôm not on tonight but will be back on tomorrow we have a discord as well if you want to DM me your username I‚Äôll send you an invite as in game voice is terrible lol
---
My ffr junkies handmade makes me want to cry with how many repair kits I've used on it.
---
I don't do Line in the Sand or Uranium Fever any more unless I'm on a private server and need steel.
---
Line in the sand is way too long and rewards nothing of use except the random crappy legendary and a bunch of junk. I have enough nocturnal lead pipes and get tired of waiting for the SB to quit hiding behind the building or disappearing altogether.
---
Uranium Fever is a good event with generally good rewards, but the supervisors are way too squishy and some knob always yeets them in one shot.   They should make the Legendary Supervisors much, much stronger.
---
Radiation Rumble is a pain to solo, and the chance of high tier rewards only exists if you have a good team of 3+.  It could be good, but needs tweaking.  At least you usually pick up some good scrip by doing it but it takes a lot of ammo.
---
Project Paradise.. Same as Radiation Rumble.  People get out of the habit of doing it because the chance of failure is so high unless the team is solid.  Of course you can solo it, but only for lower tier rewards.
---
The rest of the events are generally underleveled 1\* crap and T-Notes which I just don't need.  Maybe One Wasteland will change that.  As it stands, sadly I get far better rewards by just farming the DMV.
---
It has a bunch of stuff I generally like doing in video games.
---
None - it's quite nice.  Don't forget to redownload the space suit outfit reward again if it looks possible.  They fixed the helmets finally but it needs to be claimed  again from the game board if you claimed it before the fix.
---
Now get out there in nature!
---
I prefer the ads on a Fallout Spotify playlist over listening to Julie talking about Butcher Pete in the middle of Country Roads
---
Makes sense can't believe this hasn't happened with Earl can't see squat in there most of the time
---
Vendor hopping to players with big amounts of plans will probably be much faster tbh
---
That's not bad at all. I had an instance where it was just me and two level 20s. I managed to bring him down at the price of 5k 50 Cal
---
Thanks for that.üëç
---
To be honest, I only want 19 and 50.
---
Wow would not have guessed your perception and no nerd rage? Good for you mate.
---
As they're probably trying to save your butt from the ground creatures and you accidentally get tagged nice way to say thanks
---
Hm.
---
The main gimmick of being multiplayer Fallout 4. It just works for me and I like being able to play with family and my SO.
---
That's really silly that you would put yourself through doing all that and not enjoy the rewards from completing it at all lol
---
Thank you! And I shall! I may get lightheaded from fresh oxygen lol
---
The Fallout universe. Feels close enough to Fallout 4 with its graphics items and mechanics. Extends the wacky lore of the universe, even if occasionally needing to retcon stuff, that I've loved learning about through all the games (except tactics. Only one I couldn't enjoy).
---
I did a uranium fever event with one other person - it was quite pleasant actually.  I think I prefer it.
---
no lmao, they just shoot the queen. most people dont care about ground adds.
---
I came into ACP with a similar gameplay as SE: bring a reduced weight heavy, unload for a couple of reloads, then kill adds and revive people.
---
There are no perches to get your 1k damage.
---
I was forced out of my comfort zone and had to think on my feet. I failed. OFTEN.
---
I saw a 60 second respawn timer.  I loved the whole experience outside of that.
---
No, I just don't want to deal with that while fighting a boss.  I'd rather just make enough ammo considering how easy ammo is to make.
---
because with earle, you're always put in the event, but sometimes at the queen fight it wont count you in the event so you can pvp
---
The little item you first place down when allocating your new CAMP location. The same item you can use to enter build mode or Repair all of your broken stuff. There was a skin for it that was a reward for the legendary run, it has to be unequipped from the Atomic Shop and then the Camp needs to be moved.
---
I believe that isn't guaranteed any more.
---
What would we farm him for?
---
Wdym you're not interested in my 32 regular pipe rifles
---
Are you on PS4? If so I can check I got the plan and you can have it
---
they always go for the damn fusion generator
---
Yea thats definitely one nice thing about 10mm. With ammo smith you get 172 rounds of ultracite 10mm, and it uses yellowcake which is super easy to farm at whitesprings. Crits and sneak damage are thenonly things keeping my rohnd count lower.
---
I'm trying to figure this out as well.
---
I mentioned this to my bro the other day, a little workbench that u can scrap all the assault rifles/armour you get from super mutants etc. Would be a great addition to the tents, especially at scorched earth event lol. One day.....üòÅ
---
Sometimes when I hear her say the thing about anything goes getting stuck on repeat if she never fixed it up, I wish it happened
---
He can sell rare outfits like the Hunter long coat, tattered field jacket, clean ranger outfit and hat, clean spacesuit and helmet, clean straight jacket, winter jacket and jeans.
---
For those that like to collect these things
---
Also his loot list is character based, so if someone holds him, you can log in with different characters for a better chance at getting something.
---
Sounds dope I‚Äôm boutta slide
---
Kind of underwhelming
---
You need 8 pieces and a keycard. And you need the word on the whiteboard for the specific silo. It's actually quite complicated. Here is a link to the process -

[Nuke Codes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ygyy9/stepbystep_guide_to_decrypting_launch_codes/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Rambo would do it with a bow.. just sayin
---
As gross marketing mechanics go, I really don't find this one to be that insidious or obnoxious. I'm 100% in the 'its annoying' column, but to me its sort of like TV commercials or reddit ads - they are annoying but it's part of how they fund the content I am interested in.
---
Yeahp. It's been maybe 20 years since that happened: playing in my dreams.
---
It would be a waste of time.  The first bit of new content after a complete bug fix would just introduce new bugs and we‚Äôd be back to square one.
---
Add me as a friend and come join me, fast travel to me and we can hold him to try and get the best loot possible. One person holds him when each of us switches characters
---
Well your post says 98 pounds not 9.8 pounds.
---
What needs to be rebalanced in Colossal Problem?
---
What, you didn't want a free vibrating love bed that doesn't vibrate?
---
Main reason I don‚Äôt do either of those is that they aren‚Äôt worth the effort to me. Leveling up is hardly worth my time on my level 200, and my level 63 has cleared all quests and just needs lead and to build a home. 
---
One Wasteland will help with Uranium, at least. Always max level legendaries x 3.
---
?
---
I bought it too, sitting on a pile of atoms thanks to 1st subscription and I like the look of the new jukebox, and it takes up less space in my camp
---
Maybe they should allow the game to be played on private servers where a moderator could actively ban accounts. Basically what Bethesda should already be doing if presented with evidence.
---
Not unless they thoroughly evaluate their development procedures, because right now it doesn‚Äôt seem like they test anything they put out. How did the Chinese Bunker set and the Ounce of Prevention quest pass through QA?
---
I hope so ü§û. Scavenging would be ultra efficient
---
Beats work dreams that's for sure, have you had them from 1st person perspective also or just like that? Genuinely curious as dreams are an interesting thing so under studied.
---
I need to get a couple more of the rarer Nuka Colas for my Collector Possum Badge, so this information is very helpful, thanks!
---
Uh huh. Except for cores. They're a pain in the ass. The mats are much more valuable for other things, especially ultracite cores which this trick *should* work with fine. I'd much rather take two seconds to drop a core after reloading than waste 2 pure cobalt, 2 pure crimson, 2 pure fluorescent, 4 violet and 2 yellowcake flux, plus a piece of ultracite just to make an ultracite core from scratch. That's why I will basically burn the better part of a day sitting at Poseidon on a private world generating fusion cores. Not everyone has that kind of time to burn, nor the time to farm all of the pure fluxes.   
---
I suppose you could do FC runs and hit all of the generators and power armor laying around for a dozen half used cores, but fuck that... That's what you do at level 25 to keep raider armor running lol. 
---
Edited to clarify the mats for making an ultracite core from scratch, which means making 2 regular cores from scratch as well, without ammosmith perk.
---
Anyone who has the means to, ***DO THIS NOW BEFORE THEY FIX IT!***
---
Craft one T65 arm, slap the paint and a jetpack on it, then put Emergency Protocols on your torso. BOOM! You just made a future legacy armor piece. That'll come in handy down the road.
---
This video is a few months old, so I've changed some things around, but I think one of my bases is similar to what you are trying to do.
---

---
That charlie code you listed is the same one I saw in Nukacrypt discord, right at reset time.
---
Edit: looks like, while the discord was correct, the website hadn‚Äôt updated charlie correctly. But it is corrected now.
---
I have a mod that changes the classical radio station to essentially Appalachia Radio 2, and I realized today that the jukebox doesn‚Äôt even play the radio, just one (kinda lame imho) classical tune.
---
The game has been out for almost two years now, how is it at all a spoiler to learn that the enclave has vendors? Mutation serums arent at all a secret.
---
Does it play the classical radio station that you can play on your pipboy or is it like the jukebox that we can already put down at our camp
---
2 ranger hats clean. What a tease!
---
Yep when I think of a Jukebox I imagine orchestras with music that's easy to dance to. Not!
---
Yeah juke boxes are supposed to play stuff with great beats, this one is like hotel lobby musac.
---
Wish my friend had pulled me into this game kicking and screaming with at least the version with the best graphics and mod support.
---
Yup. Pretty much this. Once the season is over, there is near zero incentive to keep playing besides any special events that might come along, though maybe not even then.
---
Yeah, well, the Marine Tactical Helmet protects me from both airborne AND waterborne diseases, so it's staying on.
---
I have had this happen when the server crashed a few minutes after learning the plan.
---
That‚Äôs my point.  They rush out most content in a half baked state, so the first bit of new content  after a bug squash patch would inevitably come complete with a whole host of bugs, new and old.  We might be able to enjoy a perfectly functioning game for a month or two, if they have the ability to actually fix every problem, then it would be back to business as usual.
---
I finished last week and I never did a single NW challenge.
---
Man someone told me today in game when we revealed our ages that I'm older than his mother.  
---
Why I tell people I'm 375 in internet years.    .o    ,
---
Wish I could afford a lawn to yell at kids to keep off of.
---
Sssshhhhhhhh
---
I see that the number of Atoms has remained the same...
---
I can tell you with complete confidence that having hundreds of duped legendary modules in your inventory will not trip their detection system.
---
The people who got caught did something more egregious than that.
---
Welp that just saved me 500 Atoms. The picture is misleading as it shows a guy "Rocking out" to 50s rock in a malt shop. Who the fuck is over the Atomic shop needs to be fired. Sons of Dane jukebox proves other music can be played. This just goes on the list of fuck ups. Pipboy 2000 being labeled as "Vaultboy 2000" my screaming eagle skin for my handmade should of been for the Assault rifle as it turns my AK into classic Fallout Assault rifle. Nuka cola Vending machine that doesn't charge people to buy Nuka colas. Display cases that aren't solid objects but holograms as you cant sit anything on them. Where does this end? Why do we need 2 classical music Jukeboxes? I already am sick of the DJ added by Wastelanders (which added zero new songs btw) How freaking cool would it be to ACTUALLY pick songs for your Jukebox hell make it a mini quest where you go out and have to find records for your jukebox but no same ol turd in a different shiny wrapper.
---
I hope you can ask for and receive a refund. That's not cool.
---
She sounds more like a bland 2020 person, from our universe, than from Fallout.
---
Yep, thats what I do. Usually though I‚Äôm too lazy to run both computers lol.
---
Gee I guess I should put my pies up for sale. I had three, ate one though...
---
Ive had the opposite problem. Nobody wants to drop a nuke in the servers im on.
---
Are you running a suppressor? I started running without and it changed the game for me. 
---
I shoot then move until I can‚Äôt see anymore targets, then switch to a rifle with a suppressor while I stalk close range.
---
I hit most of the events just to stay busy
---
Anytime your health is increasing it may cause this bug to occur. Through aid, perks or gear.
---
Because before a 90% reduced weight perk is added what would the weight be? Let's do the math here bud, 10% of 98= 9.8 and to check it you do 9.8‚Ä¢10 which = 98. So there's your answer, you must have to have big brain energy to understand this post I guess
---
Maybe it's time for creative-mode Minecraft.
---
pain
---
Oh you guys loooooove our damage lol.  Just playin.  I appreciate the rescue stimpacks!
---
Just open gifts you'll get every prime receiver
---
you still on?
---
T65 is SS armor. But I agree, I bought it earlier to test and posted on here that it was misleading.
---
This just made my day üòÇ
---
Never do Scorched Earth expecting a good legendary. It's like expecting to win on every lottery ticket you buy.
---
The slots are shared. See bullet 2.
---
Yeah, but a nuke is getting dropped and depending on the event I will be gone soon
---
Clean spacesuit helmet and clean ranger helmet aren‚Äôt rare
---
Pride gang.
---
Loading times may be a bit shorter and textures may load a bit quicker... That's about it .
---
With one wasteland I feel like events will be revitalized. Or I am naive. Both are possible.
---
I couldn't even be bothered to do every daily level up one, let alone grind additional XP. I does not sound like fun.
---
Good luck man. I'd join you, but I'm PC. I just posted asking something similar.
---
Obtainable.
---
Damn they kinda suck all I really want is those free atoms and the BOS field station
---
No thanks. Enough load screens as it is.
---
Elder Loads Online is a terrible blueprint I hope this game doesn't follow. You think F76 is 'grindy'.
---
Outside of a legacy explosive version, gatling plasmas are kinda middle of the road.  The damage is fine, but the RoF is somewhat slow compared to other gatling weapons.  The splitter barrel helps, but you have to be pretty close to use it efficiently.  It‚Äôs a good gun, but a little limited as a main weapon, at least in my opinion.  A legendary version with faster fire rate helps improve it, but I just never felt very excited or satisfied with a GP, personally.
---
This is just my opinion, but I think the 50cal is the best all-around heavy gun.  It has good damage, good range, good accuracy and a controllable RoF that allows you to open up immediately and take single shots if you like.  You also don‚Äôt have to wait for the barrel to stop spinning in order to heal or switch weapons, which can be problematic in events like ACP and the old vault raids.
---
I carry a 50cal as my standard gun, a gauss mini for big bosses, and a Gatling gun for long distance shots and lower lever areas.  Those three give me enough diversity to handle anything in the game.
---
Consumables breakdown:
---
Net Gains
---
* \+5 nuke cards
---
* \+50 bullion
---
Net losses
---
* \-1000 caps
---
* All fireworks
---
I get the sense that Bethesda isn't going to bother fixing the fireworks fast reload bug and is just going to make it legacy. 
---
No evidence other than it not being in Season 2 and I'm not aware of seeing it in any other loot lists. Just a gut feel. So, might be worth holding onto the fireworks you have right now.
---
Still no skin for the Fixer....... These guys just don't get it.
---
Boils down to what type of resistance whatever youre shooting it at, besides scorched n scorched beasts.  Robots have higher energy resistance, ghouls otherwise etc
---
Who's Brian and why's he got big energy? The fucking irony. ü§£üòÇü§£
---
Thanks for the offer. On PC though.
---
Cheers!!
---
It's a smaller image. Because player icons are tiny...
---
Fix... the.... rng....?
---
yes they are still rare rewards from savage divide events
---
Just got bit by this.  Still not fixed!
---
Ok. So what?
---
It's an extremely common drop from the SBQ.
---
LOL I have one like that too. I really like that they added that in there, it's a fun flavor item.
---

I have no idea but you like get it and it‚Äôs like hey I‚Äôm here and as big as I can be so you can‚Äôt see anything have fun!
---
I got posted on FB for asking a guy nicely to stop and he messaged me back all toxic then when I clearly shut his overselfish ego down he picked and poked through the messages to make me look bad on FB. I honestly hate some people in this world. What's worse is that he made the rest of the people in the event crash, and before we all crashed he had made it so unplayable I was getting negative frames üôÉ
---
This is adorable and so cool! It amazes me how creative people get in the game. I love it! üéÉ
---
It‚Äôs in every vendor
---
Exactly. I finished it 3 days ago without rushing it. Missed a couple of days but overall, I'm not in a depressed state of mind nor burnout.
---
I did archer, athlete and hunter. Swimmer is weird because you have to stim someone in water, which doesn't seem super easy to do, unless you have friends that play, then it's easy. Hunter on the other hand involves shooting things with various guns, which is pretty straightforward. Seems like archer and athlete are pretty much givens. Good luck!
---
As in making boss events have a higher chance of dropping good legendaries
---
Which do you think is the best general frame? As in just running around with?
---
Well I wouldn't call it a fun thing.
---
A lazy OK event maybe.
---
Internet historian?
---
Learned the hard way to pay attention when looking up nuke codes.
---
Did the whole run and did quick Google for the codes.
---
Not paying attention that for some reason it brought up old codes from January and of course the rest of my nuke cards were in stash
---
nuking things and crafting berry mentat
---
I have about 60 Ultracite jetpack plans....farm SBQ for a day or so...youll get a few drops
---
ESO is grindy like nobody's business. I do love the maps though, and they are stunning when fully modded (on PC). Wish I could make 76 look like that. I don't mind the load screens either, i love the massive world it offers because of that. I kind of wish GTA:O would do this also and add in the other game's maps one day.
---
10 hours later and the posts start coming about how it was misleading and people bought it because of how the last line was worded. Imagine that.
---
So delightful aha! Very nice
---
More interior spaces would be fine. More vaults opening. More caves.
---
All my exp with bows in fo76 is in nuclear winter... so if prime arrows arent that bad to craft in bulk id go with that i guess. All myguns are primed minus my TSFfr 50 cal, so maybe im biased :P
---
Then I've thrown away a small fortune in jetpack plans as I get them from every other SBQ
---
If you do a little hunting and maybe some server hopping, you'll find it in player vending machines.
---
Yeah same here I prime 90% of my guns. Thanks for the info!
---
Exactly this. I ask my wife 'Hun, what do you think of my base?'
---
Her- 'Does it matter? You'll have moved tomorrow.'
---
Farming 20 Earles a day and selling Reclaimed Deep Mining Masks to everyone....very hot item atm
---
To the game there's no difference between a Bloodied/25/25 Handmade and a Nocturnal Broadsider. That's what RNG means. You're not asking to have it "fixed", you're suggesting getting rid of it altogether.
---
Got a set from uranium fever about a month ago.2 masks 3 jumpsuits
---
I finished a couple weeks ago and now I find I'm back to being bored.
---
Before I'd at least have a goal, now its like wtf to do.
---
No events pop up,  farming xp is pointless until new run comes
---
It's multiplayer Fallout. I can finally show off my camp. It was pretty lonely and boring building a cool camp and only being able to show your friends a screenshot who were also playing.
---
I love urban exploration, decaying buildings and exploring. The old old Terminator FPS game, or the STALKER series had good vibes like this too, only those are old and kludgy feeling compared to Fallout's engine/gameplay.
---
It's fun hunting for loot and gear. I enjoy games like Diablo / Grim Dawn / The Outer Worlds and finding that perfect set of gear for max damage.
---
I enjoy playing with friends (not that any of mine play anymore :() but even just the random encounters with other players feels like you're not alone, even if I play solo. It's fun to see people now and then and interact with them, or help in a boss fight, or trade stuff, or see other people's camps.
---
Yeah, just stupid rare
---
&gt;I get the sense that Bethesda isn't going to bother fixing the fireworks fast reload bug and is just going to make it legacy. 
---
It's fixed in the PTS.
---
What happens to your unlimited scrap box when you stop Fallout 1st? Do you still have access to it but can't add anything to it?
---
I would think about getting Fallout 1st if there was a six month option at the same 12 month discount. But as an Aussie Fallout 1st per month is $23au versus WoW's $16.50 which is just insanely expensive.
---
Well, ACP is actually fun compared to other events. At least for me. A lot more stuff going on. I get to swap loadouts before the fight to be team medic, etc. I also find the Queen unfun (for melee) but at least it's better rewards than what I'm getting in Uranium Fever (especially if people kill any of the three legendaries before I can tag them). And Line In The Sand is very unfun for me cause people just glitch it and instakill the spawns with AoE weapons. Only other event I don't mind doing is Radiation Rumble at least until I get the rad barrel plan.
---
Lmao..that's a heavy hitter
---
I've had that happen as well, was near the shaft where we drop in, just to the right of it. One instance he fell through, the other he corrected thankfully.
---
Does this also have any visual effect? If so, screenshots please.
---
We should trade servers somehow.
---
This is patched been so for a few days unfortunately
---
[*insert baby yoda meme*]
---
Haha yes die trash
---
What‚Äôs your PS4 username?
---
Any pics of rewards around.
---
Level 99 greenhouse walls only thing peaked my interest
---
I'll join the winners circle tonight. Sitting on 99 with &lt;2k SCORE needed and a full daily and weekly list.
---
I love how I spent *nothing* on the board, and get to drop Beth's atoms on a swanky new (rusty) satellite dish. So pumped as the bundle it's from fucking blows and I wouldn't wanna buy it all.
---
I loved Season 1. Luckily all I want from Season 2 is in the first half so it'll be a wank to get the job done there. I won't be bothering to complete it as I've got scout badges and shit to earn.
---
Do all the tests first for tadpole then get the other steps done move to the possum tests ect.
---
Line in the sand is nice with a group for stupid amounts of XP and scrap after.
---
Uranium Fever I don't mind soloing so I can just 1shot everything and not worrying about being a greedy jerk. If others are in there, I have to switch out weapons so everyone can tag stuff. Guaranteed 3 legendaries :)
---
I'll always start uranium fever and do it myself.   Line in the sand I won't go to unless another player or two are there already... which is more rare lately.
---
Though on PC, since we had ACP a week or so already, and since the legendary run is over for many people, it's been kind of dead for even dropping nukes and doing large events.
---
I already got all the rewards from ACP, so no point in doing it anymore. I'm also trying not to level until the next legendary run starts.
---
Fuck this stupid event, Bethesda sold thier souls for pay to play. There seems to be another motive behind these mass material collection events and the rewars is a fart in the face from Bethesda. No more buying fallout games for me thank you!
---
I guess I'm in transition. I'm level 99, so I'm basically done with the main quest, but I don't have good enough gear to do ACP or the solo stuff. I guess I could be on wendigo duty on ACP and get at least one reward.
---
All your stuff is just in a big database, so it's pretty simple to scan for specific duplicated stuff that shouldn't have duplicates, then just flag all the accounts that look suspicious.
---
Hey i just got one too from the queen ten minutes ago, one star leather left arm ghoul slayer lmao
---
I think anyone who subscribes for a year should unlock all past F1st items.
---
Thank goodness that's long gone. makes daily selling so much easier now.
---
Though, I end up hopping more player vendors than I ever did faction vendors each day LOL
---
I usually repair people's camps if I happen to notice damaged stuff when I'm out vendor hopping.
---
Yea still won't trigger, every day it's just greyed out and I never get to complete it
---
I use my BE15 Gatling plasma and just spray everywhere. Sorry to those that get pelted and blinded if I‚Äôm clearing masses around them
---
What platform are you OP. I think I have one you can take free.
---
This happens to me all the time.
---
Though, I have a bloodied build and am irradiated. I have "max" health at any given point, and it still does this. Click 3 times before it fast travels more often than not. I shouldn't be healing any when this happens... unless that's the bug?
---
Did they ditch the power armor display? Boooo
---
https://imgur.com/a/p4HBjOa
---
Happened to me at line on the sand eveything was going ok everyone was using explosive weapons then some guy came in the 2 round and started to shot at eveything and no one could‚Äôt even kill anything and for his fault we fail the event
---
There are musicians all over the internet who play music from the Fallout Era. I'm sure they would love the exposure and the credit. You'd think if Bethesda reached out and made some offers bands would be seriously interested. It shouldn't be that hard to get some more music into the game.
---
I've been all over, I like mountain tops with a view. Currently on a cliff side just south of vault76 in the forest region so I can serve n00bs better. I've been saving/modding low level legendaries, and also fully modded lower level crafted weapons to sell in my vendor.
---
The view is stunning too.
---
I also try to visit a spot many multiple times during a week of play to make sure nothing spawns there.
---
My last house was on a hill top next to the cowspot creamery. I only found friendly critters spawning after a few days worth of visits, so I built a big house there.... then the next day I find out a settler spawns there too.... under my house. So he chatters about being hungry, about hating fog and all kinds of dumb stuff, and I can't even shoot him because he's under my house. LOL
---
Bloody hell, the Greenhouse stuff is up in the 90s? Guess I'm never getting that then.
---
So would I but
---
Bethesda are really awkward when it comes to speaking about new Vegas. They barely mention it if not just in passing and afew nods during interviews. They did release the NCR Ranger armour but to promote Fallout 1st, they knew of its popularity to use it for appeal. 
---
Yet they won't acknowledge the actual game. Its so bizzare
---
I have a challenge for you, go to any interview where new Vegas is mentioned to the Bethesda team and watch them acknowledge and quickly change the subject. Count the amount of times that exact thing happens 
---
New Vegas is like a hidden gem of the franchise, For Bethesda it is forbidden to speak about. its hard for them to admit that new Vegas is the best title in a franchise They spent years rejuvenating. It'd be like Rockstar not making the Best GTA
---
Rank 99 is only one I want..... :|
---
Was on not long ago in the raider scaber bundle
---
Yes sir, turrets and fusion gens seem to be my most repaired items... not my, you know what I mean
---
Smort.
---
I use that bed. Makes me laugh every time I sleep
---
RNG seems to be doing exactly what it's supposed to. You think you're entitled to a better reward?
---
Obtainable, I've gotten two sets in the past month or so.
---
Hunter isn‚Äôt bad, except for the part where you have to kill a Yao Guai with a syringer.  
---
I thought medic would be easy, but turns out you have to have 3 perk points in Pharmacy and 2 in Chemist to make the antibiotics.  I‚Äôve only ever had one point in Pharma Farma and never want for chems, so I wont be doing that one any time soon..
---
It's guaranteed, once per day... I have a stack of them as part of my daily routine LOL.
---
Also, after switching to a bloodied build with unyielding armor, and beefing up my luck, I now hit the machine ones 1/4 1/5 times, Once I got 4 in a row in different machines. Before I changed builds with all the luck, I never got a single one.
---
It specifically said so.  So...
---
Dude, the 2 scorchbeast meats you need for that one cranberry thing, though.  Ive been killing scorch beasts left and right and pretty much all that I ever get are hearts.
---
Community &amp; group events when people actually act as a team. Story elements too but those are so few &amp; far between nowadays
---
Bottom line in the shop "can be applied to secret service armor"
---
Tons of xp, tons of steel.  Eventually you just get all the new rewards.
---
Yep...   If I see something obvious that has been destroyed I run over and fix it.  
---
I've been playing the game for a while, am a bit of a scrounger, and have Fallout 1st.  So I have a nice stash of materials.  May as well help others out with it.
---
That's what other players are for. This is an MMO, if you want someone to adventure with, find someone who plays in the same timezone as you and doesn't mind RP.
---
Had that happen as well.  Just disappeared on us.  Was quite irksome...
---
I'm only 2 imposter sheepsquatch heads away from having 120, which I intend to sell all at once for 2000 caps each
---
Just messaging with a guy in a thread who just got them...Like within the past hour
---
And he got four jumpsuits, seems they added mechanic to the pool
---
I see Beth making the Vault 111 elevator door object as a camp item in 76 that warps you to a large vaulted area. You place it down and you get your own interior cell accessible from your camp 
---
What would be better if Bethesda incorporated the wastelanders NPCs as workers for your camp who can dig at a requested spot to create a cave. The caves have different sizes and levels dependant on how long you've been digging, how many people you got digging, what resources and how many resources you've contributed. The hole you dig is a buildable space with resource connections to your camp. 
---
Be great if you could actually store stuff inside since they're your own private areas but we know Bethesda are trying to monitize the storage space limits with scrapbox so no chance that's happening. They'd just throw out the excuse of exploits.
---
But yeah they might also just port over that guys entire bunker mod and have different doors and many different interiors which would be great also
---
If I build it I just leave the big door off. No problem.
---
Same thing at line in the sand just happened to me as well,  ash piles everywhere,  frames dropped, died, got the respawn bug.
---
pretty common :/
---
And faschnat freakin masks
---
Definitely not true.  I have magic at 37 fps.
---
if only there were some skins for the combat shotgun...
---
My only drop was when I first started playing over a year ago.  I accidentally scrapped it and one of our party found one for me as a replacement.  Haven't had another drop since and haven't seen it in the Enclave vendor since either.
---
Given the responses here, I'm going to have to do more events in the Savage Divide as I would like to get a full set.
---
That'll take a while I reckon to create that.......
---
It's about the only place worth buying from on the end game to prevent yourself from hitting the cap cap.
---
They literally sold a camo paint for the ss armor like 2 weeks ago. This seems like a nitpick to make it seem like they intentionally tried to mislead you. It's Secret Service PA paint with a picture of a PA. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out, no offense.
---
Yes I am
---
They labeled the captain cosmos as secret service skin as well when it was first introduced
---
Alright I‚Äôll check tomorrow once I get a chance
---
Thank you!!
---
I wish there‚Äôs a ‚Äòrepair all‚Äô button, atm you have to get to the destroyed items to repair them which can be a pita when some camps are very spread out and randomly put together.
---
Np
---
I actually liked doing challenges, I did every challenge, every day, no Nuclear Winter and just finished it a week ago, now im bored and just waiting for the new season to begin. All this bonus score is worthless to me but it was meant for players to catch up if they had difficulties, maybe next season i will have some free fallout days now that i know its doable in a more casual way. (Remember when bad math made a lot of players rage? lmao)
---
The space required between tatos, corn, and carrots is ri-godamn-diculous too. Never noticed on the ground but in one of those tiles? Jesus. 
---
Ive seen them snuggled quite close but damned if i know how you do it.
---
Shut
---
Just saw a ton of these in vendors machines! Just vendor hop
---
And make pew pew noises for guns
---
dude is a legit seller
---
if he give you all at once you would die of an overdose
---
little dosis each week and you comeback craving for more ;)
---
I leave scrap when I use vendors, especially if I was really desperate. Usually lead, since that seems to be the hardest for me to find overall.
---
If you get settlers rep up, you can buy the stealth suit from samuel.
---
And I do believe there is a giant "point of no return " warning popups before you go too far with either.
---
So other than missing out on story and some rep, you didnt miss much really.
---
It‚Äôs pretty easy to get up there actually. I skipped probably about a week total, and I completed the Run today, and there‚Äôs a week left.
---
Yes
---
I am parked in the forest near the road and I don't think I'll be moving anytime soon. I've started exploring the Ash Heap though, so I may have to move if I don't want to waste caps fast traveling.
---
1200+ notes, 5k bullion, 30k caps, only thing not maxed out is scrip (thanks to legendary mudules). And still I log in and play 2+ hours every day...
---
Yeah
---
We‚Äôve come a long way from the old Atari 2600
---
First, if you have a .50 cal that takes Ultracite ammo then you already have the Prime Receiver for the .50 Cal installed.  If you have a .50 cal but it doesn't take Ultracite Ammo, then you will need the Prime Receiver Plan for it.  If you want automatic fire, then you will need the Automatic Prime Receiver Plan.
---
Second, to make Ultracite Ammo for the .50 cal, you will need lead, steal, gunpowder, Ultracite, and Stable Violet flux.  You then select Ultracite Ammo at the bottom of the list when at the Tinkerers Workbench.
---
Ultracite can be farmed in a couple of different ways, including killing Scortch Beasts (scrapping their wings and bones gives you Ultracite) , killing Scortched and other mobs in a Nuke Zone (Hardened Mass can be scrapped into Ultracite), and by farming Ultracite Ore and smelting it into Ultracite.
---
Stable Flux requires 10x Raw Flux, 1x Glowing Mass, 1x Hardened Mass, and 1x High Radiation Fluid.  For .50 cal Ultracite Ammo you need Stable Violet Flux.  Raw Violet Flux can be found in the Nuke Zone near Fissure Prime.  Glowing Mass, Hardened Mass, and High Radiation Fluids come from killing mobs that have spawned in a Nuke Zone.  Though, these do not drop from Scortch Beasts.
---
When you are gathering Raw flux, make sure to use Green Thumb as it gives you twice as much.
---
After you building a new character? Or are you reallocating points?

For my bloodied stealth commando build, I followed the build in a video by riflegaming on YouTube. I'm at work, so I can't link it right now, but it's really informative as to the specific perks and mutations. I altered it a little (I took 2 points from perception and put them into intelligence, because I need to be able to modify my own weapons) but it's really fun to play with, and I learned a lot for future builds.
---
I wouldn't get your hopes up/crushed yet. There's a lot of placeholder/missing art on the PTS Scoreboard and there's two Greenhouse Kits which _may_ be redundant and the armor display _may_ be taking one of those spots. Plus AFAIK the armor display is still in the PTS files and MAY instead be a future atom shop item or a reward for a brotherhood quest OR a reward for the new Brotherhood Daily Ops OR a bullion purchase from Vault 79/possible new Brotherhood bullion vendor.
---
How are they actually decrypted just out of curiosity
---
Possible network issue? Online games shouldn‚Äôt really be used to benchmark imo
---
A whole thread of grumpy people agreeing is not as grumpy as it seems. 
---
In the words of Innigo Montoya...
---
Good idea but I think fire should be involved.
---
No. Nobody does. Not a single round of 2mm ammo remains. The last shot has just been fired on the last platform that had *any* left. All of the guns have run dry, and may the gods have mercy on our souls. We're just lucky we have people like you around to ask the tough questions and make us face the harsh reality.
---
I am the auction house coordinator threat this gentleman is referring too and also the owner of the group Wasteland Rogue Traders on fb your more then welcome to join us on our next auction. And even add items in for bidding I'm new to the reddit forums I have just joined because I was made aware of this post and I was excited to see about it :)
---
A shitload
---
Is anyone here on Xbox and have any vanguards marine armor
---
I'd be reallocating points. As much as starting a new character will more than likely happen in the future, right now, I'm sticking with just my main, and trying to find a more permanent build for him.
---
Share your build and we will see where it went wrong.
---
I‚Äôve had flame particles do it as well. It‚Äôs frustrating, because my build struggles to sneak and so my best way to clear out the wendigos is the Tesla, but that isn‚Äôt an option with this bug.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Tell me about it, although I‚Äôm lucky I always carry 3 on me always
---
Thanks for the info! Someone made me a .50 cal with prime receiver that shoots ultracite ammo. They were also so nice to make me the ammo as well but now I have run out and need to get the plans I‚Äôm assuming in order for me to make it
---
Yes it does
---
Nasty
---
Not sure, the video doesn't show much.
---
At a guess magic weapons
---
While we're at it can we stop auto assigning 'Claim workshop' missions just because I happen to be in the general vicinity? 
---
And if I get asked to find that damn church one more time I'm going to strangle that Responder lady!
---
Also, good tip for using the green thumb perk for the flux. I would of never thought of that!
---
I wouldn't be surprised... burned 11k doing an earl run.
---
Lol thats like asking people to stop duping.
---
Your Builds are always amazing, I should have known it was you :) I have the day off tomorrow I will be sure to come by and check it out.
---
Found out how. Blueprints. 
---
https://youtu.be/zdVf6kfak0U
---
I got a set of masks and jumpsuits recently.
---
That made me smile.
---
How many level ups are you sitting on? I'd still recommend watching the video; but o if you don't have many (or any) might I suggest the bloodied shotgunner?
---
Just click it to disable and you go back to the previous one.
---
So, yes, you need the Prime Receiver plan for the .50 cal before you can make that type of Ultracite Ammo.  I also found a reference that you need to be at or above level 50 as well.
---
How long to you think it‚Äôd be before they patch? I‚Äôll have to wait until Sunday before I can purchase the plan?
---
How would that even work? Just make another character.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
To be honest I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve never done one properly and I‚Äôm level 380 lol!
---
I've played both builds a lot. Stealth Commando, especially Bloodied is really great for farming and speed running. Heavy Gunner PA is better for high level events and boss fights **UNLESS** you're looking to solo the SBQ/IS/Earle on a private server, or with a small team of other stealth builds. In this case Stealth Commando is the fastest and most efficient way to do it. 
---
Despite people claiming they don't die while playing Bloodied Stealth Commando, you will die more often than with the PA build you're used to. With the Heavy Weapons/PA you can pretty well walk into any situation and handle all the damage while you mow down everything in sight. With stealth commando this will get you killed easily, and you *need* to rely on stealth for your damage boost. You'll lose these damage boosts during events. 
---
In the end both builds are extremely fun and satisfying in their own right. Personally I find stealth commando a bit boring so I prefer Heavy Gunner... But since you've been using this build for your whole game you'll probably enjoy a new build and the new challenges and advantages it will bring you.
---
But at least duping has consequences.
---
I‚Äôd think it might take a week because Bethesda jumps when their atomic shop items break
---
I didn't accuse him. I simply just asked.
---
Can confirm you need animal friend not wasteland whisperer
---
Wrong, you have to exchange the voucher for the uniforms from the machine to advance the quest. It was part of a bug fix
---
Where is Smiley when you need him
---
Good luck with that .. they cant keep the same bugs from coming back.
---
Around 75 or so. I think, based on some builds I've tweaked, I'd need to use about 35 points to reallocate SPECIAL points, as i have all but 1 or 2 perk cards already for a build, thank goodness.
---
He‚Äôs just waiting for his ‚Äústock‚Äù to come back
---
I always do the same unless they have stuff that's grossly overpriced in their vendors. Or if they're selling hundreds of mounted heads.
---
Well I guess Fallout is in a good place right now if stuff like this are the top concerns
---
You have vsync on.  Go into file explorer, this pc, documents, my games, fallout 76, fallout76 prefs.ini, look for present interval, change the 1 to 0.  Present interval is under display, its 20 or 30 lines down.  Bethesda can't know if you changed it, it's not illegal, it won't get you banned, it's just double your framerate.
---
I take pictures of my camp on the map with my phone so I know how many of each item I was selling at the time, then take pictures of my ‚Äúfor sale‚Äù weapons and armor lists. When something sells, I come back and edit the picture to circle the item that sold. Kind of a pain in the butt, but really my only option since the game has a tendency to crash or go black when trying to switch to other apps (PC).
---
Indeed. I swear the last icon didn't auto equip, the Screaming Eagle one.
---
I know it didn't auto equip because for once I actually had to manually equip it.
---
At first I didn't like the Mire, but I grew to love it.  Mine was on on the lake near Thunder Mountain.  I always wished that you could build on the far side of the lake but it's out of bounds.
---
However, I also like to sell things in my Vending machines and there is a lot less foot traffic in that area.  People just don't look on that side of the map when they are visiting vending machines.  It wasn't so bad when the Script Purveyor was near Harper's Ferry but it became a ghost town once she moved.
---
You can already do both sides.
---
I just got that helmet today. It does indeed look nice :D
---
I would wear it all the time if it didn‚Äôt clash with basically everything. I wish you could use a cosmetic helmet to go over the top...
---
That's a visual bug (surprise!). The problem is that legendaries and events all use the same splash pop-up visual (Event Completed, Legendary Item Acquired, etc). These pop-ups can get stuck in a queue or outright disappear altogether. You have to open the map, look at your Pip-Boy, etc to get those pop-ups "unstuck." The problem with this event is that you get 3-4 different pop-up visuals! If you miss out on Pop-Up 1, but then you complete an event (Pop-Up 2), Pop-Up 2 will force Pop-Up 1 to display out-of-order, making it appear that you received a legendary that you actually picked up earlier.
---
Here is a screenshot showing the quest rewards so that you can see for yourself :)

---
Thanks! Thats good insight! It's not that I don't enjoy heavy guns and PA, I was under the impression that a Stealth Commando build was even higher DPS. I knew the survivability would be reduced; I got a hard glimpse of that while in my shotgunner phase. But it seemed like overall, even inside events, these builds provided the overwhelming majority of damage laid out on bosses. So that isn't necessarily the case then?
---
No worries, Bethesda heard you and fully agrees. Prepare for the other pristine workbenches, one per month for the next few months. Maybe a used Valentine's Day condom too still stuck somewhere forgotten in the game files.
---
Everyone has 2mm ammo.....
---
Nor the Railway
---
I had someone use a MIRV fat man and was getting ~5-10spf. üòë
---
I play on PS4. How much do u have?
---
The traveling leather coat has a backpack on it that all. You can wear your normal backpack under it tho.
---
 the brotherhood Scribe outfit(s?) and civil war (union/confederate) soldier outfits replace the backpack with appropriately modeled ones
---
There are still factions, but they do also now share the cap pool and heach has a sales rep at the whitespring to reduce how much cost there was to hop from vemdor to vendor
---
I usually play the battle medic during ACP events, and if I ever see a tesla rifle in someones hands I always make sure they dont get heals. The tesla rifle should be deleted from the game entirely.
---
Ah fuck. Now I have to find another way to be useful without using 1 of only 4 useful endgame builds. If this update doesn‚Äôt address it, I might as well unsubscribe from first and stop playing. 
---
This leaves me torn. Not trying to be the player everyone dreads. Yet, I see 0 enjoyment from the same few build schemes.
---
Longshoreman outfit hides the backpack completely
---
Now if we could just find a way to hide the SS jet pack
---
You'll squeeze better DPS out of stealth commando during events, this is true. But you won't get your bonus damage with the boss aggro'd to other players. And if you become detected you need to react rather fast or else you will die .
---
My team kills him within 2 minutes. No magic weapons either.
---
You will need an online guide, from what I could tell there was no in game way to get the process to figure out the code, there was an obscure 13 letter word you had to guess from the wall in the enclave bunker control room, then use that word to remove letters from an alphabet, then put those letters at the front to get a new alphabet, then dejumble the corresponding number letters to a new word to tell you the order of the numbers you got from the scorched officers.
---
I did it once to launch my first nuke.
---
I had this happen to me in the last week or so. Ended up with both a forest and urban mask as well as three or more jumpsuits, one of which was the white powder one.
---
I would guess that the gatling laser is a "magic" weapon. They are less reliable but still work if you want to be lazy.

---
My favorite region is the Mire.  But, it sucks for Vending.
---
My Second Favorite region is the Savage Divide and that is where I am now.  
---
My very first permanent CAMP was below Huntersville (levels 35 to 65).  My hunting grounds were Top of the World, Huntersville, and Westek.
---
I then moved to a spot just up the stream from the Alpha Silo and would randomly join other players in doing Nuke runs (level 65 to 100).  
---
I moved to the Mire on the lake near Thunder Mountain but vending dried up when the Purveyor moved from Harpers Ferry to the Ash Heap (level 100 to 250).  
---
I moved back to the Savage Divide near Site Alpha but to a site on a relatively unused acid node (not the one in the water) (level 250 to 370).  
---
I then moved just below Sunnytop Skilanes Base Lodge, and liked the area, but Vending sucked there (level 370 to 390).
---
Now I'm in a relatively unused spot near Top of the World (level 390+) with no major features (i.e. no resource nodes, no water) but with a nice cliffside view and in an area where I get lots of visitors.
---
Wow really?
---
I don't think it's very common and I don't have a problem with the PA glitch in general but when you see it happen at the event and killing earl does nothing and barely gives a reward, it gets pretty annoying.
---
Do u have any?
---
I believe the SS PA has the best defences in the game, now if the emergency protocols are available for (don‚Äôt know personally but they should be) then playing a nerd rage bloodied is a lot easier.. Especially combined with the empath mutation (means you need a teammate using it, unless it applies to you as well, when you have it) you can reduce damage by like 67% on a team on top of damage resistance; (not sure how these different things stack algebraically).  Also for ultimate tankiness, you‚Äôll want 1: blocker 2: Fireproof, 3: serendipity 4: Dodgy if you‚Äôre not running around a lot or using vats.  If you can get yourself a decent automatic Vampire‚Äôs weapon that doesn‚Äôt need to spin up (LMG, Flamer hell even a 10mm pistol) you can quick swap back n forth between it and your primary weapon.  It‚Äôs even better if it‚Äôs Faster fire rate as well.  If you put all that together you should have to try REALLY hard to die..
---
The biggest problem you have to worry about is poisons/ damage over time effects cause they‚Äôll kill ya quick.  If ya find yourself dying more often than you like at 50% during A colossal problem, 20% makes it worse..  Personally I‚Äôm trying to move away from bloodied because when I‚Äôm just out n about I‚Äôm not in my Power Armor because I need the extra unyielding carry weight.  If this doesn‚Äôt apply to you well then you‚Äôll probably grow to love bloodied like many people.
---
With that said;
---
Stealth commandos can do ridiculous damage when you‚Äôre stacking sneak attack damage on top of everything else.  Again bloodied is the way to go because a stealth commando should never be getting hit. A full unyielding sentinel set is greatly for the stat boosts while still having great survivability.  Most people however usually want unyielding, ap regen, improved stealth paired with a legendary fixer to be able to tickle a super mutants balls  without him knowing where it came from.
---
Power Armour tank n spank is more perk reliant, stealth commando‚Äôs more gear reliant I‚Äôd say.  All depends where you‚Äôre comfortable.
---
P.S. in regards to playing with a team; if you played with the same people regularly where it‚Äôs needed, another heavy gunner with a Vampire‚Äôs Flamer using the friendly fire perkcould stand behind you while bloodied healing you, himself AND doing damage at the same time.  The same could be said for a commando built for vats with a Medics automatic rifle.
---
That's cruel and inhumane! Let us catch them alive so we can stuff them into artillery cannons and launch them at our neighbors.
---
Replace icons and poses with emotes.
---
The traveling leather coat has it's own backpack and hides all other backpacks. The regular leather coat does not and can use any backpack skin, so it's generally sought after more.
---
Anyone know what the buy/sell/trade for this would be?
---
Go visit camps that have a lot of ammo for sale. Most people sell it for 2 caps each. You can get lucky sometimes and find people that sell it for 1 cap each.
---
I think a lot of people are taking a break from the game, since yesterday I‚Äôm seeing so little people on servers to the point where the server shuts down! 
---
Earlier i nuked SBQ and no one showed up! Looked at the map and there was only few people in the server, had to solo it.
---
I WAS HERE EARLIER!!!! great build üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
---
Nooo I‚Äôm working. You have no idea how long I‚Äôve been trying to get that hunters long coat.
---
Nukagirl outfit
---
Say what you want about 76, but these encounters are on a whole other level.
---
Yeah Mate, $23 for us is a bit expensive, but once a month isn't too bad (just add it along with the 20 other monthly bills/subscriptions/services lol) but use that month to jam as much scrap as you can find in, once it runs out you still retrieve from it, just can't add to it.
---
To the people that don‚Äôt know how it works is you have someone holding the vendor bot, while you keep relogging to refresh his inventory. He has 2 random clothing each time.
---
In a private server, besides UF, I recommend One Violent Night and Horde Events, guaranteed scrip at least.  Leader of the Pack too, chance for rare weapon mod plans and 3 1 stars to scrip or give away.   Also, yeah on the DMV.  I usually just end up running the Burrows over and over, but for variety I'll hit up The Whitespring, the Asylum or DMV for some easy Ghoul farming.  Great xp, lots of legendaries and the best part is they come to you.
---
Is your friend list in Xbox OK, while empty in Fo76 and u get error message about a problem loading your friend list? I had that and I had to clean up my friend list a bit and it solved my problem.
---
The Traveling Leather Coat has its own backpack and suppresses any other.
---
Just don‚Äôt die
---
I mean it could if you slap and abundant amount of shit on then yes
---
Cheers, I can afford the $23 no worries, it's more the principle of not wanting to buy something that seems incredibly inflated compared to other subs available to Aussies.
---
My friends list isnt even huge
---
Its on their end not ours..
---
There was one glorious week where he sold as much as you could handle; it was glorious.
---
This. Do both faction quests un to the vault raid then pick. Best of both worlds
---
yup
---
Its joining randoms when they invite me and when u try to join off of the gamertag it doesnt work.. any other game is perfectly fine..
---
Thanks a ton for that! I've been working at an unyielding Secret Service set for a bit now, and have pretty decent rolls on 3 of the 5 pieces. Seems to do well even when I'm not in PA as a heavy build, which I dont use on quick errands around the map. I seem to be using it less and less daily, except for SBQ or ACP fights, which is half the reason I'm considering the switch. Plus, seems like it will keep me more on my toes, not soaking up damage and just holding the trigger down for fights.
---
Do you play a bloodied build? Or would you consider it?
---
My list was about 150 long and cleaned up about 50.
---
Yeah, griefers have cottoned onto this. When they glitch through the rubble and one-shot Earle, the glitcher gets the corpse loot and nobody else gets anything because the event fails.
---
I think you can go to their C. A. M. P. device and do that, providing you have access to the necessary materials.
---
I love Fallout, but I didn't participate in this at all. I just like building and having fun with friends. I got over my fomo a long time ago. Good job though. If I had done it I definitely would've done it your way.
---
What platform are you playing on?
---
Some would say the respawn timer is the colossal problem itself
---
It isn't available anymore. My son just signed up a month ago and he just got the basic tent.
---
From the most difficult plan to have dropped from the SBQ is the calibrated shocks.
---
Pop em in your vendor for 20 caps, easy money
---
I tried that before but it didn‚Äôt give me that option menu, maybe they added it in the latest patch?
---
I do play bloodied.
---
Actually, I was just wondering if it might be an easier alternative.
---
Not really. It's fake.
---
I‚Äôll take them if you don‚Äôt want them? I‚Äôll give you a little ammo or something
---
FO1st.
---
edit- if you have 1st, you may have to claim it from the atom shop
---
Haha you have to pay for fallout 1st to get it sadly
---
I wish there‚Äôs an easier alternative, i repaired CAMPS‚Äô turrets and walls but who knows what else were broken. Vending machines just disappear.
---
Everything that Bethesda does is misleading and lacking in information. These new legendary perks that are coming out just reading some of the titles makes me really scratch my head. It would be great if they made one for each really good weapon. It would kind of make it like a legendary or weapon.
---
The only way of getting survival tent is fallout 1st membership. This will also give you the unlimited scrapbox for putting all your junk in to save your stash box filling up so fast.
---
I heard that too.
---
Source: my dad's in the game industry, trust me.
---
Was anyone else disappointed by the Atom Shop this week
---
Mister Anderson....
---
Energy weapons are meta in fallout rn, especially for pvp. Trust me because I pvp at least 4 times every day. Tesla‚Äôs have already been nerfed so that the ark doesn‚Äôt just lock onto another player it has to be some what close as people just sit on the top of wss jumping up and down shooting it at the roof and it would hit 3 or 4 different people, but they nerfed it so it would only hit 1. JE lasers are the most broken think in 76, I hit harder with a JE at full health with no addictions to than I do with a be laser at low hpüòé
---
We can only try we can't solve all issues for someone else. Although I am quite sure if they notice it's been fixed I believe they appreciate it.
---
Tesla users suck big balls
---
No. But they do adjust the budget size of the items all the time.  Which for me, means my budget shrunk.
---
Wow sounds like that guy got everything he wanted plus more, you gotta not bite bait that hard man.
---
Iv got a set of raider power armour you could have I‚Äôm assuming you are a low level not having any power armour
---
Consequences as in ‚Äògo ahead and keep your duped shit and do whatever you want with them‚Äô?
---
I have your choice of a BE+1p single shot or a BE250 10.mm. It's hard to be a pistol player but these two are fun. I would be happy to part with one your choice. ( Bloodied Explosive +1 perception single shot, Bloodied Explosive 250 Damage resistance while reloading 10.mm) the single shot hits harder but the 10mm is way faster.
---
Only hold onto the ones that are 100/100. I‚Äôd lose the rest if you don‚Äôt have power armor. If they‚Äôre taking up too much space, sell for 20-40 caps each on your vendor.
---
Pretty sure it doesn't effect heavy weapons
---
The ranger armor has always been available, he was referring to the armored versions that have been occasionally offered as skins for it.
---
All 3 firefighter uniforms hide it
---
Yea to many life in the wasteland is tough, every little help makes a difference.
---
You misunderstood my post. I already did the raid with the raiders.
---
Oh yea! You dump your ammo and leave the lobby :) it works every time
---
?? No.
---
That's stupid
---
You‚Äôre openly asking somebody to help you cheat on reddit and dupe ammo. 
---
Be careful.
---
I'd like the Bloodied Explosive tbh
---
Gat laser speed is only 182 isn‚Äôt it? I thought you need 200 to get magic.
---
Easy way to get your head crippled: Stand directly under a ceiling laser turret in one of the nuke silos. The only part of you that it'll be able to hit will be the top of your head, and your head will get crippled very quickly.
---
I already ran the raid with the raiders .
---
It does exist. I drop them on the ground all the time. They did not exist at launch, but were added in later
---
Just hit 52, so was going to start thinking about power armor, but haven't got to it yet. Thanks but I don't wanna take your stuff. I'm Keradrah on Xbox.
---
I would so love to be able to play through the main and side quests again. Like you don‚Äôt even need to give me xp for them, I just want some story to play. Making a new character sucks, I will never do that damn rep grind again.
---
oH rEaLlY lEt Me TrY iT rIgHt NoW
---
It;s been alright with the several bonus weeks/ends and additional quests (think 7-8/day now). 
---
At launch it only had the 5 dailies and the 6th "do 5 dailies" being a large contribution of your points.
---
This grumpy old man would be quite pleased if we don't get any more free icons.
---
Ooo I don‚Äôt know if one exists but it‚Äôs a brilliant idea
---
They are both bloodied explosive, do you want fast and soft or slow and hard. Wow that sounds bad when I say it out loud.
---
Thats fsllout for.ya
---
I'm new to the game and never have enough thats all
---
Naaa it‚Äôs a gift I can make better power armours I just naturally assumed you were very low level I honestly don‚Äôt mind helping you out Iv got fuck all else to do lol
---
Looks like a player held off on killing Earl until everyone had a chance to have some fun and then gave it the beans. Could be a Junkie's faster firerate gatling laser (which can proc the magic effect and do more damage than intended).
---
Honestly, I think all platform cross play NEEDS to happen. Yes, I understand hackers and what not. It‚Äôs hard to argue against that. But outside of nuclear winter, the game isn‚Äôt PVP. 
---
If the hacking is too big of a problem, at least give us cross progression so I can play with my friends on Xbox without having to start over.
---
Been grinding 76 since beta and supporting the game through 1st since day 1 of availability. Bethesda always seems to come at us with something "on the horizon" and "in the works" but the quality and execution of the content seems to always fall short...all while we eat shit with massive framerate drops (if you have bloated inventory)  and lingering bugs, some old as the beta days. 
---
I'll keep it simple: My time with F76 can be characterized as an endless uphill battle. F1 will make things easy! Thanks scrapbox, you just eased some pressure off the petrified 800 stash that starts to bend gosh forbid you store a few heavy weapons. No worries says Bethesda, we plan on increasing the stash size. Tick tock. It's been over a year.  New boss!? Wendigo Colossus event optimized through PTS still gets delayed on console. Now in this thread, F1st exclusive items have been shit given the price and commitment given by 1st members...and I can't argue against the OP with overwhelming solid evidence to the contrary - which is what we should be able to do for a AAA game with a subscription. All the "killer" shit we've been hoping for is just NOT there at this point but "great things are on the horizon." right?
---
 \*eyeroll 
---
These gripes sound "small" when looked at independently but they've compound over the past 2 years and they hurt. The wasteland already hurts and all the extraneous shit, the little things, like seeing nothing really that knocks you on your ass for 1st members over the life of the sub is just 1 of x amount of seemingly endless gripes this endeavor has been haunted by no matter how much positive progress it gains. 
---
it's just heartbreaking. 
---
I expected better at this point. Hopes high I guess? Good chance I break before Beth gets a fire under their ass with 76.
---
Right. But before you actually go into the raid, you can go to Foundation and start the settler quest line. The settler and raider story line are separate and meet up at the vault raid. Thats the cut off point.
---
Slow and Hard preferably, and yes that does sound bad
---
I solo this event pretty regular on a private server. I actually prefer doing this solo, or with my husband if he is on.
---
Lol true
---
Same with when for whatever reason Earle decides he just wants to terror me the entire event. Kills me, goes to the other side of the cave, and sprints back over to spit and slap me the second i drop in üòÇ
---
Lol yeah I suppose, I honestly wasn't furious about it or anything I just thought it was funny that he would try killing me with a trap but when it came to a fair fight he just ran.
---
I feel ya my QFFRFR is my prized possession,  and it‚Äôs the biggest problem.  I feel like people are going to just be forced to be bloodied or run other weapons at Unyielding threshold for the xp now if they just keep doing things like the legendary run.  Some builds need some serious love.  I feel bad because the guy in my original post told me it was his main weapon and he felt terrible and at a loss because he didn‚Äôt know what to do..
---
‚ÄúI made a mistake continuing on with the raid‚Äù ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really understand what I was agreeing to at the time‚Äù yes now I know that before I ran the raid I could have finished the other side, before then, no I didn‚Äôt.
---
I stopped doing uranium fever a long time ago, too many tools that one shot the supervisors.
---
I dont do line in the sand because it takes forever, and you basically get nothing for your work.
---
Radiation rumble and arktos pharma both need a solid team of 8 communicating, so in 99% of public servers you either try and fail, wasting resources, or you only get low tier rewards, not worth doing, same thing with the old vault raid.
---
I feel u
---
Ugh. Of course the greenhouse is level 99. *sigh*. Oh well. Made it this season so I should be fine next. 
---
Wish we kept the caps and fireworks though. I have almost 500 treasury notes and 4200 billion. I need more like I need a hole in my head lol. 
---
Other then that I am looking forward to the camp stuff. üò∫
---
Hush up!!! My camp is there and I'm loving the nuka spawns for my cola nut build! Also made it a nice little red rocket stop station to add some nice functionality to the space... the cars are a pain in the butt to build around though
---
cool man Im on now,not sure how to meet up, but they're all yours
---
One of the reasons I love it.
---
Get the perk ‚Äúammosmith‚Äù under the Agility skill tree. So you get 80% more ammo when you craft ammo. 
---
There‚Äôs also a perk called ‚Äúsuperduper‚Äù under the luck skill tree. So every time you craft anything (in their case ammo) there‚Äôs a 30% chance you‚Äôll craft double that for free. When you combine those 2 perks and craft ammo you‚Äôll be surprised how much you can make. 
---
Keep in mind you still need to have a decent amount of lead, steel and gunpowder in order to make the ammo in the first place. 
---
Don‚Äôt feel like wasting your junk items? Go to other player‚Äôs camps that Have a lot of ammo for sale. And buy the ammo you need. Most people sell ammo for 1 cap per bullet. Sometimes you‚Äôll run into people selling it for 2-4 caps each. 
---
Don‚Äôt feel like spending caps? Well unfortunately that means you‚Äôll just have to Rely on killing enemies and looting their ammo. 
---
 But again, even if you‚Äôre a new player. Don‚Äôt post on reddit asking for a way to cheat, hack, or illegally obtain certain items. 
---
People that dupe usually get banned from
---
the game. Not everybody. But most people do get caught cheating.
---
I have like 90 something fusion cores just from playing the game. I have never farmed them. I prime then for my ult gat lasers and never have any issue with the single flux and ultracite they need to be made. I also don't farm flux, just have what I get from the Queen and Earl. Primed fusion cores are extremely ammo efficient to make
---
I mean there are people who've gotten ban from it.
---
Fixed instantly, thank you for the easy guide and fix!!
---
Well now that you know that information you could also, you know, just equip your other one again right after buying it. That's at least what I, a new player, does. I found out that when I acquired a free emblem 2 weeks ago it changed. The one I bought (nuka cola girl ftw) got switched with the free one. (I didn't know for 3 play days straight what happened to my emblem)   
---
So, now I just switch it. Doesn't feel that much of a hassle then this post makes it out to be.
---
Thank you at least you helped, unlike some people
---
It doesn't matter. You can still do dailies for both sides and ally with both. 
---
When you get ally with the settlers you can buy the stealth suit. 
---
But yes, you can only do the main story line with both sides up to a point and when you choose you can't progress the main story any further with the other faction. 
---
So no I don't see them allowing us to complete the raid with the other faction but you can still get the stealth suit.
---
I put my weapons and armour in the same thing ammo and other random shit I find in the same vendor and my clothing goes in its own thing
---
Yeeees, I've been appalled since it launched, that it didn't come with some way to scrap weps and armor, it needs a weapons workbench instead of the grill.
---
Any energy weapon that makes lots of ash piles in a hurry will do it. Teslas are just the most common.
---
Mire if you like peace and quiet, but not if your a seller as it is not very busy and not many want to travel out there just for a vendor, unless your near Watoga.
---
Finally had a good run yesterday and almost did my first solo against him with just a bloodied handmade 1* and my game crashed after he was on around 30% hp left.
---
I‚Äôve never known a digital download game to crash so many times and have so many loading issues
---
I can‚Äôt believe you went to the scumbags who make up the membership of the Enclave. For the Brotherhood!
---
Lol
---
For like 4000 bullion
---
Tl;dr
---
Most camps are in the forest these days. I guess cus its the free frast travel to 76 and then you can do a jog between several camps? Seems to be the trading meta game these days
---
For me it's a solid minute or more.
---
Well stop rushing through the story and pay attention.
---
Yes you can. In theory you could go straight from the vault to the Enclave. In practice you couldn't manage that without someone to help you through it. But if you know the location that the questline starts from you can just go straight there and trigger it without need of doing earlier story quests.
---
The whole main quest is like this (original story not the Wastelanders storyline). You can do the whole thing the way it was intended or you can do things in more random order.
---
I don‚Äôt know what level you are. And I honestly don‚Äôt remember at the top of my head, but the perks I just mentioned you might not be able to unlock until you reach a certain level. Not only that but the works I suggested must be at max level to give you the results I mentioned.
---
Dont know what it means.....
---
Thought i was the only one lol, the legendary run board is soooo glitchy, i hate going to it, takes 20-30 seconds to move 10 spaces.
---
Pretentious. Who the fuck are you? And when the fuck did I ask for your opinion?
---
Too long didn't read.
---
Some had those dupe gear returned I guess daddy todd didn't mind that
---
I would just like to reiterate I am in no way saying anything bad about trap campers! All I'm saying is if for some reason you dont succeed atleased fight face to face with the person you failed to cheap kill!
---
I‚Äôll be on in a few hours if your still gunna be on bud got to help the farther in-law
---
The least they could do is change it to the tracklist that Vault 51's jukebox has. I like that a lot more than the classical tracks.
---
I‚Äôm fucking tired of rude ass people on this site.
---
I have it set to 50 cal. I thought it produced slow because it was a higher caliber ammo. It doesn‚Äôt seem unbearably slow and it‚Äôs better than nothing but don‚Äôt expect it to keep you well stocked.
---
I'll ask in return is let me know what numbers it throws up with pistol perks.
---
Get the ‚Äúbatteries included‚Äù perk, it‚Äôs in th intelligence category
---
Cool story bro!
---
Sad to see a whole paragraph is to long for you to read..
---
Name one. Never seen anyone that actually got banned. Bethesda can eat my ass with their shitty customer support.
---
Perhaps try using a syringer as they deal far less dmg?
---
Thanks for the offer but I found one in a vender. Cheers mate.
---
Nvm i just realised what the mission was ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thanks for the tip. Kinda forgot people could sell plans for a while there.
---
For the quest oyu need to use a syringer
---
Have you tried removing all perks such as Tenderizer, Bloody mess, Rifleman perks etc? All that increase dmg in any way
---
Yeah, Thought it was a different mission at first and remembered you need the vox stuff for it
---
I'm pretty sure
---
\-Remove all your damage related perks (like you did). Double check you removed everything.
---
\-**Do not shoot from stealth**, or headshots (depending on animal)
---
\-Range affects damage, so try shoot from long range.
---
This works for me and does about 1/2 health damage per shot. If you still have issues for some reason realm hop. By realm hopping you reset the targets to different ones and can get animals with more health.
---
Double check all the perks are removed and maybe try shooting it from a further distance to reduce dmg over distance?
---
Ok thank you so much!
---
The masks drop in a bundle with a few jumpsuits with a 0.15% chance from all events in the Savage Divide (Uranium Fever, One Violent Night, Messenger, Guided Meditation, ...)
---
Thanks man, I think I fixed it
---
What about non-legacy/hacked energy weapons?
---
JE triggers the magic damage bug and the energy explosions bypass explosion resist. Without either, it would be complete dogshit.
---
You can be my wendigo colossus rug. &lt;3
---
Perfect, thanks! And yes, so it seems. Like, what's up with that collar. Hahah
---
Wow never knew this was a thing (i don't produce 50 cal). Surely that must be a bug.. According to wiki it takes 10h to make 200 rounds.. Jesus. By the looks of it, 50 cal has a bug that doubles the time it takes to produce ammo. I believe it should be producing in 1.44 min intervals like everything else and fill up in 4.8 hours.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ArmCo\_ammunition\_construction\_appliance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ArmCo_ammunition_construction_appliance)
---
Well? Don't leave us in suspense!
---
Did she heed the advice?
---
Wow I can‚Äôt believe how many people are getting that rare drop I can‚Äôt get a single mask to drop and I do the savage divide enclave event every chance i get and uranium I was beginning to think they stopped it but it‚Äôs good to hear people are getting them forever looking
---
Wow this is amazing! So creative
---
I think we need more recolored pa skins. Thats what the community has been asking for ages!
---
*sarcasm off*
---
It says the reclaimed mole miner mask protects you also and it has a kick ass head lamp I wear mine with the science scribe outfit
---
Yeah, it sounds like it.
---
I have one space left so I guess I dont need to worry. Do you think we need to claim all rewards before the run is over?
---
A Mole Miner gauntlet will match a Deathclaw Gauntlet point for point in damage if I remember correctly. The Bloodied and Swingspeed alone make it top tier. Get the extra blade mod on it and you have a new main melee weapon that will be very hard to top.
---
Use this calculator to figure it out, instead of trusting random people here that may or may not know the correct answer (usually don't).
---
[https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Your mole miner will produce more dps which is good on bosses, but your deathclaw does more damage per hit which is good when questing / farming and expecting one shot kills. That said, even mole miner will one shot most enemies, especially from stealth.
---

Nah, you should be able to get all 10 levels if you complete most dailies.
---
Can finish it off today with the weekly
---
Explorer outfit too
---
I think it's trolls and the more attention it gets the more they'll do it. Cant be sure though, I'm not an asshole out to ruin everyone's day.
---
Legendary version with a faster fire rate. I have one and it melts things.
---
Yet to experience dying in ACP. I'm confused as to what people are dying to. The environmental threats aren't one-shot mechanics.
---
Basically this is ESO all over again and don't stand in red.
---
2 weeks break, don't stress out.
---
Yeah, not wasting anymore Atoms. Also no budget so whatever.
---
Fuck is a no no in fallout 76
---
The legendary run has come to an end for most people by now, so once again most events return to being a ghost town.
---
If Bethesda wants events to be active outside of the seasons, then they need to do something about improving the rewards. No more 1\* rolling pins from Encryptid, no more people one-shotting legendaries before everyone gets their loot, and no more playing Campfire Tales 50 times over for 1 measly possum badge.
---
But your title says you wish they'd change it so you can complete both sides without any repercussions. I simply pointed out that you could complete both quest lines without repercussions. They won't change it, because then your choice of sides wouldnt matter, which it hardly does anyway. Just whether or not you want to lose rep with one faction at the end and a special named weapon. 
---
What I did with my 3rd character was to level up to 20, without doing any main quests then just started wayward/wastelander quest line. If i ran into a point where I needed something from the original quest line, then I did that.
---
It is only a few points behind the dcg or power fist. It is a top tier unarmed weapon. The biggest downside is it takes up 1/3 of your screen haha
---
Edit, why the heck did I get down voted lol
---
Basically it's the same as SBQ, nobody wants to kill the little guys and if they swarm one person it's pretty hectic, especially at a minimal frame rate. They have to have died at least 8 or so times to get the respawn time that high though, Ive only had to wait 3 secs when it happened to me.
---
He‚Äôs not wrong bro. You wrote half a page just to say how you got screwed by a Trap camp.  Just leave a ‚ÄòTLDR; I got screwed by a trap camp and wanted to vent‚Äô,  at the end of your post.
---
Thats really bad that hope they don't start foing it on ps4
---
I would actually take it for a test ride instead. You can look at all the numbers and data, but it won't tell you how you'll feel about it. Do your normal routine, but keep your dcg in your stash. If you think the mmg is a better feel, fit, or look, then by all means, make that your main. Also, check out available mods (I think dcg only has extra claw)
---
Wait you are upset no one turned up to uranium fever  I would love all that steel and scrip to myself
---
I‚Äôve played ACP 5 times, had it failed twice because of this. One time he disappeared entirely for 10 minutes. We were just wandering about picking up screws and stuff when suddenly he‚Äôs back, breathing his toxic bad breath over us.
---
When seasons were announced they said there'd be a two week break between each one. So patch 22 could come out in three weeks at the latest.
---
Both have extra claws mod and it is calculated on the numbers i provided.
---
Perfect Place for farm these nuka colas and for farm Raider or settler reputation
---
I probably could have worded my post better. I was really just venting because I wish I worked on the settlers missions at the same time as the raiders, so I could‚Äôve gotten the Chinese stealth for free. I just wish there was a way you could still do them after running the raid with the raiders. Especially because it doesn‚Äôt really make a difference in the end anyways
---
Sure it's intentional, but you're making a big ol deal out of nothing. Speaking as someone who has worked in enterprise software development, it was probably something as benign as an email 2 years ago that said "Hey, should buying a free icon auto equip it?" "Sure, for X random reason" and nobody has been bothered to look at it again since.
---
No I just blow them up
---
Oh boy! a free icon!
---
For fuck sake, Rule 8.
---
Yeah... what‚Äôs your point?? I can say oh explosive weapons wouldn‚Äôt be good if it wasn‚Äôt for the area damage, because that is sort of the point of them. What I‚Äôm saying is the reason people use a JE laser is because of the magic dmg, no one would use it if it wasn‚Äôt magic everyone would stay bloodied
---
It's so we have to keep subscribed through fomo.  If they put in the 1st tab (why even have that now). Then the rewards are redeemable anytime.
---
Ok
---
What‚Äôs the legendary effect? I have a bunch with 25ffr but haven‚Äôt got consistent magical results.
---
I usually do the same after I nuke them.
---
Yes you are right, it doesn't make a difference in the end. I rushed through on my 2nd character cause I just wanted to start getting bullion. Messed up cause it was my stealth rifle character and would have benefited great from the suit.  
---
What platform are you one? If you want to start a new character, i can help level you up so you can get the suit for free on that character. Just a bummer to have to grind the faction rep on 4 characters.
---
OP if it helps people have seen this post a thousand times hence the response. Don't take it personal.
---
CSA isn't what people make it out to be either.
---
Wow this again. It‚Äôs literally mentioned multiple times in the game. What do you want them to say? They didn‚Äôt work on it. Obsidian did and none of the devs are there.
---
It‚Äôs not a exploit it‚Äôs a bug
---
Yes, 220 ballistic, 400 energy and, IIRC, 40 poison.
---
See that's the thing--maybe it's my ESO experience but add management is everything. Avoid environmental threats, add manage, get the revives and damage deal when appropriate.
---
Look after your mates!!!
---
Ill def take it. I have a few low levels that could use some help
---
I didnt even get screwed yall idiots
---
Are there any images or models on the PTS to explain wtf the difference is between the greenhouse "housing" and walls?  Is the housing like a prefab or just the roofs and anything that's not a wall something?
---
This videos explains it very well in short time
---
https://youtu.be/kXIP4GTQrV4
---
In any way, if you manage to decode a code, then you are big brain because it's a whole pain in the ass to do so.
---
They only update it once a day
---
I‚Äôm on xbox. Thank you for your kindness. It would be nice to have a lady friend to play with on the game, since I haven‚Äôt really ran into any other than myself lol. I‚Äôve been thinking about starting a new character, so when I do, i‚Äôll let you know :)
---
Yeah. Agree. I am not feeling super excited. üòÇ
---
Nah
---
It's pretty clearly both lol
---
"Edit, why the heck did I get down voted lol" - Cause people are kinda funny here and can't think for themselves. They see one downvote and they will go like sheep with the herd "HE MUST BE WRONG!" \* cliiiiiiick \*
---
The bugged explosive lasers wreck him though, that‚Äôs why people use them.
---
What does OP mean and CSA mean?
---
Idk if I should be happy I skipped this. It would‚Äôve taken along time but still, some of the rewards were cool but just not worth the grind
---
Maybe a Robobrain attached to some random appliance? I only say robobrain since it was Mobius who created both the mug and toaster, right?
---
thank you, i didnt know about the calculator
---
Go cry on your boyfriend's lap
---
It just works- Todd Howard.
---
Cool beans. Xbox too. I can also introduce you to other women on fallout too. 
---
I ran 1 character for a long while. Made a second and it became a lot more fun. Learning new ways of playing really opens up the game. You can change your build without wasting level up.
---
This would give me a mod to use there.
---
It updates around the daily challenge reset time, 12pm EST.
---
I‚Äôve have a total of two account one of which was a level 80 something before it got deleted by my brother, and I‚Äôm not playing my second as a level 105. Which yes, my second character is so much better.
---
You mean the ones that aren't that bright? Like Marquee Letters?
---
Extremely   common drop from dupe gifts. Just check people's camps
---
You'll get it.i got mine even joined  with only 1 minute left on uranium fever and died right before it ended.lol.really surprised when I saw both masks when I was willing to trade a bunch just for 1

---
Golden!
---
100% agree, I usually make sure I've tagged Earle, then just have at the wendigos whenever they appear, getting shots at Earle inbetween. Good  team players are few and far between, even with the public teams update.
---
No, they aren‚Äôt the Marquee ones, they are the light-ish blue neon ones. I try to make them larger and it‚Äôs shows green (okay to place) but then they snap small. I‚Äôm not sure why though. I paid sooo many caps with these plans lol
---
Their loss too, all them screws are worth their weight in gold.
---
Yeah they have all the time in the world to do that while you're gone. Sofia does that to me. I act like I want to chat and she backs off of it. I say ttyl and jump on the bench. It wouldn't be so bad but it's always when I need to use it.
---
Eh, it's still one of the subs rules, hard to know where to draw the line on what is or isn't an exploit 
---
Bethesda could totes ban or reset someone's account for doing this. Is it likely? Nah it's probably fine.
---
But it's still an exploit, so there is still the chance
---
That's why discussing how to do exploits isn't allowed :P
---
Maybe try on /r/fo76filthycasuals, it's a less restrictive sub, not sure how they rule on exploits tho
---
Right i had to put a lock on my door to my craft room. EVEN THEN it still happens some how even if they aren‚Äôt on it.
---
Are you high?
---
Fasnacht man mask also spawns in fort defiance

Tuesday
---
Wouldn't be surprised if there is already a dupe method on the downlow.last dupe method was live for a long time but wasn't shared publicly. Shits crazy
---
If this sub gonna ban me over telling you about a bug that hurts nothing and no one and has happened before with no serious reaction that‚Äôll suck but it seems like almost every subreddit for 76 is just heaps of rules
---
follow up question, how the f r u such a high rank? I have been playing since day 1 and I'm barely level 75. I haven't even been able to finish a nuke launch run successfully.
---
Find someone close to that level and gift it to them and tell them to do the same when they level out of it.
---
I should have played way more casually, as I was done waay too early. And all these SCORE bonuses near the end I never saw coming. Will try to chill way more on the next one, although it's real tough for me to resist the completionist/perfectionist urge to complete every single daily and weekly until I'm done
---
Also all those examples in the ‚Äúrule 8‚Äù are harmful exploits and this one harms no one because like I said it‚Äôs already happened and you can‚Äôt trade the armour pieces because they are bullion items
---
Im thinking the fireworks was just a nod to the season being around during the fourth of july. They will also be fixed next update
---
Create a team with a friend/someone that finished the run and get them to build you the door at your camp?
---
I'm on PC and happy to build you one if you add me üëç ign:bigsiege
---
Salvage divide mountain range overlooking cranberry bog. 
---
There‚Äôs still some area with a little greens, very secluded, peaceful, not a lot of people camp there. Plus, I can watch the nukes on queen from my camp.
---
You won't be banned, just the post might get removed cuz it technically violates a rule, don't take it so personal lmao
---
Its a bug not an exploit
---
Exploit - make use of (a situation) in a way considered unfair or underhand.
---
This isnt unfair to any other play and isnt underhand, like duping 50,000 B2525 fixers for yourself
---
Everyone with the same things can do the same thing without crashing a server and they dont get any reward for it, other than getting a jetpack on their arm WHICH SHOULD BE AN OPTION ON ALL ARMORS ANYWAY
---
Also, if it wasnt posted on here, Bethesda would never know about it because they dont test anything
---
EDIT; And another thing, Bethesda should give whoever made that skin a promotion, not fix it - sell it as a benefit; think of all the green camo paint sales they will make.
---
I have mine set as an inoffensive colour at low opacity. It really does change the experience I feel, helps it be a lot more immersive.
---
I'm flooding in handmade skins.well maybe not but damn...combat rifle mods work on the fixer how hard would it be to make the skins work?one of the most sought after weapons has no skins at all?
---
Well i know i havent donated anything since steel week so that sounds about right as far as im concerned.
---
What are these guide stones you speak of?  You talking about that weird stone monument on the hill with the 'alien' carvings on it?
---
Wow didn‚Äôt know that thanks
---
24/7
---
Wow that‚Äôs awesome and I hope
---
I gave you an up in appreciation for the link. You did some good be happy with that. Nothing else matters.
---
Whoever works these out should be on a Salary of Script and Atoms üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs the end of days
---
Try experiencing dying so many times that you get kicked outside and can't get back in on my 1st 2 tries. 3rd and 4th tried I died just as Earle get killed because I'm standing at the entrance where you jump down and rock falls on me ( because this level 405 Bloodied Build didn't know what the heck he was doing).
---
If they don't wish to give us atoms, give us scrips for completion of Daily and Weekly rewards once we've completed the Season Pass. That'd be pretty cool.
---
Yeah I read that somewhere
---
But what about chain gang
---
Ok sure
---
&lt;3
---
I put in 2-3 hours a day, and finished it having come in half way through the 'Season' via game pass. Looking at it, I could put in a 2 hour session, 3 times a week, and do the same next season.
---
And I'm already looking at buying a copy before the game drops off the service. Up in the air about Fallout 1st. We'll see.
---
Hmm.. it'll take make at least a week to get the gold for jetpack, how long it will take this to be fixed?
---
I use them in Silo's to destroy the mainframe cores. At least it gives them a purpose. \*&lt;shrugs&gt;\*
---
I'm definitely going for that BoS bunker. It's a straight recreation of  [Lost Hills](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lost_Hills) from the first game. Feels a bit silly, and out of place, but that's never stopped me before.
---
Actual definition of exploit: "a software tool designed to take advantage of a flaw in a computer system, typically for malicious purposes such as installing malware."
---
Doing this bug is taking advantage of a flaw lol
---
But by all means, have fun on your weird crusade of what you think the word exploit means, again it's not like Bethesda is gonna do anything  (Probably)
---
But still, this post is against the subs rules, which idk why you're so upset about it, the post hasn't been removed or anything 
---
The mods could remove it if they wanted to, just like Bethesda could ban people who use the bugged power armor if they wanted to lol
---
My experience went a bit like yours in the beginning. I play bloodied melee but I carry a bloodied 50 cal. It took me a few rounds of playing against him to learn to heal vigilantly and when to duck and cover. I‚Äôm used to running in and punching something til it‚Äôs dead.
---
I was really frustrated at first because I died a lot and missed rewards the first 3 times. I‚Äôve fought him about 12 times since then and have been very successful with my teams. When I hunkered down and decided to switch up my strategy I actually enjoyed the strategy and how different of a boss fight it is. There are still some things I take issue with like the expanding respawn times and the collapsing of the mine shaft keeping you from looting him if you die simultaneously, but overall I think it‚Äôs a welcome change of pace once you find a rhythm to the chaos.
---
There actually is a skin for the Death Tambo. I've only seen it come up 2-3 times but it tends to stick around for a bit when it does.
---
I see them in player's vendors all the time.
---
Codes are manually updated every week. Eck fetches them. Pure punches them into NukaCrypt. I guess Pure made a human error.
---
PC got a free upgrade when it migrated onto Steam, so it's not *THAT* crazy of an idea, is it?   
---
\*&lt;starts sweating&gt;\* heh...
---
Yup, what I did for my first time. The bleed mod just makes that last bit go a lot faster if you happen to try and kill a level 66 instead of a 16
---
I know that place! Level 80 legendary sheepsqautch had me stuck on the roof when I was a lvl 50. Showed him whose boss. At the cost of all my ammo
---
Your definition of exploit refers to something totally different
---
But whatever, i don't care.  Todd can take my pants down and get his $8 for paint i wouldn't have bought otherwise and congratulate his employees for a job well done
---
Only issue IMO is for those who don't have or want to use the points to get all 3 hacker perks haha
---
Original post/er and Chinese Stealth Armor.
---
All burn ups, are from those who speed run it, the fact there WAS not enough POINTS, and autocomplete bugs, just maked it much more tedious, but yeah it was fun.
---
try it for yourself and see, I can hop into power armor to cancel it and back out to prove it works.  The supermutants said westek belongs to them, did I believe them no, I proved otherwise.
---
127 Bullets to kill a behemoth with 1 star bloodies 207 fire rate minigun in power armor, same gun with 15% block chest on 13 bullets kill same behemoth
---
Are they smaller then you would see at other people's camps?
---
The 'actual' name of the item is The Starlet Sniper. I'm guessing it's an Unstoppable type comic hero like the Mistress of Mysteries.
---
Edit; Just looked it up, [Astoundingly Awesome Tales - The Starlet Sniper](https://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-4/Astoundingly_Awesome_Tales_-_The_Starlet_Sniper) is a collectable in FO4.
---
You could probably ask Bethesda Support for a refund on the other items, buy the bundle first, then explain to them that you want to refund the other stuff since you bought the bundle. They tend to be really forgiving about purchases.
---
I've really been playing only on weekends so I've missed a LOT of dailies and I've still managed to get to rank 82. 
---
I don't understand the players who finished it a month ago whinging about having to grind for it. It's really not bad, and nobody forced you to rush through grinding out challenges and the xp repeatable every day.
---
It's the same fucking thing... if you find a bug and decide to take advantage of it to do something the developers never intended you are then EXPLOITing it.
---
Why you getting so pissed bro this bug hurts no one and you can‚Äôt even trade the items like you could with the ultracite PA bug
---
Oh that's cool! It does look kind of epic
---
Yeah! Like way smaller than the ones I‚Äôve seen. I went to one camp and the neon letters size was about 1/5 of my body. When I place mine down they are definitely smaller than my head.
---
Totally agree, done both of them solo a few times now until one or two players appear at the end to get the completion stat. I'm quite enjoying both events solo if I'm honest. Obviously I appreciate Line in the Sand takes a lot longer without company but, lots of XP and tonnes of loot, always good!
---
Then there are the moments when there isn't anyone at the workbench but the game still says it's occupied...
---
such a bizarre system. i really wonder wtf bethesda is thinking sometimes. why not just have every 50 levels let you unlock legendary perk card rank? why this convoluted implementation?
---
No, it's the Torso that gives the x4 mining bonus, when the text says arms
---
Why / how will daily ops render useless the Follow Through perk?
---
Exactly i have my crafting area locked to prevent them from using it and it still doesn‚Äôt help. Sometimes I‚Äôll turn around and she‚Äôll just stare at me through my metal door.
---
When I saw that on the news page after loading up I thought it was a custom workbench combining multiple benches into one. Sadly just a skin.
---
Day 39 of when Fo76 was released was doing a Free States quest in the mire at that armory.
---
Anywho I was creeping by some machinery an saw a work bench So I was like ohh I can quickly repair my rifle yeeeeah as I'm transitioning I notice the Heavy Turret in the corner...
---
Game Game Gaaame GAME GAAAAAAAME!!!
---
Of course I kept getting a rollback server delay and kept requiping the bench annnd dead.
---
Safe to say my chat I was in were on the floor giggling like crazy.
---
The sad thing is, I wouldn't have any problem doing all this if it weren't for the fact that you have to go back to whitespring after Every. Damn. Officer.
---
It just makes it so tedious - more loading screens (and walking through the bunker) than playing!
---
I'm new to the game, theres a caps limit?
---
It was fun playing this season in unyeilding, stacking buffs to grind XP. I really feel this
---
style of gameplay. Setting up sleep/music buff and heading into the wastes to farm.. now I can do nothing and justify sitting in PA.
---
An exploit is an exploit, stop trying to play semantics.  If you found a bug that let you gain infinite scip that's not hurting anyone but it's still a fucking exploit.
---
Looks like a bad Spiderman. ü§£
---
I actually liked that bed. It is the reason I bought another month of FO 1st.
---
I use it for my Brothel-themed camp :)
---
Till you realise you‚Äôve done 99.99% of the game without the weapons your after üò¨..
---
I appreciate the warning from you guys on this.   I'm thinking that if/when I try to do a solo launch, I'm going to do it on a private world just because of this.   
---
I'm really sorry this happened to you two.
---
Your right it shouldn‚Äôt and it doesn‚Äôt take that long for me but those with slower internet might have that issue...
---
The quest title is "siding with____" and when you talk to the npc to start it it also tells you it's the point of no return
---
That example of scrip would hurt someone, it would mess with the economy because it would add a bunch of script/legendary weapons way to fast and could mess up the trade by flooding the game with a bunch of items the bug I found doesn‚Äôt hurt literally anyone you can‚Äôt try and counter my point with a example that goes with my point also chill out dude don‚Äôt gotta swear all the time
---
A worthwhile comment right hereü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah you'd think the Raiders would be loaded for bear.
---
Thanks.
---
After the 3 main quests for either side.  Do all 6 then choose.
---
When it comes to bloodied unarmed ,the difference in damage is almost irrelevant as you should still hit for 1000+ damage. Power fist has anti armor mod,while gauntlet saw has innate bleed damage. 
---
That said I would use that mole fist over your deathclaw gauntlet,swing speed is amazing for melee.
---
Yeah Earl give guaranteed 3 star at end so lots of people are doing it over and over. Rad rumble I turn up see how many scavagers are alive and decide of it's worth staying. Project been trying to get the rare drops for ever did hearted now they should scale rewards to how many people are in event.
---
Exactly how I felt and I only went this last time just to test the asbestosis chest lining which actually work. I didn't get any damage from the falling ambers. Now that I (along with the 1 other player who stayed to the end) managed to defeat Earle, I am definitely going back but next time I may have to figure out a new strategy depending on how many others show up. If im not mistaken, how many of the smaller wendigos spawn depends on how many players show up. Now what I have to figure out is the location of the exit. If Earle geys taken down, the exit needs to be more visible heck we already have enough to deal with fighting him as it is.
---
Pc
---
Totally random but relating to the nuclear keycard reward: that seems like such a strange thing to give away, but thinking about the calendar for upcoming content, season 2 has an event called ‚Äúbombs drop‚Äù. I‚Äôm guessing that event may involve launching a bunch of nukes which is why they‚Äôre giving us some cards in the pass.
---
It doesn't matter what I think.  You found a bug.  You exploited that bug.  You came here and told everyone else how to exploit that bug.  You're breaking the fucking rules.
---
The literal definition of an exploit is a bug used in an unintended manner to someone's advantage.  You're putting a fucking jetpack on your limbs, that frees up your torso for other mods.  You're giving yourself and everyone else you've encouraged to use this exploit an advantage in the game.
---
Impressive
---
Yeah but I‚Äôm not a native English speaker &gt;.&gt;
---
i ussually build my camp near the centre of the map, saves me caps when i want to fast travel and if possible i build as close to a train station as i can to sell to the vendor and sell my legendaries.
---
The Fasnacht Man mask is the only Fasnacht mask that can spawn outside the event. It has two fixed spawn points - the one in the train yard and another in a room on the 2nd floor of the right wing in Fort Defiance.
---
Okay, finally got some crimson flux to make the ammo and yes. The gun is amazing. It is exactly what I was trying to achieve with my character. I had been using a .44 anti-armor exploding damage western revolver, but this fits the Gunslinger role play much better. Thank you!
---
did not know that, thanks!
---
Bro chill what happened to rule 4  also you legit get to fly around for a whole 4 seconds if you know how to jetpack whoopity doo you get to fly and that gives you such a insane advantage that you need to get angry about it calling it this insane exploit that‚Äôs hurting the entire community also you got the definition of a exploit wrong a a exploit is a software tool designed to take advantage of a flaw in a computer system, typically for MALICIOUS purposes such as installing malware I don‚Äôt think being able to fly for 4 seconds is malicious
---
I run 2 bloodied characters, 1 bloodied heavy PA and 1 bloodied stealth commando.
---
I‚Äôm only 71 level on the heavy gunner so I can‚Äôt give the best comparison but I‚Äôll try to give you as much as possible.
---
Play style wise I‚Äôd prefer heavy gunner, you rush in like a train mauling down anyone in your way with your big gun is straight badass, plus PA is very tanky, you can laugh in most of the bosses face while their punches feels like tickles (still need to stimpak tho) to you. Sneaking is slower (even with the fixer), you could stand up and rush from point to point and crouch to hidden again but it‚Äôs still not as quick as heavy gunner, but the damage numbers compared to the big guns are so much more satisfying, you‚Äôll be able to kill bosses half or maybe quarter amount of time than heavies.
---
Grinding wise both have their own mountain to climb. Heavy gunner will be grinding hard for junk resources since you‚Äôll be repairing your armor more and consume more bullets. Sneak commando grinds less for bullets and junk resources but you‚Äôll need to roll for that perfect set of legendary armor (which compare to the PA grind is more tedious) unless you‚Äôre comfortable with weak resistance. (which is obsolete soon in Daily Ops)
---
Both builds are good for me and I disagree of staying on 20% all times and dying frequently. I almost never stay on active nerd rage whenever I‚Äôm bossing unless I‚Äôm very confident I won‚Äôt die on that run, there are a lot of factors to that: the people you‚Äôre running with, server stability, how prepared are you (chems, food, aids; are you fully buffed for a quick run or just tagging along the crowd). I stay on 20% only for carry weight or xp gain.
---
Bethesda: Cool idea! I'll make it cost some Gold Bullion
---
*10000 Gold Bullion*
---
Plenty of stuff returns to the atom shop. Nobody know what or when though
---
Yeah, I've just never ever seen this item return when looking it up, no one's even mentioned this item since it came out over a year ago.
---
Forest.   I don't want my camp torn up by high level enemies (watched friend's camp get destroyed by three SB's in the SD).   Also, if I'm exhausted from some intense battle, I don't want to have to battle a glowing yao gai, etc., just to get into and use my camp.  
---
A happy coincidence to my location is that it's a spawn point for animals.   I'm like a wildlife rescue.
---
I think its console related, on PC no issues.
---
Thanks for the tipp. Another Legacy item for my collection
---
Try building a wall at your camp and then try placing the letters and see if that does anything.
---
If were going to talk toasters, I want Talky The Toaster from *Red Dwarf*
---
News Flash.  Just like how it doesn't matter what the fuck I think about your bug it doesn't matter what you think either.  All that matters is what the mods think and that's why your thread has already been deleted.
---
If you want to try your luck then go ahead and post it again and include your little essay about how it's not "really" an exploit and see how that works for you.
---
Yeah imo it‚Äôs better than the one you could do with ultracite because you can‚Äôt trade it so it harms no one other than being a funny addition and a novelty item for people to show off later down the line
---
Only got deleted because you got angry at me for making a point and trying to have some fun and make this crappy game fun again but you went and spammed the mods with reports way to make a fun community toxic bud hope you got your kicks out of this
---
&gt;My theory is that it's a hobby of theirs.  They downvote everything.
---
"So, what's Fallout 76 about?"
---
"A man and his toaster."
---
It's really  odd that the first Atomic shop paint for T-65 is camo. I mean it's a really generic paint for a very unique armor.
---
Yes,  you found out my secret.  I control the mods and they act at my whim deleting threads that displease me regardless of the actual rules.
---
wut
---
Disappointing.   Guess I'll sell all that Ballistic Bock I made.
---
Yeah I know, that's not what I'm saying though.
---
You know what the easiest solution for Bethesda is?
---
When you hover over a players camp, there a section for Aid and a section showing Stimpacks.
---
Why is there a single section exclusively for Stimpacks? Why isn't it in with Aid? Many things give you health beyond just Stimpacks.
---
Move them in with Aid and make the Stimpack section for clothing.... Then they don't have to screw around with the UI all that much.
---
Problem solved.
---
Sure does
---
Haha reminds me of when my rl friend started and creamed at my raider tent (he‚Äôs a masochist). I was like it‚Äôs in the atom store bro.. think he missed it by a few days üòÇ
---
Yes! Also does anyone notice they're seems like fewer songs on the loop these days? Did they lose the licenses or something? I wish they'd change it up again!
---
It‚Äôs common
---
yes, I proposed exactely this a month ago. Only this type of bobblehead stand would make me want to collect them. Now it is just way too much budget
---
They could even make themed magazine stands that hold one series of magazines, with some art work on the stands resembling the magazines. Like the displays you would see in a comic book store.
---
I started a two weeks later on a mule account (finished week ago on main), completed today while double score week started (cant make it earlier bethesda üòí)
---
Angry Turtle has a great "Avoiding Death" video, whilst Captainoob has a new Earle Tested  video which is helpful.
---
Like the chicken coop from the current season, I imagine those will be sold for gold bullion at Foundation
---
Any new rewards in the pails, or same as last time?
---
Kinda capable, not very capable. You ain't cutting edge there I'm afraid. But 76 is a strange beast and requires tweaking where others don't.
---
I would recommend doing the questline for both up until the point of no return. It gives you a good amount of reputation for each faction. 
---
The Settler's questline will give you something that's pretty useful(which will also save you a pretty good amount of grinding later on). 
---
As for the Raiders, I'm not sure if there's anything unique to their questline. There is one legendary(haven't sided with foundation yet so not sure if it is unique) that you can get later on with the Raiders by being nice to a certain npc.
---
Ah okay so I just have to wait. Thx buddy :)
---
No way since:
---
1. The run IS designed to replace the free atom challenge to lower atom gain.
---
2. The repeatable challenge is 10000 xp, which is a potential exploit to those glitch players for infinite atom. Beth won‚Äôt want to deal with that. (remember those people who glitch to rank 100 that got banned for life? No cuz a lot of them didn‚Äôt) 
---
You‚Äôre literally asking them to cut out the source of their income.
---
If you‚Äôre expecting we get smaller stuff like fireworks or lunch boxes for like every couple thousand scores, that will be more likely.
---
Just finding this out now after buying the skin and got my post taken down and had some dude curse at me for talking about it
---
I been using the slugger plasma weapon. Haven't have any issues on my ps4pro.
---
just give us something cool like Sierra power armour
---
Really hope I‚Äôm not spoiling anything but I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre aware that you will have access to new craftable weapons/armor... that being said, it won‚Äôt hurt you to check those out to help you make your decision on who decide with first. Eventually you‚Äôll max rep with both sides. My main sided with the wrong side early on, operator error... just now maxed that rep to have access to the weapon I wanted literally two days ago
---
No perks needed,
---
Its shotguns with bashing damage/limb damage.
---
Having an armorpiece with "15% less damage while blocking" equipped makes all shotguns magic ( only in vats)
---
And for machine guns its you need 200+ fire rate
---
Minigun is the most common.
---
Thats all i know so far.
---
I have an instigating/bashing damage combat shotgun and Well... I oneshot almost everything.
---
Kinda Takes the fun out of the game. So really Think about getting such a Thing. Its like cheating. And cheating is only fun the first few Times.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt count on that. The secret door isn‚Äôt being sold by either side.
---
Good to know. Ill look up the rewards and go from there. I know the Chinese Stealth Suit seems to be a reward and that would be my first thing I'd want.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events  
---
shows 97,88m cloth donated rn
---
You can actually earn that in a quest, or buy it with bullion later on like I‚Äôm gonna have to do with my main... I recommend earning it early. My melee alt has it and the only thing I will ever wear PA for again is carry weight. Lol awesome in nuke zones
---
A pretty cheeky method I am using is if you have the communist collectron. Do you have that one by chance?
---
Actually i do
---
A liberator named Larry.
---
MKV
---
It took me over 100 tokens to get it but it's now the main day to day weapon for my shotty character.. worth the grind
---
It's on game pass for free in Xbox so the next gen Xbox upgrade if there is one will be free too. Not sure what PS5 will do tbh I can't see them upgrading the game at all how could they, they don't have enough staff to fix this broken mess now never mind upgrade to next gen.
---
It‚Äôs so annoying
---
Agreed. I have a Berserker I‚Äôd like to use, but lack of silencer makes it a no go for stealth
---
Shotgun need Bash and the Limb Damage? 
---
Machine guns I just need to
---
Get over a 200+ fire rate?
---
I fondly recall how terrified I used to be of the Space Invaders  XD
---
Just always getting louder and faster.  Mnrrrrg
---
They won‚Äôt acknowledge the game? The lucky 38, ultra-luxe and Mr House are all mentioned in Wastelanders, Nuka World has the NV flavours and Sunset Sarsaparilla is directly mentioned twice, the Atomic Command pip boy game has the ‚ÄúWelcome To New Vegas‚Äù sign, Deacon mentions House in FO4 etc. I don‚Äôt know where this weird narrative that they don‚Äôt acknowledge it comes from
---
That's a whole different thing.
---
I think they said it would be available tomorrow. So it‚Äôs almost 5AM here now and the atomic shop resets at noon for me, so I‚Äôd say in 7 hours it‚Äôll be there.
---
Science Scribe outfit hides your backpack and meshes really well with the SS Jetpack. ü§ô
---
One of my camps is at a random raider spawn. Always two people in my camp, ally and a random raider. I just shoot the raider if they‚Äôre on my bench and I need it. LOL if it‚Äôs my ally, go into build mode and store them if I‚Äôm in a hurry... and don‚Äôt have an active ally quest
---
Thank you so much for answering!
---
Already felt very annoyed that I might have missed it!
---
Wasn't playing last couple of days much because of grinding in other games...
---
Has to do with the server ping, not any perk. For some weird reason the high fire rate plus certain legendary mods make heavy guns do an insane amount of damage.
---
You gave them your steel? Sucker!!! Just kidding, but I haven‚Äôt donated one scrap of anything... Hell I just discovered that location a couple days ago
---
Well at the very least whenever I‚Äôm awake
---
Mire. Every time.
---
Yeah, more p2w stuff for sure
---
Bethesda:Just because your the first person to ask that ill make an exception 
---
Also Bethesda: Fucking breaks the entire game because you wanted  pistol and automatic pistol perks in perception
---
Crafting them is the best way. You can get them occasionally from treasure maps. Or just pay someone to mod it for you
---
K, Unfortunately I dont think I could trust anyone to mod it for me, but thanks
---
I'm  constantly watching their videos.
---
i farm my nuka cola quantum from here. and yea also a great spot for other flavors. didn't know grape spawned here i will ahve to keep an eye out for it but it would explain why ive got 2 of them in my inventory.
---
If you go over to the market sub you can find plenty of trust worthy people. Just look for folks with high trade karma. Thats how I have got mine modded. If someone over there has 100+ trade karma they can hold my first born.
---
But if you're not in to that you'll just have to buy the plan and start crafting. In my 1.3k hours I don't think I have ever gotten one outside of a few from the 1k+ maps I've done
---
What are consequences?  lol
---
The previous rewards were in the shop for a week, so you have some cushion if you don't play everyday.
---
I think if they were an insignificant amount that it wouldn't hurt anything.
---
Like say 1 atom per former rank up with 1-3 per challenge completed.  Enough to help smooth us over when were just shy of an item where after,  but not so much so that it replaces the need to buy any atoms at all.
---
Just as a means to maintain a bit of balance between their need for funding and our crippling addiction to digital doll houses to play dress up in.
---
Everyone who reads this sub already knows from all the previous posts about this. 
---
And those that care will refrain and those that don‚Äôt give a hoot will continue using them
---
So does the plan come from the maps or the actual gun? I have never done a map
---
No, you can occasionally get the weapon from maps. The plan you can get in the evclave bunker I believe
---
Alright, I really appreciate it, thx alot
---
Of course. Also be sure you're scrapping ultracite gattling lasers, not normal gattling lasers. They have a separate mod pool
---
Not looking forward to one wasteland at all as a level 400 player.
---
With every enemy being level 100 I‚Äôm going to have to use my best weapon and ammo everywhere I go, which means more ammo farming, and that also means weapons I carry with throwaway ammo for low level areas will now become useless. (I‚Äôm going to have to use my commando rifle everywhere I go because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm spec‚Äôd in instead of say my fancy pump shotgun I use for fun. Being forced to use the same weapon will just make the game boring for me.)
---
And don‚Äôt even get me started about camps... My camp I intentionally built outside of Helvetia because it‚Äôs a low level area? All those level 6 scorched now level 100? If you thought your turrets did nothing before...
---
One Wasteland should be an option you can turn off and on... As a high level player I‚Äôm not looking for the fight of my life with every enemy being level 100.
---
- guidestones mystery
---
what are you on about?
---
nice! and congrats.  Thanks for sharing neat to see other builds do amazing stuff
---
So for big bosses, sneak is useless unless everyone is sneaked, which i never saw either with SQB or Earl. Its an opinion but in 76 Power armor heavy gunner is like the only viable strong build, as VATs seem to be buggy time to time, shotguns sometimes do slap damage or magic damage that insta kills, even legendary (furious, instigating) fixer does just average damage, and all other guns are quite slow. I feel like the only real dangerous weapon in sneak is instigating lever action rifle (2 shot LAR too but inaccuracy is so annoying and only good for close range). without any rifle, sneak, damage perks, I somehow remember doing near 1K damage with both, but mostly with Instigating.
---
I get this error sometimes, usually doing this helps. Hope it does üëå https://www.androidcentral.com/how-make-your-playstation-4-faster-database-rebuild
---
So sick to the event failing because of this glitch. Every time I see it happen the people doing it aren't even barely scratching earl with that extra 3 minutes and it fails to load the collapse phase of the event entirely.
---
You have a chance to learn the BoS paintjob for combat armor helmet by scrapping any combat armor pieces.
---
Ok, got it
---
THIS. Jesus, it‚Äôs so damn annoying.
---
So by scrapping combat armor parts instead of combat helmets? Does it matter if I scrap light, sturdy or heavy combat armor?
---
It's a bit too complicated for your average brain. It's one of the things 76 did right, except the codes should be unique to the player so as not to cheapen the end game.
---
It is annoying. Just spam E on the workbenches, they leave soon-ish.
---
Prime. The ammo is dirt cheap to craft and you‚Äôll recoup some of it. But honestly, what really makes them difference is the crossbow itself. Basically a quad crossbow is what you want. At that point it doesn‚Äôt matter what frame you put on.
---
Also, explosive frame and rank 5 demolition expert does the most flat damage afaik. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm running: 1 explosive quad and 1 primed quad.
---
I think that's the regular gat laser. Think the ultracite plans drop from cranberry bog events. I found the plan in someone's vendor for really cheap.
---
Want more Halloween decor! Halloween will totally suck this year for countless people, help us to hold a grand player lead holiday season with haunted houses and trick or treating.
---
Why I'm always running Monster Mash, to save up candy to disperse this Halloween.  ^ o^
---
Want a spooky collectron that makes screaming sounds and plays spooky music,  a radio that plays the radio dramas, a spooky organ that plays that great creepy music from the church, mebe a means to put together custom care packages with whatever we'd like. To help lower level players. 
---
Also love that jester eyebot would love having something like that in my silent hill themed camp.
---
If you're PS4 I can make you one.
---
I think I heard from a random comment awhile ago there would be a one or two week break after the run finishes.
---
Me personally I kinda hope they just go into the next one, lots of a good looking stuff in the next run and I‚Äôm very excited for it.
---
Yes any armor piece will do, for the paintjob there is no need to scrap helmets. And type of combat armor (light/sturdy/heavy) does not affect the chance in any way.  
---
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR\_El8/edit#gid=1413261726](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=1413261726)
---
Now that would be something to see!
---
PC has plenty of other issues to compensate.
---
Before you go scrapping a bunch helmets try buying and learning the pland from the bot in grafton
---
There are items that were released one week, removed the next, and come back 2 weeks later. And then there are ones that were released once, ever, two years ago, that have never returned to the Atomic Shop since.
---
I've gone so far as to contact them basically asking 'where's the beef?' about multiple items. Their response was "We don't know when. Just keep checking the Atomic Shop".
---
TLDR;  
---
The best answer you will ever get is "maybe?".
---
Same thing happens at ammo factory.
---
That's disappointing to hear, I've never heard anything about this item reappearing or people talking about it much, so I don't think it was particularly popular and most likely they don't have much of a reason to bring the item back
---
Unlimited Power!
---
Damn thats good
---
Not that i'm aware of, but each their own i guess. As for me, my experience is pretty much flawless, beside a crash once in a while.
---
Sort of. It was fallout at one point, then I‚Äôm in Fortnite with a Fat Man, and then got killed by modus saying something like ‚Äòcheck out these cool skills, member‚Äô
---
*You look like you've seen some comments*
---
Haha companion go brrr
---
Yes, brrr indeed.
---
There is no BoS Combat Paint Plan for the helmet. It is a scrap to learn mod. You can buy the Chest and Limbs paint for BoS Combat Armor though. The game is weird sometimes
---
Good idea.
---
with One Wasteland, at least the legendaries are scaled so revisiting old and easy events might be worth it again.
---
IF you play a lot and somewhat immerse yourself into the game and you like the game, yes its quite possible and  I had couple of dreams in the past where there were big elements of fallout. Most before 76, where I binged FO1, FO2, FO3, NW, and FO4 thru and thru with all the DLCs etc. Cant quite remember all now but in one instance I was building a settlement, i think it was some place like Finch farm, I really spent a lot of time and used mods to redesign that place. I think i had some building and material problems and then got attacked. couple times i had some short nightmarish dreams about Pitt and Point lookout. Last one was about fallout 76, several weeks ago, I think i was under  some kind of Radroach attack, and lacked some food and materials etc. But it wasnt like i was in a virtual reality module or something. I actually didnt even realize how it was related to FO76 until i told my dream to my GF.
---
this.  
---
im short before cap limit and did some vendor hopping. beside of the time looking for the vendors (a guy had 3 vendors at different places.... why???),  the most annoying thing is looking for a stash also.
---
It's just a way to get more when paying for atoms, same cost but has perks
---
Nuked areas, you craft it with nuked fauna and irradiated materials from enemies in blasts zones (check what you need at a chemistry station), it‚Äôs honestly a pain, I recommend you equip green thumb to get double the materials and good with salt so they don‚Äôt degenerate as fast, as an alternative you can do the ACL and scorched earth events, they reward random flux, but it will take a bit

Have had nightmares where I'm trying to fix glitched stairs while trying to find ways to squeeze more build space from out of nowhere.
---
Not as fun as my usual nightmares of being eaten alive by zombies.
---
Because you have no dreams and a vision! 
---
I will start something like "Rent your Sidekick" so a player like you at level 400 can rent me  as sidekick. Your nasty level 100 Mutant is level 3 for me... i will shovel it or kill it with my pipegun for you. Efficient, cheap, fast. 
---
Rent you Sidekick for only 2500 caps per hour!  Efficient, cheap, fast.
---
You also can rent my Camp for only 1000 Caps per hour! be save and well protected in every area!
---
Amazing how fast you guys answer. thx
---
Bash or limb damage.
---
And for me it works with 200+ fire rate.
---
I got a faster fire rate minigun also modded to have it even higher. And it works.
---
Thanks for the downvotes whoever had the kindness
---
Make me
---
There's a black baseball cap that sold like mad back a couple of weeks after launch. Never returned. Mr. Pebbles backpack a few months after Wild Appalachia dropped, again was a hit. Never returned.
---
Then again, the biggest mods in the community since Morrowind have been hair styles, clothing styles and weapon appearances.  
---
Now that they have an in-game micro-transaction store, the bulk of their content is straight flipped FO4 assets, FO4 asset reskins and CAMP items. It's like they don't want money.
---
I just... their marketing decisions makes my head hurt.
---
I remember last year i went into charlie silo and didnt realise it was 15 mins till code reset , we waited on the codes for about 40mins , I was in the discord and noticed nukacrypt was struggling with charlie as there was way too many variations, me and my 2x freinds had 25 key cards between us and we figured it out and let nuka know haha it was never credited as an external source cracking it for them but we did it lmao (we was also pretty excited that we figured it out )
---
LOL i just read that you werent using the syringer lol
---
&gt;  fireworks fast reload bug 
---
What is it?
---
This should have been the default thing. Sometimes notifications text glitches and I dont even see what I just sold lol
---
I am on XB, and I would.
---
Hey dude I bought an instigating25 minigun yesterday. Do you need the armor piece for that too?
---
That reminds me.. I am down to only 37 left, I need to nuke some SBQ's..
---
Lmao...I feel like an ass for that.
---
Are they in your storage?
---
Storage??
---
Like my stash or the camp items when I go into the transfer menu?
---
I knew Bethesda couldn't resist my free atoms.
---
When you‚Äôre in build mode, two tabs from the far left I believe maybe three is called stored. Those are all the things you had placed at your previous location ready to be replaced. No resources used except the ones to place them originally
---
I dream about being chased by glowing wendigos.
---
Your camp. It has a stored section. If you moved camp everything you previously had built will be in there
---
Go to bed little boy
---
Ah you misunderstood me... I‚Äôm fully confident in my ability to kill the lvl100 mobs, that‚Äôs no issue. It‚Äôs the fact that everything will become a bullet sponge which means using way too much ammo. (You can kill pretty much anything as long as you have ammo to spend... Usually spending a lot of ammo on one thing leaves a sour taste in ones mouth though.)
---
Besides with me using lone wanderer that would not work out at all. I‚Äôm alone 90% of the time playing this game.
---
But Im not tired
---
Check the tabs in the left while building. You likely have some blueprints with your stuff.
---
On the building budget in the upper right you see numbers for stuff build and stuff stored. Both counts towards building budget
---
I dont think there is a rooftop in Clarksburg that is inaccessible, except maybe the top of the tallest building where couple of robots hangout. You can place a power armor frame and try to get it the frame ? or jump on the frame. a Screenshot would be helpful
---
Man just got tired of the nukes, give him a break
---
Theres a setting somewhere to turn off player names or something to that effect.
---
If that were the case I would stop using player camps for fast travel purely out of spite. Just who do they think they are anyway? Getting my caps that I worked hard for just because their house is slightly closer than whitesprings
---
Ahh aight, thanks :)
---
You are not first:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDJInT\_S54A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDJInT_S54A)
---
Let me check,
---
I hadn't noticed it when I was looking through the tabs
---
Maybe if it reduced tge cost to 80% of traveling cost, give them 10% of the cost
---
So I‚Äôm guessing you have a marsupial already correct? The mutation. The building isn‚Äôt ringing a bell suggest would be a jet pack if there‚Äôs no other buildings/structures/water tower/telephone pole or anything to hop from roof to roof. You can stand on pretty much anything I‚Äôve come to find out. At the Fasnacht parade, I always hopped up on the paper lantern looking things that were strung over/across the road by the end of the route
---
Wait, is this the same at Line in the Sand when it glitches and spawns all the Scorched?
---
I've been using it there to be polite and tag everything without 1-shotting, so everyone can get their loot, but the last few times I played people were emoting thumbs-down at me.  I thought they didn't like where I was standing (on top the Sonic Generator), but maybe it was the weapon?
---
I kept emoting "?^(?)?" but nobody was on mic saying anything so I had no clue what they were on about.
---
What exactly causes the issue?
---
If you need the raw flux, nuke the red forrest place near the prime fissure, the forest and the little crevases around the bog have alot of those green mushrooms, when nukes they give Fluorescent flux
---
Furthest left should be recent and then stored and then allies I believe
---
I was wondering wth was going on, I am killing everything one shoot even big bosses are 1or 2 shoot. Lol
---
Or read them from games memory.
---
I'm wondering if it's a wall section but glass like a greenhouse
---
Easy. Left hand busy with a pip-boy. There's no place for second power fist or mole miner gauntlet.
---
ELI5 the "guidestone mistery".
---
There‚Äôs also way too much recoil and AP cost on the 10mm SMG... That and a lack of sights and suppressor, this whole weapon needs a rework.
---
You're right my whole place is still in storage and I didn't even know,
---
I appreciate the help I've been leveling up getting lost in the world since I started
---
Well if we don‚Äôt have to pay to fast travel there then why should you make the caps? Lol. Exactly who is paying for us to fast travel in order for you to receive payment? Fast traveling to a teammate camp was free the last I checked. I‚Äôm down, but we should split it. LOL
---
Bloodied does doouble my damage, thats pretty impressive.  Thanks for sharing
---
Kinda cool seeing PC mods as a console player, that  segmented lifebar would be super handy.
---
There's an 8 player limit
---
.DOUBLE.THE.ATOMS.
---
Go ahead and give us your system and username so we can report you while you're at it. 
---
Duping those machines kills servers, so you're basically telling everyone here that you enjoy being a griefer and shitting on others.
---
Anytime man, be safe out there
---
Im putting the greenhouse dome on the top of my greenhouse and I regret nothing.
---
No mannequins and the jukebox plays the same old shit. Disappointing.
---
This can't be right, I was told it was impossible for a working adult human to accomplish such an awe inspiring feat, that if you wanted to finish it you needed to divorce your spouse and give away your kids to pirates.
---
I blame Bethesda for creating the problem. When The Legendary Run first came out, it was pretty easy to see there was not enough Score points to complete the season without also grinding the bonus Score points pretty hard. I was also doing some of the Nuclear Winter challenges (which I did not enjoy because I was only playing for Score). I felt like I had to grind or I wouldn't make it. Adding to the problem was the auto completion bug. So, I did complete The Legendary Run about 2 weeks ago, and was quite drained afterwards. I will play next season, but I won't be grinding.
---
Going price rule of thumb is 1 cap per 1% so full ones sell at 100 caps without effort.
---
 Just have the firework mine equiped and all guns reload faster.
---
You have to unequip and reequip when switching guns.
---
Word.
---
Also, people who lock their workbenches are sociopaths. You can‚Äôt change my mind.
---
I keep getting corrupted files messages  now im downloading game a second time
---
I will always upvote this topic no matter how many times it gets posted üëç
---
Yes and you should put a coin slot on your stash for pay-per-use while we're at it.
---
Madness! I've not come across that tomfoolery yet
---
One time during Fasnacht my camp wasn‚Äôt able to be placed down, probably the first time in 1000 hours I‚Äôve seen that since I live behind the Helvetia post office, decided to stay since Fasnacht was starting. 
---
Got into another server where my camp could be placed down and all the stuff was gone from my displays and racks. Definitely a mini heart attack moment cause this was my first time in months of being in a public server after hearing about people stealing shite from your stash...
---
My only guess is it happened because my camp couldn‚Äôt be placed.
---
Ahh cool, good to know, thanks!
---
When a crafting recipe requires *pure* flux, it actually wants *stable* flux. Which is crafted from raw flux, glowing mass, hardened mass and high-radiation fluids, all of which is gathered in nuke zones. Stable flux can also be bought from player vendors, usually for somewhere around 50-200 caps, depending on your platform. Random stable flux also drops from Scorched Earth and A Colossal Problem.
---
The whole point of paying caps for fast travel is remove caps from the economy
---
Some level 35 and 40 weapons still have great value. Theres not much of a drop in base damage.
---
??? Stack ?
---
I‚Äôve had a lot of difficulty finding the exit as well. There are big flashing lights on it but I still struggle to find it with the ceiling caving in and wendigos still flocking around.
---
Alternatively you can just stay in there and loot all the screws. You won‚Äôt lose them when the ceiling collapses.
---
I‚Äôve found it best to stay around the center of the map. There‚Äôs some equipment and railing on a platform. You can run Earl around it if you need to. It‚Äôs good for juking him and breaking one of sight. I‚Äôll either jump in and smack him a few times and jump around a corner or just move circles around it while nailing him in the head with my 50 cal. A lot of times I‚Äôll break focus from him to clear out the smaller wendigos. I try to keep an eye on my teammates to make sure they‚Äôre not getting swarmed. It‚Äôs definitely a balancing act but give it a few more times and you‚Äôll be flying through it. The last time I beat it was with 3 people and one was level 88. We had a couple deaths but also picked each other up a couple times. I think as far as boss battles go it‚Äôs really a teamwork oriented event.
---
The best way to find combat helmets in my opinion is to do Riding Shotgun, it spawns 4 caravan guard corpses in specific regions in the Big Bend tunnel, each of them will have either a Combat armor helmet, a metal helmet or a black cowboy hat. Scrap enough of the helmets and you can learn their plan as well.
---
Yeah I was the same way when I switched over. Look up a Bloodied build, currently the highest dps in the game. Was a real game changer when I found out.
---
I wish.
---
Would be nice if they just left everything up so all players can get items.
---
They would make more money to support the game that way.
---
Well ive been farming a lot of colossal problem and scorchbeast queen back to back
---
It‚Äôs updated manually
---
You can do that? Lmao that's hilarious 
---
Brb gonna make the most passive aggressive camp ever
---
I‚Äôd love to have something I can regally display a single item on. I‚Äôm making a museum and want to display certain things and the displays we have now aren‚Äôt really the museum quality I‚Äôm looking for.
---
Why would it suggest it drops that day?
---
 It‚Äôs so annoying pisses me OFF !
---
Why do you say that? Because the alien blaster skin?
---
You can expect anything from Bethesda, lol
---
Super sayian Wastelanders. Honestly the signs my favorite part.
---
I'm still on the fence. I can see pros and cons. 
---
I'm level 94, speced as a melee/commando. My main weapons are an explosive Handmade and a SS Grognak. (Still learning prefixes)
---
The axe 2 shots everything short of bosses and what it can't get, the handmade does. 
---
As such, the game has become rather boring for the most part. To borrow a phrase from an old MMO I played... It's all grey to me (I get nothing from it).
---
Head to the Bog, put the Behemoth down with 15 rounds. Mop up the mutants with a few swings of the ax and we're done. 
---
Push through the Burrows, never needing to rest or stop bullrushing with my axe, as everything falls to a single swing... Yawn. 
---
Zero challenge, zero risk = zero enjoyment (for me)
---
So part of me *is* looking forward to having actual challenging enemies again. 
---
But then the other part is a farmer, the other part has routes and routines he doesn't want destroyed. I like being able to take a death tambo to Morgantown railyard and just collect a bunch of weapons mindlessly.
---
I like being able to stroll through the prison courtyard like I own the place, stay away from my lead muties! Without a care in the world. 
---
No longer being able to do that worries me. No longer having the luxury of 'phoning it in' or no longer having the feeling of progression when you go back to a spot (Whitesprings) a little stronger and wipe the place clean. 
---
Now you'll be facing the same challenge everywhere, every time you go there. Whitesprings will feel the same at level 100 that it did at level 10. Morgantown will now require my best weapons and won't be a mindless stroll anymore. I'll have to start using ammo... to farm ammo.
---
I'm on the fence and I won't be going anywhere until I experience it for myself.
---
Free states tent? Haven‚Äôt seen that one yet.
---
Okay I think I need to specify:
---
You can‚Äôt lock workbenches per se. I meant people who lock them behind doors...
---
What platform do you play on?
---
[I assume this](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g9onb1/new_mystery_in_appalachia_can_we_solve_it_together/)
---
Sex box
---
To lock them in you need Starched Genes, which you can get at level 30. It‚Äôs only guaranteed at max/2nd rank.
---
Good is subjective since it depends on your build but unless you‚Äôre a junkie then Healing Factor is the only one I can really recommend regardless of build
---
The fancy shotgun would work wouldn‚Äôt it?
---
Psh, I've never found a locked door that power armor couldn't find a way through
---
Damn how long have you been gone??
---
Cap pool was combined so instead of each vendor having 200 caps each, they share a 1400 pool. The vendor factions still exist but now you have the ability to sell more expensive things like serums to vendors as they have more caps
---
I do not have either - I did have marsupial and locked it with the luck perk but some vendor had a radiation spray and I went through it, losing the mutation.  You can stand on power lines? There is a power line right next to the hardware store. Do I need the jet pack to walk on wire? The web says roof. I have fortune finder and it says its somewhere on that building. I have looked inside and it isn't there so I think its on the low roof end.
---
Marsupial
---
Hes politely saying the waste broke your mind, it's the only reason he can think of that would have you wearing a scout uniform in a post nuclear wasteland.
---
Choice and consequence. We need more, not less
---
As has been mentioned,  you'll need level 2 starched genes to keep that expensive serum you get your grubby little hands on!
---
It happened to me twice, I'd get the amazing jumpy mutation, quaff a few rad always then wonder where my mutation had gone!
---
Do remember rad x suppresses your mutations regardless of perk cards.
---
If you need a serum, alot of camps around white springs sell them quite cheaply now. 
---
Have fun
---
The small NW boxes are perfect to put on the vanilla vending machines.
---
I've had them placed there for so long that the last time I moved the CAMP I actually forgot they weren't part of the vending machine itself lol
---
It also only spawns there, and wasn't part of the event reward pool
---
O...kay....
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve balanced on power lines, I believe it was a powerline. I think it was going to a power pole... I wanna say it was right next to the Whitesprings train station. The physics in this game is somewhat questionable you know. Been able to stand on quite a few things that I didn‚Äôt think I would be able to...but if you don‚Äôt have marsupial, I don‚Äôt see you getting on the roof of a one story building, honestly. Unless there‚Äôs some thing that has fallen onto the house that you could walk up or something. Are you on Xbox? I‚Äôll hook you up with a marsupial serum if you are
---
Mini psa: theres alot more stashboxes other than the big genaric blue ones. I have toolboxes next to all my stations, a cooler on my chem bench, stash boxes next to my vendors, FOOTLOCKERS at the base of every damn bed! And some people still have the balls to ask me where my stashbox is. Its insulting to make my camp look so nice and then some brain dead monkeys still need that big ugly blue horror of a box to access their stash.
---
I mean yeah, breaking into locked camps is one of my favorite pastimes. But the principle of locking essentials behind doors is antisocial af
---
Hello and welcome to the game! 
---
Mutations really differ from build to build and down to your playstyle. Marsupial and Speed Demon are the two I have across every character really. 
---
Herbivore is great for food buffs, especially for levelling (Egg Head is also good for this). Carnivore and Talons I always use for melee builds. Scaly Skin is good for heavy, Eagle Eyes and bird bones for comando/sniper.
---
To lock them in you need Starched Genes, to negate some of the downsides you'd need the perk Class Freak. I'd recommend Playing around with them and see what works for you :)
---
Yes Xbox - its not that important - I will just go back when I get the jet pack. Thank you!!!
---
What level are you now?
---
So. starched genes 2 so you never lose them and if you're running with lots of them (there's 19 but you can only have 18) you really want Class Freak 3 in luck also. This cuts down the negative effects of mutations. A lot.
---
Some mutations are VERY good for one build and terrible for another. 
---
Some work in a group even if you are the only person. Herd mentality and Empath. Herd is a must have. +3 to all stats? yes please. There is no reason not to be in a team these days. Even solo. Empath also works solo. You take more damage but your teammate takes less damage. If you are solo you're your own teammate.
---
You should have either herbivore or carnivore. This will involve looking into what food buffs you want. I am a herbivore as i can just grow plants to nom on in my camp. CORN SOUP 5EVA!1!!
---
No problem. GL man
---
YES
---
If she appeared in a quest I'd appreciate the option to convince her to stop talking so much I need my god damn praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.
---
Already gotten into a few altercations but surely  getting the hang of things
---
Would be great if you could link those bunkers together and build yourself a little outpost, but I highly doubt it‚Äôll be possible.
---
Damn I missed out on that one time offer.
---
damn when?
---
Thanks for asking, I have only found one scrabble UGL the whole time I‚Äôve been playing.
---
Yeah honestly I'm not worried about these seasons at all anymore. I played pretty casually and even missed a bunch of days and I hit 100 just the other day. Its very possible. I think people get burnt out because they try to hardcore grind the board as fast as they can and that's really not how it's supposed to play out.
---
I do like some of the ideas to improve it though like ways to help out people who can only play on weekends or adding atom challenges to replace the normal ones I've you hit max rank to add further incentive.
---
Do you want a cookie or something?
---
There are instructions and guidance on the walls in Whitesprings bunker IIRC. I‚Äôm pretty sure I figured out the process in-game as it was before I visited this sub or any of the wikis. It‚Äôs hard to then actually remember, though!
---
and fyi the legendary perk card, ammo factory, also stacks on top of ammosmith so you'll make even more at the cost of the same materials ;)
---
Yep. This is the only way they‚Äôll pay attention.
---
Did you get paid to do it? You didn't have to do it. 
---
You could just play how you want and at the end of the day just get whatever rewards you earn playing how you want.
---
I can kill him solo in 2 minutes with no magic weapons too. It‚Äôs not really fast
---
Ok but tell me the point of locking them
---
Yeah, kind of a wasted slot right now, unless you want to go unarmed for a bit.
---
Through a bit of trading, I now have 8 of each of these masks.
---
They look great on display.
---
Yeah, just like when you take a bus to the shopping mall, it's not the bus company but the mall that gets your fare...
---
&gt;Starched Genes
---
where do you get  Starched Genes ?
---
also whats speed Demon do ?
---
thanks :)
---
The Alpha code from Nukacrypt didn't work either when I tried it earlier. I think they have it fixed now.
---
Then just go away I loved it and can‚Äôt wait for the next season THANK YOU BETHESDA üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
---
Level 98
---
Hella fun to use.45 round drum fires fast as hell..recoil is a tad high but hella fun to spray.would keep this on me at all times if it had a suppressor
---
It's a perk you can start picking up at level 30, I believe.
---
Speed demon increases your movement speed, but decreases... something, I can't remember off the top of my head.
---
Same happened to me. Struggled all the way through and suddenly I'm kicked out.
---
Very confusing, there's nothing that mentions this can happen.
---
Yea man, im looking forward to that! The contextual ammo system is nice too. 
---
Legendary perks and tank killer for handguns in patch 22 has me super excited.
---
Yep, it basically sits behind the wall paper.
---
... or the camp owner can do as they please. It's not on them that you don't know what you have or don't have in your stash.
---
I feel you bro. I was hyped because at least I thought you unlocked a new PA but no, only a skin. Yuppy
---
Just did it. You are a hero, thank you
---
Yes you see these posts on reddit and still use it in game kudos to you
---
I was just hoping for a cool story about why the race was even happening or why we had to win. I wasn't even expecting something as cool as new power armor haha
---
And a bright light mod for all power armor helms.
---
I have both bloodied n vampire tesla. Really, they do wonders
---
Well if you need mutations i can hook you up. I have them for 250 each in my vendor. 
---
I'll even give you a herd mentality and either carnivore or herbivore if you want.
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/lIQZKqy
---
I never even paid attention to it this whole time. Well, the only times I did was when it notified me that I had something to claim. I'm about 1/4 of the way through the last section and I wasn't even trying.
---
I imagine if I put some effort into the run, I probably would have completed it a week or two ago at this rate.
---
Not sure what people were complaining about, but I'm not a completionist and don't really care if I unlock every single spec of something for the game. 
---
I suppose the completionists get stressed when they know there's a time limit, which I guess is fair enough... But that's kind of why I am not one of those people, because that turns a game into a chore and sucks the fun out of it.
---
It's not that deep
---
Tons
---
Increases hunger and thirst
---
Does 666 hours of grind get me lvl 100 or how big chore this is. I hate daily grind and hope that someday we can see that you can complete season by just playing weekends and not every day.
---
: chicken are now deathclaws
---
Claim all of them for yourself. I‚Äôve come very close in a public but this one annoying person would keep taking the ammo factory.
---
&gt;	They would make more money to support the game that way.
---
They have people working dedicated to making the shop as profitable as possible. If they would make more money that way, we would never see limited time items.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox can I have your stuff?
---
As they should be! Means my chicken coops is now a Deathclaw coop
---
Could you elaborate on how herd mentality and empath work without a team? Do I need to have a public team with nobody else on it?
---
Ever finished a board game in real life? There‚Äôs no explanation. No fireworks. No secret message playing afterwards. At least the legendary run end gives you a few camp items and a new power armor skin. That‚Äôs more than you get from finishing monopoly
---
'Since beta' is my favourite saying in this sub.
---
ü§úü§õ
---
....or you can take a commemorative stein
---
You should be a real gem and give your stuff away. It would also make it a lot harder to come back if you got the urge. I'm trying to help you with your addiction here (also on xbox XD)
---
Sorry not on xbox, and don't have the game installed anymore :(
---
Cringe.
---
Eight pieces. 
---
Since they're the same for everyone, some people on Nukacrypt and a couple other sites go find all the pieces and decrypt them for us. 
---
All you're doing is using an alphabet cypher (A=X type of thing), unscrambling the letters to form a word, then reversing the cypher. 
---
Basically, you take the keyword in the Enclave bunker and rearrange the alphabet so those letters are first. Every other letter remains in order. So if the word was BED, the alphabet would be BEDACFGHIJK... 
---
That's the alphabet cypher. The order is the alphabet so now B=A, E=B, D=C and so on. Decrypt the eight letters you got and you'll have a single scrambled word. Unscramble it. 
---
Reverse the decryption. 
---
You'll have your original letters but they will be in the right order for the silos. 
---
Now, when you go to the silo, you will input the number that's on the code piece for each letter. So if you're unscrambled version was X6 G4 D8 A0 H5 I1 E9 W8 you will type in 64805198. 
---
[Here's a more in depth post if you want to learn. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ygyy9)
---
yeah. A little cut scene or clip that kind of summed up the season would have been a cool feature.
---
I know 3 people who have been banned, 2 from dupping on alt accounts(alt accounts are free on ps4) and 1 for ultracite glitch during Christmas event... Didn't know the latter was that bad, though I guess killing scorched for 15 plus hours for 2 weeks gets you noticed.
---
As for myself I'm just a casual running around in my food build with anti amour guns...
---
You only seem to get banned if you dupe like mad or get to many resources quickly or if you touch the free atomic shop glitches XD
---
I'm on ps4, now I feel bad I can't give away stuff to the people on xbox who asked :(
---
well thats a reach
---
i finished the run in first 17 days... 2 months of nothing to do
---
You‚Äôre welcome üëçüèª.  One thing that should be mentioned about a colossal problem; I haven‚Äôt tried it personally with my commando character but I seem to recall hearing that you can‚Äôt reliably maintain stealth in it.  Hopefully someone can either confirm or or deny that.

I have both play styles and my experience is kind of the opposite of what I read here. My bloodied PA heavy gunner dies way more than my bloodied commando. I do not even use stealth on my bloodied commando, I charge into battle like a fool. (Can't help myself, I start out crouched but after a few seconds I usually forget about stealth and charge in... smh) I even play -20% on my commando while my bloodied PA heavy gunner is more around 30-40% HP.  
---
The only thing I can think of that makes bloodied PA better than bloodied commando is when you use explosive weapons. It is easier to blow yourself up with an explosive laser and armor then with an explosive gatling plasma/laser and PA.
---
An other clear advantage of commando is that you actually use your unyielding armor and get tons more of xp.
---
Well you did....so yes.
---
Is it rare? I just got one.
---
Savage divide is my home. In the peaceful mountain, middle of the map, far from the nukes and with players visiting and complimenting my camp. It's a peaceful life
---
Also, 33% vats hit chance also makes it ‚Äúmagical‚Äù
---
Lol!
---
Probably some kind of connection from fo universe to the matrix!
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
yes there is a unique item for the raiders questline. spoiler:  the steel mill T51b helmet, which looks cool but is rather useless
---
Nope, the armor effect only affects shotguns. When it comes to machine guns its only about the fire rate Not about the legendary effects.
---
How much you wanna do? Or do you have offers
---
Thanks to mutations i have all specials at 10
---
Honestly I completed it a week ago and I didn't really grind it beyond playing for a couple of extra hours during double xp/score weekends. No paying for ranks either. It feels nice to have finished, but it's definitely not as much of a slog as some people have made it out to be.
---
Congrats on completing it.
---
You push it through a bunch of cyphers using the silo key cards and the word that is generated in the white spring bunker
---
Really satisfying to do but you have to get 8 silo keys and wait to the latter half of the week to have any idea of what the word is going to be
---
No they don‚Äôt work out of a team. But there is zero reason to not be in a public team so it‚Äôs a nice boost for doing nothing. Just make a team if there‚Äôs not one available and do whatever u want still.
---
Always 1st person.
---
I have a furious 10mm smg, I would love it
---
A big god ray visible from anywhere on the map that comes down and strikes your character would have been cool, like leveling up in Dragon Age: Origins. Though it's maybe a lot of work for something that only happens once every few months per character.
---
Welp, more XP and legendaries for me then.
---
Just yesterday solo'ed Line in the Sand with someone's tent in "correct" position, got crap tonn of XP, bullets to sell, steel and wood, pleasant valley claim tickets
---
lol
---
Works as long as you're on a team. Even if you're by yourself or with people. If you have strange in numbers perk on or it is shared you get even better results as well. if you have 1 charisma you should always have that on and share it but if you join a team and someone already has it then swap it for something else.. or don't.
---
Would be interesting if they had a live radio station within the game to broadcast tips and play requests from people playing, not all day but for like 6 hours or every other day.
---
Here's a photo I took.
---
[Fallout 1st tents](https://i.imgur.com/bIf2cyA.jpg)
---
At some point I thought of being sociopath myself but I changed my mind when I saw these guys.
---
What ones did you use ?
---
It is just a boardgame what type of story you were waiting
---
The reason a lot Dont is there was a bug awhile back that people could access stuff in your stash via your vendor and one of the theory‚Äôs. Dunno if it was proved, was that as the camp loads in if u had a stash next to a vendor the coding got a little confuzzeled and would put your leather coat into your vendor for the game price of 67 caps.
---
My fixer is staring at you in disbelief and jealousy.
---
Agreed. Both are much needed.
---
I Support this
---
My place is always open. Decon unit on switch away from door. Stash box (which has STASH  on it) next to venders. Proper kitchen. Next level work benches and a toolbox stash, backdoor to roof top garden. 3rd floor bedroom, bathroom and lounge. I have gotten bored so I am doing the vendor room in themes. This weeks theme Hubris comics.
---
Wait, so heard mentality gives you the buffs just for being on a team? The description says you get the buff when your teammates are close and you get the negative when they are not close. That description is why I never used it. I join teams for the bonus, but I always wander alone.
---
Ps4?
---
Why did they have to add them at rank 99. Imo they should just be added to the game as a vendor or bullion plan.
---
I've just found the joy of the herbivore/carnivore mutations.  They not only double the food it gives you, it also doubles the effect the food gives you. For instance, grilled ragstag now gives you +40 carry weight instead of 20.  As a melee build I get awesome benefits from the melee boosts.  Glowing meat, mutant hound, etc now all give +20% melee dmg.  Have fun.
---
The rank 100 rewards weren't enough for you?
---
that's an awful hot take on the issue. fact is that they're manipulating their playerbase with timegates and mobile tactics.
---
whether you *want* to be played for a fool is subjective I guess, but addressing the issue is the least we should do.
---
It's literally a wall made out of glass
---
What platform you on? I am on PC and may have some plans.
---
My experience on PS4 is that, the lag only happens if someone use tsla to kill enemy. Tsla tagging enemy seems not causing any lags.....
---
Nice :)
---
Any type of acknowledgement for completing this over hyped grind they touted as a new big addition. The "its just a board game" analogy is silly.
---
It'll probably be a reward from the new bos stuff.
---
Marsupial, speed demon, healing factor, herd mentality and egghead. Add strange in numbers and a shielded lining secret service underarmor to the mix and you get one hell of a special
---
I've had guys installing flooring in my house the past 2 days. As such I've had to periodically check on them every 10-15 minutes. 
---
Since I wasn't going to be able to actually play I decided I'd server hop at Charleston just to finally get the Hunters coat I'd been wanting for 30+ levels...
---
So I turned the sound down and cranked up Pandora and started hopping. 
---
The very 1st hop was the bot! Sadly all he had was a Spacesuit and a Red and Green Ski outfit. 
---
Hop Hop Hop
---
I'm getting rich from the mutant spawn, as I collect 4 caps off the 5 of them and each usually has a frag grenade and they spawn frequently. Whenever I hop to a no spawn server I stroll over and kill Grafton for 20 caps. 
---
I'm already sick of seeing that lone Responder Eyebot!
---
Why does this damn 'Find the Church' mission have to always auto assign? I dug that trash up at level 15 and I'm 94 now!
---
Hey! Vendor Bot time! Well hell, A miner suit and another ski outfit.
---
I hate you chicken dude. I hope the chicken catches you! I start hearing the chicken screaming "Get back here, ur my dinner!"
---
How long have I been at it? 2 hours?! I start zoning out, trying to figure out how the pattern works. Is the bot weighted to only spawn every 3rd try etc. 
---
An hour and half later I've evolved to trying different 'patterns' to get the bot to spawn more reliably. Maybe if I don't touch the tracks, what If I run only on the right side. No results. 
---
The pied piper leading the rats was no longer cute... and I was starving by now and out of food. Not wanting to spend caps to get back to Charleston... I ate raw rat meat to get full. 
---
Arggg! Yet another camp in the spawn point! 
---
At least survival tents don't seem to affect it.
---
Hop Hop Hop.
---
Vendor bot time!! Woohoo this has to be it! My spirit as I scrolled and saw Clean Spacesuit and Helmet, crashed harder than the station that used to contain them.
---
The guys tell me they're done for the day. I'd hopped for a total of 6 hours and 20 minutes with no luck. 
---
The next day I repeat the process. Around hour 3 I started dozing off. Waking up to find myself standing idle on the bridge or plastered into the side of the station. Somehow I kept hopping, kept running to the bridge and back to the station. 
---
Somehow I kept hoping as I hopped. 
---
Then, half awake and through hazy eyes I see the brahmin! I'd gone a good 20 hops without seeing him and wouldn't ya know it... he had no long coat for me.
---
I gave up at that point. I probably wouldn't even wear it anyways as I have a thing about outfits that make my backpack look like it's glued to my back and I don't think the long coat has straps like my mountain scout outfit does...
---
But 10+ hours of non stop hopping with zero results is rather sad. So kudos to you for performing this service!
---
Nice. I've not tried on my pistol char yet ... debating on using her in blooded guerilla mode or full health gunslinger.
---
Decisions decisions!
---
Yeah, but not ultra rare like the vtu cap or leathercoats
---
If you looking for someone to buy the ballistic bock I‚Äôd take it
---
I got rewards for every single step. Giving me a couple extra for this month long grind fest that was touted as a big new addition is silly. I don't even want most of them.
---
i keep a nuka cola stash box between my 2 vendors just for cases like this, like you i cant remember shit half the time so i end up looking back and forward while im restocking
---
Maybe they are concerned about the stash vending glitch.  Has it been fixed yet?  I personally enjoy the Easter egg hunt of trying to find all of the vending machines in a camp.  It forces you to slow down and enjoy the players camp.  I even enjoy the trap camps.  Just remember to save your junk before going into a trap.  Lol.
---
The bullion reward is slightly better. The aid items are kind of pointless but also few. Caps, atoms, and scrip are around the same. The cosmetics and camp items are mostly comparable though I'm probably ever so slightly more interested in the stuff they are giving out this time around. I definitely want the Greenhouse and BOS Field Station. 
---
The lack of any the new turrets from datamines makes me think they must be gained via Daily Ops, BOS quests, &amp;/or probably new bullion items. Hopefully the PA stands will just be a free items/additions like vendors &amp; displays.
---
I really appreciate it however sadly I am on xbox
---
Would actually love that in the inventory as well.... That would avoid me to sell Scribe uniform or Deep mining gasmask.... :(
---
I have a junkies 10mm also and I concur that the aim is just horrid to the point that I just spray and pray with it most of the time... I'd settle for glow sights
---
Pray to Todd
---
Yeah. If you're alone in a team or your teammate is all the way at the opposite end of the map you get that sweet sweet boost
---
Do you plan on using VATS often? Are you going with or without power armor?
---
If you're going to use VATS often without power armor I'd suggest picking up Lone Wanderer and get your Charisma up to 4.
---
It is just a season pass it is your problem you saw it as a new big addition
---
Yeah man!
---
I'm actually going to put a few in strength since I've dropped blocker for now (as well as perception) im also running a bit more int and maybe will scale that back. Follow through, take one for the team and two attributes will be my first picks. My pistolier is closing in on 300 but doesn't have nearly as many perk cards as my main spare to level.
---
I do have like 20k .38 still and two bloodied pipes so maybe I'll spend that and see instead of my 10mm ultracite :)
---
Might as well be how scary and difficult they are to kill in this game üòÜ I want to run in terror when I see one not just one shot it with a crap weapon.
---
NO NO NO!
---
If you can pick it up for $15 or even $20 go for it, any more and they are laughing at you!
---
Haha, no fireworks for Season 2.
---
Think about it they cost 5 caps each and are larger so take longer to produce, that's my take on it, but all the ammo machines make them slow even the ammo factory, the raider machine takes about 2 hours to make 150ish not 10 hours for 200.
---
There a glitch where If the stash is near the vendor if you spawn in quick enough people have access to your stash, few people are still having this issue it has not been fixed yet fully.
---
Gold is heavy, you would hurt your back to carry so much bullion.  Smiley is just looking out for your health.
---
I've been done for about a week and as someone else on here once said, they should rename them to C.H.O.R.E. challenges.   The daily time gates are too much for anyone with a full time job and interests that go beyond playing Fallout.  If season 2 is just the same, I'm out. If they made them all weeklies and just gave more of them,  I would be all over that. I tend to play a lot on the weekends but very little during the week.
---
theres a gnome and a stroller inside a road near slocum joes down towards the wayward in the road with a baby gnome tucked inside.
---
i feel like im one of the few to know about this one as its so obscure
---
Good lawd, how much does a whole season cost?????
---
Yeah just said this before noticed you had too I've heard this too. Plus people are still saying it's happening now and then.
---
the cheapest it is on steam is  ¬£34.99 :c
---
making a build around speech checks is probably the biggest waste of points in the game. one because they're limited to the main quest, which you should be done with in no time. two because they're mostly there just to give you the illusion of choice, in reality it's usually just an alternate line for 'yes'. and three because you can always just use unyielding gear to raise your charisma.
---
riflemen aren't particularly good. they can dispatch mostly anything in a single shot, and may see more use after the nerf hits. but they're useless against bosses. and commandos/reflex sights are better for vats (and crits), so there's also that. I don't see why you'd use a shotgun with that build, either.
---
as for gear, the usual. bloodied or junkie's, focus on sneak, so chameleon or unyielding.
---
I have no idea how I got it. I really dont remember. Sorry
---
Holy crap! I did not know that. The description is very misleading
---
I enjoyed the season
---
Absolute undisputed fact is not a hot take. 
---
Nobody is forcing anyone though. i finished ages ago and i think i've used like 2 of the rewards or something.
---
I'm not using any of the skins. Never used the kits as i have loads from the SBQ and have FO1st. The scrip and currency rewards are nice but could live without them. I have the chicken coop in my camp but i don't use it. It's just there as i had budget. I am using the wallpaper but if wouldn't be the end of the world if i couldn't. I'd use the comic wallpaper.
---
That's internet logic right there.
---
Then don't buy it on Steam grab it from another website and activate on Steam.
---
Its not worth paying double just for the Steam refund option.
---
I saw it for what they promoted it as. Yeah, my problem for once again thinking bethesda might actually give a crap about the players.
---
Thanks anyway
---
There's some blocks in the big teapot that spell late, I might have seen it mentioned before so not 100% sure it's one people don't know about
---
Got a bloodied ffr, couldn‚Äôt agree more. It‚Äôs one of my best backups and super fun. Also everyone‚Äôs always selling hella 10mm so she stays fed.
---
You can try it for 1 dollar if you try Xbox gamepass for pc for 1 month 
---
Plus every other game on gamepass rn
---
You going swimming a lot?
---
Happy Hunting.
---
I've put them in my vendor sometimes. Unfortunately, it doesn't list as a BOS Combat Helmet just as a Combat Helmet.
---
Where can one find this gold seller?
---
you're right in saying that nobody is forcing us to do it. Bethesda doesn't have an employee with a gun to my head.
---
but my point isn't that they're forcing us. it's that they're manipulating us. which is indeed an undisputed fact.
---
cosmetics are the lifeline of this game. maybe it doesn't apply to you, but there's a reason why the captain cosmos stuff was a level 90+ reward instead of 10. and also why the subjugator outfit is a level 99 reward next season.
---
Cool my dude thxüëç
---
bethesda! AMIRITE!
---
Missed opportunity for a LMG skin since there is an Ace theme.  There's no new skins for gear like last time.  Could also do an airplane hangar CAMP shed or prefab.  Or even a crashed airplane body as a CAMP item.
---
Sights for the pump shotty too would also be nice
---
i noticed that as well... i got a lot of misses, but sometimes i hit and it writes 900 something damage on the screen but in reality it only does about 20-40 damage, which is quite annoying since i then don't get the instigating effect for the next shot
---
There's a gnome murdering a bear in the chest room in monogah mine.
---
Also a gnome riding a plastic flamingo that I remember seeing somewhere.
---
Personally I think commando vats sneak is better and more practical.  I have an assault rifle with reduced vats cost that will generate a crit about every 15-20 rounds, and it is just absurd. I can stay in vats for an obscenely long time with it.  It makes picking off groups of enemies easy and is amazing at dealing with the baby wendigos when fighting Earle. Just some food for thought.
---
adrenal reaction
---
I could possibly be wrong but I think almost every build type tends to use speed demon.
---
Luck has the most crit benefits like Better Criticals, Critical savvy and so on. Critical bonuses stack so you can have 50 vats + eagle eyes + better criticals to get 100+ critical damage. It would be more suited for a weapon with high base damage like a hunting rifle , lever action or gauss rifle.  Concentrated fire in perception is a must to aim for head shots .
---
Gun- fu is another perk to look out for, it's in agility which can help change targets in vats quickly 
---
If you can get upto 33 luck , you can get crit shots in 1 shot given you have critical savvy equiped. If not, just use the 15 crit fill legendary effect which is just as good.

---
I have to agree, wait for a sale if you can. This game is very fun with a lot of content, but if I paid that much I'd be let down because of the lack of .. support? They do update the game but there are many urgent bugfixes that take weeks/months to get fixed.. and there are so many missed opportunities. It does fill the fallout void though, the quests are good and builds can actually matter, as well as weapons. And the game is great with friends. But overall it feels like a game that's 75% complete, so I wouldn't pay full price for it.
---
If you have a brahmin in your camp and your vendor prices are unrealistic, your brahmin gets shot.

And what cut scene would you like "sorry we fucked everything up text with headless npcs running around to benny hill music"?
---
Well last night a few of us had ran encrypted, ACP, then queen with an ACP bonus. Had lots to do. 
---
Thanks to PKOA great group to be a part of, check us out on reddit.
---
Along with marsupial
---
 speed demon, healing factor, carnivore/herbivore, adrenal reaction, and  herd mentality are my best sellers
---
The website of Fallout 76 (currently under the weekly atomic shop update site) also gives us the timeframes:  
---
Red Rocket Player Icon: Sep 1st - Sep 8th  
---
Steel Dawn Fatigues: Sep 2nd - Sep 7th  
---
Vault Tec Armor CB (1st ONLY): Sep 1st - Sep 6th
---
And please place a workbench next to that
---
I would focus on the main story and side quests mission wise.
---
Pick up all guns near workbenches you scrap them for mods
---
And lastly google FO76 perk card builder, there you will find all the perk cards and you can make a build that you will think will suit your play style and it will LV map it out for you, personally I think it‚Äôs a great idea to look at the cards and think about what you want your build to be, and the builder is an amazing tool!
---
I'm level 125 and I've still never done Uranium fever, Radiation Rumble or Project Paradise. Is it even worth it at this point? I have joined in to beat Earle once but it was just sort of meh and I quickly realized that as a casual player with a character at level 125, I'm have some really crappy weapons.
---
Mine is hidden. First time i put it on it was there, I reloged and it was hidden. Ever since then it only shows up when i get out of power armor.
---
Pretty much always, whatever is broken if i have the mats i fix it, and usually leave a plans care package too.
---
I have one if u r in ps4 I can place for you.
---
And a semi automatic receiver please. I want that pcc!
---
Do you think that the contemporary camp bundle will be discounted or should I buy now?
---
Upstairs in the Wayward bar in Flatwoods
---
WELCOME! Got a copy and paste reply. 
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
When you level up you can put a point in a special stat and pick an available card BUT you don't have to pick a card in that special. So you can put a point in STR but then when it comes to picking a card you can cycle through and pick one from INT or LCK or any of them. When you hit 50 you can move a point or pick a specific card every level up so don't panic if you mess up your build.
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. Workshops are pvp zones though. Someone can come and beat you up and steal your lunch money.
---
Everytime you see a workbench get in the habit of scrapping all junk to lighten your load. And then when you see a stashbox (found in camps, train stations, red rockets) stahs your junk. SCRAP THEN STASH!
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.

Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup. 
---
And here is a list of how to obtain certain outifts and their rarity. 
---
and remember to **HAVE FUN!**
---
Think about what build you want first and foremost. Do you want a full health or bloodied build? A bloodied build does more damage but you have to limit your health to 20% to achieve this and you die a lot. 
---
Do you want to be a melle, pistol, shotgun, heavy, commando? Once you know then you can start to plan your build early. 
---
Search angry turtle on YouTube he has some awesome videos for all players.
---
focus on perks that reduce weight 
---
traveling pharmacy + thru-hiker first, bandolier after
---
Fixer is still my main!lol
---
I wanna know how these LEGENDS find the codes so fast
---
TYVM actually, been running out of things to do. much appreciated
---
Is there any reason you *needed* people to know that you're quitting a video game? 
---
Usually, you just stop playing the game and move on.   Making a post about it is odd, its like your begging for attention and maybe confirmation that you're justified in quitting.
---
Buy it now. It's been back multiple times but never discounted.

It all depends on the damage scaling and the range of the explosion. Card can be god tier or it can be completely useless.

If you knew how long it took them to make Earl...
---
Just hand your duped shit off to mules as soon as you did it, before getting checkpointed.
---
I just finished it too and it gave the ‚Äúbad‚Äù replies too. An earlier thread about it suggested its caused by being in a public team.
---
Definitely good for QOL!
---
Thanks. Is this the only gold seller in the game?
---
Not really worth bothering with until you have both ranks of starched genes tbh.
---
LMAO
---
This is an awesome tip.
---
I waited for a steam sale and got the game for ¬£15.99 and boy have I had my money‚Äôs worth! Even at ¬£49.99 I have played over 350 hours already and I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs worth the money but I am stingy so I did wait until it was on sale.
---
I haven‚Äôt regretted the purchase though, during furlough/covid it has really kept me entertained each day. 
---
You can quest, scavenge, explore, join public teams and do events, kill bosses, grind for bullion for good gear etc. I have finished the quest line and now I‚Äôve really got into trading and working my way up to good weapons and collecting outfits etc. 
---
I think there‚Äôs a bit of something for everyone and I‚Äôve really enjoyed my time playing and intend to keep playing. I do spend a lot of money in the atomic shop as I always want my camp to look the best and I guess it can be pricey but oh well!
---
You know sometimes I noticed it‚Äôs not there and sometimes it was...Never really tried to figure out why. But now that I know, whenever I get out of power armor I‚Äôm hopping servers. LOL. That will make it disappear again correct? Get out of PA and it shows up... hop servers and it‚Äôll disappear again?
---
I know! Everytime theres a new icon I have to requip thomas the thermo nucular tank engine
---
As a higher level player with everything I need already, the legendary run was the only reason I was playing. I'm at Max gold and don't want anything else offered. I have 150 rolls on hand for new SS armor untouched because the yield is so poor I stuck with BOS combat for 3/5 of my armor. Have plenty of caps, and don't need them for anything.
---
So why log in to play if I get no atoms, lunchboxes, cosmetics, etc for rewards? If anything I have the opposite perspective you do. If I'm given too long between seasons I might realize I've been brainwashed and leave the game altogether instead of just keeping the grind going.
---
You forgot to read the part where I was thanking the community for making it fun for so long. Kind of the reason for posting it
---
scaly skin, adrenal reaction, speed demon, healing factor, and bird bones seem to go pretty well for me
---
I do it solo, if you do it in a team the amount of robots is honestly ridiculous. Solo the end launch is like a picnic vs team
---
Man, didnt expect to get convinced to not do this build lol. Now I feel kind of bad for trying to do it. 
---
All of the popular build I see all the time and everywhere feel kind of lame to me, so I dont want to use them. No problem if folks feel differently though! Just not my cup of tea to use big guns and power armor, or melee weapons, or the like.
---
That SPECIAL point does make sense though. I should probably focus more on making my stats postively affect the thing Ill be doing 99% of the time (running, fighting, gathering) and not the stuff I do 1% of the time (talking).
---
Also, Im a relatively casual player. I use a shotgun sometimes because it is fun to use a shotgun.
---
This. Enclave plasma guns would be amazing as legendary weapons, the normal one is really fun to play with. As for the ultracite laser rifle, it should be like the one in  Nuclear Winter.
---
I am on PC and using Teslas in ANY team event is a big nono
---
Yes, but they dont stack together like the weapon weight reduced pieces
---
Yep! I use VATS a lot. I do have Lone Wanderer, too. I think you may have misread my (poorly written, admittedly) special stat breakdown, I have 10 Charisma as of now.
---
That fish tank lamp looks awesome, definitely would buy it.
---
Thats also kind of weird, like you're just throwing in a thanks to random strangers while also shit talking the game. If you wanted to post a rage quit rant, then just do that instead of this nonsense. 
---
None of us care if you, or anyone quits the game.
---
Utube angry turtle magic weapons.
---
Yeah taking up camp budget because you cant delete it
---
 " barely functional game " pleas elaborate?
---
Whitespring is great for flourescent too.  Slap on green thumb and pick flowers around the gazebo and around the clubhouse.  Last time I farmed there picked around 120 raw flux.  Plus there are tons of ghouls for farming the masses and fluids.  Kinda screwed if you can't get those too.
---
Ok man, didn't need to be rude about it, why would I post a rage quit rant if I've had fun with a game and it's community? Its just meant to be a thank you for people who made the game fun for a long time
---
I don‚Äôt care about better quality or quantity of rewards. 
---
I just want them to be themed right
---
Coz a space run filled with guillie suits all over the place made no sense at all
---
Hey slidey! I‚Äôll see you online later :)
---
Lol...
---
MrsP123 :)
---
Makes a lot of sense! I know there are wayyyyy more effective builds out there, but I told myself when I started that Ill go with my gut and not what the meta says... I kind of use my Homemade as an assault rifle, considering it fires as quick as you pull the triggger basically and Im on PC so I can click pretty fast. I do have some commando perks already because I used that at the beginning... Ill give it another shot and see how it works.
---
My gun luck is pretty poor, unfortuantely, though. I still use a level 40 Handmade because I havent found a better one lol. I did find a bloodied shotgun, though!
---
Also, appreciate the advice! There are definitely some sneak/crit perks that I dont have yet that Ill definitely go for.
---
The Fixer IS the skin. It‚Äôs a skin for the combat rifle.
---
I love it too. Hopping public servers just to check out camps is a lot of fun.
---
Like all the quests between right now and beta that didn't work (thankfully do now), all the visual bugs, constant broken ai and textures, I'll admit playing it on console definitly didn't help, the game looks much more stable on PC
---
Definitely quicker and easier solo.
---
Usually if I‚Äôm doing a ‚Äúteam‚Äù approach it‚Äôs me running one silo and a friend running another. Both finish prep, launch one go do earl/queen. Other person goes back and launches the second.  Makes wait time a little less when you start killing things.
---
don't, experimenting with builds is the most fun I have with this game. no matter how whack or non-viable they might be. one of my favorites is a vats heavy gunner.
---
having said that, it should be noted that making a build around charisma/speech checks is a terrible idea.
---
and the same logic you used in regards to your special applies to your weapon choice as well. if you're not soloing bosses on the regular, then there's nothing wrong with a rifleman build.
---
There‚Äôs something to be said for not having to fight enemies when you return home üòú
---
Reading these, it never occurred to me that there are pretty potent VATS/Critical builds out there. Completely slipped my mind, apparently. Illl 100% try to get 33 Luck, getting a crit every hit sounds so satisfying. Ill look into gun-fu, too.
---
Thanks for sharing! I was about to look up Luck perks that fit my now-altered build, and the ones you have are likely the ones that Im going to gun for.
---
It‚Äôs a post apocalyptic wasteland! Everyone should be nice!!
---
Does this frame drop happen to the person using it too? I‚Äôve used teslas for weeks when it was the best gun I‚Äôve had, never had noticeable frame drops with it. I‚Äôve even used it at colossal problem events.
---
There are def troll groups with tesla going to events.  Ran into a couple the other week.
---
I love how things that were in fallout 4 ( which made a copy and paste job of fallout 76) are being sold to us in the atom shop and simple things have been left broken. 
---
I always wonder if they even play the game online with us to see what's wrong and what to improve. I am guessing they don't and if they do are they not allowed to just pick a problem and focus on solving ? Daddy Todd telling them to churn out another useless skin ?
---
Doesn‚Äôt work on heavy guns.  Not sure if its intended or bug.
---
You need to make a pit to keep the vendor in...
---
‚ÄúIt rubs the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose again‚Äù
---
Hahaha that‚Äôs awesome. This is pretty much me, I am always looking for a good body of water and a high cliff for a stunning view!
---
The myriad offerings in a video game that is just a laid back affair to be enjoyed at your own pace.
---
I can shoot, loot, craft, trade, build, collect, hoard. explore, roleplay, troll, grind, play fashion fallout etc.
---
Warts and all, it's a bloody terrific game that has made me a Fallout junkie again.
---
All i need now is for someone to throw money at Bethesda to next gen it and ensure we have a forever game.  ( Someone call Phil Spencer)
---
They all share rhe 1400 total instead of the 200 per faction on the early stages of the game.
---
I might give that a try, thank you!
---
I think having vault 76 as a free fast travel has been what kept me out of the forest. I figured I‚Äôd make another free fast travel spot somewhere else. Even when sitting on 24,000 caps I‚Äôm still a cheap-o
---
Yeh but tbh I don't like randos in my camp either lol, I just make it a cozy hangout joint for me and my friends so I get it
---
Its faster solo.  Less robot spawns.
---
not to be that guy......but i kinda like being alone at Uranium Fever.... just saying
---
Always solo. Takes just under 10 minutes solo and 12-15 teamed due to the extra spawns.
---
I spent a long time just north of the Top of the World. Right next to where the mother daughter are dead with the green/black dresses on. Amazing views, very peaceful
---
Wait, what?! There is a 30k caps limit? So I have to invest in more gold as long as I am not at the limit there and I have enough I'd like to purchase. And I have about 100 treasury notes I can't trade because I regularly have 20 fresh from daylies. :(
---
I was thinking about buying serums the other day, but wanted to make sure I am not short on caps after buying one...
---
Workshops are great, just a heads up tho...if you claim a workshop and are within its boundaries, you can be attacked by other players who can contest you‚Äôve owned workshop
---
Alot of the listed sell well but i find that when i put a batch of adrenal reaction in(at 350c) my machines somone will frequently buy the whole lot.
---
Then that 4 Charisma all you'll really need. Agility and luck are good to pile on too. I also use a stealth suit which helps too.
---
My current build https://imgur.com/gallery/vwENnxc
---
You better not put anything interactable by your windows then, or I WILL dump raw fertilizer and toilet paper on your bed üí©
---
Damn. If that's true, they made a big gamble that many of us will come back in 3 weeks!
---
I agree, I most likely won‚Äôt buy the entire pass but probably up until the tree at 50 just because a lot of the rewards just aren‚Äôt that interesting
---
It‚Äôs too bad more people don‚Äôt travel to the mire, I‚Äôve seen some really cool camps over there!
---
We are getting &gt;!next season as well. Yay!!&lt;
---
suckers...one born every minute
---
Sweet free junk
---
Look up melee damage consumables.   That‚Äôs going to give you a lot of your damage.
---
Do this especially as Outerworlds &amp; wasteland 3(only  for some i think) are on it too, so ALL your fallout bases are covered
---
I'm hoping to see the return of the tesla armor (3 and New Vegas style because the one in 4 was a let down) and the wattz laser rifle from the classic fallouts appear
---
Has the new season started already?
---
Eggzackly
---
Yes, just to be on the safe side, I'd claim everything on the board before the run ends.
---
Careful, you might get a Mr Fuzzy Bear Arm skin.
---
I‚Äôve noticed that area around Sutton, Summerville, Flatwoods, and Morgantown being really popular lately. One load screen can get me to 4 or 5 camps some times
---
Ok , that's a fair enough reason, I wasn't aware of that, I hope this still isn't the case!!
---
Maybe a ‚ÄúYou have been insulted!‚Äù too. Just to get the point across.
---
Yea it's a rediculously good deal, I usually hate Netflix style subscriptions but it's hard to argue against all the games you get so cheap lol
---
nowhere near soon enough
---
...Jesus Christ. Never noticed that or thought about it.
---
That explains it in some cases, I wasn't aware of this.
---
Oooooo, I wouldn‚Äôt mind either of those. I used the Wattz Laser Rifle in a mod for Fallout 4, I love its aesthetic. And Tesla Armor would be nice, imagine we could get a mod to attach it to Secret Service Armor like the jetpack?
---
I think you were more susceptible to it if you had used glitches to go over your camp budgets it was supposed to be fixed but never be to careful.
---
This has been my strategy just about all game. But now I‚Äôm getting to the point where there is less and less to buy with caps so I don‚Äôt mind spending them to fast travel
---
Titanic reference in the New Gad. One skeleton on a door reaching out to and arm
---
Yep its a bummer
---
PC / Sony
---
Apples / Cabbage
---
Well now you're making me feel bad for my 1400+ hours played... but then again I see the game as mostly functional with a side of broken fast travel.  So long, farewell, Auf wiedersehen, goodbye.
---
The one with the hanging cage?  
---
It's ok. Not something I'd pay money to help progress to getting and I had close to 3000 Atoms when it started. I did get a few levels and with the double score and all I got 100 roughly 1 1/2 weeks ago.
---
Make sure that you‚Äôre covering the five flux bases first. By that I mean, your first five serum recipes should each be craftable from a different kind of flux. 
---
Also, when buying the recipe, get your Charisma as high as possible (up to 25) so you can get the price down to 17,500 caps.
---
Dude - you‚Äôre at the Atlas Observatory, we all know that...
---
Just kidding. I totally hear you on the peaceful camp location. The last thing I want to do after getting shafted with crap team in Colossal Problem and not beating it, is return home to fight a Yao Gai tearing through my stuff
---
I‚Äôm very new to the game only just hit lvl 25 but when setting up my camp one of the first things I did was put stash workbenches and venders near each other
---
it just seemed like the right thing to do
---
I didn‚Äôt know till after I visited other people‚Äôs camps that most of the people around my own level that I visited put venders and stash behind multiple locked doors
---
And they wondered why they wasn‚Äôt getting many sales (besides the fact that prices was very high for basic items)
---
Agreed, prolly not super insidious or anything. It's came up a lot though over the years since release and it should be a trivial fix. It hasn't been fixed, that's a choice that's been made more than a couple of times by the dev team.
---
I too work for a massive conglomerate of a software company. I see decisions made like this one both very intentionally and very unintentionally. We tend to fix the unintentional ones.
---
No.
---
Now that, is impressive! I agree with you about the fast travel and most problems I saw on console seemed to be getting ironed out pretty good, I hope the game continues to be fun and functional for you man! :)
---
I‚Äôve played since beta and only launched two nukes lol. But first one was way back during launch and was with a team. The end was so shitty and I remembered that part. So when I launched my second nuke like two months ago I figured it would take forever at the end. It was one of the easiest things to do honestly. I will always do solo when I decide to actually launch them
---
My understanding, based on a post a while ago. The assets are in game, they just arnt enabled or something.
---
I‚Äôm going to make my way over there one of these days! I have a Halloween camp I‚Äôve been thinking of and the Mire is a great location
---
Go with off meta picks of empath &amp; herd mentality.
---
Once the casuals realise how strong both are in public teams &amp; that it makes almost no sense to not be in a team (even solo), it should pick up.
---
I see ya! Accepted lol
---
I agree, it's not the worst or anything. I think now that we have better ways to alert folks to atom store changes that it should go away though.
---
switch it off for a day or 2. you do not have to actually live in it
---
Not in my case, as i said. Two people of my fixed team are using it, no issues.
---
What are your specs?
---
I didn't think it would be possible for me to finish this season, but after they added a couple more quests to each day and with a few of the bonus days/weekends I actually managed to finish a little early and I'm a casual player.
---
Just finish all the daily and weekly missions (though I only did a few of the NW ones) which really doesn't take too long each day, and you can get to the end.
---
Now - we just have to hope they stick to the formula they finished this season with...the right number of daily/weekly missions to let players finish without feeling too much like a painful grind.
---
Take my money!
---
(And then form a tux with it)
---
They'd just get accused of trying to profit off his death, even if it was free.
---
No, not even remotely. Unless it's on special, I'd never recommend anyone paying that much. The game is too buggy &amp; lacking in end game content to be worth that.
---
Our team can beat him in about 5 mins but we've all got legit legacies - explosive lasers &amp; plasmas. We let people get their dibs in first before blowing him up.
---
#STABLETUX
---
Savage divide is where I keep getting drawn to. Something about being near the middle of the map I like, not sure why. Currently I‚Äôm in walking distance to National Radio Array and WesTek Research which is kind of nice
---
Remember ‚ÄúLoss‚Äù? There are bottles arranged like that in a picnic table between the pumpkin house and the fissure site. It doesn‚Äôt always span completely.
---
Not trying to start anything, but cap stashes aren‚Äôt that big of a deal as they respawn fresh daily (sometimes). Not to mention that‚Äôs a lot of hassle for what may only be 10 to 20 caps. There‚Äôs 10 cap stashes on the outside of the building at Poseidon Energy.
---
To encourage you to level up from perma-noob.
---
Then I've just been very lucky. I've played since launch, was able to finish every quest. Found 3 missing textures (I kept count by taking screenshots). Only had a couple of crashes (2-3) in the beginning, but recently it got quite bad had prob 4 since the last patch. My biggest problem is server disconnects, that has been a lot better since wastladers or the update just before that not to sure. I use to get the long neck visual glitch every now and then, then it stopped for a long time, this weekend I saw it again and the one where you look like a wendigo after exiting PA. How did you manage to stick around for 450h? I've quite fully functional games after a couple of hours, because they were boring.
---
In this case, the actor/character doesn't have anything to do with this particular game so it might feel a little off.  But I think games like Marvel Avengers &amp; Fortnite (which has a Marvel season) would be places where companies could do something connected to his legacy.
---
Sniper Rifle from Fallout 1.
---
Bring it. Chunky-as sexy bitch. 
---
I'd stick my Fixer in my own ass for a classic Fallout sniper weapon.
---
specs are irrelevant, it happens on all platforms and there are many complaints

but yeah, who cares as long as it works for YOU, right?
---
Heading down into vault 96 is a carriage with some prisoners in the back. Reminded me of Skyrim - since I the Bethesda, I‚Äôm sure that was the point
---
How would you gain xp?
---
Anyone who locks their camp up, is a psychopath.
---
Yeah, if I had been willing to play day after day trying to finish the season I probably could‚Äôve but I had gone back to work, had other games to play like Ghost of Tsushima and etc, and on top of that the reputation grind for the raiders and settlers just killed it for me
---
For real, lot of those classic weapons had such good designs, also, sounds like you could use a Bozar.
---
i didn't have any trouble.  i tried to replace it with where i had my other armor workbench but the new one has a slightly bigger footprint so i had to move stuff around a bit.  otherwise, no issue...
---
Oh man I can't remember the name of the quest but the one where you go to all the grafton attractions and fix them up I remember the pricket fort token machine was broken for Soo long that's the biggest quest issue I've ever had, I hear you about the disconnects though sometimes they would happen crazy frequently but even though someone in this thread has 1400 hours which I don't even know what you would do at that point I only played it for a long time because fallout with friends sounded so fun and it was, even with no friends the whole time I met so many cool people just walking around checking out camps
---
I do not have any perks equipped and my magic shot guns are brutal.  The primary effects are instigating, junkie's medics and stalkers.  the secondary are bash and limb damage +33 % vats hit chance. On heavy weapons you need to get the fire rate over 200 but I have seen people also say 180.  If it's explosive then the fire rate is effectively doubled.  There is also magic armor.  Any piece that adds 15 % to blocking or something like that will make any shotgun magic.  the magic effect only happens in vats.
---
Or said vendors get detonated with bait spontaneously.
---
play literally any other fallout game and you can play almost non violent except 4 i think
---
As much as I struggle for 45 ammo I can‚Äôt imagine using a 45 receiver on anything else
---
If you haven't done them, sure.  They are fun, the rewards just aren't much unless you are on a good team.
---
There is a skeleton taking a selfie at the Tyler County Fairgrounds
---
Most players don't even know who he is lol
---
Same. I'm over the lead deposit closest to it and just hop over there every time I log in. Plus you're super close to Huntersville and west Tek.
---
I paid full price and havent regretted my purchase for a moment. Opinions are like assholes...
---
Reticle yea.  Disagree on the suppressor. That gun is great for sprinting in and blasting! 
---
Live my JE15r
---
This would be great i hoard so many weapons and i have a furious &amp; bloodied explosive if they'd fix that recoil and add some mods to it i would enjoy using it so much more for events so i dont one shot legendary creatures and just to shoot at low level stuff with its such a fun gun in my opinion and ammo is everywhere for it
---
Totally agreed. And please do something about those long barrel mods. They way too ugly. No need for those brass parts
---
Go play the New Vegas DLCs. 
---
If 76 is the only Fallout you‚Äôve experienced, you are missing out on amazing experiences.
---
You can't get rewards from legendary enemies without killing them.  Enemies are BAD, it is like war.  You have to kill the bad guys for the greater good.
---
Depends on what you're looking for...if you want everything Fallout under the sun, join the Fallout Reddit discord...other than that, I have no idea. I've always wanted to start a server where we could talk lore and other game stuff without being bombarded by memes or shitposting.
---
Across the river from that between slocums joe and the wayward is a lone gnome trapped under the roots of a tree ;)
---
I agree. This is where my camp is and I've got a few turrets around my water purifiers but that's it. I rarely get attacked. I built my camp around the extractor so that it's in a foundation piece and nothing can get to it.
---
You can get up to 200 bullion daily with up to 20 Treasury Notes attained from certain events (event icons with '!' in the middle). There are two machines for these; one in Foundation (look near the Sunny robots, near the elevator) and another in Crater near Meg against the wall. The vendor, Smiley, that sells bullion (300 per week) in Wayward, Flatwoods is the only additional vendor for this.
---
As mentioned by others, commando is way more powerful and a better choice.
---
As mentioned by others, speech checks should not be a relevant factor in your build. There are few speech checks that REALLY matter and even then you can back out of the conversation and take a special enhancing drug to pass the check. 
---
I do respect your choice to go off the beaten path and go for a less popular build. So here are some pointers:
---
* you want to one shot stuff like a real sniper. The instigating legendary prefix is very good for snipers, especially paired with +33% vats hit chance. Try not to combine it with the exploding legendary effect because the splash damage on nearby enemies will prevent the instigating effect to work (because those enemies will not be at full health anymore).
---
* do your research on sneak armor. The best armor for sneaking is actually unyielding armor since the agility boost is most important for sneak. But then you need to be low health. Next is 'become harder to detect while sneaking' and last is the chameleon legendary prefix. While the legendary chameleon prefix makes you invisible while crouching, it does not really help for PVE, enemies still easily detect you. It is only really usefull in PVP. I do not think people use the Cloaking legendary prefix. Angry turtle on Youtube has some great vids on sneak.
---
* do not compare yourself to others. I had a guerilla (=auto pistols) build at a certain point which was viable and great fun. But when I compared myself with friends, I did, by far, the least amount of damage of the group. Eventually I respecced that character to a different build. It is difficult to not compare yourself to your friends.
---
* play around with your sights. short basic scopes require less AP cost but have less range. Better scopes increase range but cost more AP. Most players will deal more DPS than a rifleman and will kill more enemies in a certain period of time. So you want the extra range to be able to hit enemies that other players can't. That way you'll have less players 'stealing' your kill and your really acting as a sniper.
---
You put a smile on my face this morning with your description of the grind, and it shall not go unnoticed. Hope you're on PC, as I have a Hunter's Long Coat in your size. My ign is the same as it is here. I should be on for a few hours, periodically having to afk a few minutes at my camp to get some real work done.
---
dont push yourself too hard, this game is 1 big ass glitch so use it to your advantage. U can run the silo in 7mins. when u get past the first 2 lasers then skip the 2 doors with photomode glitch and then u ll reach the main room and prepare the 5min long launch preparation
---
That's how it works for me.
---
with crater and foundation becoming free travel points very soon you have plenty of other free travel points
---
if you're on a team you could have over a dozen free fast travel points. You can also fast travel to a public event for free and then fast travel from there.
---
It could be a Blue Ridge Caravan supply line event. The Blue Ridge Caravan needs Appalachia's help setting up a strong supply line along the existing railroad. This would be an opportunity to replace those ammo vendors at each train station with something more useful and Blue Ridge-themed.
---
Hey no need to be rude about that, i'm just sharing my experience. I care if it's something that gives problems to all the players, and i guess they're aware of that. Just trying to understand why i don't have such issue when other does, that's all. Anyway, hope it gets fixed soon.
---
I'd much rather some classic chonky weapons than a lot of the newer, sleeker weapons we get.
---
Thank god bc the 8th is my kids first day of actual in person school after them being home for 6 straight months and I‚Äôll be dammed if the servers are under maintenance that day.
---
why
---
I have a spare plan is your on ps4
---
K. Bye.
---
I love what you did. You might want to try to grab the candy bowl next it comes around.
---
i agree, I like mine so much I've had to start crafting 10mm ammo ^((instead of pickups being more than enough for the pest clearer pistol)^) but the sights are utter arse
---
blackpowder weapons too (well just sights for them)
---
Thats nice
---
Right?? Who would have thought !!!
---
He's got nothing to do with fallout, why would it need to be added in the first place.
---
Exactly, why?
---
Nothing wrong with having a bit of CHONK in our weapon selections. I agree.
---
Nope, all good.  
---
Be sure it's not something server related (if that happens on all the servers, check your internet connection) and also, does that happens with any graphical settings?
---
You can in 4 but it requires much, much, much patience. Kellogg has to die for the story to progress so you have to finesse that encounter so that something/someone else kills him. There's a video online of a fully passive FO4 playthrough and the Kellogg scene in particular took forever.
---
There was a guy IIRC that had a no-kill run but he basically had to run enemies into other enemies... so not exactly non-violent but pretty close.
---
I missed a few days through it all.  
---
The only thing I really wanted as far as cosmetics was that cool Raider gas mask at 92. At least with the cosmetics any of your char's can make them.  
---
I didn't experience the 'Score Callenge completed' bug when I logged in but the double score helped a lot.  
---
Fallout 76 is an MMO at it's core. There is a LOT of grinding in it. I did manage to get max rep with the Raiders for the ammo maker. I have zero interest in going through it again with another character.  
---
IMO, whomever you side with and complete Wastelanders with you automatically get max rep with and if you give gold in any amount to the other, you'll just have to get the last rep level. If you're somehow past that then you'd get half a bar.  
---
In all, 76 is very grindy.
---
It was three or four weeks ago... It definitely worked I bought a shed load. e.g. video  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHsCL1UWy4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHsCL1UWy4k)

BLM
---
Oh my I LOVE the junk-thrower (dont remember the name)
---
Please bethesda
---
Is it still available? I would love to buy it
---
People want some kind of congratulations or in-game effect and honestly I don't blame them for that. It's like watching the series finale to a tv show that ended with like, zero fanfare. I'm not gonna finish anywhere close to the end of the run but I agree there should've been at least something at the end.
---
Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
---
Would you like some toast? Some nice hot crisp brown buttered toast. No? How about a muffin then? Nothing? You know the last time you had toast. 18 days ago, 11.36, Tuesday 3rd, two rounds. I mean, what's the point in buying a toaster with artificial intelligence if you don't like toast. I mean, this is my job. This is cruel, just cruel.
---
&gt;I paid full price and havent regretted my purchase for a moment.
---
Good for you bud.

I was smart enough to not purchase at launch &amp; got the game at less than half price on Black Friday, 3 weeks later.
---
But that's just me. You do you if it makes you feel better.
---
I'm not really techy at all, but I know that my PC can run any new games at 60 to 120FPS no problem on Ultra settings and my internet connection is stable. In addition, fallout used to work on 60FPS no drops for me, now I play in 20FPS longer than on 60, which makes NW very hard for me.
---
She‚Äôs done it...She has achieved ultra instinct.
---
‚ÄúGoodbye everyone‚Äù
---
Do not nerf the damage, Bethesda. I want this added, Bethesda. Fallout 76 community is the best, Bethesda. Unban me although I duped my ass off, Bethesda
---
I buy a lot of grounded and scaly skin. A lot.
---
That's.....a LOT of fertilizer...
---
If you talk to them they stand up straight and turn towards you.
---
IIRC, you can then use the bench after closing the convo.
---
No it has not been fixed and is still exploitable. I lost one of my scout masks this way, just today.
---
You get it.
---
&gt;  but they're useless against bosses
---
As a rifleman this hurts my soul but is absolutely true. When I go into boss fights, I moonlight as a PA heavy gunner.
---
I've heard from multiple people the fireplace door is available for bullion on the public test server.
---
I use an explosive / bloodied LAR, my build is the following;
---
Perks:
---
Riflemen Perks and Sneak, Tank killer, Nerd Rage, Covert Operative, Better Criticals, Bloody mess, both Class freak and Starched Genes.
---

---
Damage: Adrenal Reaction, Bird Bones, Eagle Eye.
---
Protection: Electrically Charged, Grounded, Scaly Skin, Unstable Isotape.
---
Misc: Carnivore, Marsupial, Speed Demon.
---
Armour: (Kinda bad but works)
---
Get as much Radiation Resistance as possible*
---
2 unyielding,
---
+1 AGI, CHA, END PER
---
Other Legendary effects (not all)
---
Chameleon Auto-Stim And 75% Chance to reduce damage by 15% while standing still

---
If ya need help, just message me. Ill try to respond :)
---
The Mole Miner Gauntlet is virtually silent.  Even quieter than a DCG.  Damage wise, they are good.  I have the same one as you and it is my go-to second only to my power fist.
---
If people don't glitch in the first place, they won't use teslas
---
I had my camp over by Sunnytop lead deposit. Since Colossus my camp was nuked 4 times and I had to move it.
---
I've played every Fallout since the first one released back in 97
---
This
---
My advice is to level up and get better perks and gear so you can finish the quest
---
Dishonor on you, dishonor on your cow.
---
I play solo and don't like hits in STR and END b/c they are the lowest for me. One point in either of these is not good.    
---
My main char has Egg Head, Eagle Eyes, Marsupial, and Herbivore.    
---
From what I've learned any ranged character should have these at a minimum. Plant based food and drinks tend to give more ranged/PER buffs than meat ones. Meat tends to be best for CW and melee characters from what I hear.    
---
I have one piece of armor that works for Chameleon. It's hard to get and prices through player vending are stupid high.    
---
I would probably say Speed Demon as the reload animations for rifles is painfully slow.
---
Id blame the people putting the tents at the spawn point personally.
---
Oh man I have both and forgot to use them! Time to scrap a few things so they‚Äôll fit lol. Thank you!
---
If there‚Äôs no tent at the spawn point, I think there‚Äôll be less people doing the event
---
Yes and there will be much less people doing the event
---
Can't help then, you need to know your specs if you game on pc man. Without them i cannot start to help you out.  
---
A thing i would do is to check temperatures, because that sounds like thermal throttling, and also to reinstall the gpu drivers after you clean unistalled them.
---
So long and thanks for all the fish!
---
The plan for crafting is pretty rare on its own, however I think it may have been included in the heavily duped Christmas present pool of plans. Once you get the plan you'll likely need to farm some uncommon components like crystal (lucky hole) and circuits (robco) to start crafting and scrapping. If all you want is just the gun modded then put up a wanted post and you'll find folks to mod it easy. Sometimes you can even find the mod boxes for the exact mods you want at the vendors like phoenix or the enclave military wing.
---
ALL THE BASKETS!
---
There's an office in either Sugar Grove or one of the other similar stations in which is gathered like the entire building's worth of trash cans. There are stacks of them in there. There's a skeleton at the desk and near his hand a note exclaiming that he has ALL THE BASKETS! Very proud of himself. It made me laugh and has been a part of my photo roll/load screen rotation since I found it.
---
This might be lengthy but stick with it.    
---
If you get a chance to buy and play Fallout 3, NV, or 4 then it's best to play those a bit more. Fallout is, IMO, only meant to be played solo and offline. 76 is relatively new regarding the series and co-op. It hasn't found its niche yet.    
---
The game will teach you most things you need to know. Pay attention to your menu screens as options are at the bottom. You can sort items by weight, value, and Spoiled for Food/Drink.    
---
There's so much to post so why not PM me and add more specific questions?
---
Just bloodied builds dying before they can get a stimpak off because they don't want to take the time to counterbuild for a raid. Blocker 3 and pneumatic chest mod for wendigos. Fireproof 3 for hazards. Lifebringer 3 and ~40% hp to not get one shot (I end up around ~135 max hp and still get +2 all stats from unyielding armor set). Born survivor 1 to heal through choppy frame rate or unlucky gangbangs. There's a lot you can do as bloodied and even if it means sacrificing ~45% damage (as melee) you're still ouputting more damage than other builds cause... bloodied. People just want to run their cookie cutter builds and not think about it. Or stand still over falling debris praying others kill the adds.
---
I know what you're saying, but you're blaming people using Tesla's for the drop in frame rate. People can use whatever gun they want. If all the enemies weren't pooled in one place dropping out the sky the frame wouldn't drop.
---
Teams, run the silos in parallel but only one member per silo. Then launch in this order:
---
- nuke the mine for Earle
---
- nuke the queen for both Earle and SBQ
---
If on private world kill SBQ and then Earle (assuming SBQ is downed in &lt; 3 mins). If on public tag the SBQ and then go to Earle, then loot SBQ (or kill) after Earle is done.
---
definitely on PC as well, even though it seems like a good idea to tag all the miniwendigos with it, it really breaks the fps for a few minutes after you shoot it
---
If you're gonna be like that there's no need to respond at all
---
Yeah. EXACTLY!  i mean he was only in the highest grossing film of all time..and the 5th.. and 12th.. and 22nd. Who watched them? Like 4 people amirite? Who has been on the internet in the last week and saw the news? nobody amirite? 
---
gonk
---
Oh sells bullion for caps?
---
What do you list it at, if you don't mind?  I've had healing factor in my vendor for weeks and have not sold one.  I list them at 500, which seems to be the going rate but maybe I'm way off?
---
They're right though.
---
Again, it ends when zorbo's little spaceship gets to the end of the board.  His ship advances one space per day and the whole concept of the season is to beat him to the end.
---
Yes I agree with you as people can choose whatever weapons they want to use but if they use other weapons apart from Tesla would be much appreciated
---
When they patch that event I'll never waste time playing it.
---
That glitch is probably 95% the reason anyone plays it.
---
It was just a grind to add to the already grind of don't daily for gold.
---
I rolled 20 ss left legs last week. I was hoping to get a bloodied berserker or vanguard.
---
I got several medics and hunters that seemed to be identical, but nothing i wanted. 
---
It's a waste of time at this point.
---
Now i have a bunch of random weapon weight reduction pieces out together.  I carry a ton of weapons just to experiment with.
---
Lol not everyone is from NA or China. About 80% or the world don't have a clue what Marvel Universe is
---
Yes, whilst the machines only take Treasury Notes, Smiley will take caps. I believe it's 1000 caps for each 50 bullion, up to a maximum of 300 bullion for 6000 caps every week.
---
Don't price a stalker's rolling pin for 5k and you won't have a problem haha.
---
There are blocks that spell "we know" beside a handprint like the dark brotherhood in the elder scrolls series, If i remember right the hand has an extra finger (probably thanks to mutations)
---
Absolutely
---
I've FT to the event and notice someone has their tent placed improperly and I just leave... Fuck that
---
Wait.
---
So weapon weight reduction perks stack? Do they stack with Big Guns weight reduction card?
---
Ammo weight reduction perks don‚Äôt stack? And one will stack with ammo weight reduction cards, but isn‚Äôt worth the small weight gained?
---
Just making sure I understand this.
---
Doesn't matter if they're right. I have to do it solo and I already tried twice and it crashed both times, making me reset. The fact is, the cockiness is un-needed and comes from nowhere. It's not hard just to awnser a question or not be a jag
---
he could craft stuff, and cook, while using a leader bobblehead, cranberry relish, being well rested and having the wise mothman buff to gain mad exp.
---
My fusion generator is now protected by 2 shotgun turrets in its own hut, with a concrete floor.. Because of this üôÑ
---
The peek hole is a sight. I actually like it better lol
---
Quests, hacking and lock picking. Getting to level 50 is easy from quests alone.
---
Have you ever been to the crashed alien ship in the divide? I have my camp near it.  It's located to the east and slightly north of pleasant valley train station it's near a trailer icon on the map.  I never knew it was there, just stumbled upon it when I was looking for a new location for my camp
---
I sell them for 200 a piece.  Supply and demand seems to work well.  Lol
---
This guy seemed to be having a bit of fun himself...
---
 https://imgur.com/Ja3aBRO
---
Quests are finite, and lvl 50 is really just the start of the game. With legendary perks requiring huge level ups OP would not have a very fun experience
---
I can understand that, I would logon do some daily missions ans if no one is on I log off. But if some friends are on I'll play the whole night. Visiting camps is also one of my favourite activities between updates.
---
Woops forgot that was primed. Glad it works for you. If I got a sneak shot off I could get over 1k so I only imagine what it's like with perks. Enjoy.
---
Remember when the almighty dataminers and mathematicians reported that we couldn't even complete the season withput grinding for multiple hours daily. Good times
---
I have about 8k .45 right now.i randomly empty my stash of steel and lead and just craft 5.56 or .45 also buy it out every time I see them in vendors for 1cap.buying 400 .45 out of 5 vendors adds up quick.but I change it up handmade semi auto and a full auto fixer
---
No the traveling leather coat is rarer so it‚Äôs sought after more
---
You're welcome üôÇ
---
There‚Äôs a great documentary of early video games on Netflix called High Score - fascinating how some things influenced their creation.
---
Oh yeah, no doubt. I will drop my price and see how that does. Thanks!
---
Why nerf the most consistent cap sink?
---
General steakhouse
---
There's a lot of stuff that needs its budget decreased.  For example, consider turrets.  They already have a hard limit of 10 turrets.  For some reason they also have an absurd building budget cost.  They don't need that high budget cost, because there's already a cap to prevent spamming them.
---
If things are genuinely that taxing in terms of poly count or texture size they need to optimize them.  If they're not, they need to lower the budget cost.
---
Fun experiences are subjective. I have no interest in the new legendary skills, I wear basic shrouded wood armour, with an instigating deathclaw and no damage buff skills. I have a lot of fun exploring and scavenging.
---
My Vampire 10mm smg with explosive rounds definitely agrees with you.
---
The small tool chests can fit on top and also don't look bad either.
---
What's the point of treasury notes? Why don't events just give bullion? Is it an anti-hacker measure?
---
What were the effects on the armor you were using?
---
Git gud at the game and do it legit
---
If you have starched Genes at rank 2 you will never lose a mutation for any reason, you need to keep it on all the time.
---
For offering proper advice? 
---
If you struggle with this quest you'll struggle with the next. And you'll struggle with other stuff. What's the hurry? Like. Do you have somewhere to be? 
---
I assume you're struggling with the belly of the beast. What level are you?
---
It‚Äôs the exact same one that was used when Bethesda removed a trailer for NV for copyright reasons (one of the song licenses had expired and the they have done that before) and this exact same narrative was spread that they were jealous that everyone loved NV and that that‚Äôs why they removed it.
---
Because non-subscribers automatically ignore the F1st section. Bethesda wants them to see what they‚Äôre missing by not joining. Just a guess.
---
OMG haha this.
---
I'm a bloodied build and even fighting scorched 40 yards away is a spray with a hope a couple of bullets find their target.
---
All the time
---
It'll be adressed in next patch - it's fixed on PTS already.
---
What part of that quest line is hard?
---
i do not think that should be a reason not to use sometimes. if it is effective and not cheating its fair. that you computer can not handle it and i get it their are a lot of adds on that mission but it is mediated with one a fairly small area and not much extras like gras and the like. i would say maybe turn down settings if it is a issue.
---
Oh oh! I have one that tilts me every time!
---
Is X bOs ItEm AlReAdY iN tHe AtOm ShOp??? Look\_\_\_at\_\_\_their\_\_\_website
---
I had it on and it deleted marsupial
---
I've been finished for a month. I know now there is no reason to spend atoms or rush the finish because all you get is a bunch of nothing for dailies after.
---
"Is this game worth playing"
---
I don't give a damn about teslas those meat piles you created cause server lag in general. Really wish they don't do that
---
Wait, you mean to tell me you can build SCORE rewards like the fireplace door to your friend's camp?
---
It‚Äôs more the massive amount of meat piles that stack up then anything. Tested it.
---
I mean ya sure the Tesla can contribute too but we literately made a 180 turn around looking in the opposite way zapping at the SB flying over head and my console calmed down as well as the frame rates came back. 
---
Once we all look back at the next wave before a shot was fired, ‚Äúbam!‚Äù Choppy as f@#k.
---
Search "Tell me about the rabbits George". It's a literary reference and basically means I consider Ward to be of limited mental capacity and intend to shoot him in the back of the head.
---
Nope.  There was a hack that involved having your stash next to your vending machines.   They fixed it, but for how long, given their tendency to reintroduce bugs?   If the stash isn't next to the machine, take a look in the house/camp.  I guarantee it's there somewhere.   You have to be able to recognize stashes when you see them, tho, as mentioned by Shmagmyer.
---
I don't really think it's cockiness. Fort Defiance is a dungeon with a few hallways full of ghouls but the rest are mostly insects. A solid rifle for the bugs and something like Marsupial to help you hop around the ghouls as they charge at you while you shoot down at them and you'll clear that building in no time.
---
Because they want your sweet, sweet dollars buying atoms.
---
You are mistaken. It has 2 ranks, rank 1 is a chance to keep it rank 2 is a guarantee. I've played since beta and have never lost a mutation with the perk on, I have multiple characters over lvl 100 and they are all mutants. It's ok to make mistakes we all do, you probably swapped it out to craft something and forgot
---
The base game is free, more or less, on Xbox Game Pass.  I presume that Microsoft is giving some sort of financial consideration to Bethesda for the privilege of hosting their game but as I already have Game Pass for other reasons (Mechwarrior 5, Pheonix Point, Outer Worlds, FTL, Slay the Spire, etc.) playing FO76 didn't cost me any additional money.
---
Very irritating, or when youve just dropped some stuff for a lower level and they send you a message saying can i have more
---
Almost makes me glad we don't have server chat. PC master race wins big this time. Sounds like a real pain in the ass
---
Uh huh.  Tell the d\*\*\* rabbits to stop opening the door and leaving it open, then.
---
Junk Jet

BRING BACK CAESER LESION

Gnome licking popsicle in the rafter beams of the Creamery, i remember a toppled Nuka Machine with some clown objects in it, teddy bear pierced through the neck by a chinese officer sword in Berkeley Springs, and I now some more but cant remember them thoroughly
---
Which he can probably sell for thousands of caps.  :)
---
I get one daily from the same gamer tag (blocked it multiple times) and they keep changing the profile picture. Sometimes it‚Äôs a dude, sometimes a woman, sometimes a cartoon. But every time they text me they ask if I have spare bloodied explosive weapons I‚Äôm willing to give them for free. I never respond because I‚Äôm 100% sure it‚Äôs a spam bot. Usually about 20 minutes later they say they‚Äôre gonna block me, report me, and call me out on reddit for being a dick.
---
I found a space ship in the divide just east and a little north of pleasant valley train station.  It's near a trailer map icon, I wonder if this is related?
---
ok - thanks. Not saying your wrong. I probably have level 1 right now. Frankly, with the Legendary Run, my time was spent on the challenges.
---
Yeah, maybe they originally thought Stimpacks would be a big sell early on and high on demand, but I'm usually selling piles to bots every day for caps and with Perk cards/looting, I've never run out. I have too much.... So I never need to jump to player vendors to get more. This category just for Stimpacks seems a bit useless.
---
Ah mine‚Äôs actually between huntersville and devils backbone
---
Just as I feared.  Sorry to hear it happened to you.
---
I'm not on the deposits, I'm on the building (well, camp is centered a bit behind it. Constant spawns, never had to really grind rep on that character - it just game to me. 
---
I did have to get creative and I do use all the turret space (I think I have 3 missile, 2 laser, 5 heavy machinegun).
---
Is that the disease where the sores on your body are red, have a dusted rim and usually sprout something resembling celery or beans?
---
"OMFG, 60 sec respawns"
---
This makes me wonder if it has to do with running bloodied... I rarely ever had a problem fast traveling before about a week or two ago, but I just recently started playing bloodied and now constantly have to retry my fast travels. I thought maybe it had to do with all the buffs I had to take to fast travel cause I‚Äôve been so overweight lately, but maybe it‚Äôs cause I‚Äôm newly bloodied! ü§î
---
Because I have the I 25ffr but couldnt work out if it was working. I know you cant miss and its after a few hits but it didnt seem to do much
---
Ps4 but thanks for the offer!
---
Side note: I‚Äôve been running the same mutations for probably a year or more, including healing factor.
---
üëÜüèª this dude knows it.
---
Def the meat piles. And it starts to lag badly 2 patches ago. Before that there was hardly any lag with massive frame rate drops. Esp with the tent placement trick.
---
I honestly had no idea there was a limit to bullion too. I've never had more than 3k at a time before I spend it.
---
I‚Äôve read ‚ÄòOf Mice and Men‚Äô two or three times.  However, out of context your OP is quite obscure.
---
Did you know 42% of all stats are made up? 
---
total box office was 2.8 BILLION dollars
---
Chinese box office was 630 million dolla bills 
---
American box office was 857 million dolla bills
---
that adds up to 1.47 billion. 
---
so nearly half the global box office was from outside of america and china. So roughly 22% of the worlds population is chinese and america. Which means a good chunk of the other 78% do have a clue what the marvel universe is.
---
I'm more annoyed by the players who use bloodied explosive gatling lasers, never stop firing, and one shot the entire stack of scorched before anyone else can even get a shot off.
---
i have seen that many times where they all drop on the siren and you just grenade it. i'm not sure if it a bug though. i have played where they spawn behind the fence by the entrance and they are known spawn points. they can also spawn singular from multiple points.
---
Jokes on them, I don't have any dollars
---
LOL!
---
But yeah, exactly.
---
It's so Bethesda can limit the amount of bullion you receive. By limiting the machines to only give 200 bullion per day from your 20 Treasury Notes, it doesn't matter how many events you do, or how many Treasury Notes you have. You are locked in to their limits, just like all their other caps.
---
Correct. Up to 300 bullion for 6000 caps.
---
- LA - auto sim,powered, sent
---
- Chest- mutant slayer,powered, sent
---
- RA- Cham,Poison, sneak
---
- LL - vang,powered sneak
---
- RL vangaurd powered sneak
---
Still rolling SS trying to get 2 more powered sent peices since the sneak doesnt stack.
---
"Bethesda please spend a lot of development resources on adding [insert stupid feature or cosmetic with no other use than adding a little bit of very specific flair ], instead of fixing bugs or dealing with the problem that there is no real endgame content, leading to annoyances like daily currency caps."
---
P.S.: I am aware that people who make cosmetics are not involved in fixing bugs and stuff. But I disapprove of any other case where it comes at the cost of bugfixing or adding actual content.
---
Wouldn't that also decrease server lag by a little bit? It wouldn't have to gather the "has-been-hit" information from all enemies that... have been hit.
---
Shoot, sold it already.  But thanks for the offer.
---
Agree
---
Like the railway rifle..
---
I got both and tesla definitely messes the game up, havent noticed that on gatplasma at all
---
People do that? Wow
---
HMMMM! It could be a hacked weapon.
---
got something similar twice but both asked politly. one needed like 2 or 3 flux for something and the other was a guy lvl 50ish, working on his PA at my station and ran out of aluminum, asked if i got some for him to buy.  
---
seems like i got lucky so far...
---
what is todays update?
---
I hang out on the Discord server for the Youtuber InnovSurvivalist
---
but, to each their own
---
Yea, lol. I'll have to start farming crimson flux, but I got ammosmith and the super duper (cloning) perk. Really the value is in the experience- it completes the look and gets the job done. That was my problem with Gauss, it was pistol technically, but it didn't look right, didn't shoot like a cowboy gun, and on top of all that, it wasn't killing like ordinary guns did. A gun slinging cowboy like Stephen Kings Dark Tower books is what I was aiming for. So, thanks again, if you need anything I'm usually in my tower, just stop on by!
---
It is a hacked item.
---
assuming you're on PC, it's not genuine.
---
word begins with H but my posts haven't been showing when I type it.
---
Well i cant Tell you exactly but i can remember i also had a instigating ffr and it didnt work for me. I Sold it afterwards. Then after some more rolls i got a ghoulslayers ffr and gave it another try. This time it worked, like you said. You have to Hit the target with like every bullet, missing a few will make the effect Not trigger. However if you do manage to Hit continuously the life Bar Drops every few seconds suddenly very fast, then again normal speed, then again very fast and so on.
---
Maybe the first effect is also authoritative, but since this is all backyard sience and there is no Official Statement for this issue, all We can do is guess, trial and error and hope that one can reproduce what someone Else did
---
Go to the market.....plenty of people you can trust besides no offense its a 2 star ultracite nobody over there is gonna risk getting banned off the sub for that.
---
nope. Sometimes i get someone politely asking if i have 6 screws of 10 wood or something really small.
---
When does the legendary run end?? How much time do I have to complete it??? I just started the legendary run today... can I finish it before the end date???? My dailies autocompleted... how do I report it????? Ounce of Prevention won‚Äôt let me progress... please help!!!! Can I get skin for my The Fixer??????
---
Completing all the daily challenges will net you 2000 points (remember we got 2 extra daily challenges because of the auto completes) a day, 1750 if you exclude the NW challenges.  Weekly will net you 5000 (or is one worth more?  cant remember) a week, so 3 times a week would net you 10250-11000 points a week.  Over the course of the 10 week challenge you would end up with 102500-110000 points, excluding any bonus weeks.    
---
That would put you at level 63-64, with a little over 50% the amount needed to complete.    
---
So, nope.  Not even close.  You'd have to do the weekly repeatable over 1000 times to make up the second half, and there's no chance that you could accomplish that playing like 6 hours a week.    
---
Bottom line if you aren't interested in grinding the repeatable a bunch you need to log in (this is factoring in around 2 incidental weekly repeatable per day) and do dailies about 80 of the 100 days.
---
Defo not about our Chad boi cause Black Panther did like shit even in china
---
I havent tried it per se, but if friends can build atom shop items or items i don't have plans for in my camp, id hope this would be no different ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If the team is erratic you won't get your sneak damage and the spawns can be chaotic.
---
I find it much easier in a small team or solo if you are sneaking.
---
You keep everything you unlock. You can still use junk in your scrap box however your tent will be removed.
---
Sneak builds are specifically not allowed in the Daily Ops feature that is coming. All enemies in most daily ops can see through stealth.
---
*The magic effect on shotguns only triggers in vats,
---
Heavy guns can do the magic without it.
---
The only thing you lose if you don't resub is access to a private world, the survival tent and the ability to put items into the stash box, you can still take items out of it.
---
Yeah it seems to have gotten worse recently as well.
---
No problem! There's another good spot to farm that I learned about on this Reddit subforum, it's the lost home (just east of firebase Hancock) in the cranberry bog.
---
It has a random spawn event that sometimes will have a scavenger trader that can have rare items in her loot list. Be aware sometimes the spawn can be Yao guai, blood eagles, cultists, etc...
---
Good luck!
---
Yea the begging is out of control. 
---
Also being in a public team and doing your own thing  farming and all of a sudden the AI are now level 9 and you have a noob standing behind you waving ?? 
---
I try to fast travel away but they follow me ! 
---
My new method is spawn into Watoga as all the AI is friendly to me... But not to them.
---
does it have a beam splitter at the end? a lot of these misleveled weapons also have attachments that make them terribly op.
---
Yea I got a befr recently i love the 10mm sub but theres no suppressor soo it's kind usless
---
With xbox they have a sense of entitlement coming from roblox and  Oving right onto fortnite save the world. All those 10 year old are lost in this game because they can not scam their way to good weapons and actually have to work for it. They don't understand that you can't cheese bullion or scrip so want handouts. 
---
But they will all be dragged back to school soon, so just another week or so and it should go back to the community we know and love.
---
Ash heap, esp the events. Uranium fever. Kinda curious for the whitespring....will the robots scale? ;)
---
Happy cake day breh !
---
My experience with it was identical: look down and the frame rates are single digits and look up, 60+.
---
Since everyone was blaming the Tesla weapons for the problem I thought about how they might be responsible.  My conclusion was that it must be the ash piles. Other weapons don't produce those (well, not nearly as many at least) so they must be to blame.
---
So, I retextured the ash pile as the orange duffel bag from NW to see if this would fix the problem.  I haven't had a chance to test it but I have spoken to someone else who had the exact same idea and he reports that it doesn't make a bit of difference.
---
I have also seen reports that suggest it is a problem with the Tesla lightning bolt somehow affecting texture rendering.  People are reporting pixellated textures on objects after a Tesla is fired near them enough times.
---
Of course they may be simply seeing visual artifacts caused by their graphics card being overloaded rendering all the ash piles and the reports that the ash pile to duffel bag fix doesn't work are just anecdotal...
---
Hopefully I'll get a chance to test it myself today but if the "fix" doesn't work, it definitely suggests that the problem is that the engine just can't efficiently render so many objects in so small an area...which would in turn mean that the Tesla isn't the problem but rather that horde encounters are.

The final cavern with the boss, a giant cave of high level scorched, and the 1-4 scorchbeasts that spawn on the way
---
Yep, i guess some people cant be grateful
---
Hard to do it legit on my own. Nothing to get good at. Don't be childish
---
Dude, so much this
---
Go play the Sims.
---
oh okay thank you.
---
I was being sarcastic, I‚Äôd kill everyone on sight of it was allowed.
---
I'm not talking Fort Defiance. I said to get into the room, meaning the Belly of the Beast quest
---
"Please spend development time and resources to cater to my extremely niche playstyle"
---
Yeah no thanks.
---
How long are the servers going to be down for maintenance?
---
Is there a fast way to grind reputation for factions?
---
Any topics on legits vs dupers
---
I think there is a bug where if you don't place turrets on something that can be scrapped, then if the turret gets destroyed it permanently takes up camp budget. The youtuber MizTracey talks about it all the time.
---
Everyone does it legit except for you. Git Guuuud
---
Yes please. I run the Vampire version of it as my main gun and I love it so, so much but I‚Äôm always saddened I can‚Äôt do more to it.
---
When micheal gets a new chair pam gets his old chair and i get pam's old chair. Then i'll have 2 chair and only one to go
---
Dude you hit a little close to home with the fixer oneLOL
---
Fully support this.  While we are at it, show the level of the player as well.
---
\+1
---
Red dot sight for the pump-action shotgun too!
---
Prewar money, which can be found in 100+ quantities in supply crates and 10-15 in locked safes, is also a good source.
---
I was literally told to do it that way by higher leveler players. Don't be an asshole
---
You asked how to cheat and rather than indukge that they gave the correct answer. Only one person being a jag in this.
---
I had to google him but I'm not really one of those people who freaks out over superhero movies.
---
Lol I know you were...so was I. As I said a few days ago after having help from others I saw what I was doing wrong. Which inturn changed my mind on my topic and disscusion.
---
I don't know what is a problem, but those numbers on those 2 weapons aren't accurate for me, at least in the game. The damage difference between 3rd Claw MMG and extra clawed DCG is significant in the calculator, while very small in the game:
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/e87yXrB.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/e87yXrB.jpg)
---
The image must have been removed then. I didn't notice.
---
junkies is extremely easy to do. Have a build. Have a junkies weapon. get addicted to 5 things. Simples. Well. You need to make sure the things you get addicted to don't negatively impact your main specials (too much). You can find a list of addictions here [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction)
---
You could post your build here using this site [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) and people could critique it.
---
That's a good build, I ran this as my first build with lever action rifle and then adapted it over to a  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=8f415cb&amp;d=sb2s01sa2pd2pk2pl2pp2cr0ic4a72an2ar2ao0lt2l71lu2a21la2ej1ed1pe2&amp;m=5c2e8&amp;n=Lever-action%20Build](bloodied build) 1 shot pretty much anything but that means running around at 25% health
---
For the Junkies I run at full health most of the time with vanguard armour and use an AR which is much more tank playstyle (my main) and although my damage is lower I rarely die even at SBQ/ACP 
---
It's about your playstyle though and what you want to be comfortable with. Some players even go for a food build which I haven't tried but they are more built around the QoL perks from what I seem... Play around on nukes and dragons to see what you like
---
Huh. I have no problems with tons and tons of meat piles or goo piles. No drop in FPS at all. Through in a tesla and a bunch of ash piles and my fps drops to 5.
---
I agree, I have a Tse I found in a vendor for 7500 and the using it as a hip fire weapon is ok but golly that muzzle rise.
---
What is the glitch you talking about? Is Tesla rifle bugged?
---
Hmmm....maybe they could have added the dead scorchbeast chasing players around when fast traveling.  Oh, and find some way to show off the rubber banding health effect. Like a level 200 using a sniper rifle at 5 feet to kill a lvl5 mole rat and it surviving multiple hits.
---
I just logged in, it‚Äôs still thereüò• no biggie tho. Thx for the info
---
Yes, this one is particularly annoying
---
Which is why I posted what I did. 
---
Not because I needed the reference explained to me.
---
Full health vampire vanguard build could be fun
---
I feel my brains cells dying the more i read.
---
Not really. The point of line in the sand is to tag as many as possible in the shortest time. Whether they spawn in many locations or 1, the tesla is still the best tagger in the game.
---
Oh, forgot about that part
---
Okay, that is absolutely fair. The meatball grinder was the last one I did and I slapped butcher's bounty on and just walked from one fissure site in the Bog to the next.
---
It's either that or "I played through BETA then left for a year should I pick it back up"
---
Brill thanks for the info
---
Why can't I be a sarcastic asshole without people dogging me?
---
Eh. I think its more of a reddit thing
---
No idea why there's so much negativity here. I guess goodbye posts are probabaly where the 1% of toxic players congregate to defend their livelihood. Either way, much appreciated shout out to the community. Goodluck wherever your gaming adventures take you next üòÅ
---
Yeah cause you have to do math this time. China got like 5 times the population but does shittier box office? Doesn't that tell you something?
---
All I can say is before the 2nd last patch there was hardly any issues with line in the sand, esp with the tent trick and regardless of weapons used. Ya sure a bit of lag but nothing unbearable and made your console scream for mercy. After that patch tho... damn I don‚Äôt do that event any more.
---
Well. You offer some people solid advice and they can't take it. 
---
**HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM**
---
I have noticed the same, when its loading a world it just hangs in a black screen. I just x out and shut down the game and reload. It usually works and loads properly. Def not just you.
---
This looks awesome!  My cousin built a haunted house a few weeks ago on Xbox.  For having none of the actual Halloween plans it turned out awesome.  Sadly I didn't take any photos or videos of it.
---
Is that a display or just a skin for the power armor workbench?
---
Not when your target spawns like 200 yards apart
---
‚ÄòNever stop firing‚Äô and ‚Äòone shot entire stack‚Äô sounds confusing lol
---
I did my first nuke launch solo yesterday and the end launch was literally ONE Eyebot.  That's it.
---
If you can manage to get your Hands on a magic shotgun, every build becomes obsolete.
---
I followed the sniper path. Just like you, Till i found a i bashing damage combat shotgun. This Was around level 70. Now i am 148 and have like 60 unspent points cause nothing makes sense. Everything is weaker than These shotguns. I hope they Patch this in the near future, cause as fun as it Sounds to run around the wasteland in godmode as fast it becomes very boring.
---
Like cheating... Or drugs. Haha
---
I will build a commando i decided. I found a quad / 33 combat rifle and with the grim reapers Sprint perk and concentrated fire you can stay in vats like forever.
---
Its way less effect ive and was more bullet intense than spending 1 shotgunshell to do 494994346,4 damage. But it bought me the fun back. At least in Parts.
---
do you practice being this dense or are you a natural?
---
You asked how to cheat and got told to do things properly. That's more a problem with you than the community.
---
But they dont. They spawn in clumps in 4 spawn locations. They only get spread out if you hand out at the wall and wait for them.
---
Cause you literally asked for a glitch. Mods can ban you from from this subreddit for that. Get the idea
---
Also:
---
Nevermind all the BoS stuff that‚Äôs already in the game, and all the BoS stuff that‚Äôs coming and new free recent additions in the atom shop, can we get more BoS stuff for the game??? Where do I spend my gold bullion??? What‚Äôs the most powerful gun in the game???? I can‚Äôt kill anything in one shot therefore my weapons are sh*t but I won‚Äôt get into details about my build or what weapons I‚Äôm using, so what am I doing wrong??? Is this game worth buying???? Should I buy the game???? I‚Äôm brand new to the game and need tips, but I haven‚Äôt been on YouTube. STOP ONE SHOTTING EVERYTHING AT EVENTS YOU HIGH LEVEL ASSH0LES!! YOURE LEVEL 9,000 WHY ARE YOU EVEN DOING EVENTS????
---
Check back next week, friend. He‚Äôll have more for you then.
---
Possibly. Still people are downvoting the comment above when it was totally legit assumption
---
O shush. That was my bolt hole. üòÄ
---
Had this happen yesterday although i just figured they didn't fully nuke the icon for the mine. Next time I will actually go check.
---
Sorry. I want a fixer skin as bad as everyone else but I do a shot every time I see this post.
---
Bro you trollin
---
Is this your first experience with a season in a game? I can't think of any games with seasons that throws you a party after you finish the season or have some sort of cinematic once that particular season is finished by a player. What youre upset about is literally the norm for this type of content. Seasons are not the same as expansions.
---
Give em some Calm-X
---
I‚Äôm not even getting to a world. I‚Äôve exited out. Quit the game, reloaded and nothing. I even reset my router and that didn‚Äôt do anything.
---
Indeed? That sounds far more stimulating at least! I'll have to give it a shot now
---
I remember some YouTuber was talking about palace of the winding path and saw 3 types of bears stacked up and he called it a bear orgy... I‚Äôll never see we bare bears the same way again
---
Give him the strength to actually take the advice and level up instead of wanting the instant gratification of completing the quest with zero work.
---
Pretty sure the PA through laser grid thing doesn't work anymore. You may have to leave it for now, go kill some easier stuff and try again in a few levelsüëç
---
I never knew this. No wonder my two shot fixer needs to be repaired twice ever time I deal with that prick Earl
---
That Sir is genius. I am going to do that next time I have a creepy random follow me.
---
Rip any respect on my name anytime I gotta mass spam PMs for Junkie chems D,;
---
I can confirm this. FPS drops and also weird pixel distortion everywhere.
---
Just do the math and you will agree with me. Don't call someone dense cause he pointed out something you were ignorant about. You was like everyone should know about Marvel pffft get real. Even some marvel fans don't know who Chad is they just know him as an actor for Black Panther
---
You took those pictures at the same time with same buffs?
---
If it is two shot explosive then it breaks 4X as fast.
---
See, I thought that too. But this is seriosly the only subreddit I've had issues with over the past 2 years of using it
---
I don‚Äôt want to be that guy but... if you have a post as simple as this, just look it up. Literally everything you need will be found within the top websites, or you can go find another Reddit post that asks the same question as this
---
Not one thing. Its tons of things that have happend. You didnt even read the post. You're part of the problem
---
Glitching to finish this one will only set you up to be underleveled for the next. I would really recommend taking a break from the main storyline to upgrade your gear and level up, then come at it again.
---
For reference, I solo'd the entire main quest. It can be done, just needs to be taken slower and with more strategy.
---
I wish
---
I agree the legendary system needs some work.  Drops are OK they should be random.
---
The purveyor should be able to apply a legendary effect to gear you bring her, and possibly you should be able to pick an effect on a 3 star for extra scrip.
---
I watched a YouTube video of a guy who spent something like 6k at the purveyor and got let's say around 50 different items.  His standards are a lot tighter than mine, but he got maybe 3-4 items he thought were nice.  The rest were 'junk'.  
---
Maybe he's spoiled for choice, but there should be some way to influence the RNG.
---
Yeah so get up on the cliff on the other side of the fort and snipe those spawns with explosive weapons. You don't even have to move. Why run around with teslas
---
They work when I am the only one on a team? Thought there had to be at least 1 person in the team or am I getting it wrong?
---
You might want to keep an eye out for a Shielded Casual Underarmor if you can find it.  It would allow you to adjust your points and still make decent skill checks:

I don't care about votes, I'm not a child. I haven't had any issue with mods and yet again, you're being part of the problem. It wasnt one thing.
---
it's not rarer, chances for both of them from Mire events are exactly the same.
---
It‚Äôs children usually, pretty sure.
---
Also curious... I‚Äôm betting on Asylum Red Dress or Forest Camo Jumpsuit
---
Then instead of causing problems then enlighten them, try to open discussion and explain the situation better instead of just asking for a work around.
---
you have no idea, brother. you have no idea...
---
I was having trouble loading at all, I ended up having to go into my games, clicking the three stripe more button on the game, going to manage game and deleting the saved files from the console. I had to delete the saved game space file as well and that fixed the issue for me. The downside is that you will lose all your pictures you have saved.
---
I blame players in Twitter saying we should help low level characters when ever possible. It gets them used to getting stuff for free.
---
I understand crashes are an issue but there is nothing anyone but Bethesda can do to fix that part
---
That's what I do too when its not glitched.
---
Snap out of it man. Asking for cheats and crying like a baby cause people didn't like it is a real stupid move
---
I use healing and speed demon with the Class Freak perk 3 and Evasive (or is it elusive?). Instead of Bird Bones I found two 50% fall damage reduction arms. No damage when falling. My friend uses Marsupial, healing and I think Scaly Skin with two 50% fall damage arms. I call her a bouncy ball. I prefer my mutations with as little interruption to SPECIAL.
---
I found a bloody explosive for 6000 caps in a vendor yesterday, and changed from a Junkie to Bloodied build just to use it. Lots of fun
---
I'd give you a solid response, but you're just going to cut down my feelings with your Daisy Cutter.
---
Nothing about your posts suggests an adult.
---
You asked how to use a glitch on a subreddit that has a clear rule about not sharing or encouraging glitches. 
---
You violated the rules of the subreddit and when this was pointed out to you, you copped an attitude. 
---
I read your questions and replies. You over-reacted and have a chip on your shoulder. 
---
Perhaps you need to show some respect when you are a guest in someone else‚Äôs house.
---
Like I wrote, few seconds difference
---
Haha the one shotters
---
It goes both ways. I dont know why people have the urge to click on and comment that they don't care lol.
---
I was asking for help because that's part of what the subreddit is for. It's not a "cheat" tons of people do it. You're still arguing a reason that only you've stated because you're not even reading. Just gaslighting and being ignorant.
---
I‚Äôll try that
---
The red asylums are probably not the rarest nowüòÇ I have 2 of them and almost everyone I asked already has one. Sux how the value‚Äôs gone down. I couldn‚Äôt even trade one set. Though still a great outfit. The forest camos are still holding it‚Äôs value. I was able to grab me 3 the other week for a legacy and managed to trade them 1:1 each for a good guns.
---
I don't recall anything about tiny penises....
---
Exactly man. No need to use teslas if the event isn't glitching. Unless you looking to do some cardio
---
I am guessing it will be some kind of door like you said, possibly with different options for doors. The question they didn't really answer (as far as I've seen) is actually whether other players will be able to enter your interior. If other players can't join you then this will be a huge misstep.
---
If you want I can tag along with you in game, get you geared up and help you out
---
You‚Äôll need some examples so we can know what your talking about.
---
Lots of people dupe. That‚Äôs still a violation of the ToS. 
---
Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right. That‚Äôs a very immature defense.
---
Why they thought this would be fun for the audience is the real puzzle.
---
Uranium fever has three guaranteed legendary spawns so it‚Äôs pretty good for that at least. It‚Äôll be great when one wasteland comes out I guess
---
wow i did this exact post 4 months ago. even in the same event.
---
sadly i had no recognition for it . F
---
Here‚Äôs some real advice. The quest can be hard at low levels. If you‚Äôre under level 50, do other stuff then come back to it later when you‚Äôre stronger. If you‚Äôre over 50 work on your perk card setup. Use perks that increase damage/survival. The other stuff doesn‚Äôt matter. 
---
Some real real advice. Quit trying to cheat. One guy suggests it and suddenly you trust him but don‚Äôt trust literally everyone else giving the real advice.
---
That one's even worse! It's like dude, you played it. Did you have fun? Then play it again.
---
That's why I waited til now to post this, lol. I've donated over 3500 units to date, and that's enough from me.
---
That‚Äôs so cool. Love finding creative camps while wandering
---
Hahahaha... this thread did not get enough upvotes.
---
I lock only one door, and it goes to my bedroom. There is nothing in there but my bed and dresser. Still people glitch in just to see. I only keep it locked because when I jump back to camp, remove my rads in the shower and jump in my bed to heal a bit, I dont want to stare at some other player already there and have to wait. 
---
Yes that has happened and it seemed they actually went afk.
---
I never found either lol
---
Cosmetics do also affect it. Game has far too few devs working on it and relatively too many artists. Encouraging that is harmful for everybody here. It is not beyond the power of a money printing company like bethesda to hire more people to fix things. The issue is that they haven't
---
I was told to use this glitch ON the subreddit. I got an attitude when people were being twats and not actually giving information, not when somebody pointed it out because they didn't.  I'm reacting upset because I am, because most people here are just assholes for no reason. What does "someone else's house" even mean??? Its a free site you make 0 sense. Again, you're part of the problem
---
YouTube. Just type in fallout 76 and whatever you want to know.
---
There's no need to be a butt. We're all gamers. All he said was some of us have stuff to do and "my dude." You're pretty sensitive if that's all it takes to bother you.
---
Did you uninstall the game data? I don‚Äôt see any option to do what you mentioned
---
Make another bed...
---
Because its a public forum, if they have to right to post what they want then I have the right to respond how I want. 
---
By your own logic, why comment at all?
---
The only subject I tire of seeing is this one.  Stop.
---
Sickening cheater mentality right here
---
Thatd be great, I'm usually on around 5pm est during the week and variable times on the weekends. I can pm my gt.
---
That's why I was asking for help. I ask for help, and I receive people being sarcastic and getting cocky for no reason. I'm not the only person. Theres a reason the sub is shrinking
---
I think they originally thought that nuke launches would be much more rare than they actually are. It should be replaced with a simpler but unique puzzle.
---
Missed that part :) gonna tag akarnokd
---
That plain epic üòÑ
---
Nothing, it registers that you got them, but there is no bonus or reward
---
I dont really know many people who didn't solo most if not all of the main quest.  Belly of the beast I did solo around level 40, it was somewhat difficult and I just sprinted past the scorchbeast and got out of there.  Funny looking back on it now that I shoot them out of the sky in seconds lol.
---
What? Who said anything about dupeing???
---
I finished last night and my score bar stayed full and says max level. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs pointless
---
The fairgrounds have stuffed bears, and paper trash, and pre war money
---
I was told to by higher level players. I know you wouldnt have a problem with them, you're just doing this to jerk your ego off
---
Cool I‚Äôm in mst so you‚Äôre a few hours ahead send me a message on Xbox gt communistraptor I‚Äôll be home later tonight after work
---
these are the steps I went through:
---
go to my games and apps,
---
go to FO76 game image,
---
click the 3 bar button for more options, 
---
go to manage game and add ons,
---
go to saved data,
---
and delete all from console.
---
Hope that helps!
---
There are mods that do this
---
sure, can help with specifying gear and perks (I didn't used any buffs)
---
I was asking for advice on how to do something tons of people do. Being told "play the game" and being being assholes isnt advice.
---
I believe that's because the explosive energy weapons are technically doing explosive damage so they're using the ballistic damage resistance instead.
---
I deserve more rewards from the Legendary Run after I completed it and got all the rewards
---
That can go
---
I don‚Äôt mind people posting they completed the run and what their experience was p
---
Yeah! I think I took a break around when you help Rose to re-assess my character's perks and gear, ground out what I needed to, and finished off the rest of the main story in one final push. 
---
I used to be terrified of scorchbeasts! Now it's a mosh pit of wendigos that haunt my dreams. Haha.
---
LOL I do have a problem with those people. I was ranting for months on those people when those cheaters were duping.
---
???
---
First time asking?
---
I will say that the rare outfits are stupid crazy rare. I have 3400 hours in game and the majority of them have never dropped for me.
---
But can't Bethesda yeet you out of their game for having mods?
---
Thx but unfortunately I'm on xbox
---
Does the VTU baseball cap fit that description?
---
Someone else breaking the rules doesn‚Äôt suddenly make the rule go away.  So whether or not someone in this sub told you how to use a glitch doesn‚Äôt justify you taking the rule on your own later.
---
And ‚Äòsomeone else‚Äôs house‚Äô means that this is a subreddit that is managed by the admin and moderators, and you are a guest. They set the rules of the sub. You are expected to follow them. And if you don‚Äôt like those rules, you are welcome to leave.  You can even start your own subreddit if you‚Äôd like, with your own rules and blackjack and hookers.  And in that subreddit, you‚Äôd have the authority to enforce a code of conduct. 
---
I‚Äôm not ‚Äòpart of the problem‚Äô. I just don‚Äôt agree with you. You‚Äôre the one making *that* a problem.
---
Someone disagreeing with you isn‚Äôt the same as someone attacking you. 
---
And where are these ‚Äòdeath threats‚Äô?  Those need to be reported beyond just this sub and Reddit.
---
That is awesome. THIS IS WHY WE SHOULDN'T KILL BRAHMIN, GUYS
---
I agree.
---
It still gathers that info anyway. Damage numbers, on-hit effects, tagging for exp/loot, triggering aggro, etc. This would do nothing
---
It‚Äôs an example. Just because someone breaks a rule doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs okay to break the rule. 
---
Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right.
---
I keep seeing people mention the points adding on to next season.
---
No, they don't. Why would they?
---
Events typically give scrip. 
---
Yes, this game has way too many currencies.
---
I swear I do inventory management every day like some wasteland SuperDuper Mart manager. I was rebuilding and fiddling with my camp over the last couple of days so had enough for one drop to the Botherhood.
---
Someone choosing not to help you use a glitch or cheat isn‚Äôt them being an asshole.
---
Tattered field jacket, Forrest asylum uniform, leather jacket, camo jumpsuit and Responders fire uniform would be my guess.
---
Im at the limit on budget, i cant even add a small letter to my camp, let alone another bed.
---
I do not know. Quick search suggests that it drops from forest events... so it sounds like it might be at the same rarity level.
---
You‚Äôre on Xbox?
---
They need to pick a niche for this weapon. 
---
* It could totally be a great brawler-SMG ... increase the damage and maybe ROF, reduce the recoil. Keep it not sneak-able, but make it a great in-your-face option
---
* It could be a good sneak skirmisher weapon ... add suppressor, maybe reduce VATS cost
---
"I've literally gotten death threats from posts on here"
---
X Doubt
---
I ended up doing only 2 quests on a team and actually wanted to do them solo.  Some dude at work found out I started playing and wanted to team up.  He was trying to cheese me through the main story so I could do silos with him and after 2 quests I stopped because I wasn't actually experiencing any of the story that way.
---
I do remember trying to sprint my way through the bog for this mission with 3 scorchbeasts ass blasting me the whole way.  It was terrifying at the time but super fun too.
---
I don‚Äôt like u/yonggo sometimes. But he has spoken out against glitchers and cheaters and dupers in the past.
---
You‚Äôre not special. He didn‚Äôt single you out.
---
Well now you‚Äôre proving their point. You still want to glitch it despite being told that it‚Äôs against forum rules.
---
Bloodied sneak commando. In my humble opinion. Switch between that and unarmed. Plus you can switch to rifleman as well to conserve ammo on smaller enemies.
---
I want my light switches back! Preferably both so they can compete for my attention!
---
I will place it after it's fixed
---
Dude how is "My advice is to level up and get better perks and gear so you can finish the quest" not actually information or being a twat? Legit question cause that's what I did for the BoS questline. It was surprisingly harder than the actual final quest.
---
No thanks. I design my base for me, not for you.  Go use your own camp.
---
THEN GTFO.
---
...brilliant. consider your idea stolen
---
Someone else breaking the rules doesn‚Äôt suddenly make the rule go away.  So whether or not someone in this sub told you how to use a glitch doesn‚Äôt justify you breaking the rule on your own later.
---
Yeah.  It's a cross-platform issue.  Sometimes it just doesn't show up, but if you have damage numbers on, the sneak attack should still be reflected in those.
---
Its over. Nothing will be added. No extra score.
---
I hope so, I bit on it right away when someone wanted to do a trade and I heard it‚Äôs the rarest and gave it a benefit of the doubt. I traded a legacy for that so I do hope it‚Äôs legit crazy rare. One guy even said he was playing the game since beta, literally the day it got released he went on and played and from there he only got 1 out of so many tries. Plus I do not see them floating in the market
---
It‚Äôs never going to happen
---
My favorite pvp combo. You have been insulted, your the dumbass, toilet paper, fertilizer, and salt.
---
I can't help you when it comes to glitches, unfortunately. I only play legitimately.
---
It definitely is a cheat and an exploit. Just because others do it, does not make it ok...
---
I wish I could feel what it felt like to see one of those things flying around for the first time again. Man. I almost pissed my pants the first time I launched a nuke for the Queen. üòÇ Man, time flies. 
---
The game's got such a great story though. Finding notes is still my favorite part of this game.
---
I'd chalk it up to more than likely people losing interest in the game but yeah the internet isn't the best place so when people don't like toxicity they'll leave.  I personally am not subbed due to constantly seeing posts talking negatively about the game which I myself enjoy and I rarely get involved in discussions but when I do I try to convey the idea of opening a discussion and try to be as friendly as possible but I know sometimes I can come across as a dick and I apologise if I had.
---
Don‚Äôt forget Forest Scout Masks
---
I've shot a player that did that. If they can't be grateful they can die imo
---
This sub is seeing a lot more fragile egos lately. I asked someone a very clear and polite question yesterday and got told I was ‚Äòstarting trouble‚Äô. 
---
It‚Äôs mind boggling. And I still want to see these alleged ‚Äòdeath threats‚Äô OP received. Because that needs to be addressed, and not by some mods on Reddit.
---
I didn't include those due to the savage divide lottery dropping them.
---
But the drop rate is very, very low
---
The private server refreshes? How am I only now finding this out? Thanks, man!
---
Scout armor masks are more common, as early in the game you could buy masks from enclave vendors.
---
Yes, and I just ignore them now.
---
I‚Äôd say most important thing in the game is decide on a build heavy, shotgun, sneaky commando/sniper and focus on leveling up to it so you‚Äôre not wasting any perk points
---
My favorite is "Hey, your level 317, what are you going to give me? I'm only level 12". And then they follow you around the map if you dont block.
---
K, imma have a look, where can I find this market? Is it a subreddit?
---
They are replaced by tears and sadness.
---
Thanks for your reply! I was wondering if it was just me because I just watched captain noob on yt and his notifications are showing up (think he's pc though) I have damage numbers on so will pay attention to them for now. Thanks
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of people asking for atoms for challenge rewards if they have already finished the season. Not a bad idea considering it has become quite the ghost town.
---
Add a 12.7mm receiver.
---
Exploit yes, cheat no. Why does it matter to you what I do in my game? It doesnt and shouldnt
---
Pointless, they are going to accumulate to nothing
---
They should remove it after completing the season.  It's just pure laziness they have left it in.
---
Did you power it up? Sorry, that isn't trying to be rude, I had this issue of the quest not advancing until I powered it.
---
Doubt all you want, doesn't make it any less true
---
You no longer get angry when they auto complete.
---
I think the Easter Bunny Mask might rank up there.  It's Atomic Shop, so it wouldn't have been mass duped.  It was only available in Easter 2019, which was pretty early days for the game and you had to login every day for a week and get the Deathclaw Egg from the Atomic Shop.  It also wasn't available last Easter.
---
The bundles for E3, Gamescom, and Quakecon which had things like the Pint Sized Slasher and Maxson's Battlecoat are probably up there too, because they've never been available since those limited-time bundles.
---
The Easter Bunny Mask is kind of the new Mosaic Tiles - you know a player has been around if they have one of these things.
---
"Someone disagreeing with you isn‚Äôt the same as someone attacking you."
---
An alarming number of people think it is.
---
I'm talking the other ones.
---
I never said everyone should know about marvel but it's the biggest film franchise in history and i imagine a very large chunk of the worlds population are aware of the marvel universe. Even if they've never seen one of the films. 
---
My mother who has never seen a single marvel film and probably never will knew who he was.
---
I really had hoped for a few instanced options like various entry points that would lead to the area.  So a few types of doors, cellar door, elevator, etc.  But I've learned not to expect to much with this game.  I remember all the speculation related to private worlds/sessions before they arrived, more than half of what people had hoped for out the window!  I watched the video from gamescom and was a bit confused as well.  I mean why can't we have an instanced area say on the third floor of our CAMP?   From the limited information made available it sounds more and more like purely instanced basements or vaults only, like mentioned in this post.  I hope that is not the case, but who knows?
---
Sneak sniper is my goal, its always sneak sniper or in case of skyrim stealth archer.
---
I liked it,but due to RL I was &amp; am going to be unable to finish it,so I‚Äôm just kinda hoping there‚Äôs a way to obtain these items later,like alls that I wanted outta the last portion,
---
was that white raider mask,&amp; the t-65 paint,nothin else really interested me,that wasn‚Äôt fairly attainable.
---
But ye,I guess I just wish they‚Äôd do more double score weekends or somethin,for those of us that love the game,but haven‚Äôt as much time too play.
---
Haha, I read that thread after seeing this one and I have to say, noone was being an asshole, except for you ofcourse. You are acting like a child who can't get his own way, its glorious to see.
---
Lol GTFO nub,  you're so bad at the game you need to find ways to cheat ,you're a scub
---
Wow. You still don't get it? Hahaha.
---
Death by Mr Fuzzy...
---
Insults aren't being an asshole? That's a sad world view
---
Yep, always!!!
---
My biggest issue is getting enough of the glowing mass, hardened mass and high rad fluid.
---
I'm just gonna wait until daily ops go through and enemies drop the ammo you use.
---
The scrap box is a game changer for me.  
---
Then I get some atoms to use monthly from it basically
---
The jacket is glitched or getting it is?
---
I have the forest camo jumpsuit.  I get multiple daily trade requests, but I'm not giving it up
---
Well, let me put it that way, the reason the red asylum uniform may not be considered the rarest anymore is not due to changes in its drop chance.
---
Finished it some weeks ago, you get nothing. BUT I do find it interesting to see how many daily and week challenges I've completed by just playing how I want to.
---
This one is Armor Ace themed though. Would be strange to not include it in the Season. But it does seem like they do changes based on feedback, like making greenhouse lvl 99, as people express interest in it. And the Atom Shop display may be redundant if you can get one for free in the Seasons, so they might rethink because of that.
---
How you have so much notes? I struggle getting enough each day.
---
Yeah I was being a dumbass and not powering it up haha, thanks for the help Maybe I can finally do this quest line after a month
---
It does, I didn‚Äôt see a delete all from console just uninstall. That‚Äôs what I did, I‚Äôm in the process of reinstalling now. Probably won‚Äôt get to play today which pisses me off

I know what Black Panther is but I never knew his name till he passed away. I'm sorry man he was never a significant actor. He had potential but died too soon. If someone like Nick Fury or Ironman or Black Widow died, EVERYONE would know cause they are big actors to begin with but not this guy.
---
No, in fact the client recognizes you have mods and won't let you play nuclear winter but you can play adventure just fine. So they know we use mods, in fact in one of the ama or livestreams developers said the look at the top fo76 nexus mods as feedback to see what the community wants
---
Well the atomic shop items are an exception. I meant the ones that are only dropping from events. Probably any yearly event outfits will do just like the jacko suit. And on top of that, they couldn‚Äôt be duped. So it makes it rarer than any imo. But since halloween is near maybe it‚Äôll come back.
---
Yup! Just make sure you hop back into the private server quickly after leaving it. I‚Äôve also had some problems around the first or second time where some mobs might not spawn, for that, I just fast travel elsewhere, quit, join back, fast travel back, and boom, all mobs ready to go
---
Post your platform, my dude.
---
If you use Gatling laser I‚Äôd recommend power user 3 which doubles your fusion core ammo. Bloody mess with give you extra 15% damage output.
---
White Fedora
---
If people on Reddit are legitimately threatening your life, why are you still on Reddit?
---
So investing one point each into rifleman, expert rifle man and master rifleman as soon as possible will give you a 30% damage boost so aim for perception, agility and luck, lots of good builds online to give you a good idea of where to go in that build, I ran a bloodied sniper/commando build until just recently after a near perfect rolled mini gauss dropped from the acp event
---
Woah. Full health too. That‚Äôs pretty amazing.
---
I got like 5 staches on my porsh people still ask me : where is your stach at ?
---
Did you scrap anything at a bench while in your power armor? Especially spam scrapped? 
---
There used to be a bug that caused unintended stuff to be scrapped if spam scrapping. It was patched but I believe it returned with the Wastelanders release because I saw a clean spacesuit image flash up and it was gone from my inventory.
---
For that, I nuke morgan town. Hella bloated ones and you can just refresh em by rejoining the server. I did it for about 2 hours and had 100+ of glowing/hardened mass and high rad fluids.
---
I tried to use my minigun for the new boss but those wendigos don‚Äôt always drop the ammo and I run out way faster than I get back
---
I dunno, all my pa light looks too bright, cant examine objects standing close to me, i wish for less bright lights (colored or vault boy lights not for me)
---
I‚Äôve noticed. 
---
It seems fewer and fewer of us can have engaging debates without people assuming there is anger or hatred involved.
---
When I ask *‚Äòwhat makes you think that?‚Äô, * or ‚Äòwhere did you hear that?‚Äô*, it‚Äôs a legitimate inquiry. I‚Äôm curious and would like to understand the issue better, because it‚Äôs illogical to assume that I know everything about a topic, even if it is a topic that I‚Äôve studied for a long time. 
---
Some people take it as *‚Äòyou must be stupid if you believe that, so tell me your data source so I can point out all of the errors and then dance around you and mock your idiocy.‚Äô*  
---
Maybe they‚Äôve had people do that to them in the past. But there‚Äôs a word for when you preemptively judge an individual based primarily on prior experiences with other people.
---
How near we talking? I always keep a toolbox close by vendors, and got a Flea across the street
---
I finished 7/11 of the weekly challenges last week just from normal playing. I was kinda surprised, because I wasn't really doing much.
---
I'd prefer a one work bench solution.
---
"Is this game worth buying yet? LOL"
---
I feel like the pistol perks are in agility so you can use both rifles and pistols together, as high agility and perception makes Vats very useful for both weapon types, I also believe that pistols are designed to be sidearms rather then primary weapons. I just want to stress that filing the pistol perks under agility wasn't a mistake or accident. So there must be a good reason for it to be this way.
---
There's some videos of it on YouTube I think ü§î  one of the fallout 76 YouTubers covered it.
---
I believe when daily ops come out, each enemy killed during those always drops the ammo of the gun your using.
---
You mean insults like ‚Äòget better gear, perks and more experience‚Äô?  
---
That‚Äôs not insulting. That‚Äôs practical advice. 
---
By the way, where are those death threats you mentioned?  I don‚Äôt see them anywhere.
---
Pipe...
---
Pipe is life.
---
You can actually do without One Gun Army if there's something else you want to fit from the LCK line. It has some niche uses (like maybe crippling Earle), but add Bloody Mess there if you don't already have it.
---
Aside from Stabilized and the nine Heavy damage perks in STR, I'd recommend maybe running Traveling Pharmacy/Chem Fiend and running Psychobuff for the 25% boost.  You get the added benefit of basically holding as many Stimpaks and Radaway as you want. And it's easy to craft from the Psycho and Bufftats that you find. Just make sure to use Super Duper and Chemist to make a ton. After you do all of that, it's easy to go down the rabbit hole and run Junkie's, lol.
---
Haha, no worries! I had exactly the same problem. I facepalmed when I realized I needed to actually run a wire to it. It's not always super clear to me whether something runs on ambient power or has to be wired directly.
---
The regular light is way to dim to light really dark places up though.
---
It's definitely the ash piles and some of their inability to be looted that's fucking over the FPS.
---
I think the rarest mask will have to go to tanned mask. But I met a beta player level 800 with a mask that is literally the vault 94 scout mask but without the thorns and stuff. Apparently you have no way of getting them.
---
throws upvote at you
---
Exactly my point, was amazed how many challenges you can cover from cocking about and just having a laugh.
---
Thank you so much! I won't be missing this opportunity ever again!

I dig that one tbhüòÇ goes well with my underwear ü§£

Which ones?  Share links, please.

Which specific posts are the ones that you felt were ‚Äòinsulting‚Äô?  You can copy the link and post them so we can all see what you mean. 
---
And by the way, please don‚Äôt post ones where the first comment was advice, your reply was rude, and then their counter-reply was ‚Äòinsulting‚Äô. We‚Äôre looking for examples of unprovoked rudeness on their part. Not retorts you your own.

Or "I left when TSEs got nerfed. What's the meta now?"

Nah, you can't possibly be having fun /s
---
I know they drop ammo like the wendigos but if it‚Äôs actually all enemies, then holy shit I‚Äôm thankful. But Earle takes a fuck full of ammo to kill so I guess this is the solution till then
---
And why hasn‚Äôt OP shared those links or provided any evidence?

If these claims are true, they need to file a criminal report.

Is it wrong to kill your own brahmin to reset the milk? Asking for a friend.

These are all very high-end advice, and I would suggest you just go blindly into the world of Fallout 76. It's extremely rewarding to discover all the secrets and tips/tricks the game has to offer. Then come back here when you're done with the story and looking for everything you've missed. There is no rush
---
Same here, I've been running the same mutations over a year with no issues, it wasn't until I switched to a bloodied build earlier this year that all these weird fast travel and death/respawn issues started happening, of course updates happened too, so who knows. But more people would be having these issues if it was an update, so maybe it's just us bloodied people... and something very specific we are using/doing/etc.
---
This is probably the best subreddit to find friends idk about discord‚Äôs
---
Yeah if you used the build limit glitch your camp takes longer to load and apparently this gives them more time to steal your stuff. Apparently having your camp at max can even be a risk. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs patched or not but I‚Äôm not taking the risk.
---
There are several LFG discord communities. 
---
I attended to 15-20 nukes yesterday
---
After deliberation, we will allow it.
---
Scrip it. If its a REALLY good roll for another build, hold onto it incase you swap your build in the future. 
---
There will be an ultralight mod in parch 22, so you could mod unused peices with ultralight and they will take up very littlw stash space.

22nd September is my guess, gives about a two week gap between the seasons.

---
I beleive they said there is a 2 week break between seasons.
---
 If the season ends sept 8, and there is a two week break, one would think season 2 will be part of patch 22 and drop on Sept 22.

I actually have a screenshot of this somewhere, let me find it.

I‚Äôm at 67 and not sure if I will complete or not as I‚Äôm heading out of town for the weekend.

Right, didn't know that
---
That‚Äôs the one who I‚Äôm suggesting gives us this feature, but expanding it to allow us to use it whenever we want. I‚Äôd say they could just place a cap of 200 a day (or don‚Äôt place one at all, but knowing Bethesda, we won‚Äôt get that) in exchange for a set amount of reputation.

Only played about 3 months when 76 first came out.   Came back for the private server and Wastlander.  Nice upgrades to the game.

I got to friendly with both with severe bugs and stuff but then gave up when I found out there was a rep level between friendly and allied and I have little interest in trying for it

Yea but you dont get the bright light option for a lot of the power armor sets. Thats what im getting at. You should be able to have that option you know
---
You clearly didn't read all my comment
---
you do realize this is a server based game, right? The codes do not need to reside in local memory
---
You can respawn enemies on any server if you log out and log back in.  The only problem is getting back onto the same server.  If you have friends on it, or if you look for someone on the server in your recents list, you can do so.
---
It's just easier solo on a private server as you don't have to do any of that, and you also don't have other people rolling through and killing things.
---
Oh, I see, I thought you had completed it.

This comment is the exception to the rule. So far, it‚Äôs the only one that fits the OP‚Äôs claims.  And yet, OP is claiming that ‚Äòmost comments‚Äô are like this.
---
This gives me hope for future longterm progression grinds.  Many people (myself included) thought the Run would be a nigh-impossible task when looked at purely based on SCORE-per-day.  But it turned out to be quite doable, once they scheduled a few double SCORE/XP events, threw in some buy-a-free-square ATOMS rewards, and dialed in the daily challenges a bit.  Makes me wonder if they have similar plans for Legendary Perk Coins with future SCORE rewards, quest rewards, and so on.  
---
Hopefully it won't be a "double perk card scrap weekends," though.  That'd be a kick in the teeth!
---
This is what ruined the pve mode in fortnite.
---
It's mostly kids.

I agree with you man. Why put story elements into something like the Season Pass, give it a freakin' name, "The Legendary Run" and not give you an ending to the story. 
---
One of the typical graphics that close up quests would've been a welcome sight. You get those for practically every named quest. [Like the 'Lying Lowe' quest has the graphic](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lying_Lowe) of Fallout Boy pulling his hair out at the conspiracy boards, something simple like that would've been great.
---
You clearly didn‚Äôt read mine. Why would they talk about NV if they didn‚Äôt work on it? If someone brings it up, what do you expect them to say? ‚ÄúOh the game is so good, blah blah blah‚Äù unless they are making a remaster, I doubt they‚Äôll want to go into detail since they don‚Äôt know the details since they didn‚Äôt work on it. 
---
If someone brought up something your company published but didn‚Äôt work on, would you be more likely to make some comment and then move on to something you do know about, or would you try to explain something you didn‚Äôt work on?
---
What platform are you on
---
A Maize maze.. amazing
---
No. You received people giving you proper advice.  You did not like the proper advise.
---
Still works with the lmg but not reliably. I have a bloodied limb damage and a junkies faster fire. If the server is laggy they work better but I generally only use the when time is an issue on an event. Gauss minigun works because of the explosive effect.
---
I thought it was a bug. I probably didnt pay attention when the robot decided to not kill me anymore.
---
Fasnacht rewarded two for each one and Meat Week rewarded 3. Primal Cuts also rewarded TNs. People just hop around doing Public Events like crazy as well. I had a nice excess from Fasnacht but didnt have a lot of time to give to Meat Week so ive burned through my extras and now am back to just the 9 from the Faction Daily missions and any Public events that pop up.
---
Not even close
---
If the problems still persist then they shouldn‚Äôt be retired. It may be tedious to see them clogging up the feed day in day out but it‚Äôs honestly the only reliable way to get Bethesda to acknowledge a known issue (and sometimes even fix it!). Saturation sustains visibility. When stuff gets fixed it‚Äôll stop getting posted on. 
---
Probably.
---
LAER please and thank you
---
You won't see 'magic' damage until you get to a fire rate ~200.  It also works with shotguns, because you hit with all the pellets at one time.
---
Oh, and 2-shot and explosive weapons make it easier to get to, because they both double the 'hits'.  But SBQ is immune to explosive weapon damage.  I have read that Earle's legs will take damage from it though.
---
I had a person ask if I could give them 20 of each flux

this would actually be a really good idea, even make the exchange really high so it's still better to the dailies, but going from neutral to the highest rep takes FOREVER grinding out the dailies.

I mean this in total earnest, that was one of the funniest things I‚Äôve seen in quite some time. 
---
Especially because I read that in Wallace Shawns voice. You‚Äôve bested me this time friend. Take my upvote, and leave in peace!
---
In all likelihood the bobbleheads and stand are rendered as one. You can't increase performance without decreasing fidelity.
---
Rhymes with park it 76.  The sub has beef with this one.    Making post takes  a little practice but after you get it it's fine.  Just make sure you check for karma over 100 or so and offer up a little caps....someone will offer to do it for free.
---
The earlier one says it's a wall set, the later one says it's a wall set with roof pieces. The earlier one has no art yet, the later one appears to be the greenhouse glass set from fallout 4.
---
A man gotta re-up. It‚Äôs a long way back from the Vault weighed down with gold bullion!
---
Take my upvotes as well!  And thank you for playing along!
---
It‚Äôs a good feeling to add some humor and light-heartedness to this kind of unhappy post.
---
If you want to cheat and glitch go to the market sub.  Their all about glitching, cheats and duping.
---
Agreed good sir. Agreed.
---
You'll still get score when you complete a challenge but it won't go anywhere
---
The point is to bring attention to the devs
---
Absolutely not. There have been disastrous consequences for players due people (who seem to lack a good conscience) stealing from others. I keep stash boxes far away from vendors as well as keeping the spawn point at maximum distance.
---
&gt; this whole weapon needs a rework.
---
I really like how the 10mm SMG feels, but this is absolutely true. It is an AP hog, even when fully modded with AP cost reducing mods and 25% reduced cost legendary effect. Its also a prime candidate for the Guerilla perk, but has no grip mod to put it in that category. Which is silly, since Guerilla only has two weapons that work with it: 10mm Pistol and Pipe Auto. (Pistol perks need a rework as well, but that's another post. Just make them one 3 point card like Iron Fist, please.)
---
Once you have been Mayor for the day you are now free to roam Watoga at your pleasure.
---
Also great for doing all the " kill x amount of robots with x weapon" atom challenges as the robots don't fight back.
---
If you thought this was gonna be different than literally any other season pass you and others who think like this are just dumb and never played any games with a season pass before
---
It‚Äôs fake progress.. it‚Äôll reach the goal whether we donate the stuff or not.
---
PLEASE THIS
---
Yes. I know cheating isn't an issue on consoles.
---
I love shotguns for mobs, heavy guns for the scorchbeast queen and earl. 
---
It‚Äôs a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù shotgun because of the 33% VATS accuracy, it does way more damage than it‚Äôs supposed to. Apparently if you add an armor piece that has the blocking legendary perk it gets even stronger but I haven‚Äôt tested it out before.
---
Too much work just get regular 2mm ammo
---
Welcome back!
---
Yes. I have one with bash and it is magic... Although it's also Bloodied so it doesn't really matter wether or not I use VATS.
---
xbox 1
---
I doubt it, they'd have to have a model for every possible permutation of Bobbleheads which would be in the millions. It's got to be checking for what types, what order, etc to properly render it so a full stand has got to be 21 objects being rendered. It seems like they can instead do a single stand with all the geometry fixed and locked to one order so it only has to render one object instead of 21.
---
All launchers (grenade, missile, and mini-nuke) need to have different rules then other guns, but otherwise I agree.  The durability should be based on shots fired not enemies killed.
---
No I had just been adventuring and doing my thing. I bought armor from a vendor and when I went to put it on and hopped out of my PA I noticed my characters face was exposed and the helmet was gonezo =(
---
I hope not with how many I've tossed
---
Yup, more than 50% of the time, I don't see the pop up.
---
I'm also hidden.
---
We'll get the collectron no matter what lol the progress isn't real
---
The posters on the wall covered the word and finding the scorched officers, but the alphabet jumble wasnt explained anywhere I found, it was just "decrypt" it. The terminals and reading through them never got into detail.
---
I‚Äôve always wanted to experience it you know to just see what‚Äôs it like in front of me but I‚Äôm sure people do glitches in NW console servers
---
Agreed!! I used to max myself out on caps, buy 5.56 and rinse-repeat. With all the duping this year, I put a stop to that. I am almost done learning all the plans and I am going to need a cap sink very soon. I don't plan to stop playing FO76 anytime soon!
---
You got it dude!
---
If that's where I'm thinking, I believe there's a tree on the back corner you can jump up on to get onto the ledge of the roof. There's a bunch of canned food up there, along with a footlocker that usually has a lot of fertilizer in it for the Dogwoods daily that pops up.
---
I had a sneak build with silencers and got bored. It was no fun just walking up to mutants and headshoting them. So I removed all my silencers and the gun fights are way more engaging. That‚Äôs my advice, stay sneaky enough to land initial sneak attacks but turn up the volume on your weapons to make it more fun.
---
"Score points should be Atom after completing the Legendary Run".
---
this one shows up all the time.
---
I know herd mentality works if you are a public team of one.  If there are other people on the team, you do not have to be near any of them for it to work.  One of the in game descriptions is inaccurate.
---
Similar PSA: if you're selling junk put a scrapbox near by or else I'll assume it's a trap and not buy any junk from you.
---
If you‚Äôve been saving the Atoms you‚Äôve been earning along the way from the board, at Rank 74 you can buy 8 levels. You‚Äôll get another 150 at level 80 &amp; 90. You might have to spend some extra Atoms to get to the end, but Rank 100 does give you 500 Atoms. So if you get to rank 97 and have 450 Atoms, and the Season will be about the end, spend them to get the last three ranks, netting 50 Atoms along with the three ranks of rewards. 
---
Best of luck!
---
All PC players play together so ultimately it‚Äôs up to you which launcher you want.
---
Also Bethesda.net doesn‚Äôt have achievements IIRC for what that is worth.
---
Doubtful
---
You can never have too much gold... but I'm not going to sell you any this week :(  
---
Logged in on one character yesterday and got gold, went back with a second character.. No gold for you sonny
---
That gives me hope at least,I dunno about the PA paints as much as it would suck for me,I kinda think it‚Äôd be nice for the people who could accomplish the grind,to have SOMETHING that was exclusive
---
,but I feel like the mask could be done as a raider reward.
---
I believe it is a Skyrim reference. Nukashine can teleport you there.
---
Got it, thx alot
---
I appreciate the people when the spawn point is blocked at the entrance and when the group of scorched are dropped in there's always ***someone*** who has a grenade thrown the moment they land blowing them in all directions and not allowing anyone else to get a hit on them not get any XP.
---
Thanks for that too üëçüèª
---
Yeah the system at this point is the same as the current season, so figure on needing 40-60 days and 40-100 hours to complete if you don't have any bugged challenges or use any exploits.
---
Mines assassins...... Blech.  But if it works, I'll keep it.
---
I should be able to help you out. I usually solo earl on my private so it should be cake. Psn talley54. Ill try to on about 6
---
You might appreciate [this link](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events), then.
---
I was actually gonna donate, but...
---
&gt;( Get this post to Hot/Trending by Upvoting to get the word out as time's running out! We may not see this in the Atomic Shop in the future! )
---
Well I'm the kinda person that, when I can tell someone really wants me to do something...I refuse to do it because I wanna do things on my own terms.
---
I always put a footlocker on top of my vending machines but after reading this ill be taking it down didnt realize you can glitch into inventorys like that.. Is that the reason people are constantly buying single ammo??
---
I mean, to someone like me this sounds immensely fun. It's supposed to make the nuke launches require effort. I'm actually disappointed that the codes are non-unique.
---
cool, thanx
---
It will come out when it does. Random guessing means nothing to me.
---
I'd probably be interested. What makes you say you suck at launching nukes? If you like, I'd be happy to help coach you on how to launch efficiently (and even legitimately, if you like.)
---
SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
I mean they did have a big ass warning before you chose to side with the raiders it‚Äôs literally your own fault. It couldn‚Äôt have been any clearer that you couldn‚Äôt progress any further in the settlers story.
---
I think they should be a non-unique code, but personally I think the the Enclave bunker keyword as a compromise should be immediately available as opposed to waiting a few days and then guessing at a word I have never heard before.
---
I will send you a request. I launch nightly. lvl. 515. You can run with me if you see me on.
---
What's the tanned mask? Also I don't think Dev room/ hacked items should count for rarity.
---
It said the fatigues are unlocked but it only allowed me to get the beret? Is this just me?
---
IIRC, assassins will be updated to affect human NPCs. So it will have more use against Cultists and Blood Eagles, for example. It will be a good ‚Äòbackup‚Äô weapon. 
---
I carry three magic Gauss Shotguns so I can keep my time between repair sessions longer than normal. One is a Junkie‚Äôs, and my main isn‚Äôt a Junkie at all. The other is Anti-Armor and the third is Troubleshooter‚Äôs.
---
why would they add this to the game? He has nothing to do with Fallout, Marvel has nothing to do with Fallout. At best they would get labeled as "profiting off his death" and at worst it would cause a racially charged division around the game.  
---
It's unfortunate that someone died but, frankly, it happens every day. Why is this one actor deserving of being immortalized in a completely unrelated game?
---
I have a furious one that's a lot of fun, but as a non bloodied build the poor accuracy and lack of suppressor means its next to useless on anything high level. Because of that it sits in my stash, and I've accumulated over 15k 10mm by just playing.  A suppressor would be awesome.
---
I spent 11 yrs in the forces, my weapon never broke once, it breaks every 11 minutes in this game, I think they need a reality check, or do away with it altogether, otherwise, what's the point.... :-)
---
It is absolutely fake progress, but I'm going to be super pissed if this is the one they let us fail. I donated steel before I knew it was all fake and nothing again until these days when I tossed them some cloth. I need a new collectron so I can ditch that Santa turdbot.
---
I'd rather they just enable atom challenge rewards for the last two weeks of the season for everyone in addition to the score reward. That way it's not locked behind ranks some people won't get to.
---
Nope. Would you like to level up everyone's characters 9 times after level 200 to move points, and acknowledge perks we lost in Perception because of that? Because that's how you screw people.
---
Pistol perks need condensed into a 5 star.
---
It‚Äôs more tedious than hard. Nuke silos are easy as well with the PA exploit, a majority of the time is just looking for ghouls since I don‚Äôt have a route yet
---
It just means you can put the camo skin on the jetpack
---
DID WE MEET THE GOAL FOR THE FREE BOS STUFF???
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a dev room/hacked item. It‚Äôs a scout mask with no livery whatsoever. A buddy of mine has one too. He got it way way back and was told it was in game for only 2 weeks during beta. As what the trader said.
---
Yes, max caps an individual character can have is 30k.
---
The Steel Dawn fatigues should have been unlocked sometime yesterday, according to their Twitter post. But IIRC u/LadyDevAnn said yesterday in here that it was delayed. My guess is at today‚Äôs update at 12 Noon ET.
---
Edit:  Yes, she did and provided [this link](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/aziPqMpE2SiBmqWPiAxUb/atomic-shop-weekly-update-september-1-8)
---
I have a feeling you bought a jet pack skin plan and don‚Äôt have the jet pack itself learned. I could be wrong.
---
Yes, this has happened to almost everyone.  Store that wall, and the legendary run poster will also be stored.  Put your wall back.  Build a large painting on the wall, maybe the big one with the palm tree.  Now place the legendary run poster on top of it.   I don't have one where the frames of the 2 decorations are exactly the same size, but it is better than sinking into the wall.
---
Yeah that and bombing our friend Earle.
---
My solution to the meat pile issue was finding a [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/469) that replaced the meat piles with a stack of tall blue and yellow balloons. This way there's no more frame rate issues and when it's over you don't have to squat to pick stuff up.
---
Damn bro, maybe because it isn‚Äôt even their game üò≥
---
Thank you for the advice (i'm on PS4), but when i work on a camp, i mean we talk about hours until I feel it works relatively fine. 
---
To make it short, i don't know what i can do with it. I need to experiment stuff with it. I didn't buy the Nuka Cola bundle because i didn't like the fact that we see the screws holding the door to the wall.
---
Actually, i need to test these doors to see if i'll like them...
---
Yeah I'm currently making an alt who can do both. I think the special legendary perks are really going to open this dual build up a lot more.
---
&gt; Any pics of rewards around.
---
[Yes](https://imgur.com/a/p4HBjOa).

---
some of the older weapons have made it in, but I'm still waiting on the good ol' Desert Eagle and the 14mm pistol
---
I doubt they would do it, companies love fluffing up the numbers of their games and they aren‚Äôt going to admit that people aren‚Äôt playing their content.
---
Marsupial definitely and probably Herd Mentality. So easy to group up and +3 to stats is fantastic, pretty much zero downsides.
---
If I don't want to fit Class Freak into my build I just go with Starched and Marsupial + Herd Mentality.
---
Iron sights are both there but they're bugged and the front one is invisible.
---
Yes except you count as that "at least 1 person" person in a team. So for example, with empath you don't get the full 33% damage reduction like the rest of the team but you get 25% (33% - 8%) still, assuming you have maxed out class freak perk.
---
Patch 22 isn‚Äôt out yet.
---
I have only did it one time with a team.  Also, yes coaching would be great
---
cool! thank you
---
I'm at 85 right now so I'm hoping I can make the push to 100. If not, well, I got some atoms saved up from challenges so hopefully I can get within buying range.
---
Apparently, even if the numbers show sneak attack there are in some cases false numbers. There is a thread about that :
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ikohpb/here\_are\_some\_definitive\_answers\_on\_how\_sneak/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ikohpb/here_are_some_definitive_answers_on_how_sneak/)
---
Request sent. Np.
---
Just use the free states skin being it allows you to use a jet pack even without knowing the plan
---
It doesn't come with the jetpack, it's just a skin to put on it. You still need to buy the t-65 jetpack plan for 2000 gold bullion first before you can use the skin.
---
I didn‚Äôt buy this, but I did read the description and figured it would be very misleading as the text says ‚Äúthe power armor skin INCLUDES A PLAN FOR THE SECRET SERVICE JET MOD‚Äù. 
---
I‚Äôd either submit a ticket for a refund or report it as a bug.
---
Pointless
---
To elaborate. 
---
The problem with the stealth armor is that it doesn't allow you to wear anything with it (except maybe underarmor?).
---
So you loose out on 5 potential legendary Effects from your armor and all the resistances of those pieces as well.
---
And the enemies will still find you eventually. And when they do..you die because you have no resistances. 
---
All of that loss for being able to move while "invis".
---
Instead, there is a legendary effect of chameleon, which has the same effect as stealth armor but only while not moving and crouched. It works out better in the end.
---
The only people I see who use the stealth armor are very high levels with god roll legendary weapons whom can one shot everything.
---
In short, you really arent missing much.
---
It looks trash as an under armor it makes you look like a fat ass when wearing combat armor as a male character. The officer underarmor and such does the same thing and you can wear it as the same time if the fatigues if they were an over armor item.
---
It‚Äôs not as big of an issue on consoles but there is still some cheating that goes on.
---
I'm thinking that maybe a fireworks plan may become a bullion purchase.
---
I got an idea on how to torment the beggars:Shoot em.
---
Is there a datamined image of the Tank Helmet available?
---
I actually liked the season setup and want to see them more often, however I'd like them to bring in more actual content first. like new areas and new quests. Even with the larger pool of daily challenges the game got really old really quickly. There needs to be more dungeon runs added, not just Events.  
---
Bring back the Vault runs, but scale them down so it's not a million bullets to get through.
---
Yes. And they've even used those mods for the atomic shop showcase of the Liberty skin for it.
---
I disagree. I think nukes should be something special that takes work. I think the way it‚Äôs set up is nearly perfect. You can cheat and grab the code online (which I do) but you still have to do the legwork to make it happen. Any easier and you‚Äôd have nonstop nukes. The law of diminishing marginal utility demands that it be somewhat difficult in order to prevent over-saturation and thus boredom.
---
I really appreciate the tips!
---
You don‚Äôt get rewards. You don‚Äôt get atom points. You don‚Äôt get script or gold. So no need to rush or worry about them anymore. 
---
That‚Äôs it. You finished the race. All that‚Äôs left is wait for other people to finish.
---

That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. It would work with any full health guns though
---
yes....smashed....take that concrete....
---
If we don't reach 200m I expect the goal to once again change so that we do fulfill.
---
Aaaah the freedom from doing dailies for about a month. Enjoy the break. Ive been done over 3 weeks and don't miss them at all.
---
It doesn't happen that often to me (Xbox) but I did have one kid, and I mean kid voice messaged me - "I need Frag Grenades" and about 5 seconds later "I need Purified Water", I fast traveled to him and dropped a bag full of fertilizer and some TP that I was going to scrap. Little Shit.
---
The only reward is not having to deal with it until next season.  Which, honestly, is a pretty big reward.
---
They are a pain
---
So far no artwork for it in the game, not sure if anything is in the files. Usually when something has finished art they have been adding it to the preview though.
---
People have asking about this since like, Fallout: NV, and the 10mm has always been a weird gun that they neglected with mods since then.  It's almost become a hallmark of Bethesda's forgetful/hamfisted approach to game making as of late.
---
If you don't want to go the magic route, anti-armor is a very good effect for a shotgun, but the rate of fire and long reload time of pump shotguns makes them a poor choice against stuff that takes a while to kill. A junkies or anti-armor combat shotgun would be a little better, partly because you can put a perforating magazine on it. I'm using a quad double barrel on my pistols/shotguns character - best raw damage per shot, crazy high rate of fire, and it reloads pretty quickly. It is viable in queen fights, though I have to use something else until she lands, in my case a junkie's pipe pistol or vampire's laser pistol.
---
No problem I spend more time trading than actually playing nowadays.  If you need some pointers let me know.
---
New turrets? Got a link?
---
Two ways to level-up:
---
Follow the quest lines for main story, Wastelanders and side quests to advance the game play.  Should be about 40-45 when done...maybe higher
---
Or, hit up groups and events to level up to 50, then start the quests
---
Just a few important quests and events in my opinion: 
---
Miner Miracles to get Excavator armor and plans and power armor station
---
Line in the Sand event for XP
---
Power up power plants events to get generator plans
---
Uranium Fever event for XP
---
Claim unowned workshops for XP and plans
---
Exactly. I don't understand how so many people are saying they finished so early, just "playing casually" - I know my playing had dropped off to almost the bare minimum by the end, but even with completing nearly every daily and every weekly, save for missing *one* day, I only *just* finished last week. Which, granted, was almost two weeks before the end, but it was a *grind* to get there... Maybe it's just because I refuse to run a meta bloodied build or take the time to mindlessly grind XP, but I still don't understand how anyone could have finished "casually" so quickly.
---
Save any god roll pieces in case you decide to change your build.
---
not even once
---
No worries. I'll add ya. Just shoot me a message when you're on.
---
Suppressor mod would be very welcome. Like this weapon but it is very loud and harsh recoil even with mods
---
Are there really people out there still doing dailies thinking they are keeping that SCORE?
---
Lol unless Caesar has access to a time machine that ain't happening
---
Enemies inside Daily Ops have ''mutations'', the first game mode to be released called ''Uplink'' features enemies with a random mutation chosen between 4 different types, and another one that is always present, which in this case is the ''Piercing Gaze'' mutation.
---
The mutation(piercing gaze) basically makes enemies always know where you are, you will always be in ''DANGER'' while you are inside that instance, thus negating both all the defensive advantages of stealth like not being hit and also all the offensive ones like sneak crits, so you won't be able to proc Follow Through.
---
This could all change before the patch hits the live servers though and afaik Bethesda already confirmed that ''Piercing Gaze'' will only be present in the ''Uplink'' game mode.
---
What you bought is essentially the skin for the power armor pieces. I believe you can apply the skin to all type of power armor. 
---
You also unlocked the skin for the jet pack. Meaning if you have a jet pack you can put that skin on it too. 
---
But you need to own the plan for said jet pack, it will let you add a skin to it. For example I have the plan to craft a jet pack for the t-60. So I can add any jet pack skin to it. However I don‚Äôt own the plan for the x-01. Somebody just gave me their old one a year ago. So I can‚Äôt craft or add the skin for that.
---
I prefer steam. 
---
1) I have quite a few games with steam.
---
2) Two-factor authentication. Get with the modern world Bethesda.
---
3) Updates tend to be smaller than Windows store.
---
That sounds fun, I support having multiple legit playstyles.
---
Agreed, haven‚Äôt really played besides getting on yesterday to check the atomic shop. Bought the captain cosmos bed for half off which was nice as I only had the unstoppables bed and mothman bed
---
How would I template my post? I just need to say I need someone to mod my Ultracite Gatling Laser and have caps
---
It couldn‚Äôt be any closer if Hawkeye, Deadshot and Robin Hood merged into some kind of mutant mega-sharpshooter and took aim from six inches away. 
---
By the way, where are the links to those death threats?  You need to report that to the authorities and have criminal charges filed. Failing to do so means you might be putting others at risk by ignoring that crime.
---
But according to the description it comes with the jetpack plan so it‚Äôs false advertising
---
Yea its kinda annoying.a couple days ago a guy asked me if i could drop him 100 shotgun shells,so i did and then he said he meant 300 hundred.Once i said i heard him clearly say 100 hundred he started yelling and left.What a experience.
---
So you sign on and just stand there then? The issue is there is ZERO endgame, so by the time you finish the run you ran out of shit to do weeks ago.
---
I just finished done one and I was like hold up I'ma ask first
---
Radio Shack
---
so that took 2 hours with zero rewards that mattered. Then what?
---
Thats excellent info thank you! Me and my buddy stumbled into a power plant one on Monday, was fun being level 4 and fighting 15 - 32 level enemies, we ended up devising traps to finish it off. Then we defended the workshop and were getting wrecked by the little liberators and some very nice level 171 came along in his power armor and swatted them and then wandered off. It was an enjoyable experience.
---
youre also just lying.
---
And the G11 please
---
Tbh ive never had a newbie asking me for stuff, but luckily im not on xbox! I don't envy anyone who has had to put up with a new influx of players!
---
I have it on steam. There's no real advantage buying it anywhere except for the achievements if your into that.
---
That be great if mods could be used on console.  Great idea tho.
---
I'm at 1.3k hours in. It's the only game I've played since I got it in Dec 2018. I just enjoy the game, I enjoy the world. I build, I kill, I loot, I give
---
Yes, please continue to butcher the lore.
---
I'm using the windows store because I can get the 10% off anything else I buy like the Appalachia starter bundle, then another 10-20% if I get a discounted Microsoft gift card.  However, they don't always run all the sales that other stores do, for example I bought the Raiders and Settlers bundle through the Bethesda store during the Quakecon sale because only the console version was discounted in the Microsoft store, not the PC version.
---
I will let my friend know. Thanks.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even bother with builds at that low a level, just play the game and enjoy it. Focus on builds after level 50 at least.
---
We gatta put in 2hours to get resource to play the game lol 
---
You don‚Äôt see an issue here? Just wait til one wasteland where enemy will drop the ammo we use on them
---
I have a couple I'd really use if they had a suppressor.  Reduced vats cost would really balance it out. At least fixer levels considering 10mm puts out lower damage per shot.  Something that's not true irl. But then irl, .308 shits all over .556. .556 is just lighter so you can carry more. One of my favorite quotes goes something like "The decline of America can be traced to the day we switched from a round designed to kill our enemies to one designed to piss them off."
---
Despite that it's considered practically a junk weapon in NW, I loved it for that tiny ADS spread. I went to level 46 just for the Legendary Run points and was always happy to find one.
---
Rocket launcher in fallout 3. Junk jet in fallout 4 wasn't in falllout NV

I missed the wood portion of this? What days was it running?

The tesla armor would be amazeing
---
Piper's outfit and Maxson's battlecoat are both in the game 184 years earlier than where they appear in the canon, so if it's just aesthetics it's probably fine
---
On roguetrader we have scripted timer so it'll mark it as expired, until we get new codes in place, and people can report back that it worked so you can know if it is a good code (or not). 
---
BTW: Rogue is not Rouge :)  One is a rapscallion personality, the other is makeup on a face :D
---
You‚Äôre the man to ask, does the number of little wendy spawns differ solo as opposed to 4+ people?
---
While it‚Äôs a nice idea, the crafting process is already slow/bug enough that I don‚Äôt want them adding anything else.
---
Fair however when you make a questline revolving around them in 76 it will fuck up the lore completely, I agree that a Caesar outfit would be nice or a Lanius

Since they're almost identical. And frankly I think the F3 version is just an upgraded design of the F1 version.
---
The picture in the atomic shop shows the camo on the jet pack but doesn‚Äôt include the plan for what ever power armor jet pack you have
---
Piper's and Maxson's coats are just coats.  
---
You could walk down to any department store and put those outfits together.   
---
They're pretty general.
---
It plays hotel lobby musak
---
I'm not sure. If I'm not using my stealth commando I get swarmed so its hard to tell. I think there is more with more people but I'm not 100% on that
---
Would be cool if people didn't lock their doors, like what are you trying to hide. Not to mention locks only keep honest people out. If I want in I will get in.
---
yeah like cmon we need a little ticker giving us that info
---
Give me red light mod for my Excavator so I can have red eyes on my Communist PA.
---
Yeah but they‚Äôve already said that atom shop stuff isn‚Äôt canon.
---
I haven‚Äôt purchased or read the description for it, but it doesn‚Äôt make sense for it to give you the plan for all jet packs. Essentially the skin is applied to all type of power armors. So if it came with the plan for the jet pack, that means you‚Äôll get the plan for the jet pack for the raider, t-45, t-51, t-60, x-01, and t-65 for free. 
---
Which wouldn‚Äôt make sense because the t-65 you have to buy with gold.
---
I think it comes with the plan to ‚Äúbuild‚Äù the skin jet pack, but not necessarily unlocks the ability to craft a power armor. 
---
Like when you unlock the plan for a weapon, you unlock the ability to craft the gun, but I doesn‚Äôt mean you got the ability to craft all of its mods. 
---
Not too sure, maybe somebody else can give you a better answer. I‚Äôm just trying to piece things together with what I have so far.
---
Lv 449 here and have been looking for a group to consistently do Earl with, I'll send a request when I get home from work.
---
On PS4 I just have messages from randos disabled. Can you not do something similar on Xbox?
---
What? No. That's now how rendering is done. The model would be calculated after a change is made. The number of vertices remains the same, but it's instaniated as one renderable object instead of 21 seperate ones, this is optimization 101. Again, can't increase performance without decreasing fidelity.
---
Yeah, OP can bet his ass that there'll be no more stashes anywhere near my vendors anytime soon.
---
Yes please
---
"Bring back my Free Atoms"   
---
"Give us Enclave cosmetics"  
---
"Low level players are ruining ACP"
---
It is nice to just mindlessly grind xp for the upcoming legendary perks without having to do anything specific.
---
This really speaks volumes of how much of a house of cards this game is. We are afraid of improvements because something entirely unrelated might get broken. Like the Adrenaline perk last patch.
---
Not for any power armour for the t-65 it states it has camo skin and includes the jetpack plan with it
---
Yeah, it is mainly a discussion about the launcher. If there are no downsides to windows store I may stick with it... Or maybe wait some sale.
---
Cosmetics in an MMO are butchering the lore? LMAO
---
The camo is only for the t-65 so wouldn‚Äôt unlock for any other
---
Agreed... I would *love* to get that greenhouse set, but it took me probably... I don't even know, how long has Season 1 been running? I only just finished last week, after completing nearly every daily and every weekly... I do **not** have it in me to play this game 2 - 3 hours every day for *another* eight or so weeks. I need a break, and a chance to actually play *other* games, too...
---
I dont mod my PA lights tho, basic ones
---
&gt; Will we have to rely on dupers
---
Yeah, they'll dupe that shit, piece by piece. NOT.
---
Beth will (once again) tweak the numbers, as always. They can not afford to let any event fail.
---
I love my pistol character. I do need to upgrade my guns though. Nice work!
---
Oh. Like I said I haven‚Äôt checked it out myself. So disregard anything I said.
---
Hopefully !
---
I still owe you 2 nukes ill be there we already friends:)
---
I literally stopped mid-event when i hit 100, shut the game off, and haven't touched it since except to check the atom shop on Tuesday. I missed my family.
---
Hey y'all.

[Send us your suggestions here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76&amp;subject=Suggestion%20to%20add%20to%20the%20Bethesda%20Plz%20wiki%20page&amp;message=Please%20add%20the%20following%20topic%20to%20the%20Bethesda%20Plz%20wiki%20page:%0A%0APlease%20include%20links%20to%203%20well%20received%20recent%20posts%20on%20the%20topic%0A%0A1.%20%0A%0A2.%20%0A%0A3.%20%0A%0AWhy%20it%20should%20be%20added:%0A%0A). Right now, retired posts are reserved for suggestions to add to the game, but if enough people suggestion other things, we'll be more than willing to add them.
---
if they work like the wendigos they drop only ballistic
---
Ahh after looking at it I can see how it seems like this. Pretty deceiving
---
But that‚Äôs not what the description says it says includes the jetpack plan
---
But with legendary perks coming, getting a specific build as a goal by level 50 will then give you access to invest into legendary perks after level 50
---
Meh depends on your opinion for me its worth buying though it might not be for you
---
If it was an accurate BOS Collectron, it would go out and collection technical plans...and then refuse to give them to you.
---
Could we not get the update and then it just doesn't go live for 2 weeks?
---
Other games have done this.
---
I can hope I just want new content.
---
You've played the game.  You sure they're following 'optimization 101'?
---
Yer it‚Äôs completely worded wrong and reads like u get the plan
---
Let's hope so
---
The real answer, there is never too much ammo!
---
But your point still stands.
---
I dislike people using energy weapons at all on that event in particular. I want to loot those meat piles, not stare at empty ash/goo piles that cover 4 piles each and won't go away.
---
you would waste more than 2 hours crafting the amount of ammo that this dude can make with a 2hours run.
---
They haven't said anything yet.
---
Lmao wow,  that's like 96% of this subreddit lol
---
Damn humans.
---
Usually when I play it is hidden to me but my friends can still see it. So idk.
---
They literally never stopped firing. It was just constant explosive spam...So when the stack of scorched appeared they were instantly destroyed.
---
I had to resort to standing in front of them so others could get hits in.
---
I also never saw them reload...
---
There has been no official announcement. There is zero reason to think the game won't be playable on PS5.
---
So true.
---
Especially 2mm, 11k on one Earl run...
---
It's badly worded but it basically is giving you a power armor skin plan for the jetpack mod. If I was you I would contact customer support for a refund saying it wasn't what you expected.
---
I sell stacks of them occassionally for 1 cap and peeps do buy them. 
---
Has a sweet tangy taste that warms you up from the inside. ^  o^
---
They did say patch 22 is coming in september aswell.  It makes sense to send both out at the same time. Hopefully tomorrows ITV will give us more insight
---
I thought all PC players had TFA now? Wasn‚Äôt that announced a month or two ago?
---
The 2hour run are just to get the material to craft , he hasn‚Äôt even started crafting 
---
So yea crafting 2mm vs ultra 2mm is a big difference per craft but not worth the effort 
---
Once one wasteland come out we are going to get ammo reward per kill (base off ammo we use) and legendary perk ammosmith perk will not make it worth it
---
Maybe no challenges?  I wouldn't be surprised with this game if devs forgot about the time in-between and challenges are there but for no good reason!  LOL.  I remember camera challenges when that item got delayed but there were still daily and weekly challenges involving taking pictures!
---
This is one of those things I didn't realize I needed until now.
---
It'll find power armor pieces and lazer rifles but the lock won't be accessible by you
---
I'd stay away from windows store and especially from steam.
---
Steam... If you buy there you'll have 2 (non-interchangeable) wallets, one with Beth and one with steam. If something goes wrong, their CS point at each other and you are standing in middle, left with no recourse but a chargeback.
---
Windows Store aka gamepass... has some special directories where it installs this game, needs also special attention if you don't install on C:. Installing Mods can also be a bit more frustrating as this version has different filenames.
---
Just bite the bullet and use Beth's launcher, less problems overall.
---
150bucks.
---
that picture makes it look like you can. we need to know what happens when you try to build it
---
I really want an update dedicated to new weapons. Bring back a lot of Fallout 3 and New Vegas weapons. We need a lot more viable mid game weapons and I feel like if they added more guns and melee weapons they could really use that to better flush out the balancing. 
---
Even have some small story with it, make it some mercenary merchant company or something or even the brotherhood of steel could bring in new stuff.
---
It would be nice to have more guns across each ammo types as well. Personally I really really dislike the whole Atom shop gun skins. They should add the classic assault rifle. I think its called the G3? Not too sure but that would be awesome.
---
Never have enough of those when I need them most.
---
you might have to just back out of the game and go back in and hope it resets itself :/
---
Wish I could upvote more
---
Well done! I tried soloing it with a J5015 handmade at full health and its difficult, especially without bloodied. To do it with a pistol too is impressive.
---
PUT 'EM BACK IN, BOYS!! HE DIDN'T DO IT!!
---
Oh I have tried that too, no luck :(
---
All but the (community) one I agree with I honestly like hearing the wholesome story's lol.
---
tfa on steam is for steam only, not for the game itself. And even if you use steam you only linked the beth-account to your steam account, thus making the tfa irrelevant if someone finds your Beth-account.
---
Size... on PC the displayed update-size in the launcher has been a bug since the beginning.
---
That‚Äôs hella funny ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ launch a big ass nuke and miss the target.
---
Aww yes I remember this mission.
---
Good to know.
---
Yeah naw, over 1 cap and ur being exceedingly generous to buy it at all.
---
That is if were not confusing stabilized for inert flux.
---
Putting in for a refund
---
I'll add another screenshot, but it says I don't have the required materials. It looks the same as the Captain Cosmos jetpack - greyed out.
---
Literally just bought a BE 10mm and think the same thing. Although if it does have a suppressor it would become very powerful and that‚Äôs why I think they left it out
---
Happened to me on my t65 you'll have to buy the basic x01 jetpack from enclave
---
Yer I am doing cheers
---
How do i even find it. I heard of it but im so baffled and confused
---
Edit: nevermind. I found it. It just took a couple loads of the store to appear
---
God I hate these ones the most. If your leaving just leave WTF you making a post for just go smh
---
Do you actually own the plan to make the jetpack for that specific armor. I know free states is bugged and can be applied without the plan?
---
100 levels again!  FUCK!
---
Have you ever fired a 10mm?
---
They have recoil.
---
Yeah...
---
I'm waiting until one wasteland. Uranium Fever with level 50 mole miners will make it much more profitable
---
Having finished and had some time to step away, I honestly can say I have mixed feelings on seasons. At first, they gave me a renewed sense of purpose in the game, something to do. And it timed nicely with the public team revamp. 
---
About halfway through, the challenges continued to repeat, and staleness started setting in. But in for a penny and in for a pound, with not much else going on in the game, so onward. Hitting ranks 80-90, my attitude started to sour. It truly felt like grinding, especially with the end in reach. It was here that it occurred to me shorter seasons might be better. The finish was about as exciting as a mortician acting as a party DJ, which didn‚Äôt improve my view of the Run. I just felt a little burnt out, relieved and accomplished, but a bit grumpy all at once. It was a really weird thing for me.
---
Yesterday, I logged in a tinkered with the camp. I looked at the map at the same old events. I looked at the daily quest log. And I just turned the game off. I‚Äôm not ready for another season, not ready to repeat the same activities over and over like Groundhog Day. At the same time, I‚Äôm not fully ready to walk away from the game. I‚Äôm ready for the BoS DLC. Or any DLC that makes this feel like a Fallout game and not a mobile time waster.
---
TL;DR ... Legendary Run left me in a really weird love/hate mood with this game.
---
Nah, I was just riffing on those posts I see all the time. I've been playing since the beta.
---
Wendigo cave is my go to spot.
---
Thanks man ü§ò
---
Wotoga, under the road there is a large tunnel with tons
---
The toxic dump place with the two deathckaws in the cave you go to for the enclave mission, east of harpers ferry
---

F
---
Thanks, this is just what I wanted to know. I may stick with Bethesda after I decide to buy the game than.
---
I have some atom points tho. Will I lose it changing to Bethesda?
---
I would really just love to have some lines from her that reference events in the game.
---
hmmmm...what about taking the piece of armor off your power frame and reputting it back on? Idk I've had issues like this with my strangler armor and I'll have to manually use the armor station just to do anything and reapply things, then again I am on console and this bug could be a PC only thing
---
Are they wrong tho
---
You can't ttade T-65 armor
---
ohhhh that could be...
---
#Flounce!!!
---
Oh good tip I will go get the plan and try that.
---
"Low levels shouldn't be able to join the event"

This pisses me a lot. But mods should make megathreads for things like this, because there's a lot of recurrent stuff.
---
Best place for stabilizing agents is still WS, nearly 60 bloaters there and ws is faster to farm. Use nades to lure the mobs together and then slaughter them.
---
What's a toxic larry??

Something like [XB1] W: Modding service for me Ultracite Galtlin laset H: Caps/ammo(if you have any 5.56 or .45.

"I grinded the hell out of the Legendary Run because some math expert told me that I couldn't finish it in time and now I'm not getting anything extra for playing the actual game"
---
Yeah. We know it's a problem. But just emote him and keep going or something.
---
i'm only wanting the 2 glasshouse plans, so the rest is all bonus to me. though that jetpack looks pretty fly on the xo1 suit
---
This might be the mod's work. To make a megathread about some of these posts.
---
There‚Äôs a jangles the moon monkey and a stuffed panda on top of Seneca rocks with astropanda written in the wall next to them
---
Everytime I go to someone's camp that has that door, I open it just to have it slammed in my face &amp; I have to open it again. It is somewhat broken.
---
While we're on this topic, that fireplace door at the end of the Legendary Run... I can't seem to put it anywhere.
---
Also Todd everywhere.
---
Two of them in the Glassed Cavern.  I'd expect people are too busy not dying to notice.
---
Down in the underground lake area, there is a teddy bear rescue scene.  One bear is a couple feet out in the water, half submerged.  Another bear in a miner helmet is reaching out with a pickaxe to retrieve him.
---
Then, at the exit cavern (the one with the elevator), there's an old brass mining lantern and the word [PLUGH](http://www.plugh.com/) spelled out in alphabet blocks.  I guess some Bethesda designer was a fan of ancient text adventure games.
---
Also, in one of the cupolas in the Palace of the Winding Path, there's some crayon drawings and a note from a little girl that lived there.  To the side is a stack of three teddy bears, as a nod to Ice Bear, Panda and Grizzly in their [bear stack](https://webarebears.fandom.com/wiki/The_Bears/Bear_Stack) in the cartoon "We Bare Bears."
---
Edit: Was also going to add the two white-coated scientist bears preparing to launch Jangles from the top of the giant Rollins Labor Camp walking crane, with aid of gasoline, a fuse and a toy rocket.  But it looks like that one is common enough to even [appear in the Wiki](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Rollins_labor_camp).
---
They only spawn when a player is doing the quest afaik.
---
If you run with a bloat fly syringer you can keep infecting the fly that spawns for .ore chances at glands.
---
Also good if doing stings and things to use on the bu HD s ur already killing to avoid going out of your way for bloatflies
---
Split in opinion on this one. For things like the pipe pistols and fat man, they have parts with durability issues. For other things like handmade, hunting rifle, and 10mm, maintenance and cleaning are a big part of it. In the forces im sure you know well the exhaustive hours spent cleaning a rifle for turn in to the armory and the dicks not wanting any more oil or less than they subjectively want. Then you have like the gatlings and mini guns, that have wear on batteries thay we dont actually repair or gears and motors. Finally the lmg barrel has a set round expended life when we swap them out. 
---
Not everything breaks, but at the same time maintenance and repair are part if it.
---
Did some looking project bravo goes until the 10th so doubt BOS will arrive before thats finished... but also meat week second week is set for the 22nd and last time meat week and new content had the same date they staggered it. So now I'm really curious as to what they will do.
---
"I'm 50.000 hours into this game and I'M PISSED OF IT!!!"
---
Last I checked .50 cal was a ballistic round.  Do you know if high voltage hefe works on heavies?
---
Thx alot for the help!
---
any of the abandoned bunkers have them and there's also the Sunday Brothers farm in there cellar plus the basement where you go for the daily quest "Forbidden Knowledge" that i know off the top of my head so far
---
There's no such thing as enough ammo in this game.
---
It didn't go in, it just impacted on the surface.
---
Oh yeah sorry I misinterpreted your comment.
---
apparently it's tied to framerate and latency as well. so if you can't maintain a steady 60 FPS, or if your internet is bad, it won't trigger as easily or at all.
---
I tried a bunch of them but can't seem to trigger the magic damage on bosses. my rig can maintain a steady framerate, so I blame my internet.
---
Oh gotcha that kinda sucks
---
That's the part with the 2 wallets, yes.
---
Atoms and F1st are not transferable between these launchers. Quite a bad joke actually. But it is what it is.
---
but they just added a system in the game for making public teams with people to play with them.. &gt;.&gt;
---
It doesn't get stronger. Having the perk on your armor turns whatever shotgun you have into a magic shotgun.
---
Anything related to stash/storage or CAMP budget.
---
Yes.
---
Aw wut? I just started using that perk &amp; it's broken? How so?
---
Ive seen people nuke scorchebeast area, and the Colossus event still popped ? doesnt all nukes wake it up ?
---
No one joins or fast travels to me
---
Hate not being able to use the sights on anything when using chameleon armour
---
I like that
---
I‚Äôd speculate you have found SS armor has a high asbestos requirement, thus the need to start looting cig. Packs and cartons.
---
The joys of discovery ;)
---
Yup the old auto complete bug. Costumer support won't do anything for you either. Sadly you're just sol today
---
This could likely be my problem as well, then. I haven't really noticed many performance issues with my internet while on 76, but it's certainly possible.
---
The Blue Ridge side tunnels have around 20. Just run the "Riding Shotgun" event with green thumb equipped
---
There was and might still be an exploit where one could buy 300 gold exit the wayward reenter and buy it again if that's been patched or not IDK. Worth a shot if you ask me
---
"TO THE PERSON THAT tickled my balls while I was asleep at my camp..."
---
You're not the only one. Loads of people have had this issue. Sucks man.
---
Nope single ammo is because it's the cheapest thing to satisfy your daily score challenge.
---
It's not so bad if you go half bloodied and stay stealthed.
---
same, i once had a lag spike for the colossal event so hard it made the whole ground go fuzzy and pixelated and I literally couldnt have my character steadily aim at Earle or any of the spawns :(
---
Steam is the best game launcher for a multitude of reasons, many legitimate sites such as fanatical, humble or greenmangaming often have sales on fallout 76 and those will most likely be for the Bethesda launcher version.  As someone who has who used the beth launcher for a few games I can say without hesitation that it's not good but still better than uplay...but that isn't saying too much
---
D
---
Next to the Service entrance at Whitespring, take a right. That's my spot.
---
How did it taste?
---
Of course it's some asshole stop-having-fun guy.
---
So I take it the Camo Paint is exactly like this again? Where it's a mod instead of an actual paint option and the jetpack can overlap with other jetpacks? Haven't bought the Camo Paint to do the testing myself
---
There are 4 or 5 in the Rusty Pick.
---
Remember to equip Green Thumb perk
---
I hope so. I dont want to be spending 500 atoms on a collectron station
---
I was so excited to have a cap sink when WL came out as i had ran out of plans to buy and Player Vendors have shit (or very overpriced). But there was nothing to buy apart from bow/crossbow mod plans and thanks to a Wandering Trader i knocked most of those out second day. And Smiley but with the limit im usually close to max caps again a few days later.
---
That's something a raider would ask.
---
This gets posted every single day.......WE ARE ALL AWARE THIS IS HAPPENING.
---
I feel like this issue stems from the console player base most likely being mostly younger players.
---
Though it does worry me what will happen if pc ever gets text chat lol
---
Behind Whitespring resort where the secret entrance to the enclave bunker is. There‚Äôs a couple of dumpsters overflowing with corpses. Tons of brain fungus there.
---
it's currently a bug
---
‚ÄúRemove legacy weapons, they are too OP. Pls Bethesda.‚Äù
---
Proves how lucky a player you are.
---
my game runs pretty smooth as well, at least in private. but it's more about latency.
---
I'm not American or European so as you can probably guess there's a lot of latency between me and their servers.
---
Fallout 76? 
---
More like Fallout Ultimate. Everything is here!
---
have you ever messaged them? then again I'm a 200+ and if i message people they usually will come to my aid üòÖ lol
---
There was a short time recently where the Vault 94 Scout Mask didn't have the leaves attached to it.
---
Always picked clean already when I go looking for it.
---
I wasn't aware of this, figured since it was a team perk, there would have to be 1 person besides me on the team. I do run a maxed out Class Freak, so might as well use both mutations in that case. I'm always in a public team, even if alone.. so these should help out a fair bit. 
---
Thank you for explaining, appreciate it. Gonna make the serums as soon as I get on.
---
The amount of quality of life improvements that could be made to this game is insane, you can tell it was just slap some mechanics together and move on. No real detail or thought was put into finer aspects, at least that's how I see it maybe I'm just hating too much lol
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not even level 40 lol
---
Why isn't you magic weapon outperforming a bloodied? No idea
---
No worries at all!
---
Not to put you down, but Instigating mini gun is a pretty trash legendary. Especially against the queen where she has full health for .001 seconds before someone damages her. Instigating is only really good on high damage per guy weapons like a super sledge...
---
I like helping other players and I give away a lot of decent guns - cap value 1k to 10k and ammo and stims.  I've done everything and helping players is my end game.  
---
But there is a limit.  No, I'm not gonna give you a legacy or a BE fixer and quit asking for steel or other basic junk every time you're on.  One guy I helped keeps coming back and putting a 1 star script weapon at 0 caps and requesting a god tier gun (blocked)
---
True even more as it missed that close lmao
---
Poor fellow dweller
---
That's kind of the thing.  From a strict probability standpoint, the Red Asylum Dress probably is one of the rarest, if not the rarest.  But it follows that the rarest things also tend to be the most duped.
---
They fixed it, was a prior bug that up could get all the holiday nuclear winter gear.
---
Behind Whitesprings near the service entrance there are some dumpsters and there‚Äôs lots of brain fungus there
---
The whole point of the season was to move away from rewarding large sums of atoms to players. I doubt very seriously Bethesda is going to add challenges that reward atoms between seasons. 
---
Their goal is to encourage spending for atoms, to make more money.
---
Nice one :)
---
They already said Combat Rifle skins will work for The Fixer in the future
---
That's good then, gonna have to use both Herd Mentality and Empath.. Seem like 2 good mutations if it's that easy to proc. Thank you very much!
---
I've noticed that a fair few descriptions are wrong in 76, so it's nice that players explain it to others to spread awareness.
---
I'm not on discord but maybe thats what I need to do. Thank you
---
Thank you good sir. If I had the caps I pay you for your service
---
"There's literally nothing to do now I am taking a long break from this game it really opened my eyes to how much of a grind this while thing is ugh ugh Bethesda bad no make fun game me done but me be back for next one so can complain more hurr hurr."
---
Must be a console exclusive thing. Don't get any beggars on PC. Only time in 500 hours I've been asked for something was during ACP because the dude ran out of ammo.
---
Toxic Larry‚Äôs meat and go. North east of Berkeley springs. 3 snally spawns.
---
it's a magic weapon my dude
---
I take it you haven't seen/heard about "magic" weapons, then?
---
I'm aware that Instigating, as a perk, is trash for low damage-per-shot weapons. Not sure if you noticed the part about me usually using a Bloodied 50 Cal?
---
But Instigating is one of the primary perks that makes a weapon "magic". Just wondering why I can't seem to get mine to work that way.
---
This one always confuses me. I mean, a big message pops up in the middle of the screen and you have to confirm that you want to take the risk. If you click "yes" then you shouldn't get all butthurt when someone kills you and takes your stuff.
---
if i was on PS id help you in a heart attack with my strangler heavy junkie gauss minigun build lol
---
Love the 10mm SMG it doesn't get enough love. First one i got was a TS FFR thing was great close quarters but had no long range. Then i found a AA FFR in a vendor for 2K Caps it was a no brainier and i love the thing (named it Fury). Found a AAE for 1K shortly after (Tempest) and its my Tagging weapon (that still does OK on its own).
---
Not anymore. It just didn‚Äôt do anything previously
---
If I had a nickle for every time a nuke dropped when I was about to go to bed.
---
My circadian rhythm is like a box of hammers falling down some stairs now.
---
I‚Äôm for this as I have 5,000 bullion and nothing to spend it on, but if I could buy rep with it, I would shamelessly throw gold into that deposit box.
---
Not now. Last patch, July's patch, broke it. August patch fixed it and it's working again.
---
Why so much INT?
---
Just give us a station where there‚Äôs no person talking, like there was in NV
---
This is I think the problem with what‚Äôs going on. 
---
Dailies and weeklies only give SCORE points during the season. Once the season is done I doubt there will be dailies or weeklies during the break between seasons

Nerd rage and demolition..
---
Yeah kinda forgot demolition
---
Ah thank goodness, otherwise a waste of 5 perk points. Thanks for clearing that up üëç
---
Your lag spike sounds like it should be named "Tesla"
---
Amazing lol. I love that spot I have no idea why people don't hide there two people at each end is perfect you don't get flanked by the wendingo mobs
---
Meh I like having a radio host. I liked how Mr. NV would comment on recent quests you completed
---
Has gotten to where I just buy bulked Aluminum and lead from venders now to avoid having to drop everything to farm it.
---
Yeah feels like an OCD. Can‚Äôt stand to see if there are some turrets or else out of order.
---
Big Bend Tunnel is full of the stuff, go into the side passages and you can get more than you'll use before it goes bad.
---
Basically how magic works is their is two kinds. The first one: any gun that shoots multiple projectiles is classed as a magic weapon with the right roles of course. This includes shotguns. Harpoons with flechette rounds and even the laser rifle with beam splitter. With shoguns/harpoon, to get the best damage per shot you want to VATS.
---
For Heavy weapons, the best way to get the magic effect to work, you need your fire rate above 200, the higher the damage the better the magic effect will kick in. So heavy gunner perks and if a blooded or junkie build use one of them Heavies. You need to shoot the same limb out of VATS to get the rubber banding to take place. Missing a bullet with reset the magic effect! 
---
Frame rate is taken into consideration but everyone should always be fine with this as long as you are in and open world and there‚Äôs loads of people at the event with you.
---
I hope this helps. If you need any more details or have questions, you can ask! Enjoy your day

Yes, for first members they have something free for this week, but online first member -. -
---
Oh its a snarlygast hangout?
---
Yeah but in NV there was a secondary station where no host talked. Mr new vegas was actually a good host though so I only used it when Johnny guitar was playing
---
I found a mr.fuzzy In a bus driver seat like its driving wearing a clown hat with magic spelled out in the letter blocks. this is currently my favorite part loading screen.
---
Also, theres a mad hatter reference at the tea stand. sadly it's a bowler hat not a top hat and a piece of paper with the 10/6 that would have been in his hat
---
A gnome with a wrench inside a computer like its fixing it
---
jangles golfing, gnome under a patient's bed in fort defiance, gnome wearing goggles holding a harmonica at top of the world...I can keep going about lawn gnomes and other stuff but it will take away the fun when you find it.
---
Welcome to the club.

2022
---
Magic trash is magic.
---
I also have this doubt. I have already tested junkie, instigating, medic, 50 limd damage weapons and none of them showed ‚Äúmagic‚Äù damage.
---
Actually, if I may, you should check out the peace keepers of Appalachia. We are like minded individuals and we are here to help. Check out the sub at pkoa :) 
---
If that‚Äôs not your style, what‚Äôs your psn? I‚Äôll add you straight away.
---
It's also a combo of the lower cost of entry and how much they trust their kids that has parents buy their little shits a console. A kid is a lot more likely to have access to a $400-500 console than a gaming PC they can easily get into trouble on.
---
They said that you will have the option of locking it
---
What do you mean chief ?  How to build what I mentioned or that I don't have a problem turning on or off a radio whilst in CAMP(although, the appliences should work far better and have choice of station)
---
Thank you for your thoughtful and informative reply. Cheers!
---
So, Cursed Fletchette Harpoon Guns are magic... interesting. Might be fun to try with Quick Hands (or the weapon swap glitch). Just for funsies.
---
I don't know man I switched to glatning plasma man the ammos easy to craft and mods are easy to find
---
It's happened more than once. Had a couple of kids I was shepherding along. Helped them out until they'd been playing long enough to be self sufficient and stopped giving them anything. Made them either buy it or trade for it. Haven't seen them on since I did that. Oh well.
---
Yes!   So annoying.
---
imagine playing an M rated violence oriented RPG with a young child
---
In huntersville there‚Äôs a gnome burying jangles and also a group of gnomes hiding in a doghouse
---
I just hate posts that complain about other posts or seek to dictate what others can contribute.  It is my answer to your question.  Normally I just downvote and move on from topics I don't like or block toxic users, which I will do in your case.  Bye Felicia.

Just joined

I believe Angry Turtle crossed out Medics on one of his more recent video (thumbnails).

I think it come out today around 5pm
---
Be sure to Introduce yourself!!
---
The flamethrower thing. Elaborate on that.
---
Never happened to me on ps4
---
Service rifle and recharger pistol from New Vegas would be awesome. Or the assault rifle from FO3
---
non subscribers don't see the new items though.
---
That's another sign of a potential trap camp.  Sell junk/scrap, wait for someone to buy it, then trigger the trap to reclaim the junk. Come away with caps and scrap. Rinse and repeat.  Having a handy stash box nearby could cost them their bait scrap items, as well as any that the victim might already be carrying.  Moral: Always stash your scrap before you go on a shopping spree, and pay attention to your surroundings if you're buying scrap in particular.
---
Ah, thanks for the info, confused me it did, does it still let people do the event ?
---
I know it wasn‚Äôt called a vault 94 mask. It‚Äôs a completely diff mask cause someone showed me one before and the vault 94 mask was already a thing. It‚Äôs called something else i just forgot what it was. I think it‚Äôs desert scout?
---
I have this same experience.  I have all kinds of supposed "magic" weapons and I cant get it to work either.
---
That and now the new thing is to shoot pot shots at me while I'm doing a quest, then I turn around and their waving....
---
I'm on a quest leave me alone. More shots.
---
Depends on what you have and what you want to do. I saved all of my troubleshooters armor for a set to do encryptid and run silos. Sometimes, if im overencumbered and my stash is full, and out of scrip, I just drop them on the floor.
---
I'm saying that basic energy weapons are terrible because of a bug, and explosive energy weapons are amazing because of a bug.

It's more likely he is reacting to whoever is getting his agro.

Been finding lately that the only sneak perk I really need is escape artist. The rest feel redundant. 
---
I enjoy sprinting around too much too. Sprint around a corner, duck, them go back to killing.
---
Sweet so I can get it after work
---
Well, from the beginning we were told ‚Äúshelters‚Äù so it was pretty clear we were getting underground spaces. And what you are asking for, though it would be interesting to work with, is kinda ridiculous when you think about it. Floating camps are bad enough If that happened, you would start to see 1x1 sheds with a door, with a massive mansion on the inside. With an instanced location, they can‚Äôt just calculate how much space would make sense to be behind the door. It has to be set.
---
Not a perfect solution, but eventually you‚Äôll get a feel for how much ammo you‚Äôre making based on how much gunpowder you have, or how many times you hit the craft button.
---
No?
---
Who in their right mind thinks that making pistols the same as rifles is a good idea? It takes upwards of 15 levels in Perception if you wanna squeeze every last drop out of your available perks for rifles. And if you want to run another weapon, agility is easily your second highest stat if you're doing VATS. Putting pistols in perception would mean it's all or nothing on either rifles or pistols and that's a no.
---
No problem! Always good to check after each update. Never know when your loadout is going to be completely useless for no reason
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one questioning it.
---
i was using my junkies, bloodied, and furious gauss miniguns too which probably didn't help with the lagging üòÇ and yeah it was so bad I literally could just touch my analog stick and my characters camera would slowly inch to where i moved it to üòÖ
---
Oh really cheers
---
Not true about them only spawning during the quest.
---
They also spawn when Heart of the Swamp is going. I think the event has to actually be running, not just available. I've gone many times, some just this week, when the event is running and collected Strangler Blooms. I've currently got over 100 radshields.
---
Soooo....you have been blind drunk for the last couple of months then?
---
I will be putting this to good use. Thank you for the idea. I recently had a random message me demanding a gun. It was the first time it happened to me, but it seems like it's happening to a lot of people and that I can look forward to more of it in the future. This probably a side effect of 76 being put on the Microsoft game pass.
---
A clean chemistry workbench would be amazing.
---
Same
---
People actually ask that?  That's kind of astounding.  They must be brand new, without any alternate stash plans or CAMP building experience.  Hopefully they only have to ask once.
---
I fully agree with you.  I scatter around all sorts of stash boxes in the form of trash cans, lockers, crates, tool boxes and such.  Those things make the camp look lived in.  The big blue toy box sticks out like a sore thumb.
---
So someone has to be running the event for the blooms to open. Do they open around the even itself or by dyer
---
I plan to use it all up pretty much as soon as I obtain it,&amp; Holy Moly,you guys are the frickin best!!!
---
I posted,ran up too the store,came back &amp; checked,&amp; ya‚Äôll dropped many a bomb of knowledge!
---
TY all soo much,made a guys day!
---
May yer ammo be plenty &amp; yer carry weight always be light!
---
Nonviolent playstyle is hardly niche in the Fallout community.
---
He's spending 2 hours just to get the flux, mass, and fluids. Not even for the steel and lead materials required. To get those that's a shit ton of scraping weapons (Line in the Sand is great for this) and a few runs of Lucky Hole. Easily another hour and a half.
---
That's 3.5-4 hours of grind to make ammo for a gaus minigun which might survive 2 ACPs and a Scorched Earth.
---
The way to see if your gun is showing the magic effect with shotguns/harpoons is shoot an enemy and if random different damage numbers are showing. That means the gun is magic. For example if to shoot the shotgun once and every pellet of the shot shows 50 it‚Äôs not magics but if it shows 75 64 93 for example.m, then it‚Äôs magic. 
---
Another way to turn any shotgun or harpoon with any role on the weapon into a magic weapon. Equip one armour piece with a role that‚Äôs 15% blocking damage and the gun will become magic.
---
Well... it shoots twice.
---
Lmao pretty much. It started as a fun little drinking game... now it‚Äôs a daily challenge that won‚Äôt auto complete!
---
Wooden blocks spelling REDRUM next to a kid's tricycle on the balcony of the second floor of Torrance Manor (reference to "The Shining")
---
You could take nonviolent peaceful approaches in almost every Fallout game up to this point. This is a Fallout game.

September 29
---
"can people stop using teslas at ACP my xbox sucks and cant handle it" I like this one tbf as I hate consoles :P
---
I mean it's only so "free" when you pay for the subscription
---
Lol hahah was that what I saw yesterday? I saw a nuke launching and I'm like bro....thats not where it goes. Then went about my day raping, and plundering corn.
---
The auto completing score should never be silenced.  This is a horrible bug and I personally want everyone who encounters it to post about it
---
I did the level ups but on new alt characters. Hopefully i can skip all that if they keep the extra challenges on the dailies and keep doing double score in the following seasons.
---
Good luck with it, I'm sure if you ask someone will build you a door for testing, they can always scrap it if you don't like it üòÇ
---
That's when you give them a "you have been insulted".
---
Well you can but it's a lot of work for a small pay off. You can make it to where only friends can send you messages and invites.
---
A silencer for my instigating explosive 10MM sub would be a game changer.  Yes X 1000!
---
There's exploits on console but no hackers.
---
I wish I would have had one a few minutes ago.  Right after I nuked Monogah we got a world shutdown notice and I had only 2 minutes to kill earl.  I tried to magic the shit out of him but it didnt work.
---
I would only use it where appropriate but none of it works for me.
---
You or other people are doing a lot of damage to him I think. He usually follows that highest damage person around. But can bounce if it changes. I‚Äôm a bloodied heavy, usually do this fight at 30% instead of 20%. I usually have him target me the whole time. If someone else pulls him from me, I usually can pull him back to me by radiating myself down to 20% so I benefit from nerf rage damage.
---
It could also be that he‚Äôs coming after me due to health being low, so he can finish me off. Hard to say.
---
Riflemen are broken. They're fun for everyday tasks and questing, but broken in any kind of high level/difficult task, not only when you solo bosses. It's very hard for an average rifleman to pass the damage threshold on SBQ. Maybe with great gear and a great bloodied build you can do it consistently, but as a casual player with average gear it's difficult. I've been a rifleman from 1 to lvl 58. I've done like 12 or so SBQs as a rifleman and got zero loot on 10 of them.  Then changed build to commando and it's the other way around. It's hard NOT to pass the threshold.
---
And, mind you, I'm using the exact same weapons as before, but with automatic receivers instead of semi-auto. A two shot handmade and a fixer.
---
My experience is that Rifleman is great fun and challenging for leveling, but they're not rewarding nor fun on the endgame.
---
Never had this happen, that is the only time am grateful for not having any chat on PC.
---
Most of it fits in just fine
---
Coming soon to Fallout 1st +
---
Wait really üò±
---
Who would have thought?! /s
---
Okay! That makes sense. I appreciate your input!
---
Same steel is easy to get and just walk though lucky hole mine with excavator for lead easy 300+ when I make 2mm cells I usually get about 2500 each time
---
Who the fuck is Felicia?
---
I could see it now
---
That first part is good to know. I knew about the blocking damage but, as I run power armor, having the wepons carry the perks is more beneficial to me.
---
I tried decrypting the codes once for my first nuke ever back in 2018. Got it wrong. Never tried again.
---
Some Fallout 3 armours and clothing would be cool, like the mechanics variant of the vault suits
---
It depends on your goals.  There are a fair number of "get the object from the chest" quests the could be solved with stealth and pacifying feats.  Exploring without killing things straightforward, if not easy.  You won't be doing any endgame stuff but it doesn't sound like that's your goal anyway.
---
It's fucked everytime I want a different server Beth throws me back on the same one.  If I just want to refresh the server or restart the game because it bugged the fuck out I get thrown on a different one.
---
Damn! That's a lot of flux! It would have been funny to give them what they asked for, except in raw flux.
---
I meant to tag a Bethesda employee with this question. [u/LadyDevAnn](https://www.reddit.com/u/LadyDevAnn)  could you pass on that we would like some indication of how much time a server or world has left?  I just lost a nuke to a shutdown I didnt know was imminent.
---
theres also a bowler hat, and a little sliver of paper that says 10/6 which is the note tucked in mad hatters hat.
---
Yeah I stayed till the very end and picked up all of the piles from the wendigos which was kind of nice. I used a junkies ultracited gatling gun for probably 3 minutes and switched to a gatling plasma so when I picked up all of the meat piles I ended up having 2k more ammo then I started with.
---
Yeah 2 hour run we are making the ammo while he's on the run to get the ammo lol
---
You can't just keep doing it,  it has to come around as a chosen item in your dalies.
---
Unless you mean it says to speak to Zack and THEN he doesn't complete it.
---
From what i see from other camps...it fools nobody. I would just like to play with it a lil bit.
---
How many times did you do Dross Toss? Only the very first time does Camden park trigger all 3 attractions. After that, every day only one of the dailies will be available.
---
Why? From the standpoint of keeping people logged on and grinding constantly, that would work out in Bethesda's favor to award Atoms to those who've finished the run and are still doing their dailies.
---
Never seen a begger on PC must be xbox 10 years old I'm presuming? Edit: after reading further I kinda wish this was a thing on PC I would have so much fun fucking with them when I'm not busy hoarding junk.
---
I normally make 5000 at a time farming lead ore and for steel I just scrap the weapons from public events
---
Is the only way to take some good out of a bad situation.
---
And they broke the power armor station in Crater with the last patch. It rotated 90 degrees because I guess it just works?
---
You have to get the executive keycard from the hornright hq to access that elevator.
---
I have said they need to give scrapbox to everyone then give us an ammo box.  I like it.
---
Thanks! I'm relieved that I didn't unintentionally cause a bug or something in the fight. I had just never experienced anything like that before and was worried I'd screwed it up for everyone else there.
---
They posted that a hot fix was implemented and that it would shut down some game worlds temporarily. So I don't think this was a server timing out.
---
That was awesome! I always wondered does lone wonderer still work if you are on a public team. ü§î
---
Have we seen leaks of what the Red Viper stuff looks like?
---
Thx!
---
Oh that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg here lol
---
If it had led to more armor variants pre-launch I would have been fine with them not changing anything. 
---
At this point, I‚Äôm just hoping they release more gear that looks as nice as the reclaimed mining helmet. Limited options is more important than mild design-lore oversights imo
---
Steel dawn fatigues are live.
---
The defence list in the Workshop menu has a flame-thrower. You'll need the appropriate perks to be able to build it(I just put up with swapping in and out all the ones you need to make building easy and possible).
---
Set up what you want to merge, this time a small radio and jukebox, for example. You use the Flame-thrower trap to destroy the first item(you recall seeing a transparent outline of an item in CAMP you may return to find destroyed before ?) So leave that in place...build over it, leaving say the front of the little radio outside the rear of the jukebox and place said jukebox. Then you'll see the text promp to repair the little radio...do so as with it being destroyed, it can now be 'merged' simply by repairing !
---
Don't know what you've seen in other creative CAMPs, but this is how folk merge items...obviously, you'd have to repeat the process if moving, but that's the way it is.
---
What got me wanting to learn that was seeing a guy who had this L-shapped couch. I was like, WTF ??!  He had put two together by using the flame-thrower and I eventually saw how through a friend who is a dedicated builder who has a YouTube channel.
---
Vendor apparel/armor  
---
"Is anyone else having this issue?"  
---
Currency limits  
---
Daily timers  
---
One-shotting anything  
---
"Why is it green if i can't place it?"  
---
"Ammo converter sucks."  
---
All valid issues, bit i think we could use a "Frequently-mentioned issues" sticky/megathread.
---
Truth.  Have to rely solely on VATS when cloaked.
---
I posted on the group post a joke abt radiation and a guy messaged me asking if i own a b2525 fixer and i said no so he got mad saying i shouldnt post on the official club if im not willing give up a gun i dont even own.
---
Here‚Äôs to hoping they release skins for said pieces in the shop to make up for it. I don‚Äôt mind it it‚Äôs just a minor thing to me. It doesn‚Äôt hamper me enjoyment of the game at all.
---
I mean, good idea, but there is still people complaining that the Scrapbox is pay to win..
---
Also I love the new armor bench skin, and glad they added it.
---
I think they dont care about armor visuals because most people wear outfits over them.  Team is to small to even keep up with bugs would be a waste of resources now.  I do agree some localization would have been nice on the front end.
---
This would cost them money, which they hate losing.
---
There is a radroach in a bathroom sitting cross-legged on a toilet holding a cane wearing a tophat.  Looted a wedding ring off it
---
If your on PC I have a pile of caps for you
---
I‚Äôll give WS a shot
---
Do you really think Bethesda will pass up a chance to sell console players the same game again? I'd say it will be playable as part of the backwards compatibility then they will re-release with improved performance at some point.
---
Exactly, also ended up with around 200-300 screws so it  can be good for farming ammo and caps (if you sell all of the stims and waters you get from it).
---
Can we get a 3 rnd burst?
---
Can herd mentality be used instead of class freak then does it reduce all the negative effects in the same way?
---
at level 7 go to Morgantown trainyard then Morgantown airport (the backpack plan is in the airport terminal top floor, grey box). plenty of enemies here and they will drop guns and ammo. work benches all over and the train station is nearby. scrap guns to learn mods and if you can get/make a hunting rifle with a silencer on it, then use  sneak attacks for double damage. also check map constantly for an event spawning at the ferris wheel top left called leader of the pack as it will give you 3 legendary's your level.
---
Good to know I guess.  Where was this posted?  It wasn't on the main screen.  I still think this would be helpful for when world's shutdown on their own.
---
LW dont work on a public team. I swap to rank 3 inspirational and 1 rank of strange in numbers (also share it) when on a team
---
I fucking jinxed myself, I just accidentally played through the reset and all but two of my dailys are done already.
---
If only I could believe that üòÇ
---
I like the bench too and thanks
---
So true!  I only just found out Gunsmith and White Knight are broken, at least in terms of slowing down breakage of weapons and armour.
---
Same happened to me
---
The high rad fluids are the worst for me, always have surplus of the others.
---
I would love to see a clean arktos chemistry bench, and a free states tinker bench
---
Yeah, I think my strength build will go unarmed instead of heavy guns from now on when it's time to kill that bullet spongy a#$&amp;+@_$.

X01 and scout armor mods, serum recipies, enclave weapons and mods...
---
I have it I‚Äôve already met with penelope but for some reason it‚Äôs not letting me back in
---
I wonder if they could do this for aid too (not that I want it or something). I would like to know how the community would react to infinite storage for ammo and medical supply
---
Thanks.  I'll keep my eyes open.
---
Great, just need to pay for Fallout 1st to get decent amounts of the stabilizing resources! /s
---
Its because the game is free or very cheap on game pass so all the obnoxious kids will get it.
---
Scroll down a bit further. It was Aug 27-31.
---
The concern with current gen games not becoming next gen for PS5 is for past old titles. Even gta 5 is going next gen,meaning it‚Äôs been supported on 3 consoles now. No reason to think the company that mastered the ‚Äúspecial edition‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt produce a game title for this. Or just join the Xbox gang and look forward to a free next gen update.
---
Thanks wendy for clarifying this i was thinking it was some sort of glitch now i know the game is full of cheap asses lol.. Im normally capped out and enjoy sharing the wealth w other players for that challenge
---
Thanks m8! I‚Äôll try this as soon as I‚Äôm able to.
---
Its because the game is free through game pass on xbox.
---
Sometimes the keycard disappears from your inventory after meering her, check to see if its still there. I had it happen to me.
---
Are people aware of just HOW MANY "The Shining" references are in this game? It's many.
---
Feel like both scrap and ammo should simply be weightless for everyone.
---
Since i know thats not going to happen i like the idea
---
Ultimately I'd rather have the Choice between looting the spawns and running out so long as I still get those end event drops.
---
Been having to tell my friend to slow down on earl and take his time to loot the spawns he downs.
---
Since between the 2 of us we usually have the event on lockdown, and his gauss minigun is much hungrier than my gauss shotgun.
---
Sorry mr.cricket I have a 5th gen i7 and a gtx1070 not sure how my p.c will do with 76.i play on xbox1x at the moment
---
I figured, why don't you use bodyguards instead of inspirational?
---
It's available. I'm wearing it now
---
Yep cause its free on gamepass so all the little kids get it.
---
Still there
---
There are at least a dozen pa spawn points in the forest.  
---
since you cannot equip what you have on a frame, it is just taking up space in your stash that can likely be used for something else.
---
Thank you i appreciate it
---
I don‚Äôt know why and I pray me saying this on reddit doesn‚Äôt reverse it but I have been able to join private servers, use my scrapbox, and use my tent even after my subscription expired. I got it for 1 month back in april and I still use everything. Not bad for $12 lol
---
Neither, you get a skin plan for the jetpack for free. You still need to buy the t-65 jetpack with bullion to be able to use it.
---
I've had the same for wks it's been in my daily list every day I play I go talk to him hoping it will complete but nope the other 2 there always come up and complete no problem it's a bug I guess they'll get around to fixing it at some point.
---
Sorry to hear that. Don't panic...there are still 5 or is it 6 days of doubles left.
---
Little tip - set an alarm. I set an alarm on my pad, it's very easy to play through...and you should be able to !
---
You using Brain Fungus Soup and Cranberry Relish to boost your XP. Joining the appropriate group etc ?
---
This thread is hilarious.. /r/fo76's greatest "hits".
---
Ok bootlick.... I am asking for the Atoms to come back for the standard challenges like we had before the Legendary Run. It's completely doable as this was the standard way of earning atoms in this game that they stated in the beginning that this game "would not be a pay to play for ANYTHING and that all content can be EARNED"...
---
Cool
---
Thats weird, try switching servers maybe?
---
Definitely would be nice for gun powder, don't know how many times I've went to craft a ton of ammo and crafted way too much gunpowder and ended up encumbered from it.
---
Gotta get them perk coins!
---
plus my DR high enough that the extra little bit you get from body gaurds wouldn't do much at all, maybe a 2% reduction at best with the deminsishing returns.
---
Wild!  Do they spawn next to the chemical plant?
---
You should be able to make a bulk amount of ammo as well as while cooking, we shouldn't have to keeping hitting the button to make 1 piece of food or a batch of ammo. Easily fixable with a slider allowing us to say make 12 carrot soups versus hitting the button 12 times and the server be laggy
---
This is excellent information! I'll locate that are straight away!
---
The sights have already existed in the dev build for over a year, you can see it on some atom shop skins like the free states one. Same thing with the pump action shotgun, that thing has had a red dot since early 2019 and we still don't have it
---
Yeah ik I won't get to the end, as I started late, but I wanted to be able to at least finish chapter two, I've gone from level 15 to level 89 since mid July so I'm on that xp grind lol.
---
Yes in the river. There‚Äôs a couple of gulpers and ghouls down there. I‚Äôve only found 5. Others have said they have found more. 
---
It‚Äôs I‚Äôm the only spot currently that they are.
---
Yeah, I didn't see what time it was when posted
---
Nice!
---
If you make your vendors hard to find... The Brahmin dies...
---
It's all good
---
2 hours ..? I‚Äôm intrigued in your build. I get that its your first time but thats a very long time to be in there
---
Can‚Äôt wait for the crippling to work again.

I guess casual varies.  To some people playing every day for 2 hours is casual, because others play the game like it's thier job.    
---
But just getting on a few times a week, or even playing daily but never checking the challenges, and hoping you just complete the incidentally is never going to get you much further than 3/4th complete.    
---
It would be nice if it was weekly focused rather than daily, because I'm not willing to do that again after completing the legedary run so I'm probably just gonna ignore seasons from now on, and seeing as that's more or less all there is to do between events, I'll likely just log in every other month when a new event hits.
---
Need a Meat Week jukebox. Like, right now.
---
Go onto YouTube, some very good videos of tips. Sometimes seeing it helps a lot...more examples too.

Must be a console thing, on PC I never get people asking for anything really.
---
Damn I'd have bought it for sure if it worked like that!
---
The dailies and weeklies no longer give atoms for completing them. They give SCORE. Score moves you up the season, giving you rewards each rank, and several rewards at the end. 
---
Everyone gets the same rewards for the season.
---
If you get more Atoms after you completed the run, then you are getting more than other players that finish after you. 
---
That's now how it works, and thinking you deserve more from the season is just people being greedy.
---
They changed it. You don't get atoms from doing the dailies anymore. Get over it and move on.
---
Cranberry also spawns inside the Nuka Cola Plant, although even I can't remember where the second one I got spawned. Grape and Orange you can just outright buy at Whitesprings.
---
Wait where can you find a tuxedo? I been looking for one
---
Save it in case there's a glitch that lets you transfer it to another player
---
Congratulations! I mean it. That would have been a successful nuke and we all know it. You‚Äôve come this far. You cannot be denied another attempt. You have become death.
---
Thank you for trying to add shame to my sadness friend. Do you really think this is what I need right now?
---
I like to take my time in the interiors, I am terrible at directions, I get lost easily. I have a superb rifleman build but I decided to run with gattling lasers and plasmas. It wasn‚Äôt about my build, it was about my preferences to live my life the way I want.

That happened to me just a few minutes ago as well. Ran the silo, started Collosal Problem, and immediately got the 5 minute shutdown pop up right as loading into the event. Shiiiit. Anyway stuff happens. I spent about 18 minutes in the silo though so not as painful. Please keep trying, you'll get it sorted out before you know it. (Chinese stealth suit, cough cough)
---
Thank you, this means a lot! It‚Äôs a bummer but I still count myself successfull.
---
Dude was only saying what we are all thinking lol. Honestly I can run a silo in 10 mins now but even my first attempt with a crap heavy build I manages it in just over half-hour
---
Fair enough
---
Wow, that's crazy!  I've only ever soloed a nuke run (well over a dozen now) and I've never seen another person while I was in there.  That's a shitty thing to do.
---
I think that during the bos return should add a power armor helmet look for the backpack and have a different one for each type of power armor and be nice if each type reduce the weight of a certain ammo like raider .38 rounds, t51 .45, t-60 5.56, x01 2mm, ultracite for ultracite ammo, and t65 for regular ballistic or energy ammo. Have it be like 5% reduction so no one whines that it's op reduction, just so that it's not just cosmetics.
---
Yeah, if i see broken things on my way to their vendors, i'll repair 'em.
---
At least you still get to keep your key card, and now you have a better idea of what to expect when you try again.
---
Correct. There are ten weeks worth of rewards. If you finish and get them all early there is no need to keep doing challenhes
---
Where do you donate it??
---
I would kill for (and with) a 3SB gun in this game!
---
Oh fuck meat week 2!
---
Yes!
---
Yes, mine was also a few minutes ago! At leat you managed to start the event. :(
---
It works that way? So if I just shot 2000 rounds in the air, the weapon wouldn't lose any durability?
---
you'd see them less often on reddit if they fixed the problem(s)
---
Other website copies don't activate on steam.
---
Of all the weapons in the game the one that would most commonly have a suppressor is like the only one that doesn‚Äôt get one...?
---
The world needs more Harold.
---
All the tips assume private server.  If I'm not on first how do I get more then 1-4 high rad fluid per nuke? I feel like with in 30s everything is dead.
---
Yeah, it was easy, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have no problem next time. I just don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll run again.
---
I hope they do change it so then there's more time to loot before the timer runs out cause what I've seen is that people don't have time to loot and they miss out on the meat piles. Other than that, it's a pretty fun and hard event.
---
Two hours?? What level are you?
---
I was helping a low lvl peep build his camp the other day and came across something he inadvertently discovered that I had no clue about.  
---
That you can place the defensive column with the stairs onto roof panels. 
---
Making it the single smallest stairs you could place in the camp to smoothly go up an additional level. 
---
But it wont place on regular floor tiles and you can't connect floor tiles to it. Not sure if it works for foundation tiles.
---
But despite those restrictions was a cool way to add a bit of extra functionality.
---
Tried to recreate the effect on a friend's camp I was helping and it got glitch stuck forcing us to scrap his camp entirely and start over!  &gt;  .&lt;
---
I think the 2 foundation wide stairs was to blame tho, miengotte hate those stairs so much!  I mean, like, I love them, but the way they inevitably destroy your camp in the touch up phase of the build is Infuriating. 
---
Wanted to add those wooden railings around the defensive stairs but found that you have to get very specific with the build order. 
---
Add floor panel first, build rails, scrap floor, add roof tile, add stairs.
---
So the 10mm SMG is my favorite weapon in the game. I could make a compelling argument that it‚Äôs one of the best guns in the game from short to mid-range. The only Effect that will make the recoil unruly is Two Shot. Explosive is great on it; but it also obstructs vision; so you just have to get used to not being able to see your target while you‚Äôre firing (if you‚Äôre ADSing). 
---
The best part about this weapon being my favorite weapon is ‚Äì god rolls can often be found in vending machine for next to nothing (since most people think they are trash weapons).
---
People really i ask for that? I had a huge crisis some weeks ago where i needed screws badly, what did i do? I went to farm some
---
Emmett mountain disposal has loads in a cave. Inside, go right and into the area with the generator, left into an office. The cave leads out of there
---
Ok good for you
---
If all the benches are locked inside I won‚Äôt buy from them.
---
yep, pretty much :/
---
Yeah, like, they can't put too much content out at once... can they?
---
My level has nothing to do with what I do inside the silo.
---
I didn't realize you could create new characters to do these dailies until 2 weeks ago.
---
Do you know about class freak and starched genes?
---
feel free to tell more about what you don't care about
---
Riiiight. Real dupers getting unbanned officially, with a statement by Bethesda per email, but you got a temp ban for a gift. 
---
I call BS
---
Depending on your build, consider melee just for acp. I run heavy gunner but can swap to melee and save the resources. Sure you might die quite a bit, but you can do a ton of damage in a short amount of time and save all your ammo.
---
The reward pool for ACP is too good to skip imo.
---
True, but actually you need to go to Dyer Chimical as soon as the event starts. I'm trying to do a video about it, a self-proclaimed dataminer told me that there's no evidence I the codes that the event make spawn Strangler Blooms and that's bs. 
---
On 5 attempts...4/5 i found strangler blooms. You really need to jump on the oppotunity as soon as the event pops in your screen if you wanna maximise your chance to harvest them.
---
I want ‚ÄúThat Gun‚Äù from F:NV!
---
Your first couple of times suck, but after you get the hang of it it's a ten minute run tops, and that's without any glitches or exploits.
---
I vaguely know about starched genes, I don't lose mutations while I have that equipped right?
---
yeah, hopefully this lesson will prevent some future fomo and unnecessary burnout
---
It‚Äôd be nice if that‚Äôs a main mentality the game keeps! A multiplayer Fallout game that adds in stuff from all the games.
---
don't pay any more than 500 caps from players. 250-350 is about the average.
---
Make sure you use starched genes 2 so you don't lose it. And you may want class freak 3 to cut down the negative effects of a serum.
---
Which serum is it?
---
There's the Camo (green) and Urban (blue), but you're thinking of a beige colored one or something?
---
they're usually new lower level people. And i'm not gonna miss 6 screws.
---
Not sure what im doing wrong but everytime I nuke whitespring in private world all the bloated ones are dead.  
---
I log off then log back on and they are still dead.  The only come back if I swap characters.  What am I doing wrong?
---
Ive been nuking the Burrows because the inderground bloated are still there, up to 72 of them on any given run.
---
The one I'm looking for is marsupial, I just assumed I could only get it from the enclave, how commonly do players sell them?
---
Wasnt it the rock-it launcher?
---
It was part of that banwave, the main reason they let people off was because the widespread sweeping bans effected people who got gifted things by dupers and Bethesda couldn't tell the difference.
---
The fatigues released on the atom store 30 minutes ago
---
wait, does starch genes prevent the mutation from going away even though the serum is temporary? cuz I'm literally missing only one mutation out of 18 and then ill have all if them
---
R91 is the lore name for it I believe. I know there was an Atom Shop skin leaked for it that looked done, maybe they haven‚Äôt released it because they want to turn it into a new weapon. At least, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping.
---
Yeah I like it alot overall,  but have found that we both  now have just about all of the unique items of value he drops already.  
---
Given that were still looking for rare ultracite plans, and taking repair kits into account, I'm starting to think that the queen still has the better long term farming value. But I would not willingly give up that added variety.
---
Starched genes will stop you from losing a mutation if you use rad aways (or anything that eliminates rads). But it will also stop you from gaining mutations if you get rads. 
---
Class freak lessens the negative effects of your mutations. For example: Marsupial gives you -4 int but with class freak it is only -1 int
---
YES the G11 my god.
---
Sneak attack overall is broken as heck. It'll show danger when I'm not in danger. Works sometimes than other times it seems like I have a bright orange shirt on. All possible sneak perks enabled because I love sneak in this game. Not a huge huge issue but annoying sometimes.
---
No, no mole rats around or hidden ground enemies either.
---
That explains why I thought i hadn't claimed it.
---
No one asked the dumb fuckers who can't clear earl in under 3 minutes either
---
Well if you're on xbone i can hook you up. 
---
Sometimes you can go a while without seeing any serums for sale in vendors and then boowm. Every vendor on the map has them.
---
Don‚Äôt pay more than 500 caps for serums.  That‚Äôs the high end of the fair market price. Middle is about 300 caps. 
---
Don‚Äôt use it until you have Starched Genes 2 equipped. Leave that perk equipped ***ALL THE TIME***.  
---
For one hour after you use the serum, you will have no negative effects. After that, you will have the standard negative effects. You can reduce those negative effects with Class Freak. Each rank reduces the negative effects by 25%. 
---
Which mutation are you getting?  
---
Also, [this resource](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_mutations) is helpful in learning more about mutations in Fallout 76. 
---
Welcome to the club!
---
Me too. 
---
Im really against the atom shop skins that just should be new weapons. Not a cosmetic atom shop skin. I was really disappointed when I saw that leak but the fact that it hasn't appeared yet gives me hope. Maybe we'll be able to get it on expeditions to The Capital Wasteland
---
Because if they just keave theyre well aware nobody will notice or miss them, by being a drama queen about it they can fool themselves into thinking people give a fuck
---
I'm on pc sadly, either way gonna have a to level up a bit to get the perks, I assumed the benefit of serums was that they didn't go away
---
you can stand in a rad shower all day with starched genes on and you wont lose any. And use rad-x DILUTED for rad resistance without suppressing your mutations.
---
Yeah I finally hit tier 100 yesterday and..... nothing‚Äô..
---
Really underwhelming. Even the lunchbox opening party noises and animation would have been cool. 
---
Nice post and idea üëçüèº
---
2 hours? 2...2 hours? WHAT!?  My 12 year old took 18 minutes first time ever trying it and he had only been playing the game for two weeks and was barely level 50.   
---
Next time maybe have a friend? PM someone on the server and ask most are willing to be helpful. Be mindful of what they are doing at the time though, normally safest to PM someone in a camp area.
---
Big bend tunnel?
---
Is it an outfit? Or underarmor?
---
You can roll for a better piece, reapply the mod you know you like.    
---
imho, a few legendary modules to craft a new piece are easier to come by than gold.
---
A man of principle.
---
The serum is only temporary for the suppression of the negative effects. Otherwise the mutation is permanent, unless it is removed by something like RadAway. Keeping SG2 equipped means you cannot lose mutations and you cannot randomly gain them. You can take a serum with SG2 equipped and still get the mutation.
---
That‚Äôs not shaming u.  2 hours for a first run is a tad long, but Nothing wrong in asking what build you used.  
---
And the question even makes sense since you said u have a superb rifle build yet you chose to go in silo with heavy weapon?
---
I guess if they want to add in Legion Outfits as cosmetics, sure, why not? We have the NCR Ranger.
---
Naw. All you're buying is that specific mutation. You can still lose it.
---
It's an outfit
---
That same exact thing happened to me this morning. Ran the silo, started Collosal Problem, and immediately got the 5 minute shutdown pop up right after loading into the event. It would certainly be nice to have a longer heads up.
---
They actually took them off due to a bug with wastelanders. If you have one that dropped from the vault raids it now has no leaves or sticks.
---
The benefit is that you get to decide exactly what combination of mutations you want instead of letting it be random. 
---
Starched Genes 2 is what makes mutations permanent, regardless of how you acquire them.
---
So wouldn't I be better off just getting the mutations through rads?
---
I have played once in the last week since i compketed the score run because i just dont have a reason to come on and do anything anymore, i did a collossal problem and thats all ive done since.  
---
I used to come on and do the dailies or something for the atoms but now theres no point in doing them
---
That is just plain not true, both empirically and from datamined information. I have been gathering blooms over the last few weeks (I have around 75 radshield on one character and another 20 on another) and I can assure you that the status of the Heart of the Swamp event, or Verdant Season, or night/day, has no bearing whatsoever on whether you find some there or not.
---
The only way to spawn Strangler Blooms in the river by Dyer Chemical is for someone who is at the right stage of An Organic Solution to enter the area, after which the Strangler Blooms will persist until the server reboots. This is idiotic from a game design perspective but nonetheless true.
---
Coming soon to 1st!   
---
Show your elite status by having skins unavailable to the plebeians.   
---
But yeah I was just saying the same thing yesterday in a thread and I hope they finally make some, and finally bring the GD buttercup rideable back.
---
All hail the PS4 cannibals!!!
---
So for my first mutation there's no need to use a serum?
---
Is this a personal anecdote or something you have confirmed from a third party?
---
And it‚Äôs always a good idea to test before you start transferring as well.
---
There are a lot of good resources out there to make your character stronger/better optimized.
---
Then you're probably posting drunk right now...
---
Lol awesome.  I have like 3500 wood in my inventory now because I somehow thought it started yesterday.  Need any?
---
Can you leave someone in it and use the social menu to reconnect or has that been broken too?
---
Hey, we may on seperate consoles but we're brothers and sisters of the forbidden tastes
---
cool!
---
Penguins.
---
I finished 3 weeks ago... imagine how it felt. Now I gotta get used to the score grind again.
---
I get them a lot, usually ammo begging.  One guy begged me to trade a marsupial serum for steel scrap.  I was selling the serum for 200 caps, which is a frickin' steal!
---
EDIT:  Xbox, so yeah...it's likely a Gamepass thing
---
random chance. too much hassle.
---
I stopped listening to the radio altogether because of Julie. Three Dog and Mr. New Vegas were both entertaining and charismatic. Travis was interesting and funny at times. Julie is pretty lame on comparison, and the fact that she doesn't comment on what's going on event and world wise is lackluster. 
---
The radio could definitely use more songs and Julie needs better voice lines
---
While you were in the forces was your weapon 25 years old with little to no maintainence?  
---
Think of it less of repairing and more of cleaning/oiling the weapon.  
---
Go 1 day without cleaning or oiling and you very fast start getting stoppages
---
I didn‚Äôt have any trouble with the enemies in there, I just took my time. I know it‚Äôs a short run. I alternate between heavy and rifles. It‚Äôs just not nice to immediately judge when you see ‚Äú2 hours‚Äù.
---
nice! I didn't know you still kept the mutation via this way with the serum. even though i can't get anymore and the last one I need is herbivore and i have carnivore and it won't allow me to have both lol üòÖ
---
Their reasons for staggering meat week and colossus on console was they wanted to gice people a change to enjoy both without overlappiny
---
You won Reddit today.  This is gold.
---
Lol, I do!  I work a full time job, I just sleep on a part time schedule :p
---
Yes, burp, we are! Yummy yummy I got settlers in my tummy
---
This is happening to me, personally, 3x since the hotfix, each time I tried switching characters. Thankfully, there was another person in to pick up the items. I will clarify in the post, as well.
---
Do u play on PS4?
---
Ok so then every time Heart of the Swamp started and I went to Dyer chemical and picked Strangler Blooms never happened and having 120 radshield also never happened. 
---
And that someone just happened to be at that part of the quest but not at Dyer chemicals always when Heart of the Swamp, and THATS why I think what I do.
---
Sorry you‚Äôve got the wrong end of the stick. 
---
But you be you.
---
glowing blood packs for the win for me üòé
---
Hotfix today? Any notes?
---
Why not wash down that people meet with a blackwater brew? üòã
---
This is what happens when we give people fish and not teach them how to fish ... no I haven‚Äôt been bugged but i don‚Äôt believe i have never gave anything to anyone.... no one ever gave me anything... but im not mean about it...
---
That all depends on if you only have mutations that you want to keep. 
---
I got the Marsupial mutation randomly from the environment around level 29 or 30 on my main so I made sure my next perk picks were Starched Genes and then locked it in. But if it had been something like Plague Walker, I‚Äôd have cleared it out first.
---
Would be good if they added older energy and big guns with the bos dlc. They could also add older conventional pre war weapons with a free States dlc if they ever do one. Those guys seem like the type to have surplus military weapons.
---
I‚Äôm good, thanks for the offer.  Do you have a Scrapbox?
---
He got choked
---
It more antisocial to break into someone lock camp than it is to lock there camp.
---
White russians. So good ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Yeah, that's a good place to drop stuff off (except for Mondays lol), but as someone said earlier, loot bags disappear at one point. I personally liked the idea of dropping things in the Overseer stash at the overseer camp.
---
Minor correction:  After that, every day only one of the dailies will *become* available. But multiple Camden Park dailies can still *be* active on any given day.
---
If you trigger one of the quests but don't do them on that day, you can go to Camden Park the next day, trigger another daily, then do both of them because the one from yesterday will still be active. I've done so repeatedly.
---
Was that a pun?
---
Friend was hosting a private server for some nukes and at one point new people could not get in and got an error message. 
---
After that, on a new server, it seemed to work again. 
---
Theory is that a hotfix was deployed and servers had to restart.
---
No, you have never been able to join a player who is "visiting private" in my experience. Just checked and there is no "join" option for "visiting private" players.
---
U play on ps4
---
Me either.
---
I think the replies about it being because of the free xbox gamepass is the right answer, cause every time I see this subject it is on xbox.
---
Not saying it doesn't happen on ps4, but I play almost every day and I have never had anyone ask me outright for things other than the random noob trade requests that I generally ignore.
---
I have the same problem sometimes.
---
What did solve it is I have ma wife spawn her toon in and do one round. Then, after I reconnect, the mobs spawn as they should.
---
Hot fix was to patch a dupe exploit.
---
Getting a mutation from the serum and the environment is the same, except for the first hour of suppressed negative effects, and the fact that it‚Äôs controlled instead of random. 
---
And Herbivore and Carnivore are mutually exclusive. You cannot have both at the same time. You have to pick one and run with it.
---
worked for me!
---
I just recently got a bloodied magic Gauss Shotgun and have been having the hardest time wrapping my head around its peculiarities concerning VATs.
---
When it focuses in VATs it's usually a 1 hit kill.  When it doesn't it's a real slog, especially for close range enemies. 
---
Can't quite pin down how to keep it focused in VATs. I exit and re enter sometimes 3-5 times and it still wont focus fire. While other times it will focus every time and obliterate everything no matter how far away it is.
---
I've had conflicting experiences using the focus fire perk too. On Earl it's great to get the crits to his face, but had the hardest time downing a regular scorchbeast on the ground,  while another time without that perk obliterating another Scorchbeast.
---
Cant find any clear info on what's causing what to happen or not happen.
---
I am also boggled by how insanely fast it fires in 3rd person. Yet I need those focused fire crits for the best damage otherwise half the pellets miss the target.
---
Am I using a gun mod that's messing with its capacity to focus in VATs or something? Or is this by design to keep it from being a perfect weapon?
---
Havent used it in a while, is it just unable to set power armor in or does it not let you access it afterward?
---

The dupes just keep on coming. Cheers mate.
---
I use a instigating limb damage minigun. It melts the queen and earl within seconds if I can manage to hit the same limb with 150-200 rounds. 
---
It doesn't work on private worlds tho, only on public worlds but there 100%. My framerate is at 90-120 mostly, network is great.
---
I stopped being Santa Claus.  It was good at first, but the ungrateful types outnumber the grateful these days.  Besides, I fought for or found everything I have.
---
I'll help out in a gunfight if a low-level is being swarmed, but the days of freebies are over.
---
Yeah, completely agree. I was really surprised at the extra low effort. Even by Bethesda standards, this was a lame way to wrap an inaugural season. They could have played the space theme, thrown up a congrats message on the screen, literally anything to help it feel more like an accomplishment. I did get a sense that I had earned my parole from silly challenges, so guess that‚Äôs something positive.

Wasn‚Äôt there like a laser assault rifle? That would be awesome if it returned
---
You can get random mutations from getting rads but you will lose them if you use rad away. The ones I tended to get were talons and herbivore. When you buy the serum from enclave, you are buying a recipe. You will need stable Flux to make them
---
It seems to shock some because it took two hours. Well, I hope you looted the place clean and found something special in a hidden corner that everyone else just runs by.
---
Tons of begging on xbox lately.
---
Recoil ain‚Äôt to bad as long as your running snub barrel
---
Supposedly works with 200 fire rate weapons also.
---
But he didn‚Äôt immediately judge.  He asked for some details for which you took offense.
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre a low level from that response...
---
They claimed it was to fix a duping glitch, so probably not
---
Their business model is moving more and more to get people to log in daily thereby increasing atom shop browsing and potentially more purchases. Hence the seasons with SCORE rewards rather than atoms. I reckon they will eventually phase out atom rewards completely so you either sub to 1st or buy atoms.
---
Lolol don‚Äôt know whats taking them so long. They don‚Äôt bother testing each item anyway lol
---
Is the dark matter now actually dark matter or white as  the normal one?

Most important thing, do not drink and tweak your build. I had a few dozen drinks on the weekend and thought it would be a great idea to tweak my build to share rank 2 Mysterious Saviour for A Colossal Problem. In my moment of genious I thought I would temporarily remove starched genes and put more points into Charisma.
---
After way too many more drinks I had inhertited the Twisted Muscles mutation with it's -50 accuracy debuff on my Heavy Gunner.
---
The accuracy on my build was comparable to my accuracy if I had attempted to go to the toilet. Imagine a blindfolded monkey with a firehose on a merry-go-round.
---
So get the starched genes perk. Look into the class freak perk. Don't pay much more than 300 caps for a serum. 
---
Once you mutate, you are committed to the starched genes perk. The alternative is.....
---
.....messy.
---
By this logic, everyone‚Äôs crafted armor should look slightly different, especially the Metal and Robot pieces.  
---
It would be wonderful if we had that level of immersion in the game. But I feel that it‚Äôs more important for them to focus on the fundamentals instead of minor aesthetics.
---
Sorry, is it still possible to craft jetpack limbs?  Os this only SS armor?
---
sorry, put it up for 25k caps and it sold to the first person who walked in.  hope you can grab one without too much hassle when treasure hunter comes back
---
They fix things under the radar sometimes so I was just checking (because I cant get to my account to check myself)
---
I think that's what it is too, their changing this up for new potential players and basically saying; well... all of you that played for all this time... well, we really don't need you anymore, we need new money.  I've been trying out different games that I've completely ignored since I started playing this, Elite Dangerous is great (if you like space simulators - I never recommend games, but wow, this one is pretty damn good.)  76 is still a good game (for now), I just have zero confidence in them, if it were any other game studio listing all of the changes coming to (whatever game), I probably wouldn't even think about it, but it's these guys... and this game... you just already know... it's not going to be good. lol
---
Same I got my butt kicked the first time and took me about 30 mins.
---
No I'm going to respectfully 100% disagree/clarify. The Plasmas destroy and melt everything. Doesn't matter if it's PVP or PVE, nothing comes close to them.
---
If you get one that's JE,AE or FE, you can singlehandedly change the battlefield environment around around you. They are the best guns the game, hands down.
---
Before the last dupe, people bought them from Gameflip for $200-$300. Players often offered their entire inventory for one. They really do change the game and the outcomes. Plasma cores are easy to make, and if you make it Ultracite, you have the most powerful weapon in the game. It's like being in AC-130 while your jetpacking and dropping everything that moves, no better feeling.
---
It's broken. Appears as the Settler one. Annoying as hell.
---
I mean, it works but it mysteriously rotated 90 degrees and now blocks the path. Similar to the nuka cola bottle at the nuka cola factory that was mysteriously scaled up two times its normal size a few patches back before being scaled back to its almost correct size.
---
Yes. That‚Äôs one of the benefits of paying $13/month, and something they are finally fulfilling from their original sales pitch.
---
Agree.  More rusty post-apocalypse stuff and less shiny brand new looking stuff.  Nothing ruins muh immersion quite like slogging through the wasteland and turning a corner to find a CAMP with perfect shiny tile floors and spotless furniture.
---
T-65 new skin allowed jetpack limbs last night. New hot fix didnt mention a fix on this but wasnt sure of they fixed it under the radar
---
You are correct sir! I used to log in with sole purpose of completing them every day and having finished the run a couple of weeks ago I now play the game more how I like and seem to naturally complete most dailies\weeklies by normal playing.
---
How is the forest asylum uniform there and not red? Forest is way more common than red
---
Som people say no, but my experience says ‚ÄúA little‚Äù
---
after tearing down my camp adn rebuilding from scratch in the same location with Contractor 2, I was a to add a few more objects than I had before the rebuild.
---
  After WL, when you were required to build the crane sign.... I believe a bit of budget was added to ensure people at max could still build the sign.
---
Once I completed that mission and deleted the sign, I was able to add a few more things in its place.
---
Hey long do you think its gonna take for them to fix the camo jetpack glitch?
---
Yep
---
I think everything dies immediately. I‚Äôve heard if you wait 20 mins and then fast travel, it works, but it didn‚Äôt for me. I think someone here mentioned you can just add someone who was in the server (by going theu recents) and that‚Äôs how you can connect to the same public server. I never tried but I would assume that might work the same way
---
It does but if you have slow internet and can't keep 60fps I think it is, you won't be able to get it to work.
---
The progression of min/maxing. It's a beautiful thing...
---
You do know the difference between correlation and causation, yes? If not, I invite you to familiarize yourself with those two concepts and the differences between them.
---
I do not deny that every time Heart of the Swamp started and you went to Dyer chemical, you could pick Strangler Blooms. I wasn't there and can't say one way or another. What I'm telling you is that there is no causation there because a) it didn't happen to me that way numerous times, so it's empirically wrong, and b) the datamined information clearly shows that An Organic Solution is the only way to trigger Strangler Blooms.
---
So yeah, someone who was at the corect stage of An Organic Solution had been at Dyer Chemicals *at some point in the life time of that server instance* before you got there. I'm not sure what's so hard to believe about that, but there you are.
---
Is there a trick to putting the jet pack on a limb for the T65? I had just enough to get the left arm and jet pack plans but when I try to mod the arm I don't get any options.
---
It is super rare, but I wouldn‚Äôt have traded a legacy for it unless it was a bad legacy. I had one drop a few weeks ago on my low level acc and was getting tons of offers for it
---
Useful ideas like these are against Vault-Tec's design philosophy.
---
Never transfer on a day with a hotfix.
---
It take some time until all instances have the hotfix applied.
---
Most of that will be from Nerd Rage.
---
You‚Äôre wrong. That‚Äôs all there is to it. What I have been doing gives me the results I‚Äôve described. Many others also report the same. 
---
Just go play your game. Let others play theirs. If something works it‚Äôs not for you to say their results are wrong because believe differently and don‚Äôt wAnt to accept others experience.
---
So I‚Äôll keep doing what I‚Äôve been doing. The guy asking is welcome to try it and see if it works for him. If it dies great if it doesn‚Äôt he‚Äôs lost nothing.
---
You keep doing what you do and keep an eye out for players doing the quest at Dyer chemicals and going then. 
---
Nobody losses.
---
Right on.
---
How much ammo tho?
---
That's impressive!
---
Right?! I had to look at my bank statements like ‚Äúdid I accidentally buy the 12 month???‚Äù But nope, 1 month, kept everything. I don‚Äôt get the atoms or the 1st free exclusives anymore but I get the tent, the box, and the server still
---
The ones you own are under your first members in atx. If not there, you don't own any skins.
---
I have 3 and 1 is broken. The Responders Medical tent is broken. Won't appear except as the Settler tent. Lame!
---
Bless those guys who try to get the mine right on the edge of their nuke zone to make that overweight hazmat suit crawl out of the mine better.
---
I'm at school rn,I'll have to check later today
---
Ok? Why didn‚Äôt you just say so? I‚Äôm surprised you had two hours worth of exploring in there is all. No need to be all coy lol
---
Okay
---
They're trash against endgame bosses where ballistic weps are needed though.
---
Almost all weps also shred all mobs at this point, I guess plasma gats are pretty potent with rate of fire &amp; ammo capacity, but there are non-legacy alternatives that are also just as good.
---
Really don't see plasma gats as being exceptional anywhere in pve when considering alternative options.
---
Sorry, agree to disagree I guess.
---
Im gonna have to resort to that myself
---
Responders Medical tent is broken. Appears as the Settler tent. Really crappy.
---
What? Where? I've had two camps up there and haven't seen them!
---
Can you clarify what you mean when your referring to for endgame bosses where ballistic weapons are needed?
---
I agree, I love mine, but on the flip side I enjoy not worrying about players destroying it, nuking it, or placing bugged items. So it is a trade off.
---
Well I‚Äôve done all the content in the game quests etc, so the only time I hop on is just to grind, I play to hit 600 by Xmas, so my build is purely designed to level as fast as possible :-) I don‚Äôt do pvp so just farming, running nukes events public teams etc :)
---
I realized 90% of my cloth comes from prewar money and I use it to craft armor. I want to see 100s on my leather and combat armor
---
Wow... That's double what I'm getting. How much you pay for your rig to get to 5???
---
Are you learning them and then immediately logging off? May be server rollback if so. Its loading up the last saved version of your character and it didn't update all the learned plans.
---
It's unfortunate, but hotfixes, downtime and maintenance are just a part of the deal when it comes to online games.
---
The bright side is that now you know from firsthand experience what to expect when and if you decide to run a silo again.
---
I got my Vault 94 mask as soon as the raid launched, it had the branches etc, but now it doesn't. They disappeared when wastelands was released, for me anyway.
---
And here I was, just hoping they would make it stop raining dead scorch beasts wherever I go.
---
Because it's literally just a new skin. Has the same sound as the old jukebox, without any animation to go with it. It's about as lazy as you can get.
---
This is true, from my experience. One of my characters has never finished this so I jump servers with a team, harvest, rinse and repeat and then we pool the blooms and someone else in the group crafts them. 15-20 minutes with a full team and super duper will a month supply for each team member
---
LOL I I didn‚Äôt even notice that typo! I was in such a hurry to type it on my phone before more nuclear keycards met an untimely fate :-P
---
Yeah I'd like to see repair kits get dropped from the event and some of the drops are pretty cool, I just hope that they refresh drop pools for events soon.
---
Didn‚Äôt realize this was broken. Did they fix the naming of it when you add a lining? It never prepended the name of the lining type you applied to it.
---
Yeah Xbox you‚Äôd be lucky to get 30 even on good intenet
---
Share the love with nukes :-D
---
Ahh so this is what happened to mine then.
---
That's why I'm a shotty build for now. Lol
---
Last time it happened to me was when they last added a hotfix. Scrolling down on here looks like they did another one today. I lost some scrip whilst transferring stuff about 90 mins ago so maybe that was it
---
There was a hotfix today, yes. But they broke something.
---
I laughed at your comment so hard that it hurt. Thank you very much for the good laugh. Yeah, two hours is a very long time to be in a silo. I find myself wondering just how much ammo they wasted on the never ending robot army. Plus, if they hadn't spent so much time lollygagging, they would had got to launch their nuke. I have zero sympathy.
---
I‚Äôve also wondered that myself
---
Yea that was fixed last week on console... 2 weeks ago on pc
---
Your mistake was thinking instigating is magic. 
---
That is very old info. 
---
Angry Turtle already said in his videos that medics stopped working and people on the comments said instigating doesn‚Äôt work neither 
---
The only reliable prefix is junkies
---
33vats, 50 limb are the mayors your looking for. 
---
Explosive doesn‚Äôt work well on SBQ, but effectively counts as doubling the FFR and so does two shot. 
---
The higher FFR you can get, the better. As the magic effect relays heavily on server lag and FPS
---
I have tested, benchmarked and uploaded YouTube‚Äôs about every magic weapon I ever sold (over 50) and the best one so far was a two shot 33 vats minigun
---
Ofc also remember to install accelerated barrel and get rid of the shredder muzzle (doesn‚Äôt effect magic but is useless and only adds weight)
---
Weird.
---
Doesn't really seem fair that my personal stealth should be influenced by what rando teammates are doing.
---
Yes sir, had to re add protective lining back on.
---
Oh that's not good.
---
Using just a regular shoty with no perks pretty much one shots most enemies, trust me I‚Äôm a heavy build and just threw it on to save ammo lol
---
Sweet, finally.
---
I buy flux because i dont know how to farm it and i am level 242
---
I didn't know if it was gonna be that soon or patch 22
---
Wearing armor under underarmour is like wearing a body sized condom to keep your armor in place.
---
Even better. Tell them there's really good loot at the bottom of the green pool in said fissure.
---
I love the Gatling Plasma, I had a Vampire's+FFR for a while, but it got poofed during one of the inventory bugs...alongside my X-01 set...
---
At least the X-01 wasn't a great loss, as I run T-51b.  I hope to get the T-65 one day, but I'm lazy and I don't want to grind.  I also have a couple of other items a bit higher on the list, like a gauss minigun and the ammo factory.
---
Might even get the dirt tiles at some point.
---
I bought the flare plans and regretted it.
---
Every time I leave and rejoin I get a new world, not just the one time.
---
If they bring back Tesla it‚Äôll be from 4 since it‚Äôs easier to take that asset and implement into the game than make an entirely new one. The Hellfire PA is just a reskin from the one in 4s CC.
---
Herd Mentality can sorta (when combined with "strange in numbers") counteract some of the stat penalties that mutations impose, since most of those penalties are usually about -4 and HM can grant +3.
---
It obviously won't do much of anything for non-stat penalties though.
---
At least its only a temporary blip while they do the hotfix, I've moved stuff between characters on a private world since then and it's fine. I just need to pay more attention to when they're planning a hotfix!
---
lol have you tried using a Minigun with the shredder mod? it lasts like 20 seconds hitting something and it breaks, its hilarious.
---
Apparently these folks dont know how to read. My first silo run took me a few hours too. Not because it was too hard. I had fun exploring and picking stuff up. I was successful in launching my nike but sadly only 2 other people showed up to help me fight the queen scorchbeast. Theres no way that was gonna happen.
---
I‚Äôve had same issue for months. Dross toss will not let me complete.   I can do all others though
---
Oh I know, started out as a heavy build. Got the Gauss shotty unlocked though so went ahead and changed over and then became a Junkie. It's a fun build. Lol
---
Yep, learnt this the hard way!
---
Yep. Unlike in 3 and NV its all tied to enemies hit. This also means that logicially using an explosive weapon where it would do best (wrecking bunched up weaker enemies)... results in it breaking at the speed of light.
---
Quality coding.
---
This‚¨ÜÔ∏è
---
There‚Äôs a lot more reds out there now after the big dupe this summer.
---
Running a junkies FFR faster reload gauss minigun not even spiced fully for heavy just has the heavy gun damage perks still melts Scorch queens sad thing is I don‚Äôt have any addictions yet just been to lazy to get them going lol
---
It would make them money.
---
It would be amazing if you could scrap it and get at least one legendary module back. I'm stuck with a ton of 3 star legendary SS pieces that I would like to scrip, but I'm constantly out of scrips as legendary heavy weapons/armor gets priority when it comes to scriping.
---
Yes exactly! Thank you so much, I needed this. People are so fixed on showing off when it comes to silo runs.  I like to slowly enjoy the game, this is how I like to play.
---
It took me over an hour my first time. There are always people that think that everyone should be as good as them. I am a melee build which doesn't work well for ceiling turrets so I failed the first few times I tried and put it off for a long time.
---
X01. Then T65. Only two you need, unless you want Strangler.
---
Idk, i think it has something to do with them accidentally implementing it as a mod and not a paint at first. A few weeks ago when the update came out, you were able to apply it as a jetpack mod to any piece, giving you a jetpack and making it camo in the mod slot and not the paint slot. That was before it even came out in the atom shop, and they fixed it a few days after the update came out, but it could be anywhere from a few days to a few weeks until they fix it
---
riflemen could certainly use a new, high powered rifle. like the anti materiel one from NV. make it ignore 100% armor and pierce some of the flat damage reduction from bosses.
---
would certainly breath some new life into rifleman builds.
---
Fort Defiance is my go to (the left wing of the building).
---
Strangler? Also I plant to collect all the power armour just to have them on labelled power armour frames
---
Exactly the same for me.  Give me those two and I‚Äôm good.  Sort of takes the pressure off me for this season.
---
yeahhhhh that's what I wanted to say sorry bout that
---
They drop fuel which isnt ballistic
---
The armour trick works for mini guns too. But ofc only works if you don‚Äôt use PA
---
I'm waiting to unlock the Gauss mini gun or find a heavy I really like and I'll have 2 builds good swap out whenever. And yeah, I was lazy too till I realized it was the answer for a full HP build. Lol. Stacked Adrenal Reaction on top so if I do take damage it just makes me stronger till I decide to stim.
---
Yeah Ive stopped rolling ss pieces too. I have complete uny ap sent sets in marine and heavy combat so I‚Äòm satisfied. I have almost every god roll weapon possible, almost all legacies, but I still enjoy trading and exploring and testing stuff. But I‚Äòm in the same boat as you, i dont need anything anymore. Only the stuff the legendary run had to offer. And thats the problem: i feel forced to finish this thing and the process is boring and repetitive and this simply annoys me and what annoys me the most is that you have to do it every day.
---
I'd love to see the Anti-Material Rifle from the BoS, but i'd be fine if it was a gold bullion-sink as it would be powerful.
---
Would also be nice to see the old Vault Labcoat return (Jumpsuit with a labcoat worn open), something similar to Ulysses' duster, Vault Tec security armor from 3 instead of 4's cardboard-like armor, maybe even some other outfits and pieces from the past including the older Brotherhood scribe robes, enclave scientist hazmat suit (or costume with working gasmask), etc.
---
Thanks for the warning. Luckily, I decided to work on a new character yesterday, so I've already moved stuff around.
---
Not a solution but a quick way of checking your ammo counts outside having to hit the pipboy is to trigger your favourite scroll wheel. If you over over any favourited weapon it'll give you the ammo count you're carrying for it.
---
Not ideal but a little less keyboard mashing to find what you have.
---
Keyboard mashing to generate the ammo will be repetitive and never ending.
---
Someone here bragged about their 12 yo son finishing in 10 minutes. I feel sad for them. God, I can‚Äôt imagine dealing with the turrets melee. :(
---
Definitely sbq, I think earl too.
---
Regarding gameflip prices, that's also largely from these being legacy weps with limited inventory.
---
Outside of dupes, supply can only go down and because of that the law of supply &amp; demand pushes prices up.
---
After the latest dupe, they're $20 because they're almost as common as non-legacies (for now, will probably go back up in time as supply decreases post-dupe).
---
Really interesting !
---
I'm heavily against those type of builds. Most players do not optimise them well. But this is one is definitely well optimised. it's not "optimised " but you have enough optimisation to be effective in different situations. Good job there !
---
And if you can get your hands on a Bloodied Galting gun...you definitely have the build to have a ton of v.a.t.s fun and you will save sooo much ammo ! Unyielding set needed too !
---
Lol yeah it made me so mad I had a full set of solar vangaurds and I used to wear it and the mask. Log in one day and poof no sticks on the mask
---
Atom shop ain't canon.
---
"Does anyone know when (some item) will be back in the atomic shop?"
---
Going for a weaker build since it‚Äôs is nerfing stacking buffs gonna try going for a full auto Rez armor set with revenant and team buff perks since fps will take a hit I might as well work in survivability for the whole team.
---
If it‚Äôs expensive for you, you can always buy an used account from 3rd party sellers. They usually go for 5 dollars each.
---
Me too when i was low level i had a guy come to me made my base gave me 5 stims and that was the last help i ever got but i thank him
---
I hope they fix it in a few weeks. I need more time to get the jetpack plan
---
Have my upvote!
---
I didn't think you could display power armor. I thought it always went back into your inventory?
---
mine went back to UA however it took my shielded mod off of it for some reason.
---
Wanamingo's could be on their way considering the next treasure hunter event will feature wanamingo plush plans with a brand new design for the creature.
---
Strange accomplishment to be proud of and to try and shame other gamers with lol. 
---
Oh I didn't and was only carrying low level guns and ran out of ammo pretty quick. I waited quite a few months/levels to try again.
---
is this Console? I don't see anything like this  on PC?
---
Many thanks, appreciated. Imprisoned by impatience......
---
I'm gonna hold off on doing something like that and see what Bethesda messes up or gets right. Or if they fix Enforcer just play support and cripple everything for people.
---
You can't sadly but I keep them in my stash in hopes I can display them one day
---
There are things other than bloodied, you know. You can enjoy exploring new locations and piecing together what happened. You can do daily quests, events, build a fantastic CAMP, etc.
---
When you put it like that...
---
You think maybe they'll patch it in the future if enough people were to complain about it or is that just wishful thinking
---
The ability to label power armour frames is a god send though
---
same here.  It never show that I killed it for the reward. Still shows incomplete
---
I was wondering if there will be any daily‚Äôs or weekly‚Äôs during the break between seasons?? 
---
If so, will the reward be atoms? .. hmm probably not.
---
"What the hell happened to my store?!"
---
"Shrek did it, said you got too close to his swamp."
---
I'm just hoping they are reading and taking the feedback advice from the test server players.  I don't mind some changes, but stuff I'm hearing and reading, I can't say I approve.  It is becoming a watered down version of what it should be.  I was happy with the recent addition of Earle, that's what this game needs, more boss fights for everyone to join in and have fun at, that's what they should have their team working on.
---
What‚Äôs the point of this post then? You acknowledge that there‚Äôs a pop up when you claim the workshop, so you know that anyone who claims one knows this info. If somebody hasn‚Äôt claimed one before then they don‚Äôt need this info until they decide to claim one, at which point they‚Äôll see the pop up and know.
---
Brotherhood of steel would be the perfect group to introduce those plans.
---
So guys, hear me out on this, but so as we know there are daily ops which send us to a couple locations which we can get some souvenirs such as a sign or wallpaper as datamined recently. But they did say expeditions would send us outside of Appalachia, that it is aimed to be more of a fan-service feature than being entirely lore friendly. 
---
What if they made it so they could add items from past Fallout games in the loot pools for expeditions to specific regions. So say if you do an expedition to The Pitt (which yes, isn't raider infested right now, according to the Foundation who passed through that area), you could still possibly get the auto-axe or steel claw. Maybe even a set of power armor inspired by Ashur's. 
---
Or say we could be sent to Bar/Far Harbor/Point Pleasant and get some items from there such as decorations, clothing, etc. Even those turbine-based water collectors could be nifty.
---
With each area they could tell a bit of the story of that area after the war. Now of course we wouldn't hear lore that hasn't occurred yet in the timeline, but we could get a glimpse of what lead up to some of those events.
---
Oh crap, gunsmith is broken???
---
What is 24 for the last roll?
---
Ooh, yes! Especially if it‚Äôs anything like the LAER mod for Fallout 4!
---
When the lighter pistol has less recoil than the heavy smg that barely fires faster
---
Based on experience I think that a great many people either don‚Äôt read it or think it doesn‚Äôt apply to them.
---
T-51b is better than both, gives you the ER of X-01 and DR of Ultracite, but worse rad resistance. But the rad resistance differences flatten out way before either of them, so it doesn‚Äôt really make a difference
---
An invisible skin for armor  would be great. 
---
They could bundle them as outfits too.
---
Either way that's easy atoms right there
---
And some sort of wallpaper for the roof.
---
I absolutely miss Three Dog (Hooowwwwllll). 
---
"Because one dog aint enough, and two is too low, its me, Three dog!"
---
yea you would think they know this but with the number of posts i see people crying about being killed at a workshop this PSA is legit
---
No it doesn‚Äôt, it plays the classical radio. The old jukebox played some random music not found in any of the radio stations
---
But they need to kill fireflies to get the mothman buff.
---
Nope, because i block all randoms by default.
---
It says right there in the description it plays the classical radio
---
I'd like to see a tinker's workbench that was more compact and maybe on some gritty, rusted metal table with the supplies on the lower shelf of the table in these unorganized bins.
---
Then there's no reason we can't have legion outfits in it
---
I want a buff to plasma weapons first i love them but their damage is making me come back to the gauss minigun
---
Yeah, pretty much. Maxson‚Äôs is a big fancy coat, but nothing you couldn‚Äôt find in a fancier retail place, probably in Watoga or maybe the Whitesprings clothing stores. Piper‚Äôs is fairly ordinary, so it‚Äôd be easier to find.
---
I would definitely be more likely to purchase underarmors if I could wear them as outfits
---
that's definitely one of the best mods I've ever used
---
i never shoot first, for various reason but if they do, they are usually dead in .1 seconds following my weapon swap ...
---
Read the post again, man. I got the shutdown warning at the end of my relaxed run. Only used up two fusion cores cuz I‚Äôm actually quite strong and have some trick up my sleeve. :) But it‚Äôs good, I‚Äôm happy you had a laugh. We need it nowadays. Stay safe.
---
If it‚Äôs too expensive, there are 3rd parties that sell used accounts for 5 usd
---
I use Ultracite, because it was "free" as a quest reward, but if I had to do it again, I'd go with X01. The reason is that its much easier to get the plans/mods for X01 than it is Ultracite. Also X01 has a wider variety of skins available for it.
---
One thing, radshield won‚Äôt suppress your mutations .
---
Would also be nice to have some things like a raider-inspired knife rack or spice rack. Maybe some hanging meat.
---
Does this break joining a friend's private server?
---
I can get the magic to work sometimes with the miniguns I have but I think the problem is usually my positioning or the boss whipping its hair back and forth. So I have to get somewhat close and all the bullets have to hit the same spot.
---
It‚Äôs a quote from the movie Friday. Or maybe it‚Äôs op‚Äôs name.
---
Especially the road leathers, harness and raider waster underarmor styles
---
I did this for my second nuke ever. I have no idea how it still activated Scorched Earth.
---
https://i.imgur.com/PihtPj1.jpg
---
Yes! I love using an automatic LAER with the Tesla attachment. Cuts down hordes of ghouls or Brotherhood Knights like a Superheated Cosmic Knife through Brahmin butter.
---
Oh bummer. But I‚Äôm glad you managed in the end. There‚Äôs no shame in failing and trying again. :)
---
getting free stuff and asking for free stuff is completely different.  
---
if i somehow deal with a low level player and i have some free time, i will make them a good pump action shotgun and full BOS combat armor deep pocket for no reason for them. ALSO, REMEMBER TO ALWAYS INCLUDE A VINTAGE NUKASHINE IN EVERY TRADE =D
---
Never had an issue.  Have you tried clicking on the pail itself?  The dialogue in this, and the lucky kicker is delayed.  But as others said, unless it actually shows a diamond icon as an available quest on the map, then it won‚Äôt trigger
---
Bottle Cap tuxedo.
---
honestly this would be so good
---
Do you mean it plays all the classic radio songs or just a couple different ones than the old jukebox plays
---
Ultracite is free from a quest, but mods are learned through plans, so may be harded to mod it how you like. Even if you have the plans, you need the flux to craft the mod.
---
X-01 you can purchase the mod from the enclave bunker, no plan, but also no crafting materials needed.
---
Could be because cranberries are a fruit and in game do not trigger herbivore and can still be enjoyed as a carnivore
---
Edit: Tasty Squirrel Stew DOES work with carnivore for a nifty +20% XP gain, if you want an alternative
---
Came here to say the exact same thing...seems I'm late lol
---
U bring a range weapon for the turrets.  Its not rocket science.
---
In my tests the event has nothing to do with the blooms,unlike the quest obviously. 
---
I think you're taking coincidences for evidences.
---
No I always play after to recoup the caps I've used in vendor just have to keep an eye on it.
---
Fortunately, yes.
---
They need to start doing some complete sets - i'm getting tired that they're just updating one thing and not another. 
---
The nukashine stuff for example, i'm all fancy on one, but the fermentor is still the grotty version.
---
Thanks.maybe they thought there would have been a constant flux of people at that quest's stage.
---
So second question, what mods should I use?
---
"Is it just me, or are thirst and hunger increased after the last patch?"
---
It was an early Atomic Shop item.  I'm not sure if it's ever come back on sale.
---
I'm curious, is this more of a XB1 or PC thing because of how the messaging works? I play PS4 and have never been subjected to begging...
---
Ooh. An Arktos one would be fantastic.
---
My Be flamer dies after 2 clips. Defo needs looking at.
---
Something similar happened at my camp once, I think it was server lag.
---
I logged into the game, was at my camp. Proceeded to goto my stash to move stuff around when a couple of the walls suddenly went \*poof\*
---
I think they were already destroyed, just that the server was slow and took a while to update it for my client.
---
I have the patient to wait for the Settlers but having to do it again for another character is a hard no-go.  
---
My time is worth a lot more for so little reward.
---
## and vice versa outfits as underarmor!
---
My step son made a character by that name. Has his soundboard literally begging people to go help this other settlement.
---
This has been posted like 25 times a day....for the past couple of months. How is this still shocking for a reddit user?
---
Hes just trying to let everyone know that he's that guy that is "Hardcore" and takes owned workshops because he can't live with PvPing everything and anything. He's also the guy that just like he says "You know what you're getting yourself into by claiming public workshops!" 
---
Dude give me break! Regardless of the mechanic of the workshops, its stupid to be a nuisance to people on the server. Just let players be. There is no need to disrupt their experience just because "its part of the game" and you feel the need to conduct a hostile takeover of someone's workshop and seek out blood.
---
Wait, are you on Xbox? Saw that scenario a couple of days back and was surprised that it still triggered the scorched earth event.
---
Tbh I think the camp cost is way too high. They should cost one flamingo unit each.
---
I dig it! I really like the new armor bench
---
Well let's hope Bethesda gets their shit together and decides to leave damage as it is I'm fine with one wasteland but it doesn't work if we get nerfed too
---
and some outfits show the gloves of the underarmor you‚Äôre wearing. if it has gloves.
---
Let‚Äôs see. Heart of the Swamp goes off. I fast travel to Dyer Chemicals. No on their players on the map or there sneaking around when I get there.
---
Strangler blooms are there. Kill gulpers and ghouls. Harvest plants. Make radshields.
---
Has 120 radshields, so puts some up for sale. They sell quickly. So every time I can go during heart of swamp event I get more and sell the extra. 
---
Keeps repeating this and for some strange reason, every single time I go when Heart of the Swamp starts, o get the same results over and over! 
---
And yet people keep telling me I‚Äôm wrong! Other people have the same experience! But they are wrong too! 
---
So I‚Äôm going to keep being wrong because It‚Äôs clearly giving me great results!
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhh
---
.it's a secret.  /s
---
Yup! Just tested yesterday. Thanks for posting. :)
---
I‚Äôve been looking for a Furious 25% AP redux 10mm SMG forever. I keep hoping someone tosses one in their vendor thinking no one would want it.
---
I‚Äôm disappointed it‚Äôs been a year and we never got persistent workshops which was one of the promised too come features.
---
You get some from the scorchbeast queen fights. 
---
You can craft it by getting the flora in nuked zones, then you have to kill enemies in the nuked zones and loot off of them you need a hardened mass, a glowing mass, high radiation fluids, and 10 of whatever type of flux you want to make. It takes quite a while to get some of those items (I never have enough high radiation fluids)
---
Yeah seems like you see two people at every boss event with a red asylum dress and a legacy plasma.
---
You can always let people preload the season and activate whenever you want tough.
---
But that's just me needing daily ops and legendary perks asap.
---
You should be fine. Worst case ask for a Steam refund.
---
Yeah, my Jangles the Moon Monkey is constantly fighting off new icons.
---
Are you saying we can stand directly under the falling debris while taking zero damage? 
---
I thought the debris caused high damage and then applied a lingering burning damage, and the asbestos chest only negated the burning damage but not the physical damage from the debris. Didn't wanna test it out myself because the respawn timer can get pretty horrible.
---
hmmm what are White Fedora's even selling for?
---
damn.  get a magic gat laser.
---
The music system is a mess and it‚Äôs sad to see because it‚Äôs literally one of the reasons people love the franchise (similar to GTA).
---
I am just sick of people bragging here about their silo success stories. Sorry, don‚Äôt mean to be mean but when I‚Äôm already sad, this is the last thing I wanna hear. This is a great community, but not when it comes to silo brag. :D
---
This would be pretty cool, especially when trying to craft things while using Super Duper. You don't know when it procs after the first time while you're in a crafting menu, so you can easily end up crafting more than what you were trying to.
---
But... it is a part of the game. Killing people at workshops to steal their junk and take the workshop is a 100% intended mechanic. Why wouldn‚Äôt you try to gain the upper hand by getting free resources in an online game? Your comment makes zero sense
---
I have scriped so many neat 10mm Smg because of how annoying this gun can be. Any QoL fix would be nice.
---
They don't pop up for each time you do sneak damage. How could the game handle the a mingun rate of fire of pop ups,when even something like entering a room can crash it?
---
I‚Äôm a select few that preferred the armor look over the cosmetics.   
---
But ever since SS armor I became an outfit wearer because that SS armor is ugly dog shit.
---
Why didn‚Äôt they give us the date at the start ü§î
---
We're you on a team when you ate it? Some buffs can be lost if you leave the team.
---
why are you all downvoting me I'm right bring back Caeser LEGIOn sorry for spelling but it would be very cool to enslave other players and take all of their stuff
---
when you run out of materials you've made enough
---
No falling damage at all...
---
https://youtu.be/7OvdEarxSYc
---
Then it wouldn't require any steel or wood or whatever else they are manufactured out of. And yes, some of the GPMGs were likely 25 yrs old, and some of the SA80s were approaching that I'd wager.
---
Either way, repairing a weapon multiple times in a single fight or several times an hour is a bit beyond cleaning and/or general maintenance, it's pure crap :-)
---
advocating for people to spend money on the season is always gonna earn you fire. 
---
I gotta say I agree we shouldn‚Äôt recommend this kind of thing until Big B gets its shit  together. (I would have been done two weeks ago if not for bones challenges)
---
Instagating pipe bolt action rifle is king. Pick both damage cards for rifle and pistol as they stack. Silencer with cards helps. Get limb damage as the other perk on the gun and cripple limbs. It's fun. Instagating Guass rifle is fun too.
---
Ok another idea:just run away from them.
---
This is why i have a room with vending machines and most of the craft tables that is open to everyone and they have a stash box and a scrap box too
---
All it really needs is the ability to take a sight and suppressor and it‚Äôd instantly become a top tier commando options.
---
In terms of pure DPS, it‚Äôs between the handmade and fixer, assuming best receivers for all 3. Here‚Äôs a breakdown assuming no perks or legendary effects:
---
* Fixer = 53 damage x 75 fire rate = 398
---
* Handmade = 50 damage x 75 fire rate = 375
---
* 10mm SMG = 42 damage x 91 fire rate = 382
---
A slight reduction to AP use would be nice too though. Wouldn‚Äôt complain if they did that.
---
This is awesome - thank you üëçüèº
---
Ship in a bottle, Bobblehead table football and the greenhouse kit look alright.
---
I've found lately that if i'm on a public team and crash, it gives me the option to rejoin.  I haven't tried to alt-f4 to do it on purpose though.
---
That run had a total of 4 players.
---
Two with Ultracite Laser Gatlings, they both broke them and had to repair it mid fight. I think these two were likely doing the bulk of the damage.
---
Me on Gauss Minigun, and broke so I switched to .50cal
---
And another guy on .50cal at the start who then swapped to LMG after his broke.
---
You need to buy the new camo t-65 skins on the Atom shop, it's the camo jetpack that's able to be put on other limbs right now.
---
What seems to work is thumbs down to that player, and a heart if they put it away. Most seem to get the message after a few ???‚Äôs
---
It's free either way but only one way you're just being a dick.
---
I‚Äôm on PC. Just a massive brain fart on my end.
---
....you can. You can wear outfits over your armor.
---
Ah ok weird.  Yah I fast traveled over...waited for the camp to load up (so I wouldn‚Äôt get stuck in a wall or foundation) then went over and checked the vendor... browsed a bit... then bam.  Blown up lol
---
I agree,basically an option to make it under armor or over would be nice.
---
Yeah I've had that happen a couple times not sure how to make it trigger every time though
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being a dick for using an intended game mechanic to get resources you want or need from another player who knows you‚Äôre able to take these resources from them and failed to defend themselves from you at a publicly raidable area‚Äù
---
It seems as if you are not the only one who had this happen.
---
If you can‚Äôt handle playing the game, just don‚Äôt play it. Simple.
---
Easiest thing I've found is just doing the SBQ fights and taking what she gives. I tried making it but I could never find enough of the mass and fluids etc. (of course lots of other players much higher level than me are out there farming it).
---
This is not entirely correct. You can buy both the serum and the serum recipe from the Enclave. Serums are around 3,000-4,000 caps and recipes around like 18,000+ caps depending on your charisma and perks. As others have said, the serum itself can usually be purchased cheaper from player vendors, you will not usually see the recipe at a player vendor unless they are trying to get rid of caps.
---
I usually go buy a serum recipe when I get close to max caps and then just throw a few of them in my vendor.
---
What build are y'all running that needs this many repairs? I struggled last week to hit the "repair 5 armor/weapons" challenge because my stuff rarely breaks. I have level 1 Lucky Break and Luck of the Draw, and those seem to ward off repairs quite a bit (maybe repair once a week per gun, even less for PA).
---
make sure the mutation is active in the effects page, you could have accidentally lost it or made it temporarily non effective. Also you can get it up to 25% with class freak
---
Or wood and leather armor skins. Who is wearing wood armor?!?
---
Ah, ok, thanks. I have a pile of Atoms I never use from FO1, anyway.
---
The team with six filled and you got put in a new instance.
---
Your absolutely right.i forgot steam has a good refund policy. I'll make that jump once 1st runs out ..if 76 is still going
---
The quest owner doesn't have to be there. I can activate any server I want from anywhere with my alt,it just needs to be somewhere in the server(and this is tested as well).
---
I also found some servers back to back when my simple option was to server hop and there was no swamp heart event. It's just coincidence.
---
You'll want Calibrated Shocks on the legs and the Targeting HUD for the helmet. The chest will depend on if you're a high health or low health build... Emergency Protocols if you're low health a must, and it's worth considering for high health as well... But the Core Assembly, Medic Pump and Kinetic Dynamo are all good options.. Or of course the jetpack is always fun but less useful during battle.
---
Agreed!
---
I'm on PC and it wsa fine for me roughly 9-10 CST.
---
Thats some damn fine booty to imbue your character with such wap glow
---
If you take from someone your level or higher, awesome. But 9 outta 10 times it's level 200+ players fucking with below 20's that probably haven't figured the game out yet. Yeah, if you're that guy you're just being a dick.
---
I just want a clean chem bench that doesn't look like I'll get tetanus just by looking at it.
---
I think it has something to do with the instancing of the event. So those six all were in the same instance then you and that other person were maybe just too late to join that instance. I believe it‚Äôs an 8 player max for instancing in that event but I could be wrong it may only be 2. But this has happened to me too and that‚Äôs the conclusion I‚Äôve come to each time, kinda frustrating but it makes it so it‚Äôs not too easy to kill Earle with like 20 people like the SQB.
---
On the atom store? I checked it doesn't
---
Pretty sure they're fixed on the pts
---
That is a great idea. And easy to implement, in a weapon or directly into the rifleman perks.
---
Whats acp? Is it the giant wendigo boss fight event?
---
Shotguns feel really good with that magic bug and that's a heart breaker to me..I used a magic shotty for 2 weeks alot of fun but sold it soon after so I wouldn't get attached.
---
I also believe the system prioritizes teams - if you're on a team &amp; you all jump into the event, it will try to keep you together. If not, you may get separated.
---
It's under the far right tab, where the free stuff tends to pop up lately.
---
YES. Maybe it‚Äôs special effect is a buff to incendiary, explosive, and grenade damage? Or energy weapons? Since it likes to burn and destroy?
---
I know its part of the game and it is what it is, but let's face it man...the pvp in this game needs to be removed. Besides the op and you obviously, how many people really care about it? The fact that there is an option to turn off pvp (pacifist mode) and that pvp can only be accessed through a specific area should tell you something. They just need to institute a full blown separate pvp adventure mode so you and the op can go banana sandwich and not be annoying to 99% of players that play adventure mode that don't like pvping and want to just explore while farming resources and having cool looking built up workshops. 
---
Because I know I've been ambushed after taking a workshop and started building up something nice. But I just move on after they get me. Its annoying but not the end of the world. It needs to be totally removed and put in its own mode.
---
This. Messages from randoms asking for crafting materials or food is annoying. Trying to help out a new player who then demands more stuff is annoying. Rude people, in general, are annoying.
---
I once had a random player initiate a trade, so I accepted. They had nothing of interest to me, but they wanted the 3 star TSE handmade and lever-action rifles I had. (One of them was even equipped at that moment.) I left the trade and went on my merry way. I got a message shortly after saying they wanted them. I said I'd consider selling if I switched to a heavy build, as I was planning to soon. Then I get another message saying that I need to put some better mods on before selling them to the player. Ummmm....what? My mind was blown.
---
Energy weapons as a whole need a buff because man are they fun to use casually
---
45 auto pistol from New Vegas please.
---
I believe +Limb Damage heavy weapons will still do quite a bit of good work...you may see more FFR/FR heavies as well.
---
I'm curious myself, as I do have quite the collection of different LMGs to play with, with different effects, to see what's still viable.
---
It‚Äôs quite nice, yes. Adds a touch of Art Deco to my CAMP.
---
I believe it‚Äôs affected by team numbers. Might have lost a teammate in the middle of timer
---
Probably like 2 feet miss :(
---
I hope they didn‚Äôt think it was me...
---
Mmm what about the fireproof perk? You would expect something good from the name and perk description,right?
---
Just a friendly reminder - most players don't use Arm Mods, so you'll probably want to apply this "glitched" paint to the arms &amp; then something else to your torso.
---
Yes although the last one that happened like this I didn't notice the person actually nuked the scorchbeast so most of the people on the server went there.  Me and 3 other people went to the mines.  We didn't have the firepower and two of them left to join the SBQ fight.  We ended up not being able to do the damage so we just farmed Windingo spawns for 15 minutes and left.
---
If I can't handle playing the game, lol. I can more than handle it cause no one fucks with my workshops. You all would rather go after low levels who you can shit all over and you know can't fight back to feel like a badass in the game.
---
Yes Preston Garvey,the minuteman from fallout 4,He made you a "general" but he orders you around and makes you go alone to settlements requiring your help.
---
I finished the legendary run. Now my daily play session is 10 minutes instead of 1 hour. Just enough time to hit the daily currency limits and log off.
---
Is there a how not to be a noob Video? I remember when I started bad company 2..I was that noob.everything that video said not to do I was doing.gaming has changed
---
I don‚Äôt really see any bragging in this thread. Don‚Äôt assume the worst in people.
---
Damage was changed but magic weapons still are "magic"  At least, last I checked; I suppose it could have changed in the last week.
---
It's possible the damage multiplier changes are a precursor to fixing magic weapons tho
---
The anti material rifle would be really easy to add. They already have the creation club model.
---
Reading prompts before accepting them? Taking responsibility for doing stupid stuff? Why would anyone want to do that when they can come whine on reddit and get sympathy from other people who can't be bothered to make any effort to avoid it?
---
Will test this afternoon
---
So if I have the pair keep the forest trade the other?I know we can change the color
---
Agreed. So just to confirm it is still working?
---
Is there anything more sad than someone looking for pvp at workshops?
---
 I was at whiteprings and someone had a camp right outside it with a scorch just plinking it over and over.  I was going to kill it but his prices were awful so I sat back to see what would happen and as soon as it blew up everything inside did too.
---
I'm pretty sure I've seen that happen with the greenhouses too so many it's any prebuilt building.
---
All these stories how high levels are always tossing low levels gear.  Now they think their owed the gear.
---
You don't have any repair kits on you? I just pop in and fight the queen whenever I can and I've got 20 on me and 60 in my stash.
---
As of this morning, but I haven't tried in the last two hours.
---
Yeah I mean why would anyone look for pvp in a pvp area...
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more.
---
My worry is the hot fix. If they didnt fix it with that it should stay for a couple days or even though to next Tuesday
---
I mean the basics are the same do missions, shoot bad guys get xp. But then you have all the extra stuff like crafting and such, plus they changed how the special system worked from fo4, so its just a new learning curve and was hoping there was a good old wall'o'text I could read somewhere.
---
There is someone in the comments saying their 12 yo son runs in 10 minutes. Isn‚Äôt that bragging?
---
Many of the paints you earn in Nuclear Winter work on all power armors, including Ultracite- UNTIL NOW that is.  The NW paints don't work on the T-65.  I really hate that.  Yes I submitted a ticket to Bethesda. No I didn't get   a response.  The Outcast paint you earn in Nuclear Winter is my favorite paint and I can't use it on my favorite power armor.
---
Oh so you‚Äôre the said boi. Makes sense why you posted this then.
---
Pretty sure more kid have ps than xbox.
---
Why don‚Äôt you server hop doc stanly at whitesprings resort and take care of your drug issues yourself?
---
The display frames are coming! I‚Äôll add the link if I can find it.
---
Ah ok.  This one was in the same area lol
---
Wait really???
---
Indeed it has, but I don‚Äôt mind selling some scrap to them if they ask politely.
---
I was tho.... He thought I was talking about a different daily
---
Honestly the other day I turned off notifications for messages I get from people who aren‚Äôt my friend. Has helped a bunch
---
If you find someone selling at 250 then buy them out and resell. I can‚Äôt keep my vendor stocked for more than a day listed at 500
---
I'm be shocked if they fixed it, because if they hadn't fixed it in Patch 21, putting it into a hotfix wouldn't make a whole lot of sense...but then again, it is BGS.
---
yeah, that would be so nice.  
---
Recoil on an smg should be pretty low.  like handmade low at least
---
Noticed this other day. Are another and went back to 20.
---
Available now!!
---
Good luck. They can‚Äôt even get our mags/cores to display proper levels. My character routinely reloads when there‚Äôs still ammo/power left.
---
I don't question anything anymore. BGS does their own thing and it will occasionally make sense
---
I believe the term is "You're having fun wrong!"
---
It's amazing how much you can get out of the game just exploring isn't it?
---
That would be incorrect.   Strange in numbers perk is what gives the extra 5%
---
Wow sir will you please sign my brain üß†
---
Love this
---
Bold of you to assume my gender.
---
Why do you have an issue with someone using a workshop as a consensual PvP area?  That‚Äôs a clearly designated function.
---
Hows gun fu with max adrenaline treating ya? Does it cost any ap when switching during gun fu??
---
Here‚Äôs the link! Like 3 mins in
---
https://youtu.be/W5ituDclklg
---
Oh is that all it takes? I just have to gut my build to fit in some food build perks and then drop eveything I own onto the floor because my stash is full ?
---
Well why didn‚Äôt you just say so!
---
Same boat here, didn‚Äôt sweat off any xp grinds with all the stacked consumable boosts. Weeklies and Dailies casually completed was more than enough.
---
Oh! Sorry, it‚Äôs just a habit. I am not a man either, I shouldn‚Äôt have done that.
---
Thank you
---
I think the north peak
---
I think it was shock. And they said 18 minutes.
---
Jeez....I'm level 198, and I **wish** I had 20 of each flux just for myself!
---
Umm no? Nothing was mentioned in the patch notes recently IIRC. Maybe it is just niche collectors trying to finish.
---
With the Lever Action, it's perfect. Just constant headshots all day!
---
And I don't believe so, or at least not noticed it.
---
Hare‚Äôs my take on this post:
---
OP would rather only fight players that are completely aware that these are PvP zones and are therefore prepared for the fight.  OP doesn‚Äôt enjoy PvP fights that are unbalanced or unfair for either side. 
---
If they did, why would they try to further spread the word and warn people?  If they wanted ‚Äòeasy prey‚Äô, then it would make more sense to stay quiet and let the uninformed newbie players keep marching in to their deaths.
---
Ok you think what you want.
---
hot damn and its just across from the trapped floor gnome
---
The hard part is copper and nuke material if u have any suggestions I‚Äôm all ears
---
Exactly! üòÇ
---
It was exhausting. Lol
---
It shouldnt be shots fired nor enemies hit. It should be measured by how many times you pulled the trigger and actually hit something. Bit of both.
---
Wow, thanks!
---
That would ruin my entire build. No thank you!
---
I have a TSE subbie that is now my main commando weapon since I dont have a TSE  fixer. I keep getting freaking heavy guns or nuke launchers for my commando at the purveyor. I love the little fella. Only problem I have is that it will sometimes stick on full auto even after a reload.
---
It‚Äôs almost as if people read all the stories on here about higher lvl players gifting new people gear and everyone thinks that it‚Äôs the norm instead of an exception.
---
I‚Äôm going to miss my shotgun if it ever changes. It‚Äôs nice to have a backup weapon that doesn‚Äôt require any perk point investment that you can use when dealing with mobs, etc. I wouldn‚Äôt mind a nerf on the range, but for up close and personal they are perfect right now. That‚Äôs the whole point of a shotgun, no?
---
Arm/leg tatts would be a welcome
---
Wendigo cave, abandon cave.
---
I never trust this broke as game anyway off gp have someone there to pick up items so they cant be lost
---
Fire proof helps delay death, i was able to run without it and *dance* in the falling embers using asbestos and had no fireproof perk on. 
---
Embers are 100% fire damage. Asbestos makes you fireproof 100%. Didnt even make the grunting hurt sound. Flat out invulnerable to fire.
---
It was supposed to be out yesterday but today is now supposed to be on there. I‚Äôm not home right now to check. But usually it‚Äôs the very bottom page right past the vaulting tab
---
Its a bug. 
---
Nuke Earl first, then no matter where the other 2 nukes go it will trigger CP.
---
Don't know how I didn't do it sooner
---
I usually leave a team until I get into the mine. Being the first event the day it was released on console I was in a team and only the four of us where there. So from then on I don‚Äôt join teams until I‚Äôm in mine.
---
That happened to me once but it was colored red. Almost like being disintegrated by a laser weapon.
---
Ultracite laser rifles already got a nerf back in patch 18 or 19 for no reason lol if they nerf it again then they‚Äôre officially the most out of touch devs of all time
---
Somebody gets it.
---
Xbox-I just successfully transferred several items between several toons on my own private server with no one else on it to join back on. Seems like it‚Äôs working properly (or as we, the player base, think it should I suppose)
---
I had a time like that
---
Dude I shit you not, same here. Still have the van sent set to.
---
Place survival tent in the right spot and it forces all enemies to spawn right in the middle. Easy to tag for tons of XP
---
Power armor displays have been data mined. They are coming soon it seems.
---
That‚Äôs why I have like 5 of em on me at all times lol
---
Lieutenants Hat, please
---
One of the fringe benefits of berserker builds....
---
Do you not?
---
Yeah like the scavenger station from fo4 maybe
---
This question was asked about a week or 2 ago and a Bethesda Dev said they would Pass it along to the team I believe
---
Had that in mind too but it feels like we never gonna see that happen. Sadly.
---
Looks pretty slick with the Greaser Jacket and Jeans. That outfit plus Marsupial plus no fall damage legendary armor plus USSS chest with jetpack really does make you feel like a gun-toting Spiderman.
---
&gt;They just need to institute a full blown separate pvp adventure mode
---
They did. It was called **‚ÄòSurvival Mode‚Äô.** 
---
If you want that to come back, go tell Bethesda. If you want PvP removed from Adventure Mode, go tell Bethesda. 
---
Giving someone grief for using a game mechanic *as designed* is poor form. Especially when they are trying to warn newer players.
---
Are you sure that's not just the glitch where SCORE isn't awarded until you exit any PA suit?
---
but they looked EVERYWHERE
---
Yeah the dude got extremely angry at me like I was duping or selling hacked weapons. But yeah I bought it and put the jetpack on my arm but I didn‚Äôt have the time to start testing it but I‚Äôll see if that works
---
Is this for score challenges that you completed while in PA that didn't unlock until you exited?
---
Exactly - for now we should get a free antibiotic for using it lol
---
I think the need to fix magic damage and the do the one wasteland thing but no damage nerf also inward considering fallout first but if the nerf everthing I'm not buying
---
My point exactly
---
Just use The escevator! The 40% damage reduction from being in PA and The 50% damage reduction from emergency protocols makes stats mean nothing and you can carry all you want. 
---
But you loose all of the effects of your armor pieces when you step into a PA wich means that bloodied builds Will loose their unyielding effect wich is a huge down side. Not to mention backpack mods. This is why i never use it. Plus its clunky
---
Uhhh.... Use Excavator PA for extra carry weight?
---
Oh yeah I get it confused sorry
---
1.  That‚Äôs not an exploit. It‚Äôs a delayed notification from challenges you completed while in the Power Armor. 
---
2. Read the rules of this sub. Discussing or promoting exploits is not allowed here. Please find a more appropriate venue for this discussion.
---
*But... there‚Äôs no triangle button on my keyboard.*
---
I totally agree ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
There aren‚Äôt any NCR logos. There is a CPD logo.
---
Multiple police departments as well as the Marine Corps used the Tactical Riot Armor. It is lore friendly pretty much anywhere in the US.
---
I love those that beg for legacies,  "I have nothing, would really like a legacy, give me one UwU"
---
Right now, she only has a reference to Duchess‚Äôs questline. Adding some for each step of the wastelanders plot and a reference to the Queen fight would be great!
---
Of course, giving her a physical location would be even better...
---
Must have switched off his targeting computer.
---
nm
---
Being over encumbered isn't the issue with power armour, its the poor protection, I would do better with  unyielding wood armour.
---
No i know I meant if they added future paints with the ncr logo then its not lore friendly unless it stand for North Carolina Republic
---
I wanna be able to meet her ;-;
---
This is why I was working on getting one card of each rank... I was going to have maximum versatility for altering my build! And then I read how the legendary perk system was going to work so I stopped immediately.
---
all servers will refresh when you log out and back in , to do it on a public server you need someone on your friends list in the server to get back in. You can also be on a team and close app and when you start back up you can rejoin the team if it still exists.
---
Yeah, even though Bethesda has confirmed that the Atomic Shop is mostly not canon, this one never broke any lore. People assumed it did, but that was an error on their part. The outfit says CPD, not NCR.
---
My FO76 experience since I finished has been:
---
* Log in
---
* Check player's camps for cheap legendaries and anything neat or useful
---
* Script to 150
---
* Buy 200 gold
---
* Log out
---
It takes about 20 minutes.
---
What achievement are you trying to get?
---
All the achievements are pretty straight forward and you shouldn't really need a guide to get them all. And yeah, this game got review bombed hard.
---
I know what you meant. I was agreeing with you. 
---
We have about 80 years to go before the NCR even exists.
---
Why does it matter if you hit something?
---
We need:
---
1. Chinese Pistol and it's Legendary variant Zhu-Rong (fire bullets)
---
2. Light machine gun from New Vegas
---
3. Red dot sight for the 10mm smg and the Pump-action shotgun
---
4. Silencer for the 10mm smg
---
5. 12.7mm Smg and pistol
---
6. Robot companions &amp; Robot repair kits
---
I know but I saw a couple people saying it can't be lore friendly when it can so long as it doesn't say ncr
---
Posts like these are why reddit gets pegged as a toxic community. :/
---
Nuka-Cola chemistry bench would be neat too.
---
it is annoying. i changed my build so often, i got several adrenaline cards for example, 1 five star, 1 four star and a 3 star im actually using. luckily i grinded quite much xp and dont mind about the spend levels. also, with legendary perks comin soon, this will clean up quickly.
---
Is there an actual Beth stated start date for season 2, as some of us need a bit more time for season 1, especially as some days the challenges were greyed and we couldn‚Äôt do them?
---
With white sides and a stainless steel countertop.
---
I‚Äôve only heard them say that the Atomic Shop might not always have canon accurate items. But so far, nothing in the Atomic Shop has broken canon or lore. 
---
Added to it or clarified, sure. But not broken.
---
I thought the triangle becomes the shoot button when it gets full
---
Are you kidding? Atom Shop will never be down unless there is a update.
---
Herbivore does work with fruit.
---
Yea I have levels to use tbh but it's an annoying part of the perk cards. Also with legendary perks and everyone scrapping spare cards won't that limit loadout flexibility even more?
---
You are correct there, but I'm a little odd when it comes to certain things, like, I like to craft the same amount of each serum every time I do it, but always end up with 5 of one, 7 of another, or 8 or 9. Makes it easier to keep my vending machine stocked if I always just have 5 of everything until it sells out, then refill it. Idk. I just get irritated when I want a nice round number of something and have to keep checking if super duper made more than I realized. Lol
---
Thanks! I built a camp spanning the two, then moved up into the south peak. I‚Äôll jet pack my ass over there and see what craziness awaits.
---
The Wendigo's will drop whatever ammo you've used on them. Depending on the gun you're using you'll recoup a portion of your ammo, or walk out with more than you come in with.
---
Sort of. You don‚Äôt get the ammo you used back, but the ammo *type* you used to kill things is what you can loot from the enemies, instead of completely random annoying.
---
Kill something with your Handmade, it will have 5.56 ammo as part of its loot.
---
Some. The adds drop whatever ammo you kill them with. I still end up 1000+ worse off though
---
If the mutation gets suppressed by something like Rad-X, you will lose the bonus until Rad-X wears off. It's hard to say without full context.
---
Happened to me for the first time today and autocompleted 3 of the easiest ones; sell to a player, eat pre-war food, etc. The funniest part was that the, 'Complete 5 Daily Challenges' one only had 1 towards being completed.
---
I run with every mutation except herbivore and love it. There is a lot of great info here, but I haven't seen anyone mention the perk Strange in Numbers:  It boosts positive effects 25 pct...
---
 AND IT STACKS. If you are on a team with three others and they are all sharing it the effects are insane. Some effects like speed demon are capped so not much to talk about there but things like Marsupial will let you jump ridiculously high, pair that up with bird bones which slows your falling speed and you are in the air long enough to get 4-5 shots in using a lever action. Everyone should be sharing it.
---
So. Much. This!!
---
Just a plain clean version of the chemistry bench would make my life
---
Honestly as a new player I prefer it that way, it can definitely be fun if someone comes and starts shooting stuff with you. But I actually want to earn my stuff, that's most of the fun.
---
Uncanny caverns has a bunch that you can find along the paths.
---
I got shit aim
---
Omg this too!!!!! For real, the amount of button pushing for crafting ammo is insane. I'm going to have to sue Bethesda for the damage to my fingers
---
You mean like never ever? 
---
How much time do you leave in between trying to get back into your private server?
---
So that's why all my wendy spawns left loads of shotgun shells behind.
---
Nope. You get both of them and their quests no matter what.
---
Those people are incorrect. Nothing in the Atomic Shop has yet broken lore.
---
# Out of everything - this one has to go yesterday
---
Tbh I have 15 luck visually and about 5 from armor and under armor
---
None of my luck perks ever proc like repair wep and armor, goualish or ect ever..
---
Can confirm, I walked out with more shells than I came in with.
---
No it can just be collectors
---
Scrip
---
But...those types of posts are fun to read! I'll never tire of them.
---
You are awesome!!! I thought I'd have to wait a while for the answer
---
Not sure if this has been asked before, but assuming it‚Äôs still possible to mod an arm with the jet pack using this new paint skin, if like me you don‚Äôt like the new paint, can you then revert back to your preferred paint without removing the glitched jet pack mod on the arm?
---
Was destroyed long before the kiddies came. When they implemented llamas in closed alpha, the game went way down hill. 
---
When the creative directory of a game gets mad the top 1% of hardcore players can farm and beat it in 200 hrs with a min max strategy so they decide to add enough roadblocks to 10x that time without new content, can the game ever really be alive?
---
I always run into the weird low levels. The ones that stay at your camp for hours, doing nothing but stand there. I can say that adding FO76 to the Xbox Gamepass definately attracted the beggers.
---
Not that I am aware of, Beckett is against the Blood Eagles who even the Crater Raiders think are insane. As far as I remember neither character directly sides with either faction.
---
Welll maybe the communist power armor paint but I think it is very possible that the Chinese military had Prototype power armor i feel we don't know much about China a Europe
---
U mad?
---
Yeah it would be nice if we escaped the mine to a spot that wasn't in a raging nuke zone. The first time I got shanked by a mole miner while trying to quickly get into power armor, and the second time I got the fast travel bug and died while trying to travel out of there repeatedly.
---
Third time I remembered my hazmat suit and crept my heavy ass out of there.
---
Still alittle weird that they have a whole ass section of their monetary shop dedicated to this and someone still has to ‚Äúpass it along‚Äù like???
---
There could be my friend
---
No start date announced yet, but they did say season one is over on Sept 8th. There will be double score till then though.
---
It was a super underrated set for a junkie imo. We had three of us with it and the regent stacked. Amazing. I still have mine too but the jet pack is a bit addictive.
---
i‚Äôve seen someone nuke monongah city, and not the mine lol
---
I emote them or msg them to come to me when they finally find me i drop a "you have been insulted" note after I did it my first time i put up a post to buy these notes i have 10 left so im using them sparingly
---
FYI X01 base armor plans are free on a terminal , located next to the scout armor mod vendor in enclave bunker.
---
Replying to a post with a statement doesn't make me mad, but your reply makes me think you might be.
---
It‚Äôs a bundle.
---
It usually shows up around New Years but I got mine around Wild Appalachia‚Äôs launch when it first came out
---
Yeah, apparently it's a colossal problem for some.
---
If you one shot wendigos with ammo it‚Äôs a 33 to 1 return.
---
Yeah, it's nice to get Ultracite .308 back when I kill the spawns....but it's nowhere near the volume I end up using.
---
The giant nuka cola bottle in the river.  Inside it there is a safe on the bottom underwater near a submerged Mr. Cappy.  
---
Also the NPC that is outside of Vault Tech university is the same voice as the Shady Sands leader Aradesh from Fallout 1
---
I'd love to be able to provide voice lines for them too.....ah, the possibilities!
---
I‚Äôve been wondering the same thing. I have an Instigating Gauss minigun with faster fire rate and reload. I added the penta barrel for even faster fire rate which gets it to 145 (I think that‚Äôs the highest it can go?). It didn‚Äôt seem to do much against Earle. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to test it against SBQ since it‚Äôs a fairly new weapon for me.
---
There are a lot of informational gaps. We don‚Äôt even know for sure who launched their nukes first.
---
However, having a different external facade doesn‚Äôt change the internal workings. If it‚Äôs acceptable that someone could make a Bone Raider exterior for the Excavator Armor, then the same holds true for the Communist Skin. A little metal work plus some green &amp; red paint and there you go. 
---
There are no mechanical or tactical differences, so having a different paint job isn‚Äôt lore-breaking.
---
Just make sure you switch back to your main character before you claim the rewards on the board. Things like the lunchboxes, bullion, etc, go to the character that claims them.
---
i get back around 30 2mm ec and it takes me 1 or 2 to kill the wendigos. which is nice
---
If it was generic riot armor alone, yes, I agree. That can show up anywhere. That specific riot armor + that specific cowboy duster? That's out of place in an east coast Fallout game; it's the LAPD riot armor.
---
No it‚Äôs not. I saw a post earlier this month debunking that claim.
---
Giving us Nukashine is kinda insulting JFC. 
---
Like come on. 
---
What‚Äôs next for season 3 wood and stimpaks?
---
This kinda love won‚Äôt pay the rent m‚Äôdear
---
Same here, I think I'm walking around with something like 100 of the things.
---
At least you still get a nuked zone. Right around the mine there are a fuck ton of yellowcakes
---
No, you wouldn't.  Power armor has the best protection in the game.
---
It looks cool on female characters tho...
---
If you have a lot of friends, go in to the Atom Store and change your Icon. Repeat that step until your friend list syncs correctly. If your friends list shows up, gut it. Delete anyone you don't play with. Lots of friend list issues are caused by having too many friends
---
It actually says cpd Charleston Police Department but the duster coat yes I'll give you that but it looks like that actually comes with that armor as a whole because of the metal thing on the back
---
I uhh... well not me that's for sure.
---
or you know. Don't do this. It's a dick move. 
---
It rustles my jimmies when someone buys like 9 of a serum. or 4 and 5 of each. because then i have to go and make more and get more ingredients. And the more people do this the closer i get to saying 'fuck it' and either not making them or putting the price right up. 
---
Which defeats the purpose of having them cheap so people can get serums without being paying silly caps for them.
---
You make a valid point not sure how the there eyes work tho
---
I played it until "recently" when they put a nail in the coffin by announcing it's not going f2p. Got all the achievements... even the complete 1,000 play with others. I was just delusional - hoping f2p would be the spark in popularity needed to put save the world back on the agenda, but alas Epic can go suck a dick.
---
They just want it to stay premium so it dies a slow death and no one can see just how little effort they take developing the game compared to the battle royale version. :( 
---
Not touching any games made by that company again!
---
&gt; "to the NCR Ranger Outift for Fallout 1st from New Vegas"
---
Yeah I agree but that NCR outfit shouldn't have never been tied to a FO1s subscription. Especially after the community asked for it for so long way before Fo1st was announced.
---
I would hope that the changes to the damage multiplier calculation are a precursor to a general balance fix - making outgoing damage more predictable has been repeatedly stated as the main motivation for that change, after all. Right now, though, both a fix for the "magic" weapons and a general balance patch seem to be at least a few patches away, if what I hear about the current PTS build is any indication.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/u9za0Pu.png](https://i.imgur.com/u9za0Pu.png) 
---
Only one I could find though I also recall seeing some that would fit things like the bunker and field station as well. Can't find them at the moment. Thought they were part of that same datamine.
---
The bones are the skeletons dollars
---
I understand that it has a different stencil on it, but that armor + that coat is a clear reference to old west rangers. There isn't an equivalent to that on the east coast. I think the Secret Service Armor and the scout armor are good east coast lore-friendly equivalents.
---
nothing, literally nothing. nobody cares for them
---
It's easy to kill anyone though.  Pvp is terrible.  This is why people get mad when they die in workshops.  They're just trying to get it for the score challenge or maybe collect a few resources but some idiot level 500 just *has* to steal all their junk.
---
nocturnal does need a buff though. Like. a massive increase in damage at night. maybe then people might use them.
---
Did the load in thing and watched as it all popped up and took 2 steps then KABOOOM whole camp just explodes! !???  Funniest and most awkward thing ever.
---
600hrs int he game and I haven't experience any begging on PC. Maybe once when a guy asked for a stimpak? Is this a Console thing because of the messaging system probably?
---
I have two wood sets but I also agree with your question:
---
who actually wears it and doesn‚Äôt want to become a paste every 3 seconds.
---
I mean you essentially cut the time they said they did it in half... so yea... a 45% difference is material
---
No wendigos drop energy ammo just not fusion and plasma cores
---
No, nothing at all.
---
According to this video, you can get magic effects with fire rate between 100-200 depending on a few other factors. The definitive guide on magic weapons. AngryTurtle put the time in researching this a while ago.
---
https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs
---
Damn, so you were always a clown? That's crazy.
---
Which dupe?
---
Thought it might be the pc script dupe, but the hotfix notes make no mention of it being pc only.
---
So it sounds like there was a console dupe that got patched?
---
&gt;Maybe you could even expand some weapons like how you did with the new Gauss weapons (Tesla Minigun anyone?) 
---
They have literally the best endgame weapons from Fallout 2 sitting unused, the pulse pistol and pulse rifle. And no, not the EMP ones seen in later games.
---
Anybody notice you never get a ‚Äúplease‚Äù or a ‚Äúthanks‚Äù either?
---
Only $20/month!
---
You don't need to wait for it to break. The condition bar dropping a tad below full is enough to repair it.
---
They did. They said it would last 10 weeks, which it has. Problem is people didn't know what was happening on the downtime between seasons, whether Zorbo would stay at 100 until the next season starts etc. At least now it's clarified it's ending on the 10 weeks with no other way to finish it after.
---
at twin lakes there‚Äôs a skelton that had been sunbathing nude. there‚Äôs a swimsuit next to the body.  if you go on the other side of the stream there‚Äôs a gnome hiding with a camera
---
I can launch some for ya won't be on for a few hours tho
---
Exactly, didn't have 3 with it. Just the two, but yeh that jetpack is fun, only just started using mine recently. Got a decent one a little while ago but never used it. Man I wish I put it on sooner, it bring a whe new level of fun to the game regardless of how you play. ‚úä‚úä‚úäüòÇü§£
---
The armor is fine but the coat maybe you see the helmet and chest plate are fine because are pre war riot armor so to find these in a police department barracks is lore friendly police tend to use the same equipment as other departments
---
Real talk:
---
I‚Äôm tired of them switching real ‚Äúrewards‚Äù (what most players would regard to be rewards) for stims and other consumables that drop every 9 seconds as event rewards. 
---
There‚Äôs literally a quest that gaurantees a keycard. It‚Äôs so goddamn easy to do. 
---
I would be embarrassed to launch a seasons run with nukashine and nuclear keycards in it. 
---
What‚Äôs next missiles lol?
---
[this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/gjxyoj/insult_bot_might_be_sentient_yall/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) is probably the best he‚Äôs ever hit me with and I needed some ice for that one.
---
Noticed this today while looking through. I broke a little as there is SO many for me, not just the couple location and bugged dailyq ones i read about. Rip lost atoms. Don't know how i am supposed to prove a lot of those to ticket it.
---
Oh ok
---
Right I forgot. Fair fair. 
---
Deleting my stupid Q
---
I've started giving nuke keycards to whoever drops one on earle. If i can find them (the player not the card)
---
If you've killed them and it didnt give you credit, your only recourse is to do it on a different character. That often works on many of the broken challenges except for the SBQ. This workaround never worked for her even on a private server solo.
---
Yes! Same here... had an 8 year old Level 3 jump on to our team with the mic on demanding we speak to him. I bumped him off the team because we were all over Level 200 or close to it. No time to babysit! He jumps back on again. I ignore his pissy attitude and bump him again. He jumps on our team a third time with the smartass remark that it's a public team and he has the right to be on our team! (True it's a public team but it was MY team that I created and therefore MY right to decide who is on it! Like WTF? Like where are his parents? I wanna thank them for raising a smartass little shit that already has that entitled attitude...)
---
About 2 weeks ago, somebody posted on this sub about why nocturnal weapons are awesome. But for the love of me, I can‚Äôt figure out how to link that post here. Lol. üòÖ
---
The 'other factors' are mostly what I mentioned.  Close to 200, but two shot or explosive weapons each double the number of hits.
---
Great idea. I wonder if I just put a few in vendor for free it would encourage lol.
---
No question is stupid man, don't worry!
---
This game makes me want to vomit out my ass sometimes.
---
I use them both and I can assure you, my guns break several times during events. When I unequip them, they still break just as often. Still broken imo.
---
üëäüèª
---
I'll acp farm with you gt? Can provide 3 nukes every 1.5 hours
---
No, it has the best DR, but when you rock full unyielding sentinels and the relevant defensive perks it gives a lot better protection than any power armour
---
My dream is that some day, they buff the plasma caster up to its F:NV op-ness.
---
I hate nearly all the girl hairstyles, they definitely need some love.
---
Someone else said it but the achievements are really really straightforward on what you have to do. 
---
For some I recommend you find a friend and help each other do them. 
---
The hardest achievements by far are becoming allied with raiders and settlers because it takes months of irl time if youre not abusing exploits.
---
The real solution is to use a 50 cal.  It's so ammo efficient.
---
I dont agree with if you had fun. I brought it day one and just felt the world was empty and boring thats why I came back after the wastlanders update and now I love the game. Its very annoying seeing those post alm the time, cause if you want to know if it got better, play it and form your owe opinion of it, rather than not play a game because of some peoples opinion.
---
l o l
---
My parents are in their 70s and play pretty casually. If they login they only play for 1-3 hours, and don't play every day. They also barely paid any attention to the run. I constantly remind them to "check the game board" and they are always super excited to go in and claim rewards they don't even know they have.
---
They were both at rank 70+ this past weekend. I fully expect them to get close to finishing, and they are easily the most casual players I know. They never grinded xp, or events, etc, and still will get through more than 3/4 of the run, and may even still finish it.
---
I think at the end of the day we have to acknowledge that the run was good, especially for casual players, as a source of for short term goals you can hit every day with immediate rewards for your progress.
---
I had fun grinding it out and finished almost a month early. I'm actually looking forward to season 2 and the next grind!
---
Same i have a instagating
---
That doesn‚Äôt work on the guass minigun
---
Seriously, I fast traveled to my camp and the goddamn queen was chilling on my roof
---
That sucks so bad! I feel your pain. I've only done (assisted with) the silos 2 or 3 times, so I'm not the best at it, and I struggled too, so I'd be feeling salty in your shoes, too!
---
Emergency protocols?  You can run the perks with power armor as well.  As well as the flat 42% damage reduction.
---
LOLOLOLOLOL
---
I mean use a 50 cal machine gun instead of the minigun.
---
30k points for 1500 rounds is pretty crap though
---
üíú bask in his light my friend
---
I am
---
At least the ultracite ones have a faster fire rate
---
It was the script dupe they patched, seen people talking about it on Discord
---
neah. someone would take and sell probably.
---
i also start an encryptid after as well.
---
It's free so of course it does.
---
What‚Äôs with all these posts botching about how people play the game? If you don‚Äôt like it pay big daddy Bethesda and go in your private server.
---
I bought this too and then realised it was the same as the normal jukebox. Thought they might have 2 options so you could choose.
---
Gold or glowing Cultist vine sleeves pls
---
I'd just be happy not having to waitv5 min, or re-equip my weapon to see what I've made. Game seems to lag behind, especially if I craft a large batch
---
I didn't think it was too much effort, certainly much better QoL in the game now no one can message me.
---
It says invalid link.
---
To add to your point. This game runs poorly most of the time. I have freezes, lag spikes, dash boarding etc... and yet people keep suggesting shit that would make the game unplayable. I‚Äôve read so many suggestions over the last couple years where they want really elaborate stuff added that would make my xb1 cry. They want swarms of creatures, or tornados and other crazy weather effects. Like, my game crashes about 50% of the time if it‚Äôs raining in white springs.
---
Strangler pods become stragler blooms when it is verdant season in the mire
---
A shotgun only fires one shot at a time.
---
That would be dope, but I'm confused why the hotfix notes don't say pc only then
---
There's also a bit at Whitesprings where the robot is cleaning up corpses near the buses by one of the main entrances.
---
I just one shot the spawn with Ultracite .45 and kill Earle with regular .45, nice way to farm Ultracite .45 because it's so hard to get Cobalt Flux.
---
I find that a good prime gatling laser or plasma is the best. They‚Äôre more annoying efficient and the cores usually only cost about 100 caps each.
---
I disagree on the damage part for Ultracite lasers. Because RoF is higher. What I don‚Äôt understand is why the magazine is smaller in automatic version of laser rifle. It should have a larger capacity since it hits faster but with not as much punch as regular laser rifle.
---
I would like to see an overall buff to laser damage. But until they fix the Legacy (explosive) issue with LR, not sure that is going to happen.
---
This isn‚Äôt a problem with ultracite gatling laser.
---
Laziness, poor wording, didn't feel need to specify....who knows, 100% they patched the script dupe though.
---
Sounds like someone took your junk.
---
Sry but crying wont bring it back
---
I agree! After a while of hearing the same lines over and over, it gets about as annoyingly repetitive as some of the allies' constant broken record dialogue. It kills the fun of the radio at that point.
---
I would love to have a Bozar from FO:2/FNV:GRA
---
You play it, what do you think? 
---
 No it‚Äôs not that bad and never was as bad as some reviews would make you think.
---
Joke is on them, I don't have shit.
---
Play Animal Crossing.
---
Big oof.
---
If I hear Daguerre say "I can't shake these nightmares" one more time
---
They don't seem to drop fusion cells hardly at all. I maybe get a 100+ back after spending 1k.
---
New skins for scrap box too would be nice
---
Yes, I unequipped Gunsmith (lvl 5) and have seen zero difference in the degrade speed of my guns.  I only have lvl 1 White Knight, so wasn't getting a noticeable benefit from the armour degrade, but MANY others have confirmed that both are broken.
---
I found a magic shotgun shortly after 50, used it for almost 70 levels begore finding out it was magic. It got me through a lot and ended up selling it for 3k just so i wouldnt have that crutch while playing anymore. 
---
Really got too reliant on just switching to my sjotgun when shit got thick and giving it up really made my build and my playstyle a lot better.
---
Just to tack on before you have a bad time.  The glowing mass, high radiation fluids, and hardened masses will not decay over time.  The nuked flora will though into inert flux (basically just water).  So you can farm the stabilizing items ahead of time.
---
It's not on the section of "Free Stuff" when you click on that.
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
These are the one thing I feel like should always be available...sigh
---
Was too busy trying to keep adds off myself and the others to be able go through the repair process.
---
Basically, I was the punching bag getting the adds aggro, keeping others free to keep shooting Earl.
---
No, duped items don't lead to bans, actions do :-)
---
Rolled?  Just pick the perk yourself.
---
This I don't mind.  If they are clearly making something and ask for I need X of Y then at least I know what it is going to and isn't just them wanting a hand out.  We have all been there were we 'just' ran out of something we needed.
---
I had no idea that is how it works, but that explains so much. Sometimes my grenade launcher will be half full after a LITS, other times I need to repair it halfway through.
---
Why would I?
---
Beans? Eating too many beans?
---
Also depends on your frame rate and your ability to shoot the same spot on your target. For example a LMG with ~150 FR with high frame rate (above 60 FPS) will still do great magic damage.
---
A quick thing I learned is you can repair it from your wheel. If you have the gun favorited. Just pop open your wheel click on the gun click R3 I am on PS4 and then you can repair it really quick
---
Was wondering this today if weapons were shots fired for durability loss or if explosive made them break faster too, so how is it determined? Was going to try and calculate how many shots with each weapon but that would take awhile lol
---
I take people asking this to be more of "Hey, I don't care if you say no, but do you have extra so I can finish what I am crafting?"  Its sort of a take a penny leave a penny thing.
---
Still need the ally with the foundation and crater, plus get to 100 which im currently at 80, and the 300 and 1000 gold bullion, plus the buried treasure and all that glitters thats im not complaining like im enjoying it, just a lot of people slate it and even on trueachievments as well i just dont think its that bad
---
Yes, but with 15 INT, Gunsmith 5, and Luck of the Draw 1, I could fight multiple SBQ events and have it hardly drop 10% durability. I use Improved Repair kits when I repair, so the weapons were at 150% when the challenge started.
---
Ended up removing Gunsmith and Luck of the Draw for a few fights to whittle down the durability.
---
You most likely had something like GameEngine running w/o renaming it's process.
---
Beth scans for several process names to catch cheater.
---
Thanks for the tip, will have to break something to see how it works
---
Pa is a full body riot shield.
---
i guess it is the fault of the broken economy on this game, crafting is incredibly bottlenecked (even on higher levels) you need tons of lead to craft enough ammo and it weighs a lot forcing you to run around over-encumbered.
---
You can put a stock on it, yet it doesn't make it a rifle. It's ridiculous.
---
Could you point out where I said I go after low levels? No? That‚Äôs strange, because you seem to clearly recall me saying that
---
While this is a great idea, it is too convenient so we won‚Äôt get it. Convenience doesn‚Äôt go hand in hand with Bethesda. Good show though ol chap!
---
This for sure. with the way the item crafting is set up, there are only a handful of "base" models with all the customizations giving the illuision of a lot of weapon options. There are only 4 shotguns (a couple more if you include the splitter barrels on energy weapons). And there are only a couple pistols.  
---
what this game needs is more Base weapons, and not gimmicky shit like the harpoon gun. We need real base weapons for all weapon types and balanced so that there isn't just 1 end game choice.
---
Works just fine for me. But just in case, it can also be found at our [Bethesda Plz page](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz).
---
Yes emergency protocols help but with stat boost from unyielding improving  blocker, dodgy, evasive and barbarian. Then the 75% chance of 45%damage reduction you are still better off with crap or even broken unyielding sentinels armour.
---
Lmao
---
It‚Äôs either in the description or the name, it says classical. If you didn‚Äôt assume it played classical because it‚Äôs called the classical jukebox that‚Äôs your fault
---
Crappy thing is, I'll offer to trade legendarys for screws and get called a beggar.
---
Not one from InsultBot, but one that should be added.
---
Over on the ChatMod on PC, someone said this.
---
You're called #1 because when you shoot Earl, all you see is 1, 1, 1, 1.
---
An incredibly obvious and easily done option for a jukebox to have! How absurd.
---
One of my top 10 wishes from 2019 was they would make the nukashine paint set be a **actual set** ^((once upon a time it said nukashine bench was a paint set incorrectly)^)
---
Not just a singular skin. 
---
The fermenter should be able to look just as good as the brewing station if you own the skin for the other. It‚Äôs the same damn material swaps.
---
Instanced camps are in the making.
---
How does PA affect locks?
---
any info on what that details ?
---
Proper gauss weapons from Fallout 2. And this [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/5.56mm\_pistol\_(GRA)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/5.56mm_pistol_(GRA)) and this [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/12.7mm\_pistol](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/12.7mm_pistol) and this [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/12.7mm\_submachine\_gun](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/12.7mm_submachine_gun) and this [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bozar\_(GRA)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bozar_(GRA)) and this [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Survivalist%27s\_rifle](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Survivalist%27s_rifle). We need more weapons.
---
Evasive and barbarian are essentially useless.  How does blocker benefit? (It doesn't.)  Last I checked 
---
.75 x .45 = .3375 &lt; .5. Emergency protocols is still better.
---
many play on their parents' xbox. It is more annoying when they are the children of friends.
---
Ôøº
---
Nope, they just spewed a lot of marketing speech at the con, nothing concrete.
---
my bad then. I use the plasma gat and never get any ammo but plasma core is somehow cheap
---
Happened to me today while transferring to a mule. It only happened once but I noticed my mule and I were in separate private servers.
---
Like 1 and 6 character swaps tho.
---
Are they perhaps high RoF or Shotgun ‚Äúmagic weapons‚Äù?
---
cool
---
my char only has 4 luck - used for starchedgenes2 and classfreak2.  As a result, I have to swap out when i craft and need superduper3.  Sometimes,I forget to swap back, and end up losing a random mutation.
---
When you find serums cheap, buy 2.  That way if you do accidentally lose one, you can get it back without having to hunt all over the map for a replacement.
---
Is this chem able to be sold or traded?
---
I've heard between 1-2k
---
I heard about those. They should be pretty neat and allow them to really expand on the camp budget.
---
Just wondering if there has been anything private server specific in the last few months
---
Are you on Xbox?  If you are, send me a message, GT is the same as you see here.  I will show you a nice trick for the silo (after my teachings you will be beat any 12 year olds time here - promise.)  Sorry that happened to you.
---
That gap between a mask and an outfit bugs the hell out of me. It shouldn't, but it does.
---
You can scrap most of your weapons or scrip any legendaries you aren't using.
---
I‚Äôve been getting some from Earle. So I guess you can do either of the big bosses.
---
I bought FO1st and haven't looked back
---
Agreed. Fat mans break after two-three shots when you really want to use it (in a group) and it‚Äôs depressing.
---
I wish. Not sure that they would handle it properly tbh. 
---
I've been wishing for zenimax to incorporate that idea on ESO.
---
Don't keep so many weapons and junk. If the weapons not good enough to trade, scrip it. Don't keep more than like 50 of each junk, maybe a bit more or less of some. Don't keep chems or ammo in your stash either
---
Let's talk about the two shot MIRV fatman and its 8x.
---
Only from the spawns, not from the big man himself.
---
It‚Äôs by design. It‚Äôs to keep us off of the explosive laser teat because they don‚Äôt have a good fix for it or are delaying one
---
Bloody "nerf", not looting Earle, done with legendary run
---
Not afaik.
---
Yeah, one piece outfits. But I cant wear a cosmetic for each armor slot
---
Are there still exploits for it?
---
more like a walkin' TANK
---
Which is why pa is so great.
---
Only about 100 of each kind  of junk and 150-200 for the important ones. No chems, no armor and only valuable weapons. Following these steps my stash is 600/800 almost always.
---
picking flowers for 2 hours is more fun than spamming a button for 21 ammo
---
or u can uninstall the game if everything bothers you why u even play lol go play fall guys
---
PlEaSe NeRf BlOoDiEd, I CaNt tAg oR OnE ShOt mObS WiTh a qUaLiTy Of lIfE BuIlD So I dOnT ThInK YoUr dAmAgE bUiLd ShOuLd.....Sorry to use an an obnoxious format, but it's rather tiring to see people constantly complain about it like it's the only build capable of oneshotting everything.
---
I carry all the weapons/armor/chems/ammo that I have that uses weight reducing perk cards.
---
Use the stash for harden mass stuff im selling and thing I don't want to scrap.
---
Xbox game pass has 76, you can get it for $5 monthly on pc or $15 monthly pc + Xbox with Xbox gold bundled in.
---
Yeah this is by design at this point in my humbly jaded opinion because explosive energy weapons are a total mess and it keeps us from using them.
---
i‚Äôd love to see some tubes hooked up to a keg see we can make that crystal B)
---
Currently I believe there are only exploits for the raiders. 
---
There are none right now for Settlers.
---
Mostly this. 
---
Keep about 20-30 of common junk and a bit more of the harder to find stuff. You'll soon learn what junk you need to fix your weapons and armour and what is basically useless.
---
And use this to find junk if/when needed [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
Don't keep nukes, missiles, cannonballs, fusion cores (unless 90 or above). basically any ammo with weight. Feed them to the converter. 
---
also make sure your junk is scrapped so it weighs less (with the odd exception).
---
Evasive and barbarian are massively helpful to full bloodied builds, I ment serendipity not blocker though. My mistake, that gives you a flat 45% chance to avoid any damage.   And where have you got the sum .75 x.45 from?
---
Edit I was supposed to put 75% chance to avoid 75% of damage on the mast comment.. Either way I am not making this up. It is a well known fact that unyielding gives better protection.
---
Emergency protocols all day everyday
---
Yes and no. In theory, it can.
---
But on the other side, its a choice. Scrap it for a legendary point, or keep it for a loadout. Not 100% ideal, but it may be how it's intended.
---
Survival mode was killed by the food builds who moved in wanting the added experience but they didnt enjoy neing killed , 50,000 crybaby posts later they removed it because the pvp people dont take the time to speak up about their opinions
---
Yes and no. When you kill the regular wendigos, there‚Äôs a 50% chance they will drop ammo. The ammo belonging to the gun you killed them with. 
---
For example, I kill them with my bloodied shotgun. 
---
I only have to shoot one shotgun shell to kill them, and sometimes they drop 30-40 shotgun shells. 
---
Same thing when I kill them with my bloodied Gatling gun, it takes 1-2 bullets, and they often drop 30-50 5mm bullets.
---
Rofl ü§£
---
I keep my stash box in my garage, mainly for the bug of people trying to steal from you, I have thought of putting something next to the vendors for player to use the stash but I can‚Äôt find anything that fits with the theme. For the record, my vendors are outside on my patio along with Beckett‚Äôs bar and a few tables. Any suggestions as to what I could put?
---
No, neither the Survival Syringe nor the Super Chem can be traded.
---
Fair enough, but the basic fundamentals of the game haven't change. We are coming to the same conclusion, which is form your own opinion
---
Still can place it on a limb at the time of this post (just put on right arm)
---
But  its the same for launchers you can destroy a double condition grenade launcher in two mags two that's not good design.
---
1000 is enough but higher helps if there‚Äôs a glitch or something.
---
Utilize your 4 other accts. Have a friend help transfer said items. For example, use one to store all of your excess ammo and allow them to convert it to the ammo you like. Have one for scrip legendaries to be stored on so you can have them as scrip backup during sales. Another for amazing weapons and armor you want to store.
---
I know it's a bit of a challenge to do this but there will be moments where you'll thank yourself for the extra work.
---
This pretty much. You can get by with only 100 of each materials, anything more than that sell them to vendors, same goes with chems.
---
I see what you are saying. It can be frustrating at times, I do agree.
---
But I think that is the intended function. Choices can be tough. Its hard because most games don't have a perk/skill function like 76. But i just assume it's the way they wanted it.
---
Maybe they will change it but with legendary perks coming, I doubt it, unfortunately.
---
I've only been playing for 6 weeks.
---
I have 3 nuclear keycards. What do I do next? Last week I joined a random group right as they launched a nuke which completed my "I am Become Death" quest :(
---
‚ÄúMy SCORE autocompleted!‚Äù and ‚ÄúBethesda fix the respawn bug!‚Äù are the top two I see the most. They‚Äôre both ungodly annoying because I‚Äôll scroll down and there‚Äôs at least three more posts of the same thing. Oh also whenever a new patch comes out and everyone hates it so we get posts that say ‚ÄúEnough is enough! I‚Äôm unsubscribing from FO1st!‚Äù
---
For sure
---
Unfortunately the stew isn't an alternative since I have the herbivore mutation
---
"I heard you put a bounty on yourself. It was the only time you've ever been wanted."
---
Good thing he called the burn ward, I had a very long stay.
---
Simple:
---
Scrap all junk before you store it.  
---
Only keep weapons armor and stuff you actually use or are selling.    Scrap and or sell the rest.  I only have one set of normal armor pieces.     Also if you have power armor , keep the pieces on a chassis.   I have three sets. 
---
Currently I have about 6-8 weapons.  Not including a few I‚Äôm selling.    
---
I Normally don‚Äôt need more that 100 units of most things.  So I bulk and sell to vendors or sell it my own camp.    Give some to low level players.  I do keep extra lead and steel to make ammo.    Check to make you don‚Äôt have a huge amount of gunpowder or stuff like that.  
---
Don‚Äôt keep ammo you don‚Äôt use.  Convert it or sell it.  
---
Don‚Äôt keep low level plans you already know.   I give them away.
---
This is my conclusion as well, as it's inconsistent. Because of this I believe it's even harder if you're on console. It also doesn't help that having too many people in the mine just destroys the frame rate.
---
This is probably the case. I was on a team with the strange in numbers perk, maybe the other person with the mutation leaving cause it to reset.
---
I have a feeling they will get fixed but I have a feeling not for a while I think the first step for them is the change in how damage is calculated... the upcoming "nerf" isn't necessarily an intended nerf but its just them changing how the damage is calculated making it easy to work with.
---
I think once their code and calculations are simplified they will be able to better address things like rubberbanding health and "magic" weapons
---
I really really want them to add in the .45 auto pistol from new vegas. It would give pistols some much needed love. 
---
While we are at it. I would happily restart my fallout 1st if they added outfits from the older games. Give me joshua grahams outfit he wore in honest hearts. Some of those animal skin hats like the Vexillarius helmet worn by legion members.
---
 Who cares if its lore freindly i just want more roleplay options
---
If your on in about an hour ill join.
---
Honestly I feel like these people are just attention seeking. If you‚Äôre going to leave something then just do it, you don‚Äôt need a twelve-twenty paragraph post explaining why and how you hate what the game has become and blah blah blah. We get it. Go. Goodbye.
---
What‚Äôs that?
---
I will not say it‚Äôs good just it‚Äôs intentional. 
---
I agree with yours and others complaints about this as I have two shot: mini nuke, grenade and auto grenade launchers that‚Äôs burning costly holes in my stash.
---
I‚Äôm trying to just keep one gun for each bullet type. I also have stuff that are above my level? Should I throw that out?
---
### ‚è´ Give this cat an upvote!
---
Two shot man I feel you that's got to hurt in the repair department.
---
Thought it was going to be like the radioüò≠
---
I'd like to see something that is good for non-sneak use is where I'm going - it would be GREAT if we had a face-tank commando option - short range, not in sneak, etc.
---
So yeah, slight AP reduce and/or lower recoil. Love to see the 10mm SMG be the thing you use as a commando when you're not sneaking.
---
When I get this issue, I load a different game title, then reload FO76. That always corrects the issue for me.
---
Been worth it. People bitch no matter what lol
---
Oh wtf. Gotta got up the wayward every day lol
---
Honestly the way I transfer items is that I‚Äôll get my own character on and then either my mom or my dad‚Äôs character as well, drop the item and have them pick it up, leave and switch characters then come back and take it from them. 
---
I know not everyone can do this but if you‚Äôve got a friend you can try it like this!
---
I use improved repair kits exclusively. Sitting on over 150 of them. You can repair the weapon/armor at 149% durability with a repair kit.
---
I couldn't agree more. How about some wild man dreadlocks? Maybe an actual bald head? I'm talking straight razor bald. Vin Diesel bald. No stuble.
---
TATTOOS!!!! Dear Atom, I want more tattoos. Face tattoos that make sense. Don't put it in the middle of the forehead, please. Tats for the entire body. Chest, back, stomach, arms, legs, tramp stamps.
---
Do people actually buy from the vending machine at your camp?
---
It depends how many enemies you hit per shot. That‚Äôs the point of this post.
---
I persisted for a while but I had to stop because the costs began to outweigh the novelty.
---
Never enough. My bloodied LMG bleeds ammo.
---
Honestly. Aren‚Äôt there STILL only like two hairstyles in the atom shop that have been there since beta ??
---
Also can we get bulk crafting and maybe a total of what can be crafted with the available resources.
---
Imo: It‚Äôs worth everything if you‚Äôre a Fallout fan. If you‚Äôre not, you have to try and see for yourself. It‚Äôs challenging but fun.
---
skin
---
Two shot causes twice the durability loss. Two shot explosive causes 4X the durability loss. Each time a weapon does damage it reduces durability.
---
Exactly the response I was waiting for! Thank you
---
The player‚Äôs HUD doesn‚Äôt change. So it‚Äôs probably just an aesthetic.
---
Yeah sorry this is a complaint in agreement
---
I used bloodied G l at line in sand when some one used glitch I had to repair 5 times in one event üòÜ.
---
It‚Äôs really worth, i just got it like 3 weeks ago and I‚Äôve been living in Appalachia ever since
---
Yeah, my exploding laser with beam splitter is awful.  It nukes things from orbit, but OMG it breaks so fast.
---
So they should stash their junk before going to a workshop. 
---
I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again. Stashing you‚Äôre junk should be a Pavlovian muscle memory. You see a stash box, you walk up and dump your junk.
---
Thing is, this applies to any gun with the ‚Äòexplosive‚Äô affect as well.
---
Very clever!!
---
I made 15k caps in a few days this week.  I know I'm not the guy you asked, but plenty of people shop at player vendors.
---
It depends how good it is....and I wouldn't worry about trying to keep all of those different weapons. As you advance in level, depending on your build, you'll probably only need .45, 5.56 and maybe shotgun shells.
---
Fwiw imho tip: Use a flaming bow for insane AOE tagging at that event. 
---
Even if your damage is shit it works to tag the whole group
---
I cant test it because im level 25. But i wonder if they drop flamer fuel.
---
And it‚Äôs generally includes a pretty poor review of the game. Which doesn‚Äôt seem fair after it just entertained you for 500+ hours
---
Just made a post about this yesterday! Glad to see you didn‚Äôt get downvoted lol.
---
Yer I know but thats why I said fun, as I feel the game is a lot more fun and there's a lot more to do now.
---
Im guessing so did everyone else who bought it im glad i checked the forums first sorry man hopefull it'll get patched if they actually were to add a jukebox that plays anything but just classical music I'd buy it in a heartbeat
---
I'd swap out Science Master for Batteries Included. Plasma cores are heavy, and the weight reduction lets you carry loads without worrying. As for damage, it can serve you well if you've got a good roll and good armour. I have a furious +10% damage while aiming GP, and it's pretty respectable.
---
It looks so cute but the music is annoying.
---
Player vendors are an excellent source of ammo, if nothing else....
---
Honestly I was a huge fallout fan when I heard it was announced, me and my friends were so excited, then the reviews came in about how it was unfinished and buggy as hell. So I held off on buying it until probably February this year. I started playing it, it was super fun! The community is really nice, friendly and helpful, there‚Äôs very few bad players, and overall a good experience now. Also, they did update with a new thing called wastelanders which added a whole new campaign to the game so that fills up your time too, plus, it was a free update! Happy trails!
---
The community on Xbox is filled with beggars
---
They might as well.  Next Fallout game is minimum 5 years away and probably more like in the range of 7 to 8 years from now.
---
To be fair it's a very valid question. In a game where PVP is entirely luck zero skill and there's zero strategy or thought put into any encounter, why would you actively seek it out? The game doesn't reward it and if you enjoy killing with zero effort or skill required wouldn't an arcade shooter fit better? The game's PVP is like MMO PVP, just without any skill management, it's just mindless button pressing. 
---
If you want the satisfaction of killing without effort play COD, if you like zero feedback on attacks then play MMO PVP. I get comparing actual well made games to 76 is unfair considering it's more of a tech demo, but there's a reason this is one of the few games where PVP is completely untouched.
---
I snagged one for 300 caps this morning.
---
I recommend joining a team event with high levels when you hear the nuke warning, just in case you don‚Äôt get enough damage in, you will still get the loot because your teammates did enough damage
---
Yup, same here. I always stay in the mine until it collapses and harvest the meat piles for 2mm ammo. I get tons of screws and fiber spools too. I love my gauss shotgun as I can do cc 580 damage per shot.üòÅ
---
I feel like this would be incredibly disingenuous, to be honest.
---
Another type of ammo on top of what we already have?  No thanks.
---
The atomic shop camo is only a cosmetic skin for the T65 jetpack. You still need to know the jetpack plan to apply it.
---
Thank you for the link didnt have one
---
Okay, that's the rub.  Find one type of weapon to specialize in (pistols, shotguns, automatics, etc.) and disregard the rest.  As for keeping stuff above your level: yeah, that's a smart strategy... So long as you're going to use that item.  If you have no plans to use it then scrap or sell it.
---
I‚Äôll jump in on this if u want some more bodies!
---
Psn: alphaboomer
---
Honestly? I don‚Äôt remember what he said so much as the lengths he went to to say it.
---
I was ledge hoping down the side of a cliff, and he teleported 2/3rds the way up the cliff to deliver his insult while standing on the same ledge as me.
---
It's fun.
---
I am constantly unequipping my bear arm perk card and unequipping all my armor just so I can prioritize what to scrip. It would be a huge QoL improvement to do as you're suggesting.
---
Durability has been like this since B.E.T.A.
---
Did you have any form of reshade program installed?
---
Hey look, this post again!
---
Just hold your spacebar when you're shooting in vats.
---
To have an excuse to wear the Marine Tactical Helmet, of course!
---
I agree. It would be useful if the displayed weight was in correct context to its location.
---
Ah did not know that ! Thanks !
---
Didn't someone recently datamine a Power Armor skin (missing textures) that looked kind of like the Brotherhood PA from Tactics?
---
no idea. all i know is i have it and class freak 3 and it takes nearly 30 mins for my bars to make my ap go red. I did this the other day as someone was complaining that their bars emptied in 10 minutes.
---
I'm just happy to hear people are still running the SBQ fight. I've seen ONE since ACP went live.
---
It does damage 7 times, or 7 durability losses. With explosive that becomes 14.
---
Havent tried it yet tbh but i can do a rank 1 on my unyielding heavy weapon build with 15 in agility cuz action points, gotta keep them refreshed since heavy guns out of pa in unyielding i find is viabile for vats for a few bursts before needing to switch to aim or pull back. I have the one point for escape artist that helps go on caution to refresh ap
---
Since pa gets the armor penetration, have you tried using tenderizer in charisma to compensate for the lack of armor penetration out of pa? It looks like you could take inspirational out for three in tenderizer if you wanted to?
---
I'm not yet high enough for circular reasoning.
---
I don't understand why they've cycled out most of the abyssmal options that did exist in the shop. If you're not planning to add new ones, why get rid of the only ones you've got? 
---
I wish we could choose where the tattoo goes. Why does it have to be smack-dab in the middle of my forehead? Weird.
---
That would be awesome.
---
X01 mod plans can be bought from the bunker production wing.  They were added a long time ago.   It can still take potential days of server hopping for modus to have the jetpack and calibrated shock mod boxes, but the plans should there no matter what.
---
Plans cost a lot more than the mod boxes, but it's worth it to avoid server hopping non stop.
---
Okay, but then there's a wording error(at least in the german version). It says: "Der Powerr√ºstungs-Skin enth√§lt einen Bauplan f√ºr die Secret-Service-Jetpack-Mod".
---
This translates into: "The power armor skin contains a plan/blueprint for the secret service jetpack mod".
---
If you don‚Äôt want people to buy your wares at your set prices then don‚Äôt put them up for sale at those prices. Simple.
---
Can someone explain to me why the silo robots attack me once I got recognized as a general and given access to the inner vault (talking about the biometric scan and going through the double grids) ?
---
 I find this illogical.
---
Once (and if) they fix bugged weapons, my shotgun is going straight to the trash can. The regular non-VATS shots are NOT  okay for a short ranged weapon. In VATS it gives shotguns that oomph to their shots. If that's changed, I have zero reason to use shotguns when I can just pop out a gatling gun and ice motherfuckers with similar ammo efficiency and big numbers from a mile away.
---
O wauw. In my case, almost all people were going to the SBQ event and not ACP. Hate it when there running at the same time tho
---
Sounds like you get off on the idea of taking other people‚Äôs junk. Pretty sad really.
---
Judging by the new rewards for the treasure hunt event we will probably get Wanamingos eventually
---
Ok so usually the damn thing gives you blood packs, frags, and propaganda flyers right? Well those are all fine and dandy, its the swords that really get on my nerves.
---
What you can do is keep taking the frags, swords, and propaganda flyers out while leaving in the blood packs. That'll allow you to keep filling up the base 10 pounds of weight in the machine with ONLY blood packs. If you keep taking things out and leaving the majority of them in, it'll basically only produce blood packs. I keep 35 blood packs in the machine, and take out anything extra. That usually brings it down from max to about 9 pounds left in the machine. Just enough left to tell it to only make some mkre blood packs or a frag or two.
---
So everytime I come back to camp, I can grab 3-5 blood packs out and with chemist and super duper, I am swimming in stims hah. Its not as active as some other farming methods but at least you still get to craft them!
---
I‚Äôve never asked for anything or had anyone ask for anything. Y‚Äôall make me feel like maybe it‚Äôs me. Lol
---
I was thinking of asking if anyone had spare .50 cal, but felt msg people is a hassle and just made some myself. Used all my lead but w/e I can get more.
---
I dropped a few hundred radaway/rad ex, waters, and the low lvl legendaries I had when I saw a couple low lvls at vault 76. I‚Äôve always preferred just giving people the stuff I don‚Äôt need instead of selling it or dropping it somewhere.
---
Yeah i think its a pretty solid game to be fair, its fallout whats not to love about fallout, ive played worse games
---
&gt;a game mechanic as designed

This.  You'd think by the furious reactions that I was talking about some kind of exploit.  But workshops were specifically put into the game to provide players with active pvp areas.  They are intended to be a place where players can fight over resources.  Don't want pvp, then don't stand in pvp arenas.  Stand in the other 99% of the map that isn't a pvp arena.
---
Try restarting your game and see if you still have that issue
---
It's like old people who see the blue Explorer icon as "The Internet".
---
Yes they do!     If things don‚Äôt sell I lower the price until they do.   
---
Ammo sells well along with bulk scrap.  I also sell legendary items.
---
Well in terms of story that‚Äôs finished for that quest, but now you can launch them yourself! If you are on PC I‚Äôm more than happy to team up with you and give you a hand
---
Oh yeah...the use of "Bauplan" is misleading
---
It certainly would not be the first localization error Bethesda has had in this game
---
I've found that the fire rate of a weapon will determine how much ammo you can get back. The faster the fire rate, the more ammo you potentially end up using on Earl. I go in with my Gatling and I can walk out with more ammo than I spend, because I'm not going through hundreds of rounds on Earl a minute.
---
That's a great idea....might be a little complicated, since it would involve a lot of dynamic calculations as you switch armor and perks, but from a QoL standpoint, it's definitely a plus.
---
Probably so as it‚Äôs outsold Xbox significantly.  I‚Äôve had a few kiddos blabbering on so much I‚Äôve resorted to turning off headset coms in audio settings.
---
Using speed demon mutation too?
---
With my LMG, I'm tearing through ammo. Probably at least a couple thousand rounds.
---
yes

Exit to desktop instead of menu works on PC. When you come back, the only option is "Play With Team". I'm not sure what the closing options are on console.
---
Yeah I thought about it and I might turn it on so I stop getting random invites to partys
---
Yeah but bloodied build ain't :/
---
I only did it when I realized I would be net-positive at the end of the day. You can't get anything good for 500 atoms anyways, so you're not really losing out on anything.

Quick question, once you mod the arm with the jet pack, are you able to change the paint back to something else without it removing the jet pack mod?
---
They should make a sort by for "stash weight" option. Some of the "sorts", I've never used: dmg, value.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
A Frankenstein style chemistry bench with plasma lights and electrodes and a little heart monitor would be sweet
---
Solve all your problems: go bloodied unarmed, hit Earle for 6500 damage a swing, use zero ammo.
---
He can't walk around? Like you expect him to sit there all day?
---
I bet you're the kind of player who buys stuff that is clearly meant for lower level players. Clownshoe.
---
God bless
---
I‚Äôll give you the answer of when you have enough, NEVER! I have around 62k 45 ammo And 33k 5.56 and about 40k fuel and I‚Äôm always looking for more
---
Windows store too, not happens on pc tho
---
Think about it, it would be for one handed and pistols but disallow sneaking. 
---
The Ski Sword and Gunslinger players would love it, but it wouldn't do much for anyone else.
---
Hmm I only use like 1k 45 and earl is dead
---
Maybe get some power armor?
---
Might wanna consider that since after patch 22 that unarmed will do like 100 damage if even that
---
I wonder if they were duped?
---
Yea thats where my stash of military grade ducktape is for.
---
I mean it only shoots one projectile, if your going by durability loss because of shooting and not hitting.
---
Maybe????
---
The literal 44 million holiday gifts he had? Nah, couldn't be....
---
What....
---
Even though I am more than capable of handling myself in PvP, I still capture workshops quickly, stay crouched when possible, then drop my blueprint and leave.
---
Using a workshop to build up some elaborate structure it kind of pointless, even if PvP were removed completely. It‚Äôs not going to stay around.
---
Yeah, that is a common sense mechanic that would be super easy to implement. It's just an extra number on the screen. We're crafting blind as it is now.
---
If they just fixed Anti Armor to half Energy Resistance, I could live with that. It's ridiculous that ballistic guns get to take off that much resistance 
---
And fix the fucking sniper barrel to shoot green.
---
If you stash your junk, no one can take it.
---
Why aren‚Äôt you stashing your junk?
---
It is a bunch of stuff like the flatwoods monster invasion movie posters, an electric instrument used to make like the xfiles theme or ‚Äúalien music‚Äù, an alien blaster skin, a satellite dish with functionality saying scan for information or something like that. I just feel as though it is possibly a hint that the flatwoods monster mystery or the guidestones mystery will at least get another layer once the next update arrives. Bethesda obviously won‚Äôt tell us when they add something in like that so everybody interested should be looking in to it once the update rolls around.
---
I‚Äôve been having this exact issue since the week prior. If you get any decent responses from Bethesda support let me know. 
---
Currently I cannot join any game with another player. They have to join me. Pretty bad bug.
---
Aww you're too kind üòä
---
Fissure sites are good too, if you are high level that is
---
Deliverer! Please
---
Yes, but the jetpack maintains the camo paint scheme.  The limb does change to the new paint. Currently have shadow prime on all pieces with a camo jetpack.
---
Really? I have not tried this... that would've saved me a headache last week! Thanks!
---
Only sad thing is taking this game seriously
---
I'm curious what you drop.  Is it a turret tower?
---
No nothing
---
Hello, that would be much appreciated.   Ill be playing most of today and tomorrow
---
There‚Äôs a good reason they‚Äôre not gone yet. The people paying the most in this game are the people with legacies. And deleting legacies or even nerfing then to uselessness will make whales quit.
---
It's actually a bug that they can be run at the same time by one nuke. Btw are you dutch?
---
I‚Äôd absolutely LOVE to see the Fallout 3/ New Vegas super sledge! Even if it just came back as a skin! I miss that big beefy boi.
---
For me, I put his chair in the middle of a corn field
---
Are people having trouble with that? I‚Äôve only died once from the fear making me run into the drill until I died. Lol
---
Hit me up next time you're on.  If I'm on I can invite you to my private server and we can help each other, or if I have it I can help yours
---
Awesome, cheers üëç
---
Anything you buy in the shop will keep forever
---
Because of the flatwoods monster invasion movie poster, the xfiles/ alien like instrument but most of all the satellite dish camp item that has functionality and says scan for something on its description. I liked the way it looked so I got it for super cheap and then placed it and realized it actually does something. So I just wonder if we won‚Äôt see something new in the mystery with the next update when a small brotherhood task force arrives. Now obviously I don‚Äôt think the whole mysterious signal conclusion will come all at once but I think it is entirely possible that they will add another small bit in just to keep people like me foaming at the mouth at the idea of being the first to uncover something big.

That was about the time I remember buying gold three times one week. I didn't know about the bug, but I remember going in every day that week and getting sold gold three times...I justified it because I was a dumass and bought the wrong set of armor first time.

Something along those lines.  It cut deep though.  Lol
---
Better yet, have both. Icon and corresponding emote.
---
I hadn't thought of this.  So many robots killing so many noobs.
---
They currently already do all the calculations
---
Scrap junk and then bulk your scrap.   Only keep a few bulks of anything unless it's particularly hard to get.   Keep on eye on anything in Misc that has weight, like ore.  Smelt ore immediately or get rid of it.  Turn gunpowder into ammo; gunpowder weight adds up.  .  Don't keep plans or weapons that don't sell relatively quickly.  Keep an eye on aid items.   If you're not running things that use grenades, missiles, mininukes or cannonballs, get rid of them.   Heavy.  
---
Get FO1st if possible.   I did all of the above, and it took 200 lbs out of my stash.
---
It has to do with the perk cards you're sharing with the team
---
It would be cool, but that stuff all was previously released. So who knows.
---
I‚Äôm wondering how long it will be before we see nuke skins and corresponding effects. Quantum cola nuke blast let‚Äôs go! Just because it‚Äôs the apocalypse doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt go out in style - visiting flavour country.
---
They actually wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if u didn‚Äôt lose damage during the day.
---
Farming scorchbeast queen and earle are how you farm flux.  The actual way is completely ridiculous, involving tons of carry weight.  If you do decide to go this route, make sure you use the double plant perk and good with salt to keep the flux healthy for much, much longer.  Another idea is to find a way to transfer it to a character that you only log in when you're ready to make it.
---
Yea I just grab them for the score challenge. Funny enough, I had 10 at once on the same server trying to do the weekly 3 hours before it refreshed. 
---
I left right after just in case anyone wanted one of them. Didn‚Äôt want them feelin bad for takin it, or feelin like they shouldn‚Äôt. 
---
Woulda preferred a different challenge tbh.
---
Thanks this why i love this community so helpful
---
Not sure if I am having the same or similar problem on console, what problem is it causing?  I'm getting a "friends list cannot be verified" error and cant join others, is it the same thing or was your friends list just not showing up?
---
Once they figure out they can buy thousands of flux for around $10, they'll just do that instead.
---
Add the father winter helmet to this list, two of the rarest, hardest earned rewards in game (and the nicest) and we can‚Äôt do anything with them. Father winter is locked at level 15 and can‚Äôt be crafted or moved to a mule, hazmat can‚Äôt be repaired...really disheartening.
---
Hmm that does feel a bit less interesting- I would still like to have ut available in case I want to change things up. Currently using the train car and I must say that one does have a lot of charm
---
It‚Äôs was a try for a easy cash crap with the hole BR hype. Most likely it failed like BF5 BR and is abandon by the dev team because it don‚Äôt worked out and the BR hype is kinda over + most Fallout fans don‚Äôt want some shit BR in there game.
---
I've been playing on the PTS, they drop what you're using, ultracite ammo and all.
---
Well yeah, I know that because it was on sale I am just saying that it was all released at the same time this time around. Could be absolutely nothing and just them trying to sell some old atomic shop items. Or it could be a hint. There was also the alien vault girl head which I am pretty sure was new. But who knows. I just really want some more layers on stuff like the guidestones/ mysterious signal, the interloper, and every other 76 mystery. I mean the game is still fun but I was straight up addicted when those mysteries first reared their heads because much like playing a single player game I like uncovering stuff like that through exploration
---
This is how a simple bug makes teens of hours worthless
---
On top of the carry weight required for it.  It's ridiculous, even with the weight perk.
---
I just spent bullion on a plan at regs i already knew because of a misclick with garbage UI , there 3 days worth of bullion blown. Cant sell back, cant give to a friend, lets fix that first.
---
The issue is that the gauss minigun shreds the .50cal damage, even though it's an energy weapon.
---
They go to the Big Score Bucket in the sky.
---
I‚Äôve tried the different variations of no walls paper, using a frame or even the gun rack display with no luck it‚Äôs annoying.
---
What I noticed was with the Wastelanders update they lowered the quality of many textures, especially poster and signs, even the atom shop stuff
---
Wigs too... that stack with masks and helmets.
---
I wasn't aware of this either.  I'm definitely taking my boxes away, sorry customers.
---
Nah. My backpack is using chemist mod and strength slots are taken up. Not justifiable unless I change my build and thats not gonna happen, ESPECIALLY with one wasteland
---
I usually only claim them for challenges. In my experience I've only been killed once when I went back to defend one once, which I usually don't even bother. I dump junk often, so the griefer that showed up when I was low health after fighting off waves of wolves only had to shoot me a couple times, but naively I thought he had come to help. Now, if I am doing a little farming at one, I always check before I fast travel to it. Then farm and go.
---
However, last night as I was claiming to finish the weekly, and I noticed two of my workshops being claimed by others, one outright. The other looked at first like they were waiting to see if I would show up. Both had one high level 300-500 and a low level with them. Being a low 200+ level, and honestly, couldn't care less, I ignored both.
---
But the funny part was a level 300+ on my public team, unnoticed by me, went to one of them and killed the 500+ before getting killed by him on respawn. Thanks dood.
---
I get that everyone has theories of how magic weapons work but honestly I think they have to do with the game trying to catch up with latency or lag. This is my experience of course but I always do most insane magic damage in laggier servers and I think it might be that the damage is applied again if the rate of fire is high enough and the server tries to apply the damage you‚Äôve done over and over again the server catches up to the lag it applies it all at once. It might be an upgrading of servers that will fix the problem
---
Get 1st for one month. A few nice little bits you keep and a private server to go nuts on.
---
You keep the Scrapbox and what's in it, you just can't add to it  if you stop 1st.
---
Run around on Private doing material runs, loot everything and scrap all the guns and armour. If you can do it everyday for a month you end up with a scary amount of stashed materials.
---
I've had it for a month and a half and I have 50,000+ steel, 15,000 lead and between 1000 and 5000 of most of the less common stuff. It's insane what you can build up without limit and you don't need to bulk to sell either...my plastic is 14,000+ now too.
---
They haven‚Äôt said anything so I‚Äôll pass of baseless speculation as fact. There will be reverse challenges. Each challenge you dint complete will deduct atoms of your balance. If you run out of atoms they‚Äôll remove items you‚Äôve previously purchased.
---
Visual bug is cool, but living fast by eating ass is much cooler.
---
I put the vault-tec generators on them to make them portable, I hadn't thought of a mini-stash also.
---
I mean you could easily get mods that would allow you to mount your rifles at the cost of damage resistance?
---
Isn‚Äôt there always a dialogue box that pops up asking you to press okay that you‚Äôd like to buy that item? I remember seeing that for every bullion plan I‚Äôve purchased.
---
Omg yes.
---
No point to use barbarian maxed tho, with full ss armor you get a tiny percent upgrade in defence, with over 400 dr/er, there was some data mine posted (it might be even lower, like 300+)
---
I think it doesn't occur to people that in a game with a such a normally cool community, there are still assholes out there just waiting for any opportunity to get a cheap kill on another player. There's no shortage of workshops to take over; there's no need to fight over resources. And if you want true PVP action, there's better ways than sucker punching someone who probably isn't interested in PVP, warning message or no. It's naive, but understandable, to think "who's going to want to bother me? I'm not bothering anyone and there are plenty of other workshops to take"
---
I certainly fell for it when I was new to the game. I happily waved at the big scary power armor man 10 times my level as he ran up to me at the junk yard workshop I'd taken.
---
A premium service (that should be free at least for the scrapbox) which basically solves this issue of the very low stash limit Bethesda created because you can stash unlimited junk in the scrapbox for $13 per month (yeah, more expensive than game pass, amazon or Netflix), includes other things like private worlds and 1650 monthly atoms. 
---
Not a fan because that should be on the base game or at much by a one-time payment of 500 - 1000 atoms (the scrapbox) and Beth is selling it monthly.
---
Ye,that‚Äôs the one I ended up using,yielded me 34 brain fungus soups wit all the QOL perks!
---
Good enough for me,Lol
---
&gt; Farming scorchbeast queen and earle are how you farm flux
---
Not for me.
---
I start - by farming the stabalization components.  Keep a nice supply on hand.  
---
Then - server hop to find nuke zones, go and grab the flora.  Make it as needed.
---
90% of my fluxs are crafted.  But agree perks are important.  Double plant perk + crafting bonus perk.
---
it's random what you get. and they are random to get rid of as well. 
---
best off buying them. most people sell them for about 250-500. then you can pick and choose. 
---
you want starched genes 2 to make sure you dont lose them and class freak to cut down the negative effects. If you are no xbone i can hook you up.
---
I've got mine vendors and stash next to each other but there's no way to get to them from the fast travel point. When the players load in my vendors etc are on the top floor of my base my stairs are always last to spawn in. So if your spawn in point is away from them should be ok or just put one item in each that's  30k
---
Zero reason to think they would.
---
I would like the 12.7mm pistol from Fallout: New Vegas. The only .50 cal non-auto pistol is the BPP, which I love!
---
If you don't mind confronting your enemies instead of hiding from them,  then recommend the shotgunner builds. With Tormentor, Bloody Mess , Enforcer plus all the shotgun perks it can be real fun.üòÅ
---
If these were retired (specifically my score autocompleted), it would promote the feeling that they were fixed.  While I'm not sure that Bethesda actually cares how many people are negatively affected by these issues, I wholeheartedly believe that if there weren't threads about it, they would just assume it's another thing the players are willing to live with and then be marked as not a priority.
---
Until he‚Äôs dead ü§£üòÇü§£
---
I was feared to the wall drill when Earl was like 5% hp, 10 sec timer and i didn't make it lol
---
I've been trying to find the data on what the max Defence that actually makes a difference is but can never find it.
---
&gt; who probably isn't interested in PVP
---
Standing in a pvp area is like having a giant neon sign over your head saying "I'M DOWN FOR PVP, COME JOIN!"
---
Not sure if that dialog applies to known plans since you have already said yes once , but why can you even buy known plans at all if they arent tradeable or usable... I just tried to buy another cheaper item off samuel i already knew and got the dialog but i did lose 750 in a flash off regs last night, may have hit space after misclick, my point about buying so useless and expensive still stands
---
Gotta gauge if the horde goes to queen or earl first finish the one then fast travel to the other before it expires. 2 bosses 1 nuke.
---
I throw diluted in the trash where they belong and sell normal for 12 or 13 each, and supers for 18 or 19 each. It's a tiny markup from what I can get selling them to a vendor. I never have any issue selling at this price.
---
Edit - I run a bloodied / unyielding build with the healing factor mutation. If I need a stim and am carrying a diluted stim it's often a death sentence. They heal too little and too slowly with my build. Ya'll need to chill lol.
---
Im sure some last week post had it, gonna try to find.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
PS4 too!
---
Basically, yes. It‚Äôs a 1x1 that also covers all of the ‚Äòbuilding challenges‚Äô except for the crop/water source ones. 
---
1x1 shack with doors in each wall and a short stairwell at one of them. One decoration on each interior corner and one on an outside wall. A small generator on top with three Construction Lights (along with four turrets; not needed for the challenge but useful for the defense event) and two lightbulbs inside.  Stack five footlockers in a corner.  
---
The associated costs are very low and usually covered completely by a workshop‚Äôs green budget, even without Contractor equipped.
---
When the fatigues were reclassified as an outfit, I was pretty happy.  In my opinion there's no reason to make the underarmors look cool at all if they are never meant to be seen.
---
They weigh 0.1 pounds each, so that's like 10 pounds right there. I wish they didn't weigh anything tbh lol.
---
"If you don't carry anything, you wont be overburdened! Why didn't you guys think of this lol I'm so smart!"
---
I like this idea.
---
Oh nice, always those bugs. Yes i am dutch
---
Shooting a rifle one handed? Or duct taped to a shield? You're talking a huge hit to accuracy  ... like over 50%.
---
You're basically talking a dual wield mechanic, which is only going to work with one handed weapons.
---
If they‚Äôre selling then I‚Äôd say you priced them right.
---
I assumed this would result in a ban, but you could still only hold 5k.
---
It already is, but two shot/splitters/shotguns etc. all fire more than one shot at once, more if they have the explosive effect as the explosion is its own projectile. There are 'tiers' of degradation applied to the weapons and each weapon belongs to one type. These include high ROF weapons like miniguns, Shotguns, Rifles, Pistols and Heavy Explosive Weapons like the missile launcher, fatman and auto grenade launcher. Each shot (projectile) fired depletes the total durability of the weapon by a fixed amount based on the degradation 'tier' with explosive weapons like the missile launcher depleting the bar by the most per shot and the high ROF weapons and shotguns by the least due to the way in which the game handles this. Its designed to provide some balance with each type - although as explosive heavy guns are all terrible anyway their poor durability is just another reason not to use them.
---
What's even worth having in strength?  Damage and blocker, what are the other 3?
---
&gt; Yup! Just make sure you hop back into the private server quickly after leaving it. I‚Äôve also had some problems around the first or second time where some mobs might not spawn, for that, I just fast travel elsewhere, quit, join back, fast travel back, and boom, all mobs ready to go
---
My gut feeling is there is some minimum amount of time.  
---
So by doing it twice, you are crossing that.
---
I sell the regular and diffuser stims at 15 caps each, and am always getting buyers.
---
Thanks to you and others. I will try and do that next time! I was in a random group yes.
---
I do enough damage to kill stuff, so it doesn't bother me too much.
---
Nobody knows. I hope so
---
This is factually incorrect. Fire a weapon and don‚Äôt hit anything and no durability damage is done. Fire a weapon and hit and enemy once and durability damage is done once. Fire the same weapon and hit five enemies and durability damage is done five times.
---
Would also be nice in the ammo converter
---
Can you not just figure out how much you need beforehand and craft that amount? Surely it can't be that difficult to add in your head...
---
No lol
---
The best answer
---
Solo is best. Having a team causes much more spawns than when solo.
---
It could be a cooldown (maybe a few hours or something I think) But i know they're restricted to one mutation per server. If you want to collect them, just server hop each time you want one, although you should do it without the nuke because it probably  won't be there when you hop.
---
Nope, it is just "make the next shot a critical hit" button - I've never hit triangle and had my gun fire - I always have to do triangle and then R2
---
Agreed .. also to add to this.. my 10mm pistol weighs more than my 10 mm sub with a drum mag.. yeah makes a whole lot of sense.. change the weight please on pistols too while your at it !! Great post btw.. would upvote 1000 more times if I could
---
&gt;there is never too much ammo!
---
Lies.
---
Any Mininuke is too much ammo.
---
Damn market forces....
---
I love the little mysteries they add. I sometimes wish their was a little more direction (like the quantum x01 skin) but besides that I think that stuff is great.
---
ACP and Radiation Rumble also get messed up by the Teslas. Really annoying.
---
Why do youlu have both gunslinger and auto pistol perks on? Does the 10mm get boosted by both?
---
Agreed.
---
We've come full circle, cheaters are now the heroes of this sub ü§°ü§°
---
I wonder if some bean counter decided not to make any more hairstyles based on the existing ones not selling, without ever opening the game to see that the couple styles they put there are weird as hell.
---
I‚Äôd spend atoms for tattoos for sure
---
Good way to goad theves into picking them out of spite while you sit back stealthed ready to claim those caps.
---
This is the reverse home mortgage of video games
---
Explains why I forgot about that lol
---
The trade forums have strange little trends once in a while.  Around the time Wastelanders dropped, odd flavors of Nuka Cola were being sought after for a few days.
---
I think its likely a collector, who then spurs on lower end traders looking to jump on some kind of niche market or OP/bugged effect that doesn‚Äôt actually exist.
---
Just happened to me twice today. Lucky I have a 2nd account in my private
---
Yes, they forgeting bug fixes
---
I likie the tramp stamps :)
---
Everyone who reacts like this when their workshop is invaded
---
probably got very mad when they tried playing cod
---
Another day another topic, or 50, in how to fix a problem Bethesda doesn't see as a problem.
---
There is a cool down on gaining mutations per server.
---
So once you gain a mutation, sever hop and you can get another one.
---
My choice of place to get it is Emmett Mountain. There are high rad pools and a decontamination shower.
---
Go inside, remove Starched Genes, walk into a pool and walk out when you get a mutation or before you die. Pop on Starched Genes and hop in the shower to clear rads.
---
If you got a mutation, server hop to be able to get another one. If you did not get one, remove Starched Genes and repeat.
---
Some guy on PS4 had about 1 million (literally) in each machine for 50c each lol
---
Your prices are the same as the going rates in the market place. So you could probably get a few more caps each in your vendor if you felt like it.
---
"Level cap on colossal problem"
---
I know this was not intended but the T65 camo skin from the atom store allows you to place the jetpack on any part of the armor (like you used to be able to do with Ultracite or Raider PA) so if you buy it you can have both Emergency Protocols on the Torso and a Jetpack (on the arm for instance). Round it out with some calibrated shocks, and a targetting HUD or internal database in the helmet and you are set with the best PA configuration going! I expect they'll patch this so if you've already unlocked the jetpack and an arm with the bullion now is the time to set this up and keep it!
---
If your on Xbox I can make a set of serums for you.

I miss survival mode. I was never particularly great at PvP but the adrenaline rush combined with the added XP was a great time! I reworked my camp (doors, private rooms, turrets inside), I changed my behavior (not keeping aid on me), and mostly went about my business until there was a fun opportunity. I didn't care about death because I was having ... *fun.*

Doing a new char run through the other day, going through Morgantown for the backpack when I see a legendary Scorched in the top level. Haven't seen a legendary Scorched in forever. As soon as I kill it, the legendary tag drops from the name, there is no legendary drop and the corpse immediately disappears.
---
The question I have is: during that two week grace period can we still claim season 1 rewards? I sure would like to use all those scrip rewards during the purveyor sale.
---
A real one what? Duper?
---
Who needs protection if you just don't get hit? My Unyielding armor does so much more for INT and SPECIAL stats that nothing PA can defend me from matters.
---
Honestly, it depends on the hairstyle. I have got all the armor and power armor reskins I could ever want. Right now I am sitting on a bunch of atoms that I would love to use on other forms of cosmetics.
---
Usually I'll just jump servers immediately if I see people trying that.
---
My camps designed to be an experience best experienced in 1 direction. 
---
Once caught a guy letting people in the back door where the vendor room is at. 
---
Was all like, sonnova...
---
Of course it is, but few people know that at first. There's no other part of Adventure mode where someone can cap your ass out of nowhere just cause they feel like it. You're lulled into thinking you're safe from other players. Often you can feel like you're playing a single player game if you aren't into teaming up and just wander the wasteland on your own. 
---
To be clear, I definitely think your PSA is a good thing, because again, it's not going to be immediately obvious to people in a game like this, with a community with such a friendly rep.
---
Bought a year at around 8/mo or so.
---
All I can say, if they offer no challenges I am going to to a break from the game until the next season starts.
---
Always have been.
---
The diluted one are fine for unyielding builds.  On a couple of toons I only carry diluted and sell the other for daily caps.
---
Don't tell me you don't get hit, because you do.  Unless you play a sneak build.  I don't.  I use heavy guns.  I highly doubt earl doesn't hit you or the falling embers or whatever if you play a non stealth build.
---
I got ripped off by beta testing their game after paying 60 euro. Im same as you. 
---
I have to say one of the thoughts I had back then, and it looks like im getting right.  They started with dirty and old stuff and all they have to do is to release same thing but clean looking instead. Or a shelf that give 6 store slots instead of 4. Things like that. Oh a vendor only 30 items max.  Wait for the 50 item max atom shop vendor coming.
---
This is probably a true statement. I have a TSE laser rifle. Was the 2nd 3 star I ever got in the game waaaay back when.
---
That's a really good kind thing to so, especially if your camp is in low level area. 
---
I have a hoarding issue with stimpaks as I had such a struggle as a low level,  but if I see them selling cheap at a camp further out ie in the bog or the more I'll buy them. 
---
Considering they're what, 80 caps at a vendor and abit of a nuisance to make , I'd happily pay up to 30 caps each for them.
---
I just notices you are not using blocker, better do, its fuking great. I usually run to high lvl area with my low lvl alts bashing everything with baseball bat, for leveling, and lvl 25 with full bos combat armor could die from 2 shots from charred ghoul lvl 62. With even 1 rank of blocker is more like 3-4 shots, and i was able to outheal the damage with steampacks
---
Much harder wnd more fun to kill another player than to kill the queen for the eight hundredth time , had more than one person tell me they were going to report me me for killing them in the pvp server. Good times
---
True that would be great. Matching versions for stash boxes
---
How would super duper work with this type of system?
---
Quick hint for fusion cores - purchase the plan for the Gatling Laser from the Enclave bunker then craft the lowest level version with super duper on, each one you make comes with a 100% charged core, then you can scrap the lasers and keep the cores. It does not require stable flux (unlike crafting the cores themselves) and the materials are not difficult - all being 'common' junk to produce. its really easy to make plenty and maintain a PA build all the time without the need to run events or take power station workshops to keep up with your cores
---
It's definitely ash piles. I changed ash piles to small gifts with a mod and around the ash pile ones I get this wired static/pixeled rendering that destroys my frame rate.
---
Wish they'd get rid of ash and goo piles until they fix them.
---
I am pretty sure people are tired of seeing 'Eldyrus' on this sub reddit.
---
Oh wait, you said 'subjects'.... not 'people'...
---
That's what I'm thinking of swapping Barbarian out for. Got it to level 3 already for ACP
---
I was out for all of 10 seconds, only long enough to select another character and choose private. And, yes, each time I loaded in today for about 2 hours after the hotfix I would get a different private server. It seems to be working fine now.
---
Am I the only person who uses recon scope bug to find my corpses? It puts an arrow over them while alive that sticks around through death.
---
no thanks, Im good..
---
I used to have my base set up as a labyrinth of fake doors. But got tired of having to close them all back up between visits. Would sometimes lock a random door just to make them wonder.
---
Dat AP cost
---
Agreed. I loved the apprehension. It made regular activities more interesting. Admittedly, I also liked (which is apparently a big fan boy no-no) being able to go farm in adventure mode when I didn‚Äôt want to risk losing my crap.
---
You are right, I forgot to note that the shots must hit to count towards the durability depletion. But with that included that should cover it.
---
Oh boy! WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BUY WITH YOUR 500 ATOMS?
---
0: I didn't even think about that
---
Try math
---
They aren't equiped at the same time,i swap them out.
---
I normally run around with gunslinger equiped. Swap to geurilla for earl,sbq, and encryptid.  If i use my revolvers on public teams i sometimes toss on actionboy instead of covert operative.
---
Silly question. Can you have stealth boy and jet pack on at the same time? When I applied Stealth Boy on the torso it destroyed the jet pack mod. Maybe add the Stealth Boy to the arms or legs?? Thxs.
---
Yes! Me too. I wish she had a questline.
---
Yeah there will be no point in even getting on for me ether. not unless they drop something good during the break.
---
Lmfao so this 10mm 1911 right here must be a dream I‚Äôm having
---
Tunnel under the road that runs from Watoga up to generals steakhouse. Fast travel to the pylon by the abandoned bog town then run west to the road...should be able to see the entrance from there.
---
Stealth mod can only be placed on the torso assuming you add the jetpack to the arm you'll be able to run both
---
I am a sneak build. And yeah, I do get hit, but death literally does not matter at all in this game. Especially in Public Events like Earle. And if you pay attention, falling embers doesn't do anything because you can, get this...walk out from under them. Yeah. See sparks over you? Move 10 feet. 
---
The extra EXP I get from my INT being 30+ means I can level way faster than someone wearing PA. I can carry more. I make more caps when selling stuff. Better VATs, etc.
---
I literally see zero issues with this shit. Ya'll weirdly bitter about useless ass caps and some blueprints everybody already had...
---
Assuming you're high level in regular adventure mode you can easily grind out the repeatable score in probably less time than if you tried to revive those two players. 
---
Other than that talk in game if possible and ask someone to knock themselves so you can get the score.
---
What's your carry weight?
---
No it needs support try using a rug or meet at my camp gamer tag is TheSickness5915
---
no one buys them because they are not good hair styles. At least for me.
---
Yeah I guess. At least he's not a prick tho....
---
I had that issue and it was driving me crazy.  Tried uninstall/reinstall with no help, tried soft reset, no help.   Other games worked fine.  I ended up doing a hard reset and then reinstalling.  PITA.
---
I would not sell them any cheaper.  The only reason they are not selling faster is that those are easy enough to come by with normal game play, so people don't need to buy them.
---
I use my extras to get my daily caps, and sometimes drop some for my alt toons on a private server to help them with daily caps too.
---
This is a dumb question but is there a specific system of when you knock yourself if you die or if you are knocked? Like in the normal game sometimes you die and sometimes you get knocked.
---
That‚Äôs an infinitely better idea
---
They‚Äôve got the furious bug, so they hit way harder than they should
---
Do you lose your progress
---
WAIT A SECOND A PAINT FROM THE BOS BECAME A LEGACY WHICH COULD MEAN ITS PART OF THE BOS NOW
---
In nuclear winter its based solely on if your team mates are alive or not. If your team mates are alive even across the map you will knock. If they're dead and you're the last alive you instant die as there is no self res. 
---
In adventure I'm not sure but I think its something similar to that.
---
Ok thank you so much!! Sorry for the stupid questions!
---
They do not drop plasma or fusion cores
---
It depends on how bloody I am, if I'm in a team with fellow mutatans, etc, but right now I'm at 425 carry weight.
---
\*nervously looks away from corpse with thousands of harpoons sticking out of it\*
---
Hiw long do you think it will take them to fix this bug?
---
Do you know what your top max carry weight is?
---
My answer to patch 22 is that if I find it too annoying to play due to damage nerfs I'll just find another game to play. I just cancelled my FO1st so I might be headed that way anyway, who knows.
---
90% of the voice lines would be an adolescent voice describing how they will fuck your mom.
---
Get on team. 
---
Spawn at edge of map. Instruct teammates to follow you. Build floor and set of stairs. Take turns running up stairs and jumping off and downing yourselves. 
---
You don‚Äôt even need a stimpack
---
New players will never be able to afford anything in player vendors if the cap is 200k. Do you know why that will do to inflation?
---
They still have not fixed a similar one with the red scare PA skin - it allows you to place the jetpack that comes with it in the excavator PA, as the excavator cannot (normally) have a jetpack this is also an unintended bug with atom store skins. It's been like that for several weeks already so I'd guess it'll be at least that long.
---
Ah ok, I thought there was a bug that let you double dip or something.
---
I have a related issue.  I have two allies both in the CAMP storage tab.  I would like to delete one, but their item cannot be built.  It did not come along last time I moved the CAMP.  So, now I actually have two allies under the stored tab.  I have tried to rebuilt both items (in order to scrap them) but it won't let me rebuild either one with the same message (you can't have two allies).  As I said, they both show up in the stored area with a redcircle/slash prohibited sign on it!
---
Aight, i hope this bug stays for a little longer cuz I need about a week until i can buy the jetpack planüòÖ
---
Eh, I thought you could only pick from what shows up when you level up. It hasn't shown up for me and I'm level 36.
---
I'm still figuring a lot out, too. I was about 20 levels into legendary run before I knew you could claim the rewards. Each day yields an "ah-ha" moment for me.
---
Hey! Morgantown was added sept 6. It hasn‚Äôt been a year yet! Give them a break lol
---
Why would we have to imagine it when all we have to do is travel to our camps and find them missing?
---
Oh, in that case you're correct.
---
We need to provide 3 examples of posts to show why those topics shouldn't be allowed, seriously? Do the mods not look at the sub? Are they not aware there are dozens of worthless posts every day about the auto complete bug?
---
How can you expect me to take you seriously when you don't even mention the level floor?
---
Everyone should be in the tunnel next to where earl spawns. No worries about falling debris or toxic puddles and the wendigos are funneled. Earl can't hit you either with most attacks.
---
I've been done for about a week, and not having dailies has def made me play less. I really wish that when you were done with the season, you'd go back to atom dailies. The 2 weeks between seasons seems really ...dumb. For those that didn't quite make it, cruel even.
---
Joe mama...wait
---
Bethesdsa support initially thought I had corrupted data somewhere, so I reinstalled the game along with deleting saved data in an attempt to purge whatever corrupt data was there, with no success. Didn't know I could invite people with this going on though.
---
Thanks, will try that soon! Tried it did not work. Jetpack can only be applied to torso and stealtj will not applly to arms or legs. Any other suggestions?
---
Lolololol if you think that‚Äôs going to happen.. well it‚Äôs not to be real.. there is many reasons why you have to grind for the rep.. and that translates to you having to spend more time on the game.. and when you spend more time on the game.. Bethesda can go to their shareholders and say ‚Äúlook at all these players playing our game for x amount of time‚Äù then investors will invest more into the company. Just one of many reasons why you‚Äôll never see faction rep obtainable with gold bullion
---
How about compact variants of the workbenches (aside from PA station for obvious reasons)? Wouldn't be too hard as the animations for using them use a much smaller area than the workbenches actually take up. Also modders did it on Fallout 4 ü§∑. I personally would like this for a mobile camp in some of the prefab style buildings from the atomic shop.
---
Even at 3/5/10 they do not sell rapidly most days.
---
While I 100% agree you can NEVER have too much ammo for anything
---
This is awesome.  And it made me want to try making my own Ellis...  it's actually quite difficult.  Props.
---

Buying the ones you want is the best way to go about getting them. Getting them naturally is a time consuming PITA. And if you get 2 you like, but the third is not what you want, you might get rid of the ones you like before you one you don't like. I tried naturally the first couple of times, and just gave up and bought some.
---
My friend's list for this game was relatively empty even before this started, so I'm not sure that would work. Switching icons does however unfreeze the main menu so I can play though.
---
With chems and stuff? No. I've never really cared that much. My "normal" is around 380.
---
Used to, would give lower levels cool stuff then get messages like "need more .45". 
---
I get it's tough being low level but it's not easy producing loads of stuff for lots of lower levels who dont have the initiative or the patience to make shit themselves.
---
So that's why my underarmor suddently lost all it's mods, lol.
---
Caps are pretty much easily farmable and also pretty much useless if you're high level enough. If you're high level enough to grind something like scorchbeast queen  you can find a way to generate serums and hit the 1400 caps just by selling them each day. That doesn't include other ways to get caps like quests but still its pretty darn easy to hit the cap with minimum effort.
---
Any change to daily limit will no doubt need a max cap limit change. But I dont think its ever gonna be an easy fix to change the caps/economy in this game.
---
Tldr; if you hit the max cap once and are high enough level to help kill the scorchbeast queen you can consistently hit the max caps consistently as well. 
---
Currently sitting on 35 serums, selling 3 a day for 1380. Thats also only the serums ive crafted.
---
Have had the same problem and also made a post about it last week.  Still talking to Bethesda support over emails and nothing's working.  I found a way to rejoin a world so that one could switch characters but it doesn't work for joining another player that you were not with before.
---
Mine is 535.  Now, you could argue that it's partially because of the build, but so is your stealth, so I feel like it's fair to compare them.
---
The bars empty way faster if you are moving and playing.  If you stand still at a bench or putter around your camp they don't drain nearly as fast.
---
THEREMIN!!!!!! Yay!
---
Sorry if I came across as a jerk. Dupers don't help the game any, even if they have generous personalities.
---
I don't entirely doubt you but i only have 7 Xbox friends and only 3 of them play Fallout 76 (and show up in the social menu), so i wonder why it's affecting me if true? :(
---
Loads of FO4 stuff needs added to the game for free.
---
Make one of the seasons CAMP inspired. Sadly the junk walls went through the Atomshop. However they could still add the metal and extensive wooden sets to a future update and the game would be better for it. 
---
I have 1st and a steady stream of extra Atoms, many cannot afford this or the Atom bundles so add more choice and more decor. CAMP building is a big part of the game to many.
---
I wish I could find one on a vendor!
---
Even if it can't be repaired, I'll hold onto it until they fix it.
---
I was banned on xbox. I don't have anything but games installed on it. I haven't played in over a month too, so the ban came out of the blue.
---
My guess is not everyone sees the same meat/ash piles maybe. I know sometimes I see one my friend does not or vice versa. 
---
In any case I finished the legendary run a few days ago so I‚Äôll be retiring that Tesla to my stash for now.
---
Aaaaand we are back to what I said initially.
---
I don't believe so. I was banned on xbox and I only have games installed on it.
---
go play fallout 4 if you want cheated shit and instant gratification, nobody wants you here
---
That would be a great way to get some old items. I‚Äôm all for it.
---
If you run out of items they deduct money from your bank account
---
You need to combine it with the surgical mask to be reallllly safe
---
having the same issue. last camp i created today was on a road and my ally was stuck again away from its normal position
---
Can you post the text of the mail you got?
---
??? Do you mean the initiate paint?
---
That must have sucked.
---
I stopped investing in turrets because they never did much good except eat up camp budget.
---
Also if your in the workshop zone while its actively being claimed/contested...
---
You are flagged for pvp, even if your not contesting or the owner.
---
So if your walking towards a workshop and there is a red/green wall infront of you, dont enter unless you feel like some pvp.
---
I don't see how you've been banned on a console unless you've done some form of modifications to it, something isn't adding up here
---
Probably a typo, mostly likely 25% less VATS cost
---
My guess is it‚Äôs pretty much a small crew working on 76, or they are working on something big for the game. Only two reasons I could think of for the long waits.
---
Pull my finger kid...
---
I only use them because a deathclaw spawns near my camp every 20 minutes.
---
Yeah, I could get higher; my STR is base 5, so that could go a lot higher.
---
But I'm way more concerned with practically everything SPECIAL wise than I am STR, honestly. I need more INT to level faster, I need more PER to have my rifle perks. 
---
If you're running Melee you're going to want more STR, of course. Each build has it's own things going for it. It all just depends on how you prefer to play. I prefer a sneaky sniper. I can carry way more than I need to with what I've got running. With bandolier I can keep a fairly good stock of common ammo so I can sell it if I ever run out of caps, or if a friend needs it or whatever.
---
EDIT: Plus now that SS armor has jetpack capabilities, I don't really need PA for anything. Now and then I do a lead run with Excavator, but I haven't needed to do that in ...months, really. I normally just do it for old times sake, or if my brother needs lead as he's a Commando build and goes through bullets like crazy.
---
Praise be to Todd.
---
I wish they would communicate what I did wrong. I bought multiple copies of the game plus spent money on atoms. I feel like this is a huge slap in the face since I didn't do anything to break the terms of agreement.
---
Would it stack with Speed Demon?
---
I just don't see the point of leveling past a certain point.  I'm already going to be able to get all the legendary perks I want, I have all the regular perks I want, what's the point of leveling?
---
Do most people not run gunsmith 5?  When I was under lvl 50 I had a horrible time with everything breaking.  But I invested in gun5 (and for a while the luck perks). As well as white knight for the armor. And I‚Äôm now shocked when something breaks it‚Äôs so rare.
---
I was moving and playing.
---
It should be 50k max caps TBH
---
Probably used the same SA-80s as you in training, lol, damn things still had iron sights
---
No focus on a half baked cash grab side mode when the base game has so many glaring issues
---
Ya gotta pump that Charisma up a little more!  Sell them for 500 each and then throw in 80 Purified Water!
---
I've seen this. I've also seen someone mistakenly nuke the wendigo cave.
---
Instant gratification? ü§£ They don't even drop anything that useful. 70% of the weapons on the market, especially legacies, are duped items and PC has a lot of magic items...Yet, here you are crying like a lil bitch about some gifts.
---
The falling embers I believe harm the wendigo spawns too. So u can stand in there and take them out even faster.
---
Yeah I hope camp building gets even better because even after not playing the game it's still interesting watching camp builds and tours
---
Oooh. Is rejoining the server the trick people use?  I mean.  I always run into the same problem.  I head to white springs or Morgantown.  Kill the dozen or so glowing.  End up with maybe full mass/high set out of that.  Then wander around for an hour hoping to find more.   
---
Easy to pick so much raw flux.  But getting the other materials sucks.
---
Someone dumped them there for others to find since it's a high traveled location for new players.
---
DAMN that's alot too, well done man people like you are probably why the game still has a player base :)
---
Pretty much BRs are getting less prevalent and I'm guessing the majority of the user base doesn't really play nuclear winter so there's no reason spending resources to develop it any further.
---
People well be heartbroken when they realize she's an AI like the grafton mayor.

I have no idea then.  Maybe the guys with bars empting in ten minutes have one of the diseases or something.
---
Nobody wants you here either buddy ü•≥
---
Also allow them to provide their stats in power armor.
---
All of the damage perks should be turned into 5-point cards. Nine points for +60% damage? bleh.
---
More post like these the more the trolls are gonna troll.
---
You have listed all the best ones that I have found
---
I guess so
---
I often dump stuff there for other players.
---
The Radio situation could be so much better.
---
So, Bethesda, here are a couple of cheap options -
---
1. Old Timey Radio. Plenty folk music and budding musicians out there on the Web who will not cost and love the exposure...fill a station full of it. Rotate songs, change the playlist each week. Hold online competitions for Fallout fans, music recommendations and entries for bands you like or your own material, have merchandise, Atom bundles or 1st as prizes. 
---
2. Talk Radio. Rockstar have done this so well on GTA games.
---
Again, involve fans. Maybe approach new comedy talent to host and add material. Keep it backwoods or hillbilly...news and daft ads, tales, rumours and stories from the Wasteland ! 
---
Simple, simple stuff. Low cost, variety and involving the many talented people who love Fallout immensely!
---
It's nice being able to have flexibility in your perk loadouts. Sure, you can just have every perk maxed, but I like being able to have 1,2,3 ranked in my common cards, so if I want to toss on a 1 card I can use a 2 in something else, etc. I like deciding on a whim that I want to try a totally different play style and have the cards/levels banked to do that. I've changed styles about 4 times now, and if I didn't have banked levels it would have been impossible. 
---
I've got 2512 hours in game and my main is level 459. Is that necessary? Of course not. But I enjoy playing this game, and I see no reason to delete a high level character just to start over. I've got 2 other "alts" I play sometimes, but I enjoy this main most. If it weren't nearly impossible to get some of these plans I've got on my main, I'd maybe be more likely to mix it up. The amount of time you have to give to just doing the Scouts for a backpack takes too long to want to dump a high level main, imo. And that's just 1 example.
---
Ok, thank you! :)
---
That‚Äôs nice to know!
---
Yet another reason there should be shared storage between characters on the same account
---
I had one idea regard scrip and gold limits but it could make things a little difficult with the coding(and with how everything has been, something would be bound to break). The idea would be to keep the two limits but change it to "soft caps". Basically, everything would be the same until you hit them, but once you did, you could keep going but everything would become more and more costly as you got more that day. Simply, the idea behind it is still to limit and prevent people from going way overboard while still leaving the option to farm. I know it's not the best idea but it's something I guess.
---
Yes I agree.
---
I'd imagine you'll be fine since the bug is actually beneficial to both parties, players get two torso mods and Bethesda get more people likely to buy/spend atoms on the skin on the store. It'll probably be put on the back burner to be fixed.
---
Uh okay lol
---
Thanks! I'm glad it wasn't just me that thought it was a bit much, it's hard to blame toxic fanboys though, people whove played the game alot more than me probably get much much more enjoyment out of it so I just don't see clearly where they're coming from üòä
---
‚ÄúI would say that you have a face only a mother could love, but your entire family died in the Great War‚Äù
---
It was fun then time to call it a night it was late n I had work in the am. Rewards for earl are not that bad. Its enjoyable playing with my group, the rewards are just a part of it.
---
True, maybe they release them like this on purpose so more people buy itü§∑
---
HOL SIE RAUS, JUNGS!! ER HAT ES GETAN!!
---
i also have team medic 3 on and that perk that gives players increased ap regen if i revive them
---
Good to know. I haven't beaten Earle yet, I've done the event twice but the game crashed both times
---
&gt;The diluted ones are fine for unyielding builds.
---
Exactly.  And being able to turn one Standard into 4+ Diluted is a great return on investment. 
---
My Bloodied Riflewoman sells all of her Standard Stimpaks at 10c each, but keeps about 50-100 Diluted on hand. 
---
If a Bloodied build is using Standard instead of Diluted, that‚Äôs usually a poor tactical decision. One Diluted will heal 10% of your health in two seconds and another 20% over time. Add in First Aid 3 and that‚Äôs 14.5% in two seconds and 29% over time. And most Bloodied builds run at about &lt;20% Health anyways.
---
Say what
---
Good because I can‚Äôt play again until this Saturday and I need 17225 and I worked out there  will be 18000 left, excluding NW, but that was on single score, not double .
---
That's too ambitious for them. I was just giving them a minimal effort job because that's all they can do
---
Plus it would allow for them to add to "regions" via the zones we'd be sent out to, so it could be updated as time goes on to include new items, new missions, etc.
---
Amen.
---
That isn't the problem. The problem is that due to Bethesda Austin's "great" coding skills all durability loss is per hit, not per shot. This means that any weapon that has splash damage of any sort will lose durability based on how many things got hit.
---
You can break a missile launcher or Fat Man at the speed of sound just by using them in situations where their use would be logical. Yet fire them at one thing and they'll last quite a while. It's a fundamentally flawed system and I have no idea it got past unless Austin is just this incompetent.
---
Bethesda, give a tiny bit of money to some modder on nexus. 200+ ultra mega hairstyle pack will be ready in a week.
---
Agreed, will also love the Service Rifle from New Vegas, an M16 with wood furniture got my mouth watering. 
---
I‚Äôm all for more cool outfits as well. Maybe we‚Äôll get a few seasons down the line with rewards like that.
---
I have gunsmith 4, and had to use a fatman recently for a scout challenge. It went from full health to broken in 2 shots. Granted, I was hitting a lot of scorched with those 2 mini nukes, but that the whole point of the authors post. Had I hit 1 or 2 enemies each shot, it would have lasted much longer.
---
oh that 10 minute guy was just being a twat and making stuff up. Game has enough problems without people making up stuff to complain about.
---
Can you share the source for the two week downtime?  My estimate was three weeks, based on 4 10-week seasons per year. Was there an official announcement of the start of Season 2?
---
Oh my sweet summer child.
---
Who wouldn‚Äôt want a sniper rifle/LMG combo?
---
I5-2500 overclock (1070 vid) its slow, but not as bad as you think. You will be fine...
---
Are there any spots to jump up to and attack from high ground?
---
I depended on Google translate for that.
---
Lmaoo thats totally true.
---
The majority of the good shit/the stuff yall want like B/25/25 fixers and handmades on the market have been, get this, *duped*. ;)
---
Weird.  I run bloodied exp gatlings and miniguns and they seem to last.   Sucks.
---
In fairness, it used a different selection of music to Radio New Vegas, so it filled a similar role that Classical Radio does now. Though I don't see why we couldn't get more.
---
At 200 you have exactly the same tools as anyone level 500,000 has.  Not sure where the level factors in here.
---
"Please add this lore breaking item from a character/faction where it wouldn't make any sense"
---
"I'm unwilling/unable to devote the time to end game rewards and feel like I deserve them just as much as the people who DO invest their time into this game. Make it even easier to complete these negligible challenges for mostly irrelevant cosmetics!"
---
"Please dumb down/totally change this fundamental mechanic of the game because I can't figure out/be bothered to farm this incredibly common resource"
---
Protip - if you need something, go to the white spring and loot everything. If you can, pay the appropriate luck related perks if you need food/ammo/chems. You'll find it somewhere eventually. Walk the perimeter, hit all the guard houses. 
---
That place is overloaded with small amounts of just about everything.
---
You might wanna use world containers for more valuble/important items, before you get stung.
---
Bags have a tendancy to disappear, sometimes not appear or fall through the mesh.
---
I do the drop thing for ammo and junk, but weapons and armor I always use world containers or direct trade, as Ive been stung a few times.
---
I had to replace an AA/E handmade a while back, guy traded it to me so I could mod it for him. Went to drop trade it back in his camp and the bag straight up disappeared into the floor of their camp.
---
I 100% felt like a scammer jerk until I was able to replace what they lost. So be careful.
---
Yup yup! Leave and come back and it‚Äôs round 2 boi! Just has to be on the same server, that‚Äôs the key. That‚Äôs why private servers are better but I think if you have a buddy in a public one, you can just leave and rejoin
---
Shit, every time I see one it's down in like 4 minutes lol. 
---
I understand about the internet stuff, though. I'm in Northern California, out in the boonies on a mountain, so all I have is satellite internet.
---
I'm sorry, this wasnt supposed to be a negative "fuck the game" kind of thing, even though I have issues with it and I can't consider the game canon, I think it belongs in the series and can be alot of fun. I didn't mean to talk shit about the game that you clearly enjoy and I was just trying to highlight how great the majority of the community is when they deal with any problems and still find ways to have fun together
---
Scrap 95% of my stuff, have FO1st and mule characters (or accounts.)
---
If they want pvp with other pvp'ers (not just guaranteed cheap shots) why not join the hunted channel?  Or go play NW?
---
Someone said the new Operations system they‚Äôre testing on PC would be excellent way to send us on fan service expeditions to other locations around Post-War America, and I‚Äôd be hard pressed to disagree. Also, yea, we need a bit more energy weapons, and having something tied to Free States for old Fallout ballistic weapons would make a lot of sense.
---
I don't think it is mate. Go hire the group who do Old World Radio on YouTube if it's too much effort. They could turn that side of the game on it's head inside a day !
---
In-game radio has been done successfully many times before...there is no excuse. They surely want more people playing, so this is a good way to start.
---
The biggest crybabies I see are the ones complaining they can't gank others.  They need to add a pvp server and this entire problem goes away.
---
Flatwoods would be waiting forever lol
---
I do those things as well.  Sometimes I‚Äôm in the mood for that.  Sometimes I‚Äôm in the mood for workshops.  Do you always do exactly the same thing when you play?
---
Occasionally mine will takeoff running across the camp. And then I takeoff and chase thinking summers trying to kill him. But when all is said and done he just runs for no reason
---
That was kind of rude, don't see why it has to be a bad thing to say thank you to the community
---
Yup, I‚Äôm uh... I‚Äôm here for you guys. Glad to help. Got your back no matter what. I‚Äôll keep the windigos off your back while you fight Earl.
---
**Continues shoving handfuls of screws into his pockets**
---
üòä
---
See it's too ambitious. That requires listening to the players.
---
I‚Äôm surprised they were even able to list that many.
---
Likely because you arent hitting multiple things at once. Even then the explosive bit means you're losing durability at double speed due to both the bullet hit and the little explosion. Bloodied would help you because less shots to kill thing = less durability used.
---
think you could spare a few thousand? lmao
---
Weird. It was there for me.
---
Beneath the Red Rocket icon, to the left of Pristine armor crafting station.
---
I'm on PC if that matters.
---
I mean I disagree. Trading with players in this  game is just straight cancerous half the time, especially since Bethesda won't add in item for item trading....Weapons are ridiculously overpriced and most of the community won't even trade for caps anymore. Every single time a dupe glitch has been found trading has become smoother and more frequent. Creating more inventory for the market isn't a bad thing unless you're the asshole trying to sell gear for a virgin soul and the cup of christ. 
---
The "well they're getting things that I had to earn" arguemnt doesn't really work in this game either...You got lucky with RNG that's it. We didn't complete a 4 hour raid or any challenging content to get OP weapons we shot some 3 star asshole and RNG decided to nut that day. Simple as that.
---
Oh my god yes please. My two main guns are an IE handmade and a TSE handmade. I can chew through both of them in one Earle fight.
---
I wholeheartedly agree, It's confusing sometimes.  I use your mentioned workaround.  I use a perk card management mod and have a setup explicitly to drop all my perks except for mutation ones for this very reason.
---
Edit:  On a side note, put the damned fo1st box in the atom shop, make it 5-10k to buy.  This game, even with a sub, is still an inventory management simulator more than a survival game.
---
I played both modes because it took some preparation, i am definitely what you would call a fallout fanboy and didnt really want the multiplayer game but once i gave it a chance i wouldn't want it any other way. The hate pvp enthusiasts get is the most toxic thing i have ever seen in this game , one guy equated me to a child molester because i killed him and continued to kill him when he came back for his bag that i left as bait . The worst part is the changes made to pvp cater to people who dont want to pvp . If one more person tells me to go play nuclear winter if i want to pvp i will scream
---
Lol. I was doing the same.  TBH I can care less about these legendary perks. 
---
If they don‚Äôt fix legacies and magic weapons there is no point for legendary perk cards.  We melt through everything now.
---
Pretty much just whitesprings resort. I think I got 50 cans of dog food from whitesprings alone one time.
---
No because the negatives are listed as +50% hunger and thirst.
---
Tyler fairgrounds isn't too bad of a spot. I wanna say there's around 8 trash cans there? Nothing compared to the ones you've listed though.
---
One that says "Nuke Silo" with an arrow pointing down.
---
Actually, fast killing is not bad, than 10 minutes fight with lags and 60 seconds respawn timer. This game never was fair, we play as is...

Yes please, the hair and tattoo section have been ignored since launch! I think the lucky cheek tattoo has been the only addition. For hair, there was just the atomic hairstyle added. Let‚Äôs see some mullets, some punk rock cuts, some other longer hair styles... oh ya and some space themed tattoos! A majority of you audience surely has tattoos that they want to represent on their characters!
---
I don‚Äôt think so. I know there is a little side area by a machine to the left of the shaft drop.
---
Right. Make do with what your given i say. Bethesda is providing a service, if they dont want us doing something they shouldnt let us do it. Its as simple as that.
---
Well, it is with that attitude... üòã
---
They're okay with duped items as long as they're the ones hoarding all the inventory from others. I hold 76 in the same regards as 76...if someone wants to dupe items go for it it doesn't effect how I play the game so why should I care. If Shekels wants to shoot ghouls for 8 hours a day until RNG shines on him and call it "earned" or "effort" more power to him...Im just gonna wait for the guy who will, inevitably, dupe and sell it at a reasonable price.
---
This reminds me of the griefers vs grinders argument in GTA online. 
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a game mechanic!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for assholes!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúThey incentivize the behavior!‚Äù
---
What system you on?
---
That‚Äôs overkill (no pun intended).  
---
- Pick one favorite ranged weapon. 
---
- Pick one backup ranged weapon that uses your most common ammo type. 
---
- Pick one melee weapon. 
---
Scrap/Scrip/Sell the rest.  Sell your unneeded ammo for 1c each in your vendor or concert or (if you‚Äôre a little masochistic) use the ammo converter from The Legendary Run to make more of your primary ammo type.
---
You have to break the hoarder mentality you‚Äôve learned from prior Fallout games.
---
As far as junk, you probably have more than you need. Unless you are regularly using it for crafting/repair/building, reduce your on hand amounts. 
---
[This resource](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1sg7L4P7UT4mycr7JF-aXvf5gjFtsyAfUH3qjeiV03y8/htmlview) will be very helpful to decide what to keep and what to sell. 
---
Rule of thumb; if you have more of something that you would likely use in a one week period, you probably have too much.
---
Try joining LiTS or Earle with a Tesla user and tell me that's how you want to play the game
---
We cleaned our assault rifles after every training session, that is if we fired the rifles during the training.. Meaning from 1-3 times per day.
---
Ah good times at the finnish defence forces....
---
I hope so, I‚Äôve finally got the bottom of the barrel with 115 atoms till my 1st atoms get here tomorrow... Lots of good stuff lately.
---
I agree. It is infuriating. Trying to do anything during the ...what is it, a full 15 seconds? Or double that, if the quest rolled over into the next one in the quest line with just a different title... I can‚Äôt see a damned thing!
---
I should have used different phrasing. When I've posted about *really liking* the ability to go back and forth between PVP and PVE on Reddit, I've gotten downvoted galore by the "fan boys" (again maybe not the right phrase) who insist that's "not how PVP is done." 
---
I've always liked the Fallout series (and the Elder Scrolls one too, though I never played ESO) and was apprehensive about the multiplayer here. I've grown to like it a lot. It's different than traditional multiplayer for sure but it's neat. I like essentially being a "solo PVE" game with multi thrown around.
---
Some of the best times I've had‚Äîand best friends I've made in the game‚Äîcame from some of those PVP moments. It's fun to kill each other and be killed when there's not a lot of actual risk associated. 
---
But I don't like nuclear winter at all. Like I said, I'm a very causal/timid PVP person, so I enjoyed the elements it provided in survival mode while I essentially went about my business.
---
They did and the crybabies ruined it
---
I ran into one kid acting like a raider half a year back and tried demanding all my scrap like I owed it to him since I was a fallout 1st member. I put one round into his knee after he punched my guy, then executed him with my revolver. I don't anyone anything. Well technically the only person i'd owe is if I accidentally shot a car next to them trying to hit an enemy and downed them, then I at least owe that person a stim or to defend their lootbag until they get back to it.
---
Sucks that this can randomly happen considering that there's another problem where you can't even join other's PUBLIC worlds (at least on xbox).
---
I bought two $100 XBox cards at Costco when they were on sale for $85. One for me and one for the wife. 
---
$7.08/month for 1650 Atoms and all the other benefits.
---
Certainly need to do something to buff power armour, at this point its only use is fighting in nuke zones and even then Chinese stealth armour has changed that.
---
I hadn't even thought of doing that. Thanks for that tip!
---
A good rule of thumb for boss fights with adds is to prioritize the adds
---
I like this idea. Either an option to hide it completely and/or to have it reduced in size and moved to another quadrant, like the top left of the screen.
---
Sweet thanks for the input guys. Now I'm thinking on 3/10/16.
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
The Score Auto Completed posts should be posted until the end of time or until it gets fixed. This wont be swept underneath the rug and never be addressed.
---
added you
---
I think i have the recipe for the diffusersn, but i haven't really made them. Are they hard to craft?
---
added you and going on now in private
---
I've noticed this ever since the start of Wastelanders. Seems like people got the message that the community was awesome was often generous and didn't want to let a good thing go unpunished.
---
No, we shouldn't torment these beggars. We should make it very clear in this sub that doing so is an instant block and ignore. They'll get the hint after a while.
---
They did fix that, partially.  The base damage of the weapon benefits from the armor pen as intended, but any additional damage from buffs/perks/sneak does not.
---
Damage x3, blocker, bear arms (if heavy), incisor/martial artist if melee
---
try this sneak, vats, rifleman build to start. use semi auto rifles (hunting rifle, pipe bolt action/revolver with a full stock, combat rifle, handmade, fixer, assault rifle) best legendary effect would be instigating. use vats (with concentrated fire perk card) to target heads, use sneak, and use silencers on your weapons:

then after level 50 learn about mutations. convert over to full auto rifles and get a bloodied legendary weapon and some combination of unyielding or bolstering armor. morph your build into this:

note: for the combat rifle, fixer, assault rifle, and handmade the receiver mod will change these weapons from semi auto to full auto.
---
when you learn the game more mess around with your build to get something you are comfortable with and works for you.
---
what is your psn?  I accepted all the feind requests from today and I am going online now
---
I use other more efficient weight reduction perks.
---
First, upvoted for "Douche Lords in Stealth Suits".  LOL I get that same team sometimes.
---
My strategy in ACP (Since I am Bloodied) is to stay away from falling embers completely, and use cover as much as possible.  This means I stay in the cave entrances, under the safe area behind the crates and below the spawn drop a lot.  To outsiders it may just look like I am a Vag and doing nothing, but I am staying alive and killing anything and everything that pops up.  Much of my fight with Earle is from across the room, but I'm still doing 100+ regularly and 200+ sporadically.  I am contributing but it probably doesn't look like it to others except when I run out to stim someone who is down.
---
And me! I have never looked at those hairs and gone ‚Äúyeah I feel like I could pull that off‚Äù
---
That is a terrible deal
---
Yes,
---
Nope. It‚Äôs 2 aluminum 2 adhesive, 1 spring and 1 super stimpak to make 3 stimpak diffusers. Throw on the chemist perk and super duper and you get 6 sometimes 12 diffusers for one craft.
---
If you are heavy there is no perk more useful than bear arms in terms of WR.  Martial artist gives a boost to swing speed.  Incisor grants anti armor.
---
Nah, they were just chilling and didn't even care when I asked mr. Earle to meet them, personally
---
That's weird then
---
Traveling pharmacy saves way more weight.
---
Considering scout armor is enclave and the mods have to be purchased from the enclave, it makes sense to have the same for the enclave plasma gun.  A plan for it should be introduced if/when there is some sort of enclave content.  And with the plan, the ability to craft it in legendary form similar to Guass weapons.
---
going on now to get ready I will be in private join when you can.
---
Good description I just lacked the energy to do it...
---
That depends entirely on what you carry.
---
was so bummed when this got taken away. i know the steel dawn army fatigues are out now and are similar but not the same :(
---
OOF
---
You're telling me you don't carry any meds/chems?  No radaway, stimpaks, etc?
---
It‚Äôs possible to game on satellite internet?!
---
Do tesla's destroy the user's frame rate?
---
I ask because I've experienced the lag when others used them but not when I do. 
---
I've been using mine, not at ACP but at fever, because I thought it was fixed. I definitely will not use it in ACP but if I am unknowingly destroying others frame rate, I'll stop using it at other events.
---
I did away with turrets. They take up too much budget and agro everything.
---
"I should get a free scrapbox without subbing FO1"
---
I wouldn‚Äôt care.  Making 2mm is a damn chore.
---
Send them a ticket every week as a reminder.
---
Or something completely customizable like the HUD in ffxiv
---
All good.
---
And it seems they attempted to delete the whole thing after the responses they got. Ah well.
---
You've pretty much summed it up that it all boils down to people making the effort to survive. I agree totally. I feel so many players, irrespective of game, google 'good builds' and have no fucking idea *why* it's a good build or how it actually works.
---
I never followed a plan and went by trial, error and study. Need to try everything before you find what works. No patience in these kids I tells ya.
---
I‚Äôll friend ya. Be on in about 30
---
I think the service rifle and recharge pistol would fit pretty well into the new Brotherhood DLC.
---
Wait i was always confused by this.If you don't have turrets then will enemies not attack your camp?
---
Crunchtastic is my gt.  Logging on now.
---
Atleast we know we're cool lol
---
Going on a Can do at the Whitesprings is the only how my wife enjoys this game.
---
Gonna eat right quick, then ill hop on!
---
The day a SMMG comes to 76 I will be happy
---
understandable, have a nice day
---
What is the exploit by which they are guilty?
---
Okay except what about people who don't do it intentionally. These "magic" guns are what I assume you are referring to are not hacked or exploits.
---
Before I knew what they were I had a junkies ffr 50 cal didn't think much of it but decided to swap my cards around from 2 handed and try a heavy build... first queen she lands and few bullets later she died I didn't even know it was me who did it. Took a few more queens and this happened a few of the runs before I heard about magic guns...
---
Given what I know now about these guns its issues in the math based on legendary effects.
---
So you're calling for anyone who is at a boss who died quick to be banned? Even if they have no idea what happened or why?
---
I also assume you mean bethesda can or is tracking when a boss died and who did what damage and not ban everyone at the boss fight...
---
There may be those who do it on purpose and it sucks then there are those who do not. So unless you can track intent banning for this is dumb. Perhaps should be calling for them to fix the weapon calculations... but wait they are doing that or starting to by changing the system to be additive and easier to work with.
---
X-01 is free from doing quests.  The mods aren't very expensive if you know what you want.  I noticed someone say t-51b, but I think the increased radiation resist is far more useful than increased ballistic resist.
---
Im not carrying hundreds of pounds of them compared to guns that weigh 30+ pounds.  If you are a heavy bear arms provides a ton of WR.
---
It‚Äôs been a bug for months. Nothing to do with skins.
---
This is a great point.
---
Sent request
---
Apparently bad coding that is triggered by some legendary effects but not everyone knows it and some run into accidently.
---
On my way.
---
This has never happened to me. Tho I play on PC. 
---
Today I found a brand new player and I gave him some stuff cuz I could tell he was having a hard time. Instead of asking for more he gave me a laser pistol he found.
---
1 gun, 20 lbs.  I definitely carry more than 20 stimpaks alone, so no.
---
Some season 1 rewards (the chicken coop and the ammo converter specifically) can be bought with gold bullion in the PTS. Hopefully the greenhouse content will have the same treatment in the future?
---
**"many whelps handle it"**
---
many many many years of wow drummed this into me. If there's adds handle them. or else.
---
I respect what you're saying. I'd be a liar if I said I didn't feel slightly satisfied when someone waits a few seconds for everyone to get a tag on the Queen and meet threshold before just cutting her down. 
---
Nothing worse than seeing a dozen wankers with pistols, fasnacht masks and whatever shit someone left in a paper bag for them at their half baked camp. I then know it'll be an ammo dump.
---
These one shot builds have a place imo. It's to help us all not waste time and resources for yet another trash drop from an alleged endgame creature.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt prioritize the wendigo spawns when they spawn (pun intended) some people don‚Äôt shoot them at all and the spawns keep harassing and killing them, it‚Äôs easier to deal with them as a group and get rid of them so everyone can focus on killing earl. Whenever they spawn I don‚Äôt pay earl any attention I just kill any wendigo that is approaching/close to another player
---
Haha! Well Played.
---
Supposedly September 8th, there are minimum and maximum levels, they just scale more.
---
No there's no marsupial hiding in here thanks.
---
If you don't have a private server. You can join a team then quit the game. When you load back up you'll be on a team and can join the same server again.
---
Many heavies carry more guns. I have 9-10 guns each of which would weigh 20-35lbs but weigh 1-3lbs because of bear arms.
---
Thanks
---
PC
---
Yea, I had to look twice at first glance. I was confused why the whole server was at one camp...made sense once I got there.
---
Or, or... 90rw.
---
There kinda needs to be some sort of downside to them. I mean they can instantly repair your gun to 150% of their repairness so they need to weigh *something* so you dont bring like 400 of them wherever you go.
---
Oh, they will. But I've found a few spots where I barely ever get attacked, and just build in those areas. Normally things spawn in when someone FTs to your camp, right? So in the spot I'm at now, half of anything that spawns, spawns at the bottom of a cliff and can't attack me, or dies from fall damage. The 1-2 things that are left, my Ally takes care of. If someone comes in to check my vending machines, most of the time they help clear out whatever spawned in. I haven't had to repair anything in ...I don't even know how long.
---
This is the answer.
---
I just called Todd and he told me they are "Looking into it".
---
Yup. Didn't used to be able to, but they've gotten better. I have more lag than "normal", by as evidenced by my 459 level character, I do just fine. Sometimes I have to shoot something twice instead of once. I can't do PvP very well. NW I've managed a few kills, but the other person has to be REALLY distracted, lol.
---
Damn bro...Im on shitbox...üòû I'd easily give you some man if we are on the same system. Gave a level 2 like 3k of them. Was wholesome watching him slow walk away from the Vault.
---
I play at the end of every day to unwind anyway, and never really pushed to hard to complete stuff, most came naturally as promised. What annoys me is now having no rewards for several weeks ü§∑
---
Add management is a fundamental part.
---
Not to mention I hate Wendigo's. Fuckin bastards. I don't need to be told to get stuck into those bony little shits.
---
The reason we nuke it is to spawn the Wendigo, and on top of that being the only way to spawn it, we cant use the motherlode because it got damaged beyond repair and no longer works... due to breaking in to Vault 79 so thats why we cant use it, and why we have to use a nuke.
---
So joined on my pistol build today ... and man ... I wish I was solo. Such chaos, and I could barely ever get sneak to actually proc. Bleh. I ended up farming for ultracite 10mm instead. Earl kept homing in on me, it didn't look like many of the others were doing enough to grab his attention. 
---
I may move my pistol setup back to full-health and drop back to gunslinger (and you know I run gunslinger w/ Plasma/Gamma so it is still high rate-of-fire). I wonder if I could sufficiently face-tank him down in PA w/ a Vamp Plasma to carry a team of chaos monkeys like I had today.
---
Soo you want people banned because the weapon they chose to use does a shit ton of damage. Punish legit players? Wtf you have to be the dumbest moron I‚Äôve ever seen make a post on here .. congrats! you  earned yourself the dumbass of the year award lol.. ban the people who help you save thousands of rounds.. ohh and don‚Äôt get all upset because out of 100 boss fights you might have a slight chance to get a decent drop.. but you seem to be the type that‚Äôs wants to waste thousands of rounds just to get your 3* lead pipe!! Lol.. Bethesda should ban your ass for such a stupid post
---
Just give him the extra 200. One shell at a time. Launched at high velocity. At his face.
---
Ultracite, for the brotherhood, no other reason.
---
Lol, I was hoping this wasn't another conplaint about simply playing the game.  Tf people can call it an exploit is beyond my imagination.
---
While it's a nice gesture to stop using the telsa, you shouldn't have to modify how you play the game just because of a bug/problem within the game.
---
While I have a personal bias against teslas, so long as you're not exploiting/hacking with them, you should be able to use them. 
---
That's the central issue, rather than address this problem to Bethesda to fix, players seem to want to blame other players for it. I'd rather address it with the ones that CAN fix the issue and not blame those just for playing the game.
---
If the devs don‚Äôt want it than they should remove it or improve performance. Otherwise, these posts complaining about player behavior aren‚Äôt solving anything. It would be more productive to try to prove there is a problem.
---
Thats some high quality thinking there
---
Killer-Soldier1 add me I just finished killing him on the other lobby.
---
Sie sind mein Held
---
You could equip a melee weapon that has "Less damage while Blocking", then switch away from it when you aren't in danger.
---
16x
---
I usually sale diluted for 7 caps, regular for 15 caps, diffusers for 25 caps, and supers for 30 caps.
---
A bit on the high side but they so get purchased on the regular from my vending machine.
---
You mean like taking it so seriously that you hunt down players at workshops to steal their junk?
---
I agree. Very sad.
---
They have talked about giving private servers mod support but who knows when that will be. Well all know there are things that need attention more than that unfortunately
---
Gz, you can take a break for couple of days.
---
I can jump in too, if you still need people. Got a couple lvl 200s to help out.
---
I got keycards and can show you some shortcuts in the silo (not glitches) to help speed things up and make life easier.
---
Ill be on in an hourish. Ill add you when I get home.
---
I had no issues today transferring items.
---
My junk is stashed. I have more than I‚Äôll need for a years worth of playing, because junk is extremely common and you don‚Äôt use much of it throughout the game. 
---
That‚Äôs just ONE of the reasons jumping people at workshops for their junk is extremely sad. Like ‚Äúmake a wish kid‚Äù sad.
---
The Atoms alone were worth it to me. Everything else is just gravy
---
Atoms. Will. Not. Be. Back.
---
Damn :&lt;
---
That wouldnt be worth it AT ALL.
---
I recently got Ally with both factions and I can tell you that in that time I haven't gotten all the gold plans I want. 
---
I have all of the secret service armor, most of T-65, gauss minigun and ammo factory. I want gauss shotgun and plasma caster next.
---
To be fair, I took my time finishing watelanders and I dont max bullion every week. But I think that if I did it would be awful.
---
I agree, this is weird.  I thought consoles were basically hack free (hacks, not exploits).  Maybe I'm wrong.  Hopefully they review your ban.
---
They're floating in space forever....
---
GET 'EM OUT BOYS, HE DID IT!!!
---
I would like to see more events. Maybe two normal and one public one. But imo we need a community event draft. Where player can submit ideas for events. All within fair logic. No OP events where you show up and get a medal.
---
Found one at a players vendor for 50 caps the other day it's a real shame though I would like to use it. Not just sit there on my camps ally.
---
&gt; , but any additional damage from buffs/perks/sneak does not
---
That...am I mental or does that not make any sense either?
---
Imagine letting your young child play it themselves. I would NEVER! Except I totally did.
---
Wow.  Never thought of that.
---
I believe I added you back feel free to join my private world
---
Me too, I think the screws and ammo are worth way more than the stuff in the exit crate.
---
It would be hilarious if Bethesda went ahead and made the nocturnal legendary effect legacy....then nocturnal gear would finally have some sort of value.
---
Lol i remember i went from a perception to a full strength build because bethesda were too incompetent  to fix a glitch where reloading your gun made your legendary effects go away.
---
You are probably using even more than that.  I use a fixer and still go through 1000-1500 usually.  My minigun will chew through 2500 or more.
---
When I start crafting ammo, I usually already know how much ammo I'm going to be crafting based on *available material*. The thing I want is somewhat related: when I'm looking at something like a repair cost screen, I'd like to see how many of the materials it's showing me that I have which are *available*. And you should be able to tag for search from that screen.
---
Another thing: perhaps this exists and I'm just not familiar with where to find it, but you should be able to locate what item is currently marked for search.
---
I take a break from the game now and then. I come back everytime we get new content or I have an idea for a new character or camp build.
---
Of course Bethesda should fix it but until then I need to know how to proceed. (Edit: original was just straight up stupid)
---
I guess I'll try ACP solo and see what happens.
---
Man the other day I powered up the power plant all by my lonesome and got the workshop for fusion cores. This kid kept coming whenever I was out on a mission to capture it. So i was getting tired of it so i camped the workshop and killed him every time he set foot on it. Eventually got a message on how it was HIS workshop and he needed the fusion cores.... 
---
Like... uhhh... you took it from me to begin with lol
---
I'd def grind for an Anti Material rifle. Set it up as a bullion purchase along with mods, similar to the new Gauss weapons?
---
The Gatekeeper, *Fallout 1st*, has something to say
---
I'm going to do terrible describing this, but near the center concrete pad, there is a blue generator (or some heavy machinery). I want to say it has an open spot towards earle's spawn. If I remember correctly, there are some toxic barrels right near it.
---
Standing on there, if you have good enough sneak, you won't be attacked as much and can ping shots through a good portion of the area. My squishy sniper posts up there when I do the event.
---
It's not super tall, but in the right position you can only be meleed from the concrete pad.
---
Oh I grabbed this so quick when I saw it lol.  Thanks!
---
Was Royal Engineers, Iron sight always :-)
---
Not to be that guy, but harold would still be in california at that time. But id love to see more weird mutant types like him for sure
---
Could you let your ally wear it when it's broken at least or will it not show up?
---
I think the one I have is the superclocked one but never messed w it
---
I haven't gotten messages like that thankfully but if I did I would tell them I owe them nothing. It's one thing to help someone out and another to fulfill an entitled brat's demand.
---
I bet you‚Äôre one of the people with a square house and a red rocket garage and 4 vendors full of shit that no one wants because it is all the shit you get for free simply by playing the main quest, so you drop the prices of the one thing you thought was going to be a sure fire way to get rich quick until you‚Äôre way below market price and then you sit their all surprised pickachu when someone else buys you out, relists the product at market price, and actually manages to sell it all at market price because their camp is in a better location, is built with a modicum of creativity, and the vendors aren‚Äôt loaded with 120 bullshit plans that no one wants to sift through. 
---
That‚Äôs ok though. Maybe some day someone will buy your tinker workbench plans for 50 caps. Keep deluding yourself that you‚Äôre some kind of martyr for new players when the reality is that you have no concept of economics.
---
You can probably sell them for a few caps more here and there. 
---
With high charisma/hard bargain, they sell for 4/10/15(diffusers sell for 5) at npc vendors.
---
I don't have this problem mainly because I run the weight reduction perks instead of the chemists or grocer's backpack.  I threw those in the river.  When you wear those backpacks you lose all the weight reduction when you enter PA.  I don't need more damage, so I have plenty of room for a couple WR perks.
---
SOME players WANT mods. And some are fine without them. 
---
And you're gross.
---
My dumb ass reached lvl 110 without completing the mayor challenge, had no idea they all turned friendly. I felt (feel) like a moron.
---
Here‚Äôs the thing - for some builds, they only care about maybe the gauss shotgun and the gauss minigun. By the time they‚Äôve gotten the rep to reach that point, they‚Äôve obtained far more than enough bullion to purchase the weapons and the mods they need. So why not allow bullion to speed up the process? It wouldn‚Äôt be worth it for people who have already finished the grind, but it would be excellent for alts who don‚Äôt want everything, and even better for the BoS so we aren‚Äôt grinding away at a tedious quest that doesn‚Äôt change from day to day.
---
It also gives bullion a use besides the plans, which I think many would appreciate. It even makes sense in terms of lore - these factions are lusting after the gold, and why wouldn‚Äôt they want to obtain your cut and for the low price of recognizing the player
---
Yea if there is ANYONE aggroing him, sneak damage will not apply, he will only receive normal damage. 
---
Even if you are in caution, get the sneak damage notification on screen and have the sneak damage numbers, he will still only receive normal damage.
---
Only way  true sneak damage is applied  (this goes for any enemy,not just earl) is to keep him from targeting someone, AKA everyone in the room is hidden or in caution status.
---
Angry turtle has a video on this mechanic
---
 Sneak can be  very misleading in groups because all the screen info looks good, but if you watch the lifebar of enemies you can see only normal damage is being applied. So if you wanna  go the stealth route, a small group of stealth builds or solo is the only way to get actual sneak damage on Earl.
---
This is epic info.  Will definitely try.  1 of each flux for a fusion core is quite a lot, and I can't be bothered to claim the fusion generators all the time.  2K+ hours and I didn't know this.  Hmm.. how do you unload the cores when you scrap them or do they automatically get removed?
---
Why shouldn‚Äôt the Wayward have more of a use to endgame players?
---
I had a guerilla character use a bloodied explosive laser converted to a pistol and it was *awesome*. (when I wasn't blowing myself up)
---
\*turns and looks at Fornite's STW\*
---
Nobody here ever confirms anything before making a post.
---
Pvp is done however you want in the rules of the game , they made pacifist mode and private servers to cater to the players that dont want to pvp.  I actually had another player complaining that i killed him in survival when he was only there for the experience gains , he was one of the people who said they were going to report me . Had another one report me because i was in " god mode " report me because his junk ass weapon couldnt kill me , i used a lot of perk cards and other things to get my energy resistance up to 850 plus . But i guess that is cheating
---
I would love a cohesive chemistry station and brewing station that could be used for a camp kitchen look.
---
üéâ (the fanfare that Bethesda left out, that should've been there when you finished)
---
honestly though the only subjects that have been handled by the devs are the ones that flood this reddit like a wall so that they are the only thing that can be seen when you come here 
---
its like the only way to get them to see there is a problem is if there are 900 post about the same thing
---
Yeah it‚Äôs sad that‚Äôs gonna really kill the experience for a lot of the veterans of this game I‚Äôve played it since the day it was released well like a week after but I‚Äôve consistently played since I‚Äôve taken A few month break but that‚Äôs it it‚Äôs my favorite game and I‚Äôm dreading the next patch
---
PA gives you 99% radiation reduction, 42% damage reduction and says hi to your unyielding set.
---
I like going with my uny ss, but in boss fights where rads are an issue the power armor usually is a good option.
---
Same, for once they looked right...
---
When one wasteland goes live all events will have a minimum of level 50 enemies once you're high enough level, if they removed meat piles (not sure what to do with corpses, maybe they melt away quickly like the laser kill animation) and just gave us an event container to loot at the end they'd have more to play with in terms of the amount of enemies they can pack in.
---
I'd love more people to show up to the events that exist. No one ever does Arktos Pharma, as an example. Every time I see it, it's got maybe 0-2 people. Maybe they'd make more events if people showed up.
---
You can do Encrypted, SBQ, ACP as much as you want to, presuming you're willing to do them.
---
You can farm ACP, just jump servers.
---
Wes Tek is nice, but so are Harper's Ferry, the Charleston Capitol building, General's Steakhouse, all of the Fissure Sites, etc.  There's plenty of EXP out there, if you want to play the game. If you just want to farm one area, I guess that's up to you, but for me that gets really boring.
---
I wish they would bring the curly bun back üò•
---
You understand that damage resistance only applies to what damage is left AFTER damage reduction is applied, right?
---
‚òπÔ∏è
---
I agree, if its something you have to go out of your way to do then yes its an exploit... but this happens just by having things in the game even if you don't want it to its a bug
---
Not if they‚Äôre modded. The weight reduction perk don‚Äôt work on mods.
---
Absolutely. You will still get attacked by spawns triggered by someone FT in. BUT, my ally also picks up the slack. and I'm settled in the border between the Forest and the Ash Heap, so the spawns are very low level. At worst, they bust up some of my crops, but those are easily replaced....and infrequently.
---
Bear in mind, if having a turret consistently took care of the random spawns (even level 5's), I'd still have a few at my camp.
---
So if junk is so plentiful, why bother with claiming a workshop in the first place, beyond just getting the challenge over with?  Why hang out and tempt fate?
---
I would personally be fine with two server types. 
---
- **Adventure Mode** with no claimable workshops; everyone can build whatever they want there, up to the limit. It‚Äôs community property.  No need to claim, and instead of costing caps to claim/contest, it costs 100 caps to ‚Äòrefresh‚Äô the workshop public scrap budget.  Additionally, nothing in the workshop can be locked. It‚Äôs all up for grabs. And locks at player camps cannot be picked. At all. So there‚Äôs no way to become Wanted and no PvP Zones in Workshops. And Pacifist is permanently enabled.  It‚Äôs pure Co-Op. 
---
- **Survival Mode**, back almost like it was before, but no cap costs to claim workshops.  But updated for Wastelanders, your character has an affiliation to whichever side (Raiders or Settlers) your Reputation is greater. And if you‚Äôre Allied with both, then it‚Äôs whichever one you became Allied with first.  You can freely attack any other player on the opposing side. But still no player icons on maps, not even the ‚ÄòTop Three‚Äô. 
---
But here‚Äôs the catch; if you move a character over to the Survival Mode, that‚Äôs where they stay. Permanently. And you have to go through like three confirmation screens before that happens. Once you‚Äôre there, you‚Äôre there. You can also chose to lock a character to Adventure Mode to avoid accidentally going over. 
---
Until then, if you‚Äôre in a PvP Zone, it‚Äôs ridiculous to complain about being attacked and looted.
---
That still only makes them like 5 lbs.
---
Bet it will eat that budget up real quick too.
---
Can I sell my reputation for bullion?
---
Yeah. This could be done... or the perks could apply to the stash box and make everyone‚Äôs lives easier.
---
And if they either added a weapon weight perk for rifles or allowing packing light to affect them, it would help massively for rifle builds.
---
Maybe even let us buy legendary modules with bullion so we can craft more per day after we have all we want?
---
Both is even better. As Vamps Hvy build I don‚Äôt have to carry so many stims. I‚Äôm an energy weapons guy so My bread and butter is BA 3 for ALL the Hvy guns, Batteries Included 3 and Power User to drop the 100 or so fusion and plasma cores to .3lbs each and double my ammo. I have many V hvys on me but my QE  Lever is my go to for trash mobs and my V50 Pole hook and Grognaks(so want a VSSS one) are my Hvy hitters for melee. My serrated vamps combat knife is for when I like to get up close and personal. I still alswY need more str so I also have nice healthy Buffout and whiskey addiction. I have been underfunded before, not so much a problem now
---
You can def do it solo.only time I fail is because I dont pay attention to the damaged siren thing
---
I thought a pipe shotgun would be cool. Since theres already every type of pipe weapon. I figured itd work like the single shotgun from new vegas
---
I have noticed fewer people taking part too, and I chalk it up to the new ACP event. I still join the event when I can, but as a non-VATs stealth sniper build, I cannot solo it (I've tried).
---
Worked for me as of 5 pm EST.
---
Now I done seen it all.
---
Hrmm. Good point. With the Gatling I‚Äôm usually one shooting stuff.  And with the mini it‚Äôs broken out for big bosses.
---
Confused about such a focus on lore friendly gear.
---
We have morons bouncing around with marsupial and jetpacks, with garish floating constructs for homes that defy all engineering and physics.
---
Im sure someone in WV had a duster coat in their closet, and in comparison to the miscarriage of fallout the rest of this shit is, it's actuality more believable.
---
I... well... that‚Äôs the greedy option in the vault?
---
In all seriousness, I don‚Äôt know how that option would work. It would make more sense if you physically stole the bullion from them, and thus your rep was lowered.
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt got it the mat plan they might‚Äôve all been bought in my vendor when I had them up but if you trust me I can make your .50cal prime I‚Äôll just need to double check if I have it learned
---
Yep, it was chaos. 
---
I also appear to have forgotten nerd rage. And crit savvy.
---
Off my game.
---
Anyway, bringing the big boys back out. What's your armor set these days?
---
I've had this talk with some BETA friends and we have noticed they've reduced visual quality as they increased other things like storage limits and crested vending machines. I assume server load and client/server communication is constantly bordering collapse. They have to take something to give something. 
---
I think with modded servers in the future they can increase server ram as you pay for them and can max your settings.
---
Enough?
---
Sooo......did they wrestle?
---
(Asking for a friend...)
---
If I quit the game it seems to leave the team.   (I‚Äôm XB1).  Maybe if I hard kill the game instead of using the menu quit?   I‚Äôll try it.
---
My modded FE90 gat plas weighs about 18 lbs. But I‚Äôm not a heavy gun build so I don‚Äôt use Bear Arms. I use Travelling pharmacy.
---
Nobody felt the need to dupe the forrest one.
---
I've been doing workshop PvP even as a lowbie and people still bitch. 
---
It's also not easy to kill me.
---
Building this game up is hard work.
---
I sell my stimpaks at 12 cuz I can get 10 from selling them to vendors and you loose 10% at your camp.
---
You're gonna get a hell of a lot more value out of Blocker than Barbarian, especially if your defense is over 300.
---
Meanwhile the bear is testing out his new ab workout by letting his mate get a few jabs in.
---
I would like to see Bethesda give us a percentage of players who finished the Run. In the beginning I didn't think there was anyway I would finish it, but when I passed Zorbo or whatever over a week ago, I figured I would, and with the double scores daily and weekly yesterday, (good thing cause he was right on my ass again) I actually finished the last six levels and completed last night, woohoo.
---
But I don't know if I will make that much of an effort again, honestly I think I'd rather go back to getting Atoms.
---
Of course I can get a general idea, but when super duper is involved you don't know how much more is being crafted. Also, when crafting basic 5.56, which only makes what, like, 34 bullets each time you craft? I don't feel like counting in my head the hundreds of times I'm pushing the button that's going to take me to where I wanna go numerically. It is a matter of convenience is all :)
---
Been waiting for months already. 10-20 minutes waiting  for a lobby to fill up wouldn't be an issue, but an unlikely case as others would want some diversity in their gameplay.
---
....that already exists and people are using them as we speak.... or so I have been told.
---
Edit: you can actually shape a CBBE body in bodyslide and just convert it into a ba2 file and run it on FO76.
---
It‚Äôs easier enough to do it by yourself, I normally do it on the private server. Just expect to use a bit of ammo compared to when there‚Äôs a group of you.
---
Dude, doesn't matter how long you were in there or how slowly you may have been taking things.  It sucks when something like that happens.  
---
Yesterday I did the nuke silo and started ACP.  Went through the entire event carrying my team.  With about 15% left to go, my game crashed to the desktop.  I rejoined off of one of my teammates and the event was over.
---
Most people have finished the first season run, so not as many are grinding XP (myself included)
---
I'd like to see Diablo-eque experience in this game, but sometimes I enjoy the empty space. The farming incentive to server hop is in bad taste. However, the reason events are spaced out is to put less stress on servers. Putting more enemies and events would compromise stability based on what has been said in the past.
---
Im XB1 and I quit through the Xbox 
---
Menu not game menu. Works every time for me
---
I once had case where my brother left his private world, and I was booted out of it, when we got back to his world, it was new world, nothing important lost, but never had that since then
---
What happens in the Silo *stays* in the Silo.
---
No, its all saved on their servers and tied to your login.
---
If only they buffed calibrated shocks by 25 each or there was some backpack/storage option to replicate high capacity backpack.
---
Dragonborn I guess
---
Sorry, but I had to ask:
---
&gt;To outsiders it may just look like I am a Vag and doing nothing
---
Does that mean you look like a bloodied vag? (please pardon me, I'm drunk)
---
Wait really?
---
T-51b
---
Its the most balanced one and plans are cheap and easy to get. 
---
Then use your gold to go for the T-65 (if you are a heavy PA user) that one is a BEAST. Pair that with the right perks and you will be immortal.
---
I already have backups. It is foolish to rely on magic weapons only.
---
Beth acknowledged it as a bug in the PTS forums, the greenhouse structure kit is only supposed to be the rank 99 reward.
---
Agreed.  I took forever the first time.  Had no idea what to do, the robots were crazy strong, and I got lost several times.  Several of my crew chiefs got destroyed and I had no idea how to replace them.  It was comical. I know I was in there more than an hour, maybe 1.5
---
I can do it in 8 minutes now, but at first 1.5 hours felt like a monumental achievement.
---
Maybe people need a little break as many seem to be finishing the run (I too finished recently)
---
Yeah I've had some real good "lines" there. One felt like the most insane zombie overrun from any movie I've ever seen, frame rate be damned.
---
If they do that everyone will cancel
---
FO1st
---
IMO they are worse than non legendary ones. I h8 them.
---
I did something like this on the Flatwoods map, near the Gorge Bridge. There‚Äôs a few places you can get just enough air to take just enough damage to get downed. My wife and I did this on our team and the other two players seemed to understand super fast, so we let them revive us as well back to back.
---
Auto removed, they all end up in your inventory
---
I suspect after one wastelanders the market is going to be thirsty for stimpaks. Rebalancing weapons + increase on enemy levels + newer players venturing into harder areas will mean a boom for chems. Vampire weapons are already hot now. More than they used to be.
---
Did that last night only hit wendingos and stimpacked players hit 32 dingos used 16 stimpacks and they ran out of time pissed me off cause I sent the nuke prefer SBQ cause if I have to I can do by myself
---
click on the pole thing. most of the time it is glitched though and the scorchbeast is out of bounds somewhere. you have to go looking for it and thne go back into the zone. or try fast travelling to it
---
I'm also in since game pass.  I have been in two Flatwoods matches.  
---
Anecdotal, in both matches I experienced there were maybe two people who knew the map and thirty that wandered around completely lost dying rapidly.
---
I seem like the only person who wants stuff that looks like it belongs in the post apocalypse
---
Awww, that's just your "freshman 15" showing
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure running this event on *wendigo duty* is literally the best screw farm in the game, it‚Äôs beyond overlooked
---
I went to someone's vendor earlier. Really spartan camp just the needed things setup and a vendor. Heard a load of shooting, got out of the vendor to see 3 Settlers attacking the camp.
---
"What did you do to piss off Settlers?!"
---
First off, I'm a girl. Lmao. Also whatttt. I don't see your point, dude. üòÇ I wish you were on PC so you could get taught a lesson real quick.
---
I use a bloodied fire rate on my alt as a side arm. It melts and crits like crazy, even if I'm not spec'd into it.
---
That is correct. But you still have to do something. I tried joining with my alt and did not get any loot.
---
Is this a random event or is it triggered by the player?
---
That‚Äôs another valid use. Not sure what the ratio would be, though. 50 per, just like with scrip I guess?
---
Though that would be weird, since that would imply that bullion and scrip have the same price value...
---
Maybe a way to convert bullion into caps and scrip instead?
---
Well, I do have the Red Ranger skin on my excavator.  And I am bloodied.. It all adds up.
---
The caps limit is already 150k.....
---
&gt;They heal too little and too slowly with my build. 
---
That‚Äôs what **Field Surgeon** and **First Aid 3** and **Class Freak 3** are for.
---
The point is that even if you aren‚Äôt using Diluted Stims, other people would. List them for 1-4c in your vendors or drop them in public places.
---
Have a fully operational orbital battle station ready when the rebellion arrives from hyperspace
---
yup, DM me and I can link you a discord which has instructions and downloads. The downside is that you do have to make the conversion yourself (or use a preset one that someone provided). The body has to be altered outside of game using bodyslide program. It is not like FO4 where you can do it in the character creation screen.
---
Disclaimer: For any mods reading this, this is all stuff I have been told. I am in no way using these mods and please don't ban me. I just happen to be a very knowledgeable person.

I'm soooo confused are you saying that I'm a dumb ass or what im confused
---
This.  I have been lucky and it usually works fine for me.
---
That's just a gun emplacement at Wade Airport they posed in front of for the Subjugator screenshot. You can visit that same gun right now in the live game, they're available in some workshops but you can't build them in your camp.
---
There are some new turrets in the PTS like the bubble turrets, and they're not marked as ATX items. I think they're part of the reward pool for Daily Ops, but if so I haven't gotten any yet from playing in the PTS.
---
Bring the entirety of the Rebel fleet to Endor whilst the Death Star's shields are still active.
---
Creatures max out at 100 but drops max out at 50.
---
A level 50 can kill the same monster faster than a level 300 and get the same loot. Spits in the face of high levels.
---
#NO ONE ELSE KINKSHAME THE OVERSEER PLEASE &gt;:(
---
It's a more rare event that randomly pops up. You activate the lure system then eventually a scorchbeast lands near you. It's really buggy so it could take awhile or you can try fast traveling back into the event. Once it lands you have to wait for the prompt that says "kill the scorchbeast" or something like that. If you kill it too quick the event won't complete.
---
How to kill your game. FO1st.
---
What gun are you using on him?
---
Haha same, so yeah, probably used the same shitty ones at GIB
---
This is most likely the reason, none of the crap they put in that section looked good really.
---
My girl was just saying literally yesterday that she wanted to see more hairstyles because the vanilla ones suck.
---
It is a good event if you need scrip or junk.  Personally the turn off for me is how long it takes.
---
Glitched in particular, it is a cornucopia of steel.
---
BuT rIfLeS aRe AlReAdY oVeRpOwErEd
---
Yeah. That's what I was curious about. Thanks.
---
That‚Äôs not a half bad idea. If I run mine though I‚Äôll usually put a full stack of rifleman and gunslinger perk cards just to milk the glitched damage perks while I still can. lol
---
Saw that happen twice yesterday. üòÇ
---
Just saying that even if the outfit said NCR compared to what we already have in game the lore of Fallout went out the window a while back!
---
Whats your first 4?
---
I see and your correct
---
Flatwoods sucks hard
---
Good for you. Only time I use PA for battle is SBQ if they launched so you have to fight her in the blast zone. Otherwise (99% of the time), why would I use PA?
---
Lol damn it you beat me by a minute!!!!!!
---
I think that teaming up helped me quite a bit. I always teamed up with an Events or Building team, and would switch to larger teams if need be. If you luck out and get a full team doing events, and several lunchboxes are going, and have kindred, and canned meat, and Lighthouse extra XP, yada yada yada, I can tell you it definitely added up, allowing me to get the three levels up during the week.
---
This guy understands traps
---
Don‚Äôt kink shame. That ain‚Äôt cool.
---
Literally came to this comment section to post this. Make me feel like I'm in a science lab! Might also go well with my cinderblock walls
---
Likewise!
---
LOL IT JUST WORKS
---
I think season coming to a close is slowing it down and meat week killed it.  Radiation Rumble is suffering too both are good xp.
---
I can confirm this.
---
Pretty sure that is what I just told you.
---
Omg. That is awesome. üòÇ
---
Wait, just realized, you have 535 carry weight in PA? Is that Excavator or something?
---
I feel like the BoS should have been replaced by just US military remnants instead. I hate that they just get shoehorned in because they're a well known faction
---
I see what you did there. Have an upvote.
---
Agreed, and to the OP: Keep them only if you want 175lbs of stimpacks
---
If its broken how come i can still do breach and clear?
---
What system?
---
random event. there's 3 or 4 places it can be. if it's south of watoga you'll find the scorchbeast hanging out at nar repair yard usually.
---
And calibrated shocks, 15 strength, etc.  It's a ton, and if I want I can get up to 560.
---
Sounds like a **lot** of points I could use in other perks at the cost of using one of the most abundant items in the entire game. I carry 100 plus normal stims on hand at any given time and only put them up for sale when I break 200. And what the heck do you think I meant by saying I threw diluted stims out? If I'm not selling them one could assume I'm dropping them, ya know? Not gonna spend caps to travel from where I am to drop them in an area you find more convenient for me to give items away.
---
Lost.....In.....Space!!!!!
---
Given the fact that these posts appear the most at times of great controversies (or great outrages about alleged controversies), I'd say it's also a "scorched earth" tactices to convince everyone currently outraged to leave the game an tarnish the reputation of it. Or sometimes just the attempt of the latter and using the "I leave" message to give some more emotational gravitas to the post about how Bethesda are evil.
---
I have two accounts and two computers, I just make my alt go upstairs and jump down and then I revive him on my main
---
I can down him in about 7 seconds or less with a TSE minigun, but to be fair, if I was shot in the face with about 200 exploding bullets then I wouldn't expect to live long.....sounds perfectly balanced to me :-)
---
3027
---
Personally I avoid it because of the current Tesla Rifle bug who kill the framerate, every time I did it recently there is one person or more with Tesla Rifle so I decided to avoid this event until that bug got fixed.
---
All of them my good man! PS4, Xbox and PC!
---
Anything that includes a variation of the sentence "the developers don't play their own game"
---
I‚Äôve gotten it to work sometimes like I‚Äôll kill a spawn but I‚Äôll get purified water instead of .50 cal but I‚Äôll tag a group of them still getting loot and I seems all of them give me ammo the whole event seems to be  pretty buggy
---
Speaking of as armor did they ever fix the deep pocket promblem
---
Wow, I was 2503, now I feel old :-)
---
I try to revive when I can but people are usually long gone by the time I get to them.
---
My sneak bloodied build has been having a field day taking out the spawn.
---
I'm level 129 and no heavy hitter by any stretch of the imagination. And I've only joined ACP once. I was running a gauss shotgun with quad ammo and a limb damage gatling gun. And I just sat on top of the busted forklift and plowed wendigo spawns and reviving people when needed while the PA heavy hitters focused on Earle. In an 8 man event team tactics are vital. Especially when three of our squad were under level 20 greenhorns who probably had never even seen a regular wendigo before.
---
Nope, been bugged since release
---
Yes...the weapon reduction on armor stacks together...upto 90% and stack with perk cards.
---
The other weight reduction on armor do not stack together...5 peices of ammo reduction only get 20% not 90, but does stack with perk cards
---
I have 2 wwr, 1 jwr and 1 awr pieces of armor
---
Pickaxe on my neck please. Gonna roleplay as a miner next.
---
You bring up an interesting point, one which I have never pondered.  What if all the enemies respawned a few minutes after they die and meat piles disappeared?   I could see where in boss fights this could be a negative, but in normal locations maybe it could work.  Problem is what level would they spawn at..
---
Yeah but they've kind of gone in the opposite direction. Talking about finding the individual objects lying around lately. I guess it might be a bug but seems it doesn't seem like it to me. 
---
Yeah it makes it seem a tad more like 4 but it's got to be murder on frame rate (damn every comment I've made today has been about frame rate) , rendering, physics and all, and I've already made peace without that.
---
Nah Bethesda said the atomic shop isn‚Äôt canon even though your explanation is cool
---
Thanks, was worried there
---
Upvote for this guy, b/c his info is actually useful to the OP.
---
Anything from the Brotherhood of Retcons looks stupid imo
---
What game are you playing?
---
&gt;And what the heck do you think I meant by saying I threw diluted stims out?
---
&gt;I throw diluted ***in the trash*** *where they belong*
---
That‚Äôs different than just saying ‚ÄòI drop them‚Äô. 
---
And, hey, if you don‚Äôt mind throwing away caps, more power to you. I said to list them in your vendor ***OR*** drop them. It‚Äôs free to travel to your camp. ;)
---
He's probably very bloody well aware thankyou very much !!
---
You in ps4 , i will take it from you and make you beg me to stop killing you unless you are one of the quantum spamming p√óssies
---
Sneak bloodied here as well. I'll clear spawns to stack adrenaline and lay into Earle for 250 per hit with a fixer. Not the best damage but does the job
---
Not as old as those rifles
---
No one has to know as long as Damien keeps me in a good supply of film and zoom lenses.
---
This would have been even better.
---
Sure ya will. üëçüëçüëç
---
They do. My JE flamer one shots them and I was getting dozens back per kill.
---
If you are a low health build it doesn‚Äôt matter if you put on  emergency protocols because with that mod armours with dmg resist 100-200 away just have a 1-3% difference but if you aren‚Äôt low health T-51b has the highest dmg resist only beaten by T-65
---
So you want people to change their builds to PA just so they use it like once a month? I guess I don't get your point.
---
Stay on PS4 where you belong plebian.
---
One time I figured that as long as there was 5 minutes left on the clock I could kill earl myself no matter where his health was, so I decided to be on windigo duty the whole time while everyone else fought Earl... Walked away with 300+ screws just from one 15 minute event. It was amazing.
---
I would like a cook all option when cooking food
---
Speaking of skins for workshop items, like the crafting stations or vending stations or the collectrons... can we please get the ability to switch the skins on the fly without needing to scrap the item and rebuild? It's annoying when I want to have a different collectron and yesterday I had to fiddle with armor workbench positioning again when I wanted to apply the new skin.
---
But the worst is it for the vending machnies. I have at least 2 skins for them, but I've never used them, because I'd have to rebuild the machines and relist all my items. It's not worth it.
---
The technology is there. We can replace walls and floors on the fly, so why not other items?
---
Ah, I've got calibrated shocks, but I honestly haven't even looked at my carry weight in a set of PA in so long I can't even remember what mine is lol.
---
Yeah it was weird seeing a ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù as 1lb glad it‚Äôs under armour tho
---
Noticed you didn't drop your system or gamer tag
---
I will camp.as much as I want...and u cant stop me.
---
If it was on a floor or roof, store that floor/roof and when you look at your stored items, you should see the turret again along with your floor/roof.
---
I have to do this all the time. Good luck.
---
Fusion cores, free fast travel, a place to access stash. 
---
You really thought workshops are just for junk? Wow that is beyond sad. No wonder you go to workshops for pvp. You‚Äôre so bad at the game that killing people while they navigate their pip boy is the only way you can.
---
I know but i see alot of people saying it makes no when it could make alot of sense
---
No it has to stay the colour of the paint you used to be able to cover it with stuff like cosmos armour but I don‚Äôt think it works anymore
---
Did you know when to go spawn in the trees they jumped down and get you
---
maybe related to game pass and newcomers. ( is it still on I havent tracked it)
---
Had a discussion with a dude way back about this, was great  idea. Like pistol shield or melee shield. We went on to talk about mods and such for the shield. Like pheromones for mires and bugs, air horn for mutants and humans and infared for bots and scorched. Pretty good ideas i think!
---
You ever smell a powerful musk? Now add motor oil, rotting irradiated flesh, double slobbering mouths, and a revved up pre-war hot mama. Ain't no one gonna take that into their lungs and not want to throw down with a specimen like that. 
---
Overseer? More like Seein'-O's
---
seems like i touched a nerve there. 
---
Show me on the doll where i rustled your jimmies.
---
id say as long as youre not playing with assholes.. any event that throws such a large number of mobs at you almost HAS to be good
---
Same one you are. You do realize that you can have five characters right. 30k times 5 = 150k.....
---
Also, youve been trained for 11 years to deal with the FO76 weapon breaks...  
---
Weapon fires alright, weapon fires alright, weapon stops
---
it'll pick up again once the new season starts as it's good for xp
---
Yes I do.
---
Yeah! It would be good to have a mod that allows you to mount rifles at the cost of reduced damage resistance (like half shield)
---
By all means it should. I‚Äôm in full support with you major laser
---
I‚Äôm also disappointed the free radicals only had a W: chapter one appearance and that‚Äôs it.
---
Great tip! Thanks
---
Coffee spawns in the locked fridge in Flatwoods with a half dozen other pre war foods. Not sure about the container side though. A few lunch boxes around the pub and cooking area out back. Probably one on each porch next to an incredibly well preserved corpse.
---
I good way to achieve a tesla minigun is getting your mitts on a quad automatic tesla rifle
---
That‚Äôs cool but what if you could also glow like ultracite ore?
---
Console gamer, btw.  I &gt;WISH&lt; I could use a perk card management mod!!!  :(
---
If I wasn‚Äôt a heavy weapons main, definitely
---
Weapon fires one or two more shots....
---
I'm on Xbox. ü§∑ This dude gonna go out of his way to join me and try and grief me. Get a fucking life bro.
---
B FFR Something Gauss Minigun
---
Back up weapon was a B .50cal
---
Hmm, what do you use?
---
Oh man that‚Äôs a bummer!
---
Basically what you said but there are still level caps of enemies
---
What, like the Valkrie (not sure if i spelt that right) shield from Division 2? I could see that working, limited you to shotguns rifles and automatics, but big guns like lmgs were a no go. Might have to take vats away too maybe for fairness? Idk, gotta have a draw back or something, like him aim only or something
---
Edit: hip aim**
---
Behold! Ultracite man! (Available in green, white or blue.)
---
If only medic was a real build. I‚Äôd be out there turning the tide of every event.
---
Okay, I'm working through the gold quest I'm on the last quests for both the raiders and foundation.  I haven't made a decision on who to side with but I really like the minigun over the shotgun.
---
**Responder move!**
---
Sign me up
---
I quit doing this event because there's always people who bug it, which is fine, but there's also always some asshole with an explosive weapon who kills everything before I can manage to even tag them most of the time.
---
I tried it out and it worked still. You just need to apply the camo paint to an arm and apply the jet pack mod (obviously assuming you have  bought the plan from Regs). Then you can still change the arm paint back to what you prefer (I use all Dark Matter). The paint on the actual visible jet pack is still camo but all armour pieces are as you had before. Win win üëç
---
Yeah exactly!! Nah, heavy guns are generally for tanky builds anyway. I think the drawback would definitely be no vats and/or hipfire accuracy (might be able to mitigate that via mods)
---
I completely agree! There really weird hairstyles.
---
Maybe it's not broken...maybe just meant to not be able to be repaired...u know...maybe to make it more valuable as a one time used item....I think the repair system is a joke anyways...would be alot better to have to use same items to repair instead if random crap u can find everywhere
---
Most people playing on this game are new to mmo or at least multiplayer games of the modern canon. They just don‚Äôt know yet
---
Lol... Then I'd buy all the levels day 1 and get my atoms back all season
---
Send in a ticket.
---
Thx poster I was starting to think me storeing hundreds just for revives wasn‚Äôt getting love.
---
That would be an improvement, but I think being able to see both values at the same time, in a consistent notation for it, would be better.
---
I sort of hope when people see my 30 Armor pieces they realise they‚Äôre outfits. The way I work is Halloween vendor for outfits, Christmas Vendor for CAMP plans and recipes, Raider vendor for drugs (aid) and maps and normal vendor for weapons, ammo and plans for weapons and armour.
---
I hardly ever sell any actual armour pieces, but I‚Äôve been complaining for a while that there‚Äôs no outfit option on your map lookup. I totally support the removal of the Stimpak option to be replaced with outfits!
---
He‚Äôs a lively one. Even tried to tell me I said something that I clearly didn‚Äôt. Jumps to conclusions faster than a jackrabbit defense attorney.
---
I'm willing to bet that we're missing some vital information
---
Nothing marsupial related as others mentioned to cheese from but you can definitely sit on the backhoes to avoid surprising melee attacks from behind  .. . .
---
Shots hit is simple and it already favors the player.
---
Yeah just like anglers and megasloths
---
Nice. Looks like i know how im gonna counteract the fuel cost.
---
My thoughts too. People use those traps all the time to get to hard to reach, high altitude areas using a jetpack and I've never once heard of anyone being banned for it.
---
I agree...but...u know...bethesda logic I guess
---
I did it got denied lol
---
That happens to me sometimes when I die as an event is being completed specifically Encriptid! I‚Äôve found I just have to wait it out, sometimes it even takes up to almost 5 minutes, but eventually it will let me respawn and when I do I get all rewards/drops. Hopefully that works for you!
---
I was looking at mine the other day thinking really? They haven‚Äôt fixed this yet?
---
Or just craft normal ammo.  The time it takes to farm the flux is far greater than the time it takes to farm more steel and lead.
---
Something tells me you are not telling the full story
---
I feel as though MODUS might mention that, since he‚Äôs the only Enclave leader in Appalachia, other than the new members from 76.
---
What kind of prizes?just curious. Pc?
---
U can add me 
---
Dr teeth 69r md
---
We launch nukes all the time
---
You mean go out of my way to avail myself of game mechanics, if you dont like it go play something else or cry until they change it . Get a clue little man
---
Yum abestos the forbidden cotton candy üç≠
---
I revive as many players as possible but the wendigo spawns arent easy enough for me to kill fast enough
---
Light Machine Gun and Gatling Gun, not bloodied mind you, prefer two shot.
---
After one go i had 60 screws and that was just me not specifically trying to get them.
---
[Funny you should say that](https://imgur.com/QsigNBd)
---
Yeah, since it was treated as underarmor and didn't register any applicable mods anymore, it wouldn't remember a mod being there
---
Awesome!! Just in time too :) üéâüéä
---
How dare you be a pleasant and encouraging person on this sub.  Just where and who do you think you are?  ;)
---
Lol. There are a lot of settler wanderer and trade spawns at my camp.  This one time I was loading items into my vending when I heard a lot of shooting.  Came out and my turrets were shooting at the settler spawns and vice versa.  I didn‚Äôt know what to do at the time because they wouldn‚Äôt stop and I actually saw another player spawn into my camp.  My quick thinking was killing the settler.  Guess I could have just removed the turrets.  I think I scared my guest away :(
---
Lol, again, get a life.
---
Gotta disagree on the wendigo ads. All my attempts of ACP so far I found I‚Äôm the only one shooting Earle
---
It‚Äôs as if Bethesda is pretending Nexus doesn‚Äôt exist. Not condoning theft but its not even that hard for them to base something off another idea legally. Look at the stuff they have there, see what popular things fit into the game/canon, make something that scratches the same itch and sell them. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt want money sometimes.
---
Only if they have animation and sound effects
---
As opposed to using your math 5killz to calculate how many units of x, y, and z crafting materials it takes to generate, say, 1k of the ammo, or serum, you wanna make; noting whether or not you have enough of said materials; and then doing the necessary prep to do the actual crafting? Guess the designers at Bethesda expect a considerable deal from their players? ü§î
---
Now all that's missing is Wanamingos and Wattz laser weaponry and my life will be complete.

"BRING ME WANAMINGOS AND WATTZ WEAPONS!"

As long as some is alive, his bar won‚Äôt reset, is that correct?
---
I kill wendies for the easy gauss shotty ammo lol.
---
I‚Äôve been using the cursed harpoon gun with flechette if you were wondering, probably shouldn‚Äôt have sold my TSE 50 cal though, but it‚Äôs whatever
---
Well crap I had the Father Winter Helmet and scrapped it.
---
I have never seen so many order of mysteries flairs in one place at once. Also yes, as somebody already said, it's supposed to just come after you use the tower, but it's pretty bugged and sometimes just won't happen
---
Love it. Good on you for taking him on and not just skipping out. 
---
If I may ask, how was it solo? Did you use a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù weapon or are you a crazy powerful build? Just wondering because I‚Äôm a full heath build and I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs tough to solo.
---
Ive had this only happen ..just a shot in the dark but.. When you die or spawn in your perks and or your amor  weight perks dont work.so it wants to force you to vualt respawn but that doesnt work either.i dont go above 300 pounds even though my cary weight is around 450.havent had a respawn bug since I cut my weight down .good luck that bug sucks b@lls
---
I was talking with someone else and you interjected with your childish opinion, get a life
---
I tend to find other players have better guns that can take down Earle easier so Im always happy to focus on the wendigos and reviving people to do my part!
---
Ifkr, why dont i get disease prot for a full set
---
Yup, lately whenever I log in it's like a junkie needing a fix. I dont mind helping, but god damn.
---
Upon exiniming the weapon you see the cocking handle in on the floor and the TMH nowhere to be found (requires 8 steel, 2 adhesive and 1 plastic to repair)
---
Just eliminate it at a rifle all together and make it just ‚Äútesla shotgun‚Äù
---
I've given up hope of anything being done about cheaters. NW has been like that since about a week after it launched. PC has many well-known people that cheated their way all the way up to rank 100 without getting banned. Not any better in adventure mode, remember that """ban wave""" where bethesda suspended people's accounts and then unbanned them all a week later, even when they had hacked binocular rifles and dozens of freshly spawned bloodied explosive lasers? Yeah they clearly just don't care. And as the cherry on top, even people here are now praising the cheaters
---
On what platform? I haven't had any issues on PC.
---
YES!  Please fix the Father Winter Helmet!  Make it scrapable so we can learn a skin to apply!  And it can remind bind on pickup so people just can't pass it off and everyone learn it.  I spent DAYS doing Fashnacht to get that sucker.
---
ü§° here's a mirror
---
Yup. Finished the season last week and havent really logged in since. Waiting for the next patch.
---
ü§£üòÇü§£ you literally replied to my comment jackass.  Anyways done with idiots like you. Been fun though. Oh, and next time, before you start commenting on my shit maybe read it all. I said I had no problem with PVP, my problem is twats like you trying to be badass fucking over low level players. So again, get a life "little man". Wouldn't bother replying either cause I'ma block you. Ain't got the time for a random idiot online. üëçüëçüëç
---
ok sweet plague mask how can I get one
---
Best looking under armor in the game hands down
---
Bubye
---
This really should be a priority fix, has it even been acknowledged by them yet? Pretty ironic that they "fixed" it so that instead of just causing the damage bug for you and forcing you to relog, it fucks the game for you AND everybody around you now
---
I agree 200% to include the Ammo Converter.
---
That‚Äôs a poor financial move. You‚Äôre spending 250c to make 250c, when you could be spending a lot less buying the Stable Flux for around 100c and crafting your own. 
---
Turning 100 caps into 650 is a lot smarter than turning 250 into 500.
---
Pretty sure that means the server crashed
---
 Because seasons is meant for you to spend atoms... Not get more... You could make 2000 atoms per month... Now you make 2500 each 3 months... They want you to buy atoms... Not recieve them.
---
Right, but by backups I assume you mean "not a shotgun"
---
There are other options for a strength build including melee or heavy weapons.  I would prefer to have shotguns be a viable option.
---
My point is that magic makes shotguns viable.  Non-magic shotguns are *very* inferior to both melee and heavy guns.  I would say non-magic shotgun damage is on par with pistols (which I think also need help atm) but with less range.
---
I finished like a month ago and have still logged in daily, I guess it just depends on what you like to do in fallout
---
Full auto and silencers are such a great combo. 
---
I could have sworn I read it had a suppressor, must be thinking of 10mm pistol. Good thing I never went out of my way to buy plans and build and scrap multiple SMGs to unlock mods.
---
And I already know about the fusion cell  mod but I really don‚Äôt want to nerf this thing.
---
Yes it's 2 hand
---
Being a survivor in post apocalyptic times doesn't mean you want to look dirty and grungey, and I always change my camp from one style the next. Sometimes I want a nice clean looking camp, others it looks like it belongs in post apocalyptic times. People just want variety is all
---
It's a lot more common of a typo than you would think, for some reason.
---
...what exactly is the cash grab? They don't sell anything NW exclusive. Hell, most things in the atom shop don't even serve a purpose or outright can't be used there. It wasn't pandering to people who didn't own the game, since it clearly capitalizes on a lot of fallout features instead of being a generic BR.  That free week last year after it launched was full of twitch streamers not knowing how it works until it became common knowledge that gatling gun in third person was ez mode
---
Welcome to being craft locked on your scrip limit
---
I keep decent sentinel pieces too. On my main ive got a good sentinel set and it's great for encryptid
---
Hello, Im both those persons!
---
That's not possible, or an error. Even real cheaters don't get banned here
---
But they don't release much non clean stuff.
---
Yea, no one would want to be dirty, but the stuff you find is gonna be rusty and worn in.
---
Please feel free to do this at my camp.  I like junk.
---
**\*pats bloodied magic combat shotgun\*** *he's a good boi, that he is*
---
Was for sale on the Atom Shop a few weeks ago. I think it's rotated off by now, but maybe check the leaving soon tab? Good luck!
---
I really and truly can't fathom why in the heck can't you select how many of something you want to make and then just press craft and the game calculates everything and the exp all at once and then gives it to you.  For food and bullets at the bare minimum.  Things you will usually craft in bulk.  I mean, they could calculate a crafting time necessary for each piece and then you hit the button and have to wait for everything to be crafted before you can leave the crafting bench.  Of you have to cancel, then the game can just calculate how long out of the total time, round down, and then give you that.  Or if necessary, I'd rather just not get or lose anything but some of my time if I have to cancel before it's done.  If you happen to disconnect, then nothing gained, nothing lost but time.
---
The way it is right now is just unnecessary and I feel like I'm going to crash my game half the time when I bulk craft anything.
---
And for that matter, why the heck does the game need to load the graphics for every single item as I'm scrolling past them?  Just give me a list and if I stop on something for a few seconds, then just load that item.  Or even better, only show the graphic if I "inspect" the item!  The game ran great for me at first before I had so much stuff on me and trying to load the graphics for everything in my inventory is just plain dumb.  
---
There are so many little things like that that should be pretty easy to change for quality of life improvements.  Though I get what you are saying about not wanting them to break anything worse, but you have to break a few eggs when making a cake.  But for real, I can't see how they could hose everything just by disabling the graphics in your inventory other than when inspecting something, and making it possible to bulk produce items like food and ammo and chems and just calculate everything and then make you wait for a timer to tick down while watching your guy hammer or stir or whatever and then just updating your inventory with the items you built while subtracting the necessary materials at the same time.
---
ah great thanks! haven‚Äôt touched my outfit since a few days after release but this might make the cut
---
Yes, you need a minimum of +5 rads inflicted to have a chance of getting a mutation, and when you get one swap to a new server for the next
---
I just put it back on makes my character CHONKY
---

---
Not much for base items. The supply and demand is already rampant and people still overprice things because they either don't care or don't know any better.
---
Ammo is so abundant it will never be worth more than 1 cap per round, except maybe ultracite. Same with meds, or food items. This really only effects/benefits rare weapons and armor. If it were unlimited caps, I could see that causing some issues, but at only 200K the only problem would be the same as it is now, people over pricing common stuff.
---
I mean all the default crap is dirty and rusty and worn in. Everything I started with was all garbage looking stuff. It would make sense to add clean stuff instead of just more dirty crap like is already in the game lol plus the longer you're in a post apocalypse world you'd eventually find some clean stuff, so it makes sense in my opinion that it's getting added instead of more dirty stuff. Just my thoughts on it though
---
I found out the other day the Observant Radstag looks at you and smiles if you point your camera at it.
---
I'd love a sword and board option. That would be fun in PA.
---
Honestly the caps things I can take or leave. It's not much of a concern, but thought I'd throw it up there with the other two since it all pertains to currency. 
---
To be honest (and something I forgot to mention in the post) is more the issue of the game fucking blowing caps into the void if someone decided to buy more than 30K of stuff from your shop.
---
Looks like I hit the nail on the head. You didn‚Äôt even try to dispute it. Check please.
---
It's stupid, i usually sell legends cheap for newer players, (most bloodied weapons i sell for 150), almost every session i get some level 10 or so asking for my lvl 50 TSE weapon. Everytime i tell them it's abit too high for their level. "I'll get there in a day or two" "it's just a gun" and a bunch of profanity.
---
Glorious, somewhere Grahm celebrates covered in mayonnaise.
---
NOw there's a thought. That's something I didn't know.
---
Honestly we need more people like that I‚Äôve done at least three or four events where we didn‚Äôt get to kill Earle because everybody was just hacking away at Earle and people die every three seconds because nobody was attacking the spawns or it gets annoying when somebody‚Äôs getting attacked by two or three of them and they just walk around expecting you to shoot them I don‚Äôt know maybe I‚Äôm just rude but if you can‚Äôt deal good damage to the colossus take care of the Spaans at least until he mutates and then unleash on it Because somebody that‚Äôs doing bad damage to the classes while everybody else that could be doing good damage to it is killing the spawns you won‚Äôt win the event. It‚Äôs happened numerous times . But on the other hand I have 60+ new cards if anybody wants to fight the scorch beast queen or Earl with me I just hate running the damn silos
---
I did state to the effect they were giving out to much, and not to do that (if you read down a little farther), they would encourage the spending of atoms for seasons. as is there is no real reason to continue if you complete the season, not sure how much time you invested into the game but the worlds are dead only a hand full of die-hards per server (I'm one) and not that many servers.
---
Did Bethesda even have a plan for peeps who finish early? I mean the real intent of these seasons was to keep people playing-logging in daily but instead more and more are staying away after...(I've also noticed quiet servers the past week)
---
And yeah you can solo line in the sand, I use to do it all the time.
---
Haven't had that happen. No one owes me anything, I may be nice and drop stuff for lower levels, but not when demanded.
---
I see you and I have an entirely different amount of heavy weapons....
---
I found a ruined Red Rocket Garage camp that I thought was a new unmarked location because it didn't show on my map as a camp with vendors.   Turns out it was somebody's camp, so I started repairing it so I could use the workbenches.  10 seconds later I start hearing the sound of bullets hitting the garage.   Hit Vats. Nothing. Look around, hit Vats again. Nothing.  Bullets are hitting the back, seemingly coming from the bushes.  So I stand over there, looking in the direction of the gunfire, and tap my map.  
---
The Sunnytop Ski Resort super mutants are drilling the camp through bushes and trees.  So I go wipe them out and stand where they are and I can't even see the damn garage because of all the trees. My camp is about the same distance from this location, but I don't draw fire from the supers. 
---
And that's my boring story about bizarre aggro ranges in Fo76.
---
Yeah I want that too.
---
You don‚Äôt think increasing the supply of caps in the economy by 700% will have any effect on inflation?
---
Well we now know what puts that smile on his face
---
Yes they do
---
I do!
---
How you gonna dump, 
---
dump that junk, 
---
dump that junk all in my trunk?!
---
My trunk, 
---
my trunk, 
---
my lovely CA.M.P. trunk!
---
It's the only one I've ever seen, that makes it rare to me, but doesn't mean that it is rare at all. I know I hate those stupid propaganda posters, why do they end up in my Notes area (could be Misc, I don't remember) instead of junk. I think I'll collect 1 million of those, since they have no weight, and if a developer from Bethesda comes online, drop them on their camp.
---
Depends on what your selling. Trying to capture the flooded plan market by selling every plan imaginable, your market is new characters and the forest makes sense. Trying to sell good lvl 50 legendaries, the mire and the bog are a better choice since this location implies a higher lvl camp owner who would have lvl 50 legendaries and not 15 non legendary pipe weapons. 
---
Alternatively, find a spot that inspires you to build a unique camp and forget about traffic.
---
I only carry one, which weighs ~20 lbs.  I carry more than 20 stimpaks, so that alone makes TP worth it over BA.
---
You didn‚Äôt shut me down. You made a false claim and I‚Äôve challenged you to support it.  You‚Äôve failed to do so.
---
I have been getting the server notifications every so often as well. Only for a second, though. Never kicks me out of the server completely. I figured it was something with my connection, but maybe not.
---
Love it!!
---
Easy.  Have the server calculate everything one at a time while your guy just hammers or stirs or whatever on your screen.  You don't have to be updated of every single item as it's calculated, just get your items back and materials removed at the end of the necessary time.  A huge part of why it's so slow is every crafting attempt is a call back to the server, checking your perks and whatnot, and then waiting for a response.  
---
It's why it's so terrible to make anything in bulk.  Instead of 50 separate calls and checks (or however many items you are making) the game should send what perks you have equipped and what materials you have that are needed for the items along with how many items you want to make, the server calculates everything and then the server sends back one response of how long you have to wait to receive your items (or a failure because you don't have enough) and you just watch your guy at the crafting bench and see the countdown.  At the end of the countdown, the server tells your system how many materials to deduct from your inventory and how many items to add.  Easy and you don't have to mash the crap out of your button and you don't have to wonder if you are going to crash while doing it.  And if you do disconnect or crash, then nothing is lost or gained other than some time.  Or the server could wait for you to rejoin and then go ahead and update everything if the timer is done and you haven't been disconnected for that long.
---
Making it work is not the difficult part.  And I can't understand why it wasn't made that way in the first place.  But maybe making it work while not breaking something else is the difficulty.  Regardless, it's inexcusable how it is right now.
---
Alright lmao
---
I‚Äôm just wondering why so many people seem to congregate in the starting area bc it‚Äôs so boring, it‚Äôs gotta be the caps right?
---
No. You will need to revisit the location every day.
---
You're not along, I've gotten 4 requests like theses in the last month.  Annoying since I normally like to help but beggars annoy me.
---
Yeah, I agree. I would suggest following the quest lines until you‚Äôve only got repeating ones left. That‚Äôll get you to a level you can handle the ‚Äúend game‚Äù content/events. Fallout 76 is kind of designed like a single player rpg that way. (Which is what I like about it.)
---
I was lucky to trade for one that was still 100%. No way I'm using it until this is fixed.
---
Damn ah well still good info. Ty!
---
I resisted bloodied up to about your level. Once I made the turn I never looked back. The DMG output is insane. Plus with Secret Service armor serendipity etc you rarely die. Think about it.
---
It can easily be solo'd by any stealth high DPS build. The key being stealth and not getting into [Danger] to maintain high DPS. 
---
I hit the earl for roughly 160 before adrenaline kicks in, pushing up to 300-400 per shot. I can solo Earl in under 2min if I ignore the Wendigo spawns. 
---
They key when playing stealth is to remember the Earl will attack where you fire from, so take shots and move somewhere before he agros to you.
---
Not that obnoxious but... This guy at my camp send the trade thing, i wanted to see what he wanted and he requested all the types of ammo i use, i rejected that, then made the follow emote and wanted me to unlock my colectron, again, no. He got angry and started shooting at my walls lol. and is not like he was a low level or something, he was a little more than lvl 100, more than the level i had when it happened. Good thing I have messages blocked so i guess i have it easy because of that
---
You rambled on about vendors and garages like a gibbering moron. I could roll my face across my keyboard and make more sense than you did.
---
enough people showed up for my unused grenade launcher to get me 2 levels and then some. Still worth.
---
He also seems to not know that you can sell serums to vendorbots for 500c.
---
I don't shop in the Forest as it's generally implied it'll be low level crap.
---
I find I tend to focus on the Divide between WS and Watoga. I'll only FT to the Mire if I know a name from historic vending or they numbers seem quite good.
---
Personally I'm about to shut my vending down as I swear people aren't on F76 after the Seasons grind. It feels like the player base is on vacation lol
---
I am less likely to travel to a camp if it's further out.. despite having a silly amount of caps. 
---
Near a railway station is a good location as well. I'm just south of pleasant valley and get plenty of traffic. ALSO it does help if you have good stuff for sale =0
---
No clue. I fall into the third category. My goal is to make a camp that people like and want to explore. Having a good sale list is just advertisement. Because of that I don‚Äôt make my sales in volume. I make my sales on a 10k legendary sale every 2-3 days.
---
That's funny. I found a stag sleeping in my tent once. Well, it may have been dead, but it was on my sleeping bag, so, I figured it was asleep.
---
Would you like some links on how to build a more interesting camp?
---
I'll usually drop a nuke on whitesprings solo in my private server and just farm ghouls for the materials. Transfer them to my mule and then when I need flux I'll either drop another nuke or find a server with one already down.
---
They screwed over the founders for save the world. The game was released and advertised originally as just save the world. Once epic saw PUBG's popularity they got greedy and wanted a piece of the pie, so they took the funds from the founders paying into save the world and released Battle Royale with no warnings whatsoever. Save the world had ONLY two worlds complete before releasing battle royale as a fully done mode, it was kind of fucked up. The reddit and community was very active day to day giving Epic feedback but it fell on deaf ears, because they didn't care about the original game.
---
Edit: You can still find early development and release details of Fortnite, and that it was NEVER ment to be a battle royale game.
---
Or 50 cal balls.....
---
Well i mean. I have a hammer. So im best at killing hordes of monster :D
---
I'm still salty about that :(
---
I want them to add new voice lines to Ward, Wren and the other daily person.
---
You'd think after a certain point in your affiliation with them that they stop being pushy assholes.
---
I'm tired of seeing "I launched my first nuke" posts
---
I sell a bunch of plans for super cheap, I always love finding a place selling plans cheap so I became that place. I also sell ammo and legendaries that I think are too good to scrap but I won‚Äôt use. But mainly just cheap ass plans, sometimes free plans.
---
Most of the bugs or suggestions. Not because of the people posting them, but because these are things that should have already been fixed or be in the game already, tbh.
---
It‚Äôs funny how people get scared by ‚Äúhigh‚Äù level players. My level 65 mule killed a level 450. And I killed a wanted level 704 yesterday with my level 150. After about level 55 you have access to everything you need to be effective.
---
There are some games where the time to craft a single item is a critical part of the game (I‚Äôve been playing Green Hell a bit and time management is critical) but I‚Äôve never starved to death in FO76 crafting that one extra bowl of soup.
---
My guess is that they never really play tested some of these mechanics. ‚ÄúOh, OK it works for n = 1 so they can just repeat if them want than one item. Done!‚Äù
---
Scoop out the guts and you'd have yourself a brand spanking new scavenger-approved sleeping bag!
---
My junkies explosive drops them I'd say about half the time.
---
Yes something like "attention everybody in the (region name that's about to get nuked) there is a nuke about to hit the place"
---
Or announcing the events like "looks like the scorchbeast queen is out of her nest, go kill her!" Or "the scavengers at emmet mountain are about to start their salvage operation, go help em, they're paying well"
---
Sad face.
---
You're not maxed out on bullion are you?
---
I've never had any complaints about my camp before. In fact i've been told i have quite a nice camp a few times.
---
It‚Äôs all about numbers for me , I‚Äôll jump anywhere if they have numbers worth looking into. 40+ misc , 5+ weapons and Stimpaks for fighting earl. Location doesn‚Äôt even get considered
---
Is it just me or are the public events are really slow to pop on the map. I feels like hours at times between events...
---
Really? I see full servers all around!
---
I mean honestly. If we‚Äôre only allowed 20 at a time it should just be that way.
---
Unless they are planning to adjust the amount soon.
---
This happens because of 'Strange in Numbers' which takes effect when you're in a team *with* another person It boosts your herbivore mutation furthermore to give you the +25%.
---
Is that adrenaline lvl 5?
---
I have a HE and a whole whitespring run didnt drop one
---
And you don‚Äôt seem to understand that there is a 1400 cap limit when selling to npc vendors. 
---
Also hello again, I look forward to you following my post history to make comments on all the threads I participate in. There needs to be a word to describe your behavior. I don‚Äôt think ‚Äútriggered‚Äù is a strong enough word for this.
---
I need this for my Kurt Cobain character I want to make. The only flannel is under armour.
---
Pandering to the BR fad, duh. Do you honestly believe NW would exist if not for the popularity of fortnite? Give me a break!
---
Ooh shit i love Gta talk radio! I'd love to have a talk show with named NPCs of the wastes as guests! Graham, Murmurgh, Gnash and Ward. Some would be serious, some would be humorous like the grizzly bear on eric andre
---
Yep, as far as i know there haven't been any new hairstyles since the games release.
---
Then find a cool place in the forest region. Trying to sell cheap plans in the bog or mire is more difficult. Most of your visitors will be high level and already have most plans.
---
You‚Äôll have to wait until they implement mods, and then we can buy new ones. Bethesda is too damn lazy to make them for us.
---
Honestly no, not with a max cap still. Again if it were unlimited I could see people starting to list things higher and higher for more profit, and things could get out of control.
---
Maybe I am missing something that someone isn't explaining to me? Inflation is caused by higher demand or higher cost for materials etc. So the supply would be the same, and the demand would be the same, the only difference I see is a higher max which would allow high end items to be sold for caps.
---
Again, people already overprice items for caps in the market place, but most people know worth/cost of items. People can list for whatever prices they want, but the costs of things like ammo, meds, junk wouldn't be effected.
---
No worries, only 500 atoms each for the green and white style, but if you want blue that'll be 1300 for the bundle and you get all 3!
---
Bethesda looking at this thread: Got‚Äôeem! They just keep wanting more stuff! The plan is working.
---
Ya ok, that sure explains why you‚Äôre following my post history and commenting on all my posts. 
---
You got shut down
---
You got angry
---
You‚Äôre following me around to try to hit me with some kind of ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù so you can feel redeemed. 
---
Good luck. You‚Äôre only digging yourself a bigger hole.
---
Are u on xbox?
---
Yes but not like in the good old days where every kill gave multiple back lol. I think they fixed the drops to be more like bows/crossbows.
---
I see, you're debating on whether it is more useful for you instead of which perk can be more useful in general. Ironically both positions are purely player to player, so you are not wrong. That being said, it actually kind of makes me sad you only carry one heavy around. I know your situation, here is mine.
---
 I carry up to 200 stimpacks, 50 of rad x and rad away diluted, berry mentats, and a heap of psychotats. Chemist back pack works amazing for that. Off the top of my head on average and  I'm sorry If it looks like I'm bragging; 2 lmgs, 2 gat plasmas, 2 50s, 2 flamers, a gat laser, and a rocket launcher at most times. Bear arms is amazing for that. And before you say, put some up, I have close to 700 pounds more of heavy weapons in my stash and if I put most of them on my alt I would never play with them again. Many of them are also for different situations, explosive/ffr and so on. It's also more efficient to store them on me with bear arms.
---
"the Botherhood"  :) I'm calling them that from now on...
---
Gimme Ulysses's duster and Joshua Graham 's armor WITH the bandages wrapping around the arms.
---
Just as a curiosity, what‚Äôs ‚Äúnumbers seem quite good‚Äù to you. Asking from the perspective of a Mire resident with pirate ship in the lake by Thunder mountain.
---
I don‚Äôt think it necessarily matters. All limits would be arbitrary and no matter what the limit is, someone would complain about it not being enough.
---
Fully agree, without VATS. This gun is hard to get very accurate shots
---
Yeah it use to be better but Bethesda changed something awhile back I believe. I can do rad rumble and only loot like 15 total half the time.
---
Can the blast zone shift? I wanted to nuke Fort Defiance for Line In The Sand to farm materials and I chose the LITS event and clicked confirm but when I left the screen and checked my map it moved it to the right completely missing Fort Defiance and the event.
---
Pink pipboy skin is big sad
---
I‚Äôd already been in this thread six hours ago. And u/Rammadeus and I interact a lot anyways. 
---
Don‚Äôt flatter yourself.
---
Wait - from a systems architecture perspective, why are perks server side? Or why the constant calls to the server? I wonder if things are fully optimized or if it‚Äôs likely a common story of being tied to some archaic method with a mountain of dependencies so changing shit is an instant non starter.
---
I‚Äôm well aware of the vendor cap limit. I never said you could sell more than a few at a time to a vendorbot. 
---
And I‚Äôd already been in this thread six hours ago. And u/Rammadeus and I interact a lot anyways.
---
Might seem like a dumb question but you have already bought the normal leg plans right?
---
I wonder if they smell as bad on the inside as tauntauns.
---
A LMG is good in this messy situation. Especially if with vats. Kill rate is high and clears the field quickly. Kept a bloodied one with me to clear the road after earl died for everyone else
---
What‚Äôs DPS on something like that?
---
Are you missing being able to craft the legs themselves or the mod for the legs?
---
This is literally your 8th reply to me outside of our original conversation.

Would be nice... i know i‚Äôm not alone with my 900 treasury notes

Don‚Äôt flatter yourself.  Two threads. One of which I was already in a long time ago.

And I‚Äôm still waiting for that citation. Or do you plan to retract your false claim?
---
Well that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying if we had a way to purchase more stash space there would be no reason for somebody to complain people spend $15 on a mask you could spend $15 and get 50 pounds of space or what not

Thats why its only worn by my Ally. Cos I cant stand the sight of her

You‚Äôre welcome. Now stop going down to avoidable traps.

the repetable heart of the enemy was patched, right?
---
I only ask because when I first got access to bullion plans, I bought the buttressed arms and legs and didn‚Äôt realise I also had to actually buy the legs and arms plan to mod them on to
---
Grafton High suit with Grafton Monster on back beats out everything for me
---
No! Don't give them more MTX ideas! Encourage them to fix some of the other stuff first.
---
I just don't use the fermenter. Alcohol naturally ferments after about 30 minutes, and in my experience you can't turn regular drinks into a vintage version like they promised so I just save CAMP budget.
---
Play time lol
---
Exactly.  But even if you were starving to death in FO76, you could still craft a single food bowl of soup. Doesn't keep you from crafting one item if you wish or need to.  Plus, you could just cancel the crafting job and eat something from your inventory if it was that critical.  And either the server could calculate exactly how much you should get for the time spent, or just cancel the whole process and you lose a little time.  But regardless, it sure would make crafting items in bulk much more pleasant.
---
The thing is that I really like the game and I still play even with things in the state they are.  There is so much potential for things to be better though.  It almost feels like Stockholm syndrome sometimes with me staying even though I'm being abused!  I love me some fallout, and the bones of FO76 are so amazing, but it's saddening the state so many things are in with the game.  This is one of those games I would likely play for years and years, but I already feel the death by a thousand cuts coming on with how frustrated I get with so many of the bugs and weird design choices in the game.
---
I sure as heck hope everything gets ironed out into what it could be before enough people get fed up and leave for something else.
---
Also idk why but my combat rifles magazine has been glitched and now it has 230 bullets instead of 20 in this magazine lol
---
But why though?  I'm planning on having 3 .50's. I was using gauss minis but they're too ammo inefficient.  I'm hoping for a be90, a bffr90, and a vffr90.  Currently I have a 2* vffr.  With mods on that's 15 pounds total.  I suppose I could try to roll a 90 gauss mini to, but that might take a while.  Why do you need 10 weapons?
---
By killing things,&amp; only using 2 out of the eleven teen billion kinds available,&amp; then converting what I don‚Äôt sell In my vendor.
---
How bout choo?
---
Same sorta. I haven't been playing the game as long so idk
---
I can only confirm on consoles haven't talked to anyone on PC but there's a few that commented on here where it was also a issue for them on there PC.
---
I agree with you my dude
---
They also drop 2mm Ultracite.
---
server hop a little you end up on the same server a lot of the time now, that never happened before (that's why I think there isn't a lot up anymore)
---
Wait, wasn‚Äôt it included in 76 but then removed?
---
Gun fu is our friend
---
Idk man the old school ones are kinda nice. Theres only like 2 good male hairstyles.
---
Had this happen to me the last two days too! I thought I was crazy!
---
You on PC? Majority seems to be ps4
---
If your on Xbox I could probably hook you up with some depending on what it is you use.
---
My minigun mag shows 999 rounds but never goes down, I assume it holds all 8000 I carry lol, handy for Earle...
---
lol, that would be nice, never understood why it started at max count if all I can turn in was 20 a day.
---
Yes a new feature created was public teams
---
Its better than regular teams but anyone can join sadly
---
What citation? I must have missed it with this barrage of messages you‚Äôre sending to my inbox. If your stupidity wasn‚Äôt so entertaining then one might consider it harassment. But it is too funny.
---
Should have gone to Specsavers.
---
I'd need to see atleast a half dozen for weapons, armor and ammo in the thousands (minimum). I don't care for plans as I know most all of them and people with hundreds of plans are generally mounted heads people. 
---
It's just so remote over there and you end up with a disease from bugs and water lol.
---
Awww little dude I meant FERAL ones. The domesticated are fine!!!
---
Isn't it a quest item?
---
No, its worth nothing
---
Yes please. My AAE 10mm SMG is one of my favorite guns. Would love a suppressor and a reflex sight at least!
---
Screws? Im there for the ammo
---
Honestly I have no idea why they decided to do things this way in the first place.  To me it makes no sense.  I'm not some big game company programmer, I only do stuff on PLC's and smaller embedded systems and such, but especially with what I'm doing making tons of little calls instead of a few bigger calls is a problem.  And I'm only speculating with what Bethesda has decided to do in FO76, but the way the game acts makes me pretty sure they are calculating every transaction server side to try to cut down on cheating, but it's bogging things down far too much.  You can still cut down on the cheating by having the server calculate things, but it doesn't have to be a one at a time thing.  I know programming isn't easy, and doing things one way only to find you have to refactor or sometimes even scrap it and start over for it to be right is a terrible feeling, but sometimes it's necessary.
---
But this is one of those things that any competent programmer should be able to rectify without too much difficulty, and it would boost quality of life in the game dramatically.
---
Just build him one and let him be. Or make him wait .
---
Everyone can do it with enough screws and some patience.

Ya ok. You try to say that I don‚Äôt know the vendor value of serums and then dismiss the huge glaring issue with vendoring serums. 
---
This is the problem with every point you try to bring up. You only think one step ahead without considering that the step after that is a dead end.
---
Vendor value doesn‚Äôt make any difference if you can‚Äôt take advantage of it. 
---
For goodness sakes think before you hit send.

The New Vegas devs said Elvis music rights cost more than development of the game.
---
I had 1 explosive fixer. So far no one buys them. Problem I think is also that I dont know if it is day or night unless I m in a forested area... lolz
---
They're mods my friend :-)
---
What system are you on bro? Its good for mining ore. And weight value but not much else
---
I'm just gonna ignore them now. They are silly.
---
Take the card off and then put it back on again. If you've tried that, then I have no idea.
---
I can see how that can be a problem anyway thanks for the info
---
Buying it for 1 cap each. Got about 400k 5.56 between all five characters.
---
Easy enough to make I guess
---
Ah im on ps4. Would have walked you to the plans.  Sorry mate. Bottom left of the map in the ash heap
---
This is the blight of all F2P RPGs. I assume probably due to the game pass release. People sitting around begging for shit. Kids/lazy people who try to freeload off others because they don't wanna do the grind. 
---
It's why I love keeping my camp out in the BFE end of cranberry bog. I have tons of free shit in my vendors. Right now I think I have about three full sets worth of ultracite PA plans, plus ultra light mods for marine armor, PA jet pack plans, antibiotic and stimpack recipes, all of it 0-20 caps each. If anyone needs the buy three of something from a vendor it's there.(xbox) I usually make my money off the god roll legendary weapons and armor I find that I will never ever use, or my serums I sell. I could make more money moving closer to vault 76, but I don't like being so available to low levels. I like staying hidden so nobody comes and screws with me. I typically stay close to my 25k cap limit too, so short of buying gold I have no cap sink anymore, unless I find a great heavy gunner weapon.
---
I feel like most of the time,the forest is a good CAMP spot because of the free fast travel to vault 76,I have my camp just a smidge away Under the big Ol bridge there,a bit to the south.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt say business is good,by any means,but it‚Äôs def better then when I had it In the upper right hand corner of the map In the Mire.
---
While I liked that previous CAMPs location &amp; ambience better,I finally can sell things a bit more,now that I‚Äôm ‚Äúkinda close‚Äù to 76.
---
I tried a medics reduced vats cost fixer, but it seems to have a very short range on its heal rate, so was non viable for the event unless I just hugged each team member who needed healing.
---
Every two bullets was a crit, and heals weren't even noticeable.
---
My mini nukes would like a word... :)
---
How do you get that many caps tho
---
I remember reading in another thread that if you receive and register the excavator armor before learning the plans for it, you are locked out and are unable to learn the plans to make it. Maybe this person is in a similar boat?
---
Edit: To clarify - if someone gives you a set of armor, and you then go to the mining facility and 'register that power armor' as part of the quest (without first learning the plans from the terminal), then you are unable to learn the plans for it.
---
I'm assuming it was probably a 1:1 trade initially and it was tweaked but they forgot to change the GPM from 200 to 20.
---
What problem?  Vendor two a day and then sell the others for cheaper in your own vendor. 
---
Why would anyone buy them [from you for 500](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ila1vn/anything_i_should_know_about_mutation_serums/g3qvmvq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) when so many other people are selling for 300 or less?
---
No I‚Äôve got the plans for it, it‚Äôs just someone‚Äôs offered me a jet pack and level 50 armour for it
---
Maybe
---
Don‚Äôt give them any ideas...
---
Alright, I'll be back on in like an hour or 2. Start a chat with me on here and drop your GT. I'll hit you up as soon as I get on.
---
There is a reference from shining. You can find the Nickolson dead with his axe inside the garden-maze
---
Inb4 removal.  Witch hunting is not allowed here.
---
Side note, store your junk first.  It's that simple.
---
Ohhh... well sounds like they have no clue what they are doing.
---
It had a special message about world owner not being there
---
By using a gauss shotgun which is very ammo friendly tbh
---
Are you really trying to say that following my post history and commenting about me under someone else‚Äôs reply to me in an unrelated conversation in a completely separate post somehow makes the entire affair not ridiculously cringeworthy?
---
That‚Äôs your defense for your behavior? Yikes.
---
How about dreadlocks?
---
Idea: For FO1/2: Brotherhood of Steel Power Armor/Armor paint schemes. The classic old paint.
---
Enclave Power Armor/Combat Armor paint schemes from FO2.
---
That could definitely be good for those of us who're FO1st members.
---
I just want to alert all PS4 players if it happens to you I don't think you like it
---
Yeah true, I just want someone to have them. My ammo sells super fast lol.
---
Where did you study economics? Increasing the supply of a currency devalues that currency... meaning you need to use more of that currency to buy things. Look at a country like Venezuela. They aren‚Äôt experiencing hyper inflation because demand is increasing...
---
You‚Äôre welcome friend
---
Not quite. The private server is a big win.
---
Thanks, I try
---
Ahhhhhhhhh. 
---
Shit. Thanks!
---
&gt; I need a way to get Atoms.
---
$$$
---
Ay I found out that thank you so much it really bugged me off with all the stuff I can't sell.
---
I‚Äôm level 410. my camp is in the forest. 
---
I sell ballistic and energy ammo for 1 cap each (I usually have around 2k assorted ammo); I also sell uncommon clothing (like BOS stuff from tech data and uncommon headwear); I also sell legendary weapons, good prefixes only (bloodied; junkies, AA, furious, 1,2 or 3 stars); and good plans, plans for weapons, not plans for the mods, plans for weapons themselves; also uncommon plans like BOS shielded, marine shielded, and rare drops from events like walking cane plan mods, fixer plans and so on). 
---
I have a lot of traffic, both low levels and high levels, and I‚Äôm always having trouble staying below the caps cap. 
---
so all things considered, yes, it‚Äôs a viable and profitable option to have a camp in the forest.
---
No more cringey than making a false claim about someone. 
---
Either support the allegation you made against me or admit you made an error of assumption. 
---
You seem to be bothered by ‚Äòunfair treatment‚Äô. How curious.
---
Nope I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm having one do those days. lol.
---
And yet that still can't kill anything higher than lv 1!
---
I missing the plans to build them. Ugh. Sorry!
---
Hey, without you, we‚Äôd be screwed.
---
bloodied single fire handmade, kicks ass
---
Sad power armor noises
---
Ah I did the same lol! Easy mistake!
---
**BA DUM TSS**
---
He‚Äôs such a hypocrite. He‚Äôs whining because he feels like he‚Äôs being ‚Äòattacked‚Äô but had no issue throwing out a false claim. 
---
Watching him get twisted up is priceless.
---
Catch you later, man. I‚Äôm going to let the fish broil in the brook for a bit, lol.
---
I can‚Äôt say for certain why other people buy my serums at 500 each. All I know is that they do. 
---
I hit the vendor cap limit every day just selling a fraction of the hundreds of stimpacks that this game throws around. 
---
It is no surprise that someone who has no grasp on economics has such difficulty vendoring trash that they would actually consider vendoring serums.
---
No. Everyone can craft it. There‚Äôs a quest related to it.
---
Unpopular Opinion: Gauss Minigun is overhyped. I have a bloodied gauss minigun that I loved using, but then I found a regular bloodied minigun and its just SO MUCH BETTER. I think a bloodied .50 cal will be even better, but I have yet to find one of those.
---
Sure the damage per hit is lower, but the rate of fire completely makes up for it. Also the ammo is dirt cheap 5mm. AND the scope doesn't cover the target which is a nice QoL.
---
I have 580 lmao
---
A jetpack for what though?
---
Now where did I say ***I*** vendor serums?  I stated what they *could* be vendored for. 
---
I vendor purified water and excess gear. 
---
Knowing the math of what can be done doesn‚Äôt mean I use that method myself.
---
It‚Äôs amusing watching you jump to conclusions without supporting evidence. 
---
That seems to be your shtick. So you‚Äôre either unintentionally ignorant and obtuse, or you‚Äôre choosing to be a troll. 
---
Either way, you‚Äôre certainly amusing, and also pitiable.
---
i tried giving everyone 20 stimpacks each. never again
---
You're not brother! IT IS REAL.
---
They had a pipe shotgun for 4 through CC, so they already have everything they need. If I recall, it was basically a superior double barrel, and could have one, two, or three barrels.
---
Players are still there. Just taking a breather.
---
Some level 50 power armour
---
Thanks! Lmfao. Well guess I need to save up and go back. Lol.
---
Ha OK just checking. I'll have to keep an eye out later when I exchange
---
I don‚Äôt know if you are aware but you can (slightly) control where you run with right analog on console
---
&gt;y a small army‚Äôs worth of guns, meds, and ammo. I would recommend carrying just two guns and t
---
90% rad reduction, not 99%. The hazmat suits and Chinese stealth armour give 99%
---
Yeah. Waste of a faction, if you ask me.
---
Because I have tons of decent to god tier weapons that I like and want to play with. Some days you just want to stealthily snipe with an explosive flamer. Orther days you just want to channel your inner pyro and spray those happy bubbles into all of those cherubs. Some days I want to fly around with a bloody rocket launch and rain tracking death. Some days I like the feel of a 50. Cal rattling off. Spewing hundreds of rounds from a minigun in seconds, just shredding everything that unfortunately walks in its path. Vats nading with an auto grenader is super fun and a good alternative to fail selling them for 25 caps. Running around in a swimsuit with a sea captains hat and harpoon gun is both asteticaly pleasing and hilarious. I dont really have a reason for the gat laser besided I kind of wanted one 100 levels ago and had an opportunity to get a decent one (wouldn't make the same decision again, but hey, I've got it). I can go on, but the point is; I've done every quest, been to the bottom of every dungeon, killed every possible enemy, done every event. All I have left to do is play with my spoils after over 550 cumulative levels of play.
---
As for meds, I buy in bulk and HATE transferring them over multiple times.
---
Oh, that. Yeah, Explosive modifier really helps there.
---
+1
---
Unfortunately, this makes too much sense, so we'll not be seeing this idea implemented in the game. üí°üí°üí°üòÇ
---
Thanks OP. Quick screenshot to add to the list.
---
Ill make sure any attempt is met with tenfold bait to vital structures.
---
I‚Äôd say I‚Äôd hook ya up,but those are the 2 I use,Lol
---
556 fer my handmade,&amp; 45 for my Fixer &amp; Lever action.
---
I may have some other for you to covert,if ya had the ammo converter &amp; had the time/patience to do it.
---
Also I wish it would say how much ammo I have while using the ammo converter. Or at least ghost/disable the entries I don't have enough of to convert. It's a pain in the butt trying to convert 7 different flavors of ammo and remembering how many I have of each, or just attempting trial and error.
---
are you on xbone?
---
That's true. Activity will be lower than average, but core players are most likely to stay and get back into it when the times comes.
---
I‚Äôve been playing 900 hours, still waiting for find a trap camp. I hope to find one one day...
---
Store your junk and it‚Äôs no harm.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
I said it before and I shall say it again
---
I want a mullet

Laters
---
Blast its legs off than get behind it and, unload into the back of its head or just in the back. It has brittle legs.
---
He had turrets set up, but they weren't reacting to the Settler's attack. Weird. I kinda didn't want to kill them.. so I just left them to their business.
---
1. Forest is nice looking quite peacefull place mobs there stays on low level so you don't even have to worry about defending the camp. Basic turrets will do the work.
---
2. There is giant river which adds up to location. Loactions with nice river sighting is best.
---
3. Wayward is here it's one of more popular places
---
I found my spot there too. There is watch tower *nearby* fields right under f76 (nearby cuz it's visible from lumberyard and that starter farm.) also my place is on cliff so it's easier to defend place where enemy comes from only one side.
---
As a Fo1st member myself id prefer something like the bog wanderer outfit again. Its simple, looks good, and doesnt mess with my precious lore. Thats just me though, i wouldn't be mad if more people wanted stuff from the old games
---
Stash limit is there for a reason
---
Git gud
---
Steamcharts isn't the best baseline for whether or not people are playing, just because the game's still active on the bethesda games launcher, but I feel like dailies really aren't the best way to encourage player retention. You can only do the repetitive mindless dailies so many times before you start to go crazy, and there's already enough stuff to do in the game to make it worth returning to. I personally see the devs shifting away from emphasizing dailies as a mechanic as a good thing, just because they were never fun or rewarding imo, even back when you could get like 100 atoms a day by doing them. (Which is nothing)
---
I realize that people are saying the lower atom rewards from seasons compared to how dailies were is a shameless cash grab on beth's part, and that's partially true, but honestly who even really cares? You're not missing out on much. I use one skin from the atom shop per applicable weapon/armor set, and spend my monthly first atoms on shit that looks cool in the moment, but I never end up actually using. (Case in point, i bought literally every single liberty prime skin, but after an hour of using it switched back to the free valentines day skin cuz i thought it looks better) Every player I know either does the same or switches it up a little bit very rarely.
---
what I was wearing was not lead or steel, so I didn't lose anything, it bothers me that they spoil the Fallout game experience like this by playing dirty üòâ
---
I missed fissure site prime once while nuking drunk. 
---
I logged off in shame...
---
Very op ammo glitch. I'll tell you how to do it if you want.
---
I'll do that. Anything that helps man
---
Then heres what you do, you spend next month playing the game every single day just to earn back the exact amount of money in the form of a currency that can only be spent in their in-game store
---
Lol yeah in that instance I probably would have watched it play out
---
Dapper hairstyle but less bushy. Also spiked hair gel just in the front would be nice. Some more ponytails for women (or dudes too I guess) would be great. Young at Heart has a weird hairline.
---
We should get a barber you could build at your camp and maybe a tattoo shop you could visit
---
I‚Äôm remember something about them saying that they weren‚Äôt fixing that helmet. Which is just... Dumb. Somebody did a ticket or something.
---
You do get quite a bit. It takes around 3-4 shots from my handmade to kill them and I get around 20-40 bullets a kill.
---
They need some longer one's for sure. I love the premise for most of the 50 style hairstyles, but the execution just seems all wrong.
---
Pain.
---
No. Even if you kill all wendigos and revive everyone, the quest will flop if  there aren't enough people who can deal a lot of dps.
---
Dirt tiles
---
Gauss Shotty
---
T65 
---
Ammo machine
---
unlock everything, even if you do not want it
---
Thanks that‚Äôs a good reason to play with others!
---
Whuuut where do I get the ammo machine?
---
As someone roleplaying a raider boss, I love the dirty, ramshackle stuff.
---
I may end up having to. I got a lot of gold already and more to exchange.
---
Raiders have to be max rank with them.
---
Serves you right. /s üòÇ
---
Yes thank you. I always put in the t fuse first because it made sense to me that idk you needed power first for the machine I thought idk lol thank you I'm finnaly passed this dang part.
---
Yep.  Beyond that, levels are just an indicator of time invested.  A high level might make me think that because of that time invested, they probably have a good weapon and armor by now, but a low level twink could as well.  I've killed people much higher than me, and have been killed by people much lower than me.  Every build is going to have a build or a weapon that can counter it.
---
This.
---
I'm guessing the jetpack is probably just a plan for ultracite.
---
Like others have said, it's not rare at all, good for mining, and you can make it fairly easily. By how it sounds, the armor the guy is offering is either not legendary or just crappy legendaries. If you have plenty of resources to make another set and don't mind helping the guy out, then by all means.
---
Yeah until they only focus on the small ones and let time run out because they haven't shot Earle at all. This is one of the reasons I stopped going to colossal problem as much, lots of people seem to be more focused on farming screws and killing the small wendigos and give Earle 0% of their attention and it's a massive waste of my ammo lol
---
It could be like Gibraltar from Apex legends
---
88mil
---
you changed to what ?
---
Max reputation with the raiders.
---
ya, PC player
---
There‚Äôs a lot of QOL things that get suggested on this sub that we wish would get in, but ultimately won‚Äôt. 
---
It sucks that there still isn‚Äôt clear communication.
---
the decision to leave it without a suppresor doesnt make any sence, in rl smg's like the mp5 and even old weapons like the sten have silenced variants.
---
I actually thought this happened to me a few days ago.... not sure if it actually gave me the gold but it surely took my notes...  thought I was going crazy
---
I understand the devalue of currency, but I guess I'm not looking at based on the cap value itself, but maybe I should be. I am looking at it based purely off of cap values for current market items, which I see no reason would change. The only difference would be the ability to list higher priced legendaries and the like, and players would also have the ability to save the caps for them.
---
A casual player can save up caps, even if it is slowly, but chances are they aren't going to be able to have great gear for trading. If the market is centralized around caps then even casual players can save up for high end items that they otherwise wouldn't be able to trade for.
---
I apologize, I don't think I'm really understanding how it would effect things that negatively with a cap limit still. I'm not trying to be stupid or argumentative, I just genuinely don't see the problem in regards to the game economy if there is a cap, even if it's a higher one. I've never played any MMOs with such a low cap on currency and the economies run smoothly, inflated or not.
---
Also I appreciate your comments and feedback, really!
---
Jet packs plans drop constantly from queenie.
---
I think the idea is that you talk to your teammates and confirm whether they are or aren't interested in joining the battle, whether they are prepped with sufficient ammo and stims, weapons and armor repaired, etc. Talking to teammates is generally how I figure out their relative level of knowledge and experience. Character level doesn't tell me much. There are people who have alts who are doing more damage at level 35 than newer players whose first character is level 120.   
---
At this point I'm reasonably experienced and do a decent amount of damage. However, I'm frequently not just sitting around at my camp doing nothing besides waiting for someone else to launch a nuke. ;) So when I get a random notification that the event has begun and there haven't already been other recent nuke launches or etc, I'm frequently in a situation where I can't immediately fast travel. I may be in the middle of another quest or event, overencumbered, halfway through refilling my vending machines, helping a low level, etc etc whatever.  
---
So if someone lower level joins my team and is ideally hoping that I'll show up and help give Earl a good wallop, I need them to give me a heads up at least 10 minutes beforehand. I'm not constantly scanning the map to see whether anyone is in a silo or that sort of thing.
---
What level is your class freaks card? You may need to up it
---
I‚Äôm the player trying to give the lower level players the extra weapons I have after a west-Tec or uranium fever run and not one of the players I message will respond. Guess they don‚Äôt want easy capsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I really like this game and despite the scummy business practices Bethesda support has been good about refunding atoms for broken items like the communist bunker (at least for me). But seriously, don't give them more ideas. I'd rather believe stash space can't be increased for some imaginary reason than find out they've worked on a way to increase it and decided to charge for it.
---
I went from having 20 screws and always needing them to having 700 of them.
---
Instead of a damage nerf I want a challenge. I want an event like radiation rumble except with deathclaws that have cool mutations and stuff lol. That would be sickkkk
---
I just killed a guy at Lakeside Cabins.  He was just hanging out there carrying 4-5 bulk of almost every type.  I was definitely not sad when I hauled that back to my camp.
---
I am stuck on this as well
---
What's worse are all the people begging them to stay. Who cares.
---
Just put back "I've got 1 k?" When they come to collect give them 1 piece of something. If they ask for 50 cal give them 1 10 mm bullet and when they ask for the actual thing just say "I didnt specify what you would get" done it a few times most of the time they get mad.
---
