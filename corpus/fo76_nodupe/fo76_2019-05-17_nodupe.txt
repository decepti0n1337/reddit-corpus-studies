Aw no worries I accepted the karma for coming to reddit for caps lol, i got too much junk anyways could use the stash space from a few repairs
---
---
---
I checked a bag today at the purveyor, saw it was an assassins Tesla. Game crashed before I could snatch it. I’m sure it wasn’t great but it was better than spoiled meat!
---
All rifleman maxed, bloody mess maxed, demolition expert maxed, ballistic bock, psychobuff, and small guns bobblehead.
---
Thanks
---
This isnt great though lol will go back in the legendary grinder tomorrow. I'll get 40 points back for it at least.
---
6 to 10 legendary enemies to spawn at White Springs and a run? During a nuke or during a non nuke run? If you're claiming it's during a new, then I believe you. If you're claiming it's during an on nuke run, can I call bullshit. I am level 97 currently, and I do the whitespring run a few times a day. Outside of when there is a nuke, there have never been 10 legendaries in a single run. Getting six would be outstanding.
---
Lol I definitely understand needing the space
---
If you have a spare green outfit by any chance, I just found a spare blue one today if ya still want it. ♡
---
On my way!
---
Definitely buy. I’m first to admit that it’s not a perfect game but damn it’s fun. The amount of hours I put in just exploring the map and finding and collecting weapons and armor, it really is a blast.
---
If you are begging to be convinced then you already want to play and therefore are already convinced.
---
Damn that sucks. These badges are way harder to get then I expected. What's up with people crafting Smores for something? Is that related? I keep seeing it mentioned but not a reason why yet.
---
Is there like a list or page or something that has this info already? If so I'd love to see these stats lol
---
50,000 rounds of .45 ammo I just kept on walking
---
That's a lot of effort just to be a douchebag.  You also locked out the silo for the next couple hours for legit launches, which is even more shitty.  The 76 version of "MOMMY BUY ME THAT TOY/TOO EXPENSIVE SON/WHAAAAA!"
---
I was half expecting somebody to nuke the place today.
---
We saw a diving suit and a bear gauntlet in the wild Appalachia update trailer. I would guess we get those two.
---
Why does my game crash every time I enter Belching Belly
---
While it’s not the same as Fallout 4, a lot of the mechanics and ambiance are the same or similar. So from what you said, I’d be weary if I were you. Good news is, it’s typically around $10 for a console version. So not too big an investment.
---
The only BE weapon I didn't see duped this time was the gatlin gun, unfortunately the cryolator I picked up 2 days before the patch was the first duped weapon I saw :(
---
Pretty similar for AAE I expect
---
Lots of unyielding cav armor combat &amp; marine
---
Yes bethesda dont mess it up its perfect !!!!!!
---
Yes
---
[removed]
---
Sounds good to me. What's your tag?
---
You need people to play with. It makes it infinitely more fun and easier to play. Otherwise I can’t really vouch for the story but the game is a good place right now otherwise
---
I can get on in a couple minutes if that's good
---
To be honest I’m not sure, all my toons are lvl100 and up.
---
Welp.... shit
---
How many did it cost?
---
Personally, I wouldn't mind having a hard time getting a hold of end-game loot if it was actually worth my time.
---
"Why do you care? Did you go hungry? Did you lose your job? Did someone close to you die? Did it exile you to an unknown land? Only thing that suffered was your ego. I predict that you will have more postings downvoted to oblivion, until you get that ego in check. "  
---

---
Yikes. I question it because upvoted posts tend to get direct responses from Bethesda that is all. But yes feel to assume that I have a huge ego or something lmao.
---
I don’t play anymore and saw this gun like “this is what their legendary guns look like wtf??” Until I realized you’re actually supposed to mod them and make them look cool yourself lol
---
Aye. I stopped and stared in disbelief for a few moments.
---
That SMG would sell. It’s pretty cool for a SMG build
---
As far as I can tell, if you already got the backpack then I think it awards you just possum badges and from what I've read on here people are saying it's a 50% chance to get a badge from the dailies. There really isn't much to buy from the tadpole vending machine and once all the challenges are fixed, you can buy all the plans easily.
---
Sorry, PC.
---
Sounds good to me just hit me up on Xbox
---
You should sell that for a few thousand caps and put it toward a BE Hunting Rifle. Might as well keep getting better gear!
---
No idea, I commonly think it's only 7pm when it's actually 3am in game. Way too bright even after manually adjusting brightness.
---
Question on the upgrades: Doesn’t upgrading weapons or armor delete the legendary status? This happened to me with a anti armor handmade. I upgraded the receiver and afterwards the legendary status was lost. It still have the name in yellow, just no stars or stats. Was what happened to me just a possible glitch?
---
Wow lol. I can just exchange and get one item to test I guess.
---
Just take what I posted with a grain of salt. That is only my anecdotal observations over the past three to four days. It may have just been coincidence that the servers came down when they did. I, however, tend to err on the side of Bethesda being more restrictive rather than less restrictive when it comes to things like this. On the other hand, I was wrong about the legendary vendor today. I thought Bethesda that would limit us to one selection from the legendary vendor per day. I was glad to see that we were given the opportunity to sell off all 1,000 scrip, for those of us that had it, to try and obtain out of the armor or weapon that we desired.

---
I think travel leather coat is another. Suddenly it's been sold on the market everyday.
---
&gt; That's right. Well done, the bears are OP, is that the first one you tangled with? They surprise a lot of people. ;) 
---
No just seems like they became more OP recently. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; If you don't have all the AP for Rifles you can get, you are not playing  the game well. You can't expect to dominate the game without doing your  homework. 
---
Dominate isn't what I'm looking for it is simply being able to kill without being wiped out quickly.  The high need for AP in the game really seems like a balance issue with some mobs. 
---
&gt; The fact that you are upset is a bit disturbing. 
---
I'm not upset what I am is confused why they have made such a strong push towards needing AP to even take on a non boss non legendary mob. And why they give said mob so much AP ability themselves that they are able to easily bypass the PA defense as if you are naked.
---
Let it play jeepers creepers
---
Everything good
---
Strange, when I completed the quest it let's me drop the camera...
---
Thanks, I had no idea that it was an already "known" or "reported" bug
---
Explosive rounds, in a gun designed to have short range to maximize damage. I get that there are perks for that, but no build should need a perk to make it less suicidal.
---
How many players hit up the Purveyour today?
---
How many sales were made? 
---
How many will be made in the future?
---
I bet your gear is out there and just became significantly less rare. Which is the point of the Purveyor she's flooding the market with good gear. The odds are outrageously stacked against one player getting the exact drop they want but not outragous against the community as a whole getting this gear.
---
Deals can be made. Player vending visited. Someone has that gear it may not be you but a lot of people just got what you want today.
---
All you have to do is find it. They keep pushing they play together theme this is part of it if we play and trade together we can get what we want.
---
Yes visiting player vendors and trading in general takes work and time but it can be done. I'm also betting you'll eventually or maybe already did get some great gear someone else is looking for.
---
Are you just running the clubhouse?  That's good for 3-6 alone, guest houses and maintenance area tend to add another 2-4. I'm level 185 and run it almost daily.
---
Right, but the lack mystery pick doesn't stop you using it for that. 
---
It wasn't that much cheaper.
---
I think it may depend where you are at with your build. Im probably going to go 2 star to upgrade my one star furious handmade if possible. But if I already had a decent 2 star I’d try for three star
---
The challenge called backpacker has you eating 3 s’mores. If you’re on Xbox and need the recipe I can give you one.
---
 I saw someone claimed 1500 pieces of Marine armor to learn them all so hang in there.
---
Im lvl 20 and got a 2 star lvl50 and a 3 star lvl 50. Cant use either. Sucks. For now its only for the max lvl.
---
I once found a bag full of all the good stuff in large quantities because a player was doing inventory management in public and they must've crashed. I waited for them to return, because I'm too dumb to steal.
---
yep
---
he's still changing rn.
---
If you're geared up, it can actually turn a lackluster event into something entertaining.  I just feel bad for the lvl 40 guy that just ran into the event and immediately got smoked by a 12 pack of lvl 40 glowing miners.  I tend to stand on top of their bag if it happens, so lvl 300 xFingerBlaster2006x with his horny old man sheepsquatch outfit and deathclaw gauntlet doesn't steal all their hard earned black titanium and aluminum what he's certainly got the resources to get plenty with minimal effort.
---
Here with you now gotta say thanks, the things his says crack me TF up 😂😂
---
VAULT WALLS!  
---
For the love of the Overseer - my character resents being forced out of the Vault and just wants to rebuild his home above ground. VAULT WALLS! Make it happen!
---
I ran out of space and people weren't buying cheap missiles from my vendor, so I left a bag of something like 193 of them at the Vault 76 entrance lol.  Someone was probably happy until it overflowed their storage.
---
I need kindness too though. We gotta be allies
---
Agree.  I was debating 2 or 3 star.  I mean the best effects are the first 2 and the 3rd is just a little bonus.  Not worth double the price imo.  Even with melee +1 strength doesn't amount to much more damage.  And what are the chance you get exactly what you want on all 3 stars.  1 in 1000.  I think I will be buying 2 star when I get home
---
I guess my thoughts there are that a shotgunner does it better and does more dps. IDK. Rifles are for pvp / non boss content IMO.
---
Hahaha no no wood please
---
What do you mean?
---
Same. My first purchase was an explosive mutant slayer’s LMG. Perfect for West-Tek farming.
---
Yes I have. Psn is murdomcsalt if you want to swap? :)
---
Some people are freakin' vultures. I protected a teammate's bag one time during a SBQ fight, and four people were crowded around me trying to get at the bag. They were yelling at me to move over local chat, and I wasn't budging. But somebody they pushed me to the side, and managed to steal the bag.
---
The behavior of some other players is disgusting.
---
I had a good one in my vending machine and nobody took it. I honestly assumed nobody really liked them. My bad, y'all. I'm a shotgunner so its not satisfying enough for me.
---
Yes unless you have starched genes perk equipped.
---
Explosive energy weapons, old man winter mask I’d love to know what they gave that guy to dupe his mask, be combat rifle, aae double vats handmade, aae handmade, ve handmade. Those are the main ones I’ve saw a sudden influx of over the last week.
---
Get the perk card Starched Genes and rank it up to 2. Youre then free to use rad away as much as you like.
---
Wait so if I don't have that, then i wasted 500 caps?
---
No. The entire circuit. As people like to say on here, I'll believe it when I see it. Post a video, when I see it, then I'll believe that you consistently get between 6 and 10 legendaries
---
I just found Anne at the Palace of the Winding Path. I figured a good strat was to hit the Palace, the Cemetary, and the Colonel Kelly monument and then server hop. They're all within 1-2 caps of each other.
---
PSA! She's at the parking lot/overlook ABOVE the palace. When you spawn in, it's the cliff edge above and to your left.
---

---
I only have a penetrating mag in, for better damage...imagine how long this thing would run with a extended clip.
---
We need to be on a team to get the kindness part of the tadpole missions done. Swimmer you don’t need to but I want to get both done at once.
---
What is now like 10 bucks?  It's worth a massively discounted price.
---
We were promised Private Servers, but not until at least Nov. 
---
Personally, I can't wait.  I know there are several modders itching to go wild with the game.  And, frankly, the lack of RP options on the Official servers is rather disappointing...  
---
To explain:
---
Our, the Vault 76ers, mission is to rebuild the world...  Yet, we don't have that option...  We are actively prevented from doing so.  You have no ability to, for example, take over one of the existing structures and fix it.  Surely it would be what a normal person would do.  
---
You are forced to launch a Nuke...  Even though it is 100% against your mission. 
---
Things like that...
---
Off topic but if you add a &gt; before a quoted paragraph of text it'll put the blue "quoted" line next to it. Makes it much easier to tell your quoting somebody
---
Thanks for bringing that up, it was my follow up question. Pretty much anything is fun with friends, but I want to know if this is a game I can solo with ocasional co-op adventures. I love RPG’s that I can solo &amp; have fun with, my background being games like the Soulsborne titles.
---
No thanks.
---
definitely lol
---
If you want it it's all yours
---
Yes. You need 2 levels of starched genes and they dont show up til lvl 30.
---
Just buy the serum (marsupial is awesome) wait until you level up twice to receive starched genes rank two and you’ll never have to worry about losing it! Just don’t ever take the perk off
---
I don't mind having to use the camera for multiple challenges every day since I always have it on my character. Its the ridiculous conditions for most of the pictures that's the real problem.
---
Ohhh dam I didn't know about that part I can't help with that part because of the ban I'm sorry. Do you still want me to join for the other parts?
---
(my name is og.schweeser)
---
Oh alright, thats fine.
---
Wow I actually forgot certain perks don’t show up until a specific level lol. Too many hours
---
Pay to win is with real money though?
---
Daily quest, now to to vault tech university, put it in a computer, and get some stimpacks
---
The game should've been ready at launch, like 99% of all other games. They don't get credit for fixing what shouldn't have been broken to begin with.
---
The cheapest I’ve seen for a brand new version is $25 @ Walmart. Not sure where everyone is seeing $10 but if you could point me in that direction I’d be convinced lol
---
It's part of a daily quest I think. I got the quest earlier.
---
Yes its an old quest but since last patch its always a daily quest. For me anyway.
---
Sorry but Naw I prefer to get both done. Kindness needs to be completed, there’s no alternative.
---
Okay cool, just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something
---
How neccessary is the 3rd star to you? As you have pointed out, if it's the two first stars that push up the worth then I'd most likely stick with getting multiple 2 star purchases, and once we know about the 65 scrip 3* purveyors choice, maybe the occasional one or two of those for shits and giggles.
---
That’s why guys over 30 have a hard time making  new friends. You figured out that 90% of other dudes are rotten at the core and keep acquaintances at arms length until that prove to be truly rad.
---
what does making new characters have to do with pay to win? you dont need to pay anything for a new character, or anything else involved in this
---
We're already friends if ya wanna join my game. I'll pop over to my base and grab it for ya.
---
Alright I understand
---
I don't see why not?
---
Look man, the SBQ shops at Murmrgherd's.  The SBQ's loot just lost some stars when she logged off.
---
Heart of the Enemy
---
Nothing like that 4 me, half decent stuff, but nothing that surpasses current equipmebt tho. Already have an Exploding .50 cal mg and Rapid Furious Gatling,  so kinda hard to top those for my style.
---
I hope so. I live for the day when i can introduce my tommy gun to that scummy overseer.
---
Having an animal/robot companion would be fun. 
---
Could do emotes with them. The don't attack for PVP. could be customized like backpack. Like brahim has extra carry weight, dog could have revive ability (licking face lol)
---
I heard it was easy, but I didn’t know it was that easy.
---
[deleted]
---
Because it's been a while since the game released and we still have no confirmation.
---
If they weighed less I would.  .5 lbs gobbles up stash space fast...
---
I have the recipe, was just wondering why I kept seeing it mentioned, thought maybe there was somewhere I could trade them for badges or something. Thanks for the explanation and offer though, very kind of you.
---
Log1122
---
I don't think you understand what pay to win means....
---
If you Google some people had this mission half way pop up back around launch it had you going around to collect votes to become president was a different way to enter enclave other than killing the legendaries but you couldn't ever collect them cause it hadn't triggered that part
---
Are you PC? I have a Furious FSS buzz I would be willing to sell/trade.
---
Purchasing another account gives you access to more characters.
---
I sell plans, mutations and under armor mostly. I’ll throw the occasional magazine or other aid items and bulk junk in there.
---
You play on PC?  A good traveling buddy is always nice to have around.
---
Depends on what system.  It will be more expensive for a new copy.  Microsoft has a new copy for 19.99.  You can get a used copy for under 10 on ebay.
---
I’m on Xbox
---
Maybe you shouldn't farm a boss for legendaries three times in a few hours?
---
Bethesda should further nerf farming. It's a degenerate way to interact with a video game.
---
I havnt played since the vendor update.
---
can we sell ammo now or no?
---
You get checkpointed only at certain steps.
---
But thx
---
If I purchase another account, I have access to more characters than you, which means I get more scrip than you, which means I get more legendaries than you.
---
I'm getting the same exact thing. It's annoying because it's one of the only achievements I have left but i cant complete it. Hopefully when they release the Arktos Pharma event they'll fix it
---
We've got a mole miner vendor so I can see a human eventually but I feel they'll make sure it's someone with a good questline attached.
---
Name the damn thing, bro! That's the best part! 
---
AND MAKE IT A GOOD ONE.
---
Yeah, that would be the one thing I forgot to say lol, or just another bug?
---
Murder is allowed in this world.
---
I only have two characters which are both usable. One is my Survival character which is strictly a stealth commando and the other is my main character which is a unarmed melee/commando build. I don’t run mules. Too much effort haha.
---
That sucks
---
Getting on right now actually.
---
Ya
---
Yes it was, especially when you factor in the return on items you don't want.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmmqlj/mama_murmrghs_mystery_pick_always_the_best_pick/
---
r/theydidthemath and Bethesda saw it.
---
But youd have to farm legendary items and that be easier on your main than a new acct not worth the effort. The days of finding 15 legendarys in a bag are over.
---
It happens when you get in and out of Power Armor. Switch weapons real quick and it works again. Exists since Fallout 4 and is one of the most annoying bugs in the game and still not fixed.
---
I would pay to get the atoms to buy the dude's outfit if they put it in the atom shop.
---
Yeah it’s doable alone for sure, in fact for some things you really wanna be alone, like building your camp, but if your friends know cool items they call always throw them in. When your ammo farming, probably gonna wanna be alone. Server hoping for stuff, probably alone. Quests, events, bullshitting around, co op time.
---
Not really, since you still have to do the work to get the legendaries themselves to turn in for scrip. What you're saying only works if each "account" got some free scrip every day/week or whatever, like a login bonus. That's not the case here.
---
I really don’t get why roaches would be aggressive by nature. Even huge, they’re scavengers, not predators. 
---
At least they can’t fly anymore.
---
I'm down for joining, i'm a level 22. Sending a PM

Ok cool ty
---
To give you more in depth answer this game is for people who like fallout games and mmo hybrids.  There is a lot to do.  Lots of quests, events and new modes to come in the near future.  There really isn't much to do endgame but that may change in the future.  
---
I know you don't want the buy it and find out answer but that's what you need to do.  No one knows what you like and if you will like this game.  I enjoy the game despite all the negativity.  I think it's fun.  But that doesnt mean you will feel the same.
---
Same here
---
Mostly garbage, but got:  
---
Vampire's 50 Cal Machine Gun, +33 VATS hit chance and reduced weight (1.8 lbs unmodified)
---
Anti armor Power Fist, reflects 50% damage back while blocking, 15% reduced damage when blocking
---
Honestly don't do me much good, but are they of interest to other people?
---
Haha we already have White Russians to complete the set! Lol
---
 Where is it? No don't tell him. ;) I could not find the centrifuge, got disconnected and my DNA was gone. ;(
---
This is in the 3rd wave of DLC after nuclear winter
---
I was playing with my mate but he was still at the step that we was on before we went off.

You became president to get the special xo1 power armor suit... I was in there in beta. Said nothing about the enclave, I think that's just an assumption. It also says in the area that it is not completed yet so I expect it will be used in the future
---
Yeah, but I also want to know: category of weapon or type of armor - "Unarmed Melee", "Rifle", "Energy Weapon", "Heavy Weapon", "Grenade or Missle or Mini Nuke" - perhaps something semi-vague, but you know if it can be worked into your build, at least.  Like my build is so not-shotgun focused I wouldn't even try a shotgun without changing 3/4 of my strength perks (with ones I don't have yet) and moving a few S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points.  
---
The BIGGEST flaw in this game: you have to follow a few very specific formulas for your build or else you're not even 1/4 as good - that's really really terrible/disappointing - people should be able to make the character \*the way they want to make it\* and still end up with a competitive one that isn't just obliterated by some min-max tweaker who can sit there and ignore your attack, then turn around and kill you in 1/2 second...
---
What? I literally just dump them on the ground and pick them up with my alt. I've been doing it for months.
---
Uh...  
---
If you wanna die for me so I can get the "revive an ally" achievement I'll be on. OMA_Rambo is my psn. Add me I'll be playing for.the next hour or so.
---
Oh, you can solo the whole story, it just opens up once you start doing events that actually promotes working together, the recent Faschnat parade, where everyone played as minders/security for a robot parade as they walked around a settlement, was fun most of the time, with people swapping items after the event finished. You don't NEED friends around, but the occasional random team up shows the possibility of what teamwork can pull off.
---
A medic's fatman is the new meta then is it?
---
I'm always giving out stuff like stimpacks, water, ammo - I love it when a new(er) player gets all excited and tells his budy: ***"This dude just gave me 1,000 ammo, holy shit!"***. 
---
Or the other day, I traded my 3 star TSE Handmade to a guy for 20 Nuka Colas because I thought he might use it more than me, since I just switched my build away from Explosive Ballistic weapon use, because it was Nerfed too hard in recent updates and it was either change or give up, for me - I simply could not play ***the way I wanted to play*** so I had to Respec/Rebuild my character in a major way.
---
thanks
---
The thing I dislike is that it seems like with every major update, Bethesda is going to swap out the challenges to fit whatever theme of the latest update.  Instead, they should be adding new challenges to a pool of random challenges like we've been used to, rather than making these themed challenges the dominant frequency every day.
---
With the current direction, it'll almost never be non-themed challenges, because Bethesda seems to now always be in the process of releasing new content.
---
Thought that was just me.
---
I sell all my plans for 30 caps and recipes for 15 caps and they sell like crazy :)
---
For 500 caps I’d say any 3* is a steal given you can get 40 scrip for it if you don’t want to actually use it or resell it at a higher price.
---
Need that myself. Just sent it.
---
Even a regular shotgun build is super effective. Cripple your enemies, then pick them off at your leisure. I live in dread of the day they nerf it.
---
Not all missions can be solved with chess, Deep Blue.
---
P.S. Awesome Job.
---
I go through a cycle with the radio. I hear one of the good songs on a radio in the world some where so I turn mine on to hear it better. I leave it on until they over play one or more of the crap songs too many times and I shut it off.
---
3k shotgun shells, 1k .50 cal ammo, 10k 5mm ammo a few weeks back. Thank you random stranger.
---
Yupp mine is borked also.. I really don't want to move my camp just to get it unstuck.
---
Not gonna lie, I thought I was just having rotten luck. :(  Hopefully that's all it is. I get to drop my first nuke soon and I'd really like to use it as an opportunity to grab some legendaries.
---
100% of items I got I plan to scrap because they didn't have anything useful for the item it was on. Like reg raider right armor with a weightless and reduced chem weight effect. Most people don't keep items to sell because they would rather get scrip back instead since selling an item is stash space and no garuntee to sell. Your point of the mass amount of people rolling each purchase is right and wrong. Assuming a few dozen ideal items are obtained each week after buying, that means the players will either keep it (most likely) or try to sell it. I have to then hope that I'm on the right server at the time they are playing and throw away alot of my caps fast travelling just to see if they have it, assuming nobody already bought it. I'm not saying it's not better than it WAS, I'm saying this item mod idea will make it the BEST option. You can still sell it and it'll make it so that more than a dozen of players across the world get good gear. This gane is supposed to eventually have challenging raids and such I assume so getting the best gear will be needed eventually. Perhaps even make a reward for raids and such as tokens for such mod items.
---
Why would you buy a second copy when you can have more than one character?
---
You should do the quest as well. I didn't do it and crashed out. Anytime I see a scorched beast I have that option instead of searching for extra meat. It's been 2 months since I filed the bug report.
---
The odds of getting 2 stars that are good are better with a 3 star than they are with a 2 star.
---
KEK - I wish I could get free scratch tickets for turning in old ones!
---
I buy about 2 - 3 scratch tickets per year (some years I buy none).
---
&gt;  It stings a bit now walking out of the brand new legendary shop with empty pockets and a bunch of bad guns, but as a feature I’d say this was really good for the game. Now crap legendaries matter, even if it’s only a little. 
---
***Exactly***
---
they should make it so he wont change until you talk to him wearing the possum uniform.
---
I've been spending my time collecting badges. Thank goodness they gave us something else to do.
---
Ive been thinking this since i started actually making buildings in my camp. I didnt really build anything in fallout 4 because i mostly just wanted yo kill thi gs but i find most of my game hours on 76 is rebuilding/refining my camp. Always trying to go for a shantytown type place.
---
I would love to join you. Gamertag AweSomeNESSLOL1
---
How do you get scrip?
---
By turning in legendaries.
---
How do you get legendaries?
---
By playing the game.
---
Therefore, whether you have 1 account or 10, you still have to spend the time getting the legendaries.
---
Assuming you farm roughly the same amount of legendaries/hour in either situation, both players end up with roughly the same number of legendaries, therefore the same amount of scrip. Yes the 1 character player will have to wait longer to get their scrip due to the daily limit, but that doesn't mean they lose scrip or somehow aquire less.
---
 You're not alone. I was searching VTU for some code or something so I could analyze the scorchbeast DNA.
---
holly crap.. that's awesome..
---
How much did that cost?
---
BIV giving me the White Russian recipe is what made me want the outfit.
---
I'm on tried to add you. Jayross66
---
I always liked building themed stuff. I liked to try and make cozy and shoddy looking places haha. It’s a lot of fun to build.
---
I dont bother repairing the power plant if I want fusion cores. I just build a fusion generator, much faster.
---
🤷 I see people report bugs on here all the time. may it's how you said it and not what you said it ?
---
Yeah, at least some of those would be nice. I’d like some more random pieces like the aforementioned train cars and buses.
---
Joining now
---
I just want a robot station for my camp where I can build a robot army too defend my camp that actually defend it. Unlike my damn turrets...
---
Super cool. Fits the wasteland for sure :)
---
Still broken. AAAARRRRGH!
---
Yeah, that mod rocks. I wish we could build more stuff like this. It just feels super wastelander to me.
---
Yeah, and I wish we could build more like it in 76. It’s my favorite.
---
Couldn't stop laughing at bladed sugar bomb lol.
---
I want my bladed protection pp
---
up vote because asshat is my favorite insult.
---
Counting bags from someone I killed? 
---
So, storytime. I was running around RPing as Rick Grimes asking people if they've "seen Caaarl." I ran up to this one dude (the character was male so I'm assuming) and he just walked off. So, I say screw it and since I was near Slocum's, I decide to gather some firecaps and make disease cures. 
---
There were some scorched in the stream so I shoot them and kill them. 
---
I hear movement behind me and VATS onto whatever it is and shoot. 
---
It was the guy. I apologise over the mic but he kills me anyway. I look off to the side like I'm on video (I wasn't I'm just weird like that) and say, "The fuck? Ok..."
---
I seek revenge and go at him. He didn't try to fight back. 
---
I look in his bag and take everything. I went from like 250 to like 750 weight. Dude had so much junk on him. 
---
I gasped. I debated whether it was probably duped. We're talking thousands of aluminum, hundreds of adhesive, etc, but it could've just been a mule. 
---
I decided to put his stuff to good use. I repaired everything, made a new set of excavator, and finished a new set of X-01. 
---
I decided to be nice. I joined his game and ran up to him. I dropped most of it back in front of him. Only kept some screws and adhesive. They didn't take it. I still left it there.
---
I often wonder if that just got lost to the ether.
---
Bladed Grahm would be nice
---
I got some. Nothing to brag about but it sounds like you just had bad rng
---
Also got my first tse from the purveyor. I'm level 170. Thanks miss purveyor.
---
The build up to today and cashing in all those legendaries to save up turned out to be more exciting.  Felt like being told we were going to the zoo and it turns out to just be somebodies back lot with two goats, a pig, and a goose.  Back to the grinding board.
---
Oh boy, yep I'm dumb. Figured out my problem!
---
Well, I do now! I had it all wrong
---
What perks do you have? I have a TSE rifle and it doesn't come close to 500 damage.
---
This rail hopper needs to be chugga chugga chewed out
---
That would be super.
---
It’s the sexy little “thwok” noise. And also you can use the arrows as steps on walls.
---
Yep, just realized what I was doing wrong....I was saving my point (not leveling up)....So I wasnt getting the level awarded perks. Derp.
---
I’m not jelly because you just won the game. Now it’s time to quit. And right when all this fun new content is dropping. Sorry about your luck.
---
Knowing the daily might give you one makes it more worth it. I just want the refrigeration mod but each one of those world challenges would take me atleast a week to do since I work 6 days a week. Doing the dailys every day won't take too much time to get there though as long as it's not glitching out constantly like the first time I did them.
---
Eh, I’ve mostly got the legendaries I like well enough already, I’d rather get the caps for selling one stars than the low amount of scrip they give me. I’m perpetually low on caps cause I keep saving them up only to blow them on a plan or item I want
---
You have inspired me to rebuild my basic ass camp lol tomorrow gonna try something like yours! Great job again!
---
That would have made me happy. Instead I got this crap gun (Troubleshooters gauss rifle).
---
in person? i hope not. i kinda like the idea of the only humans being other players.
---
over a radio or something? sure. Appalachia may be completely dead but we know not everywhere is.
---
Clear the room.  Bring a bloatfly syringer and one of the nearby scorched.  Inject, kill, and Escape Artist.
---
Anyone want an anti armor flame with +50% damage in cats and + 1 perception? Xbox
---
Doing this for all events would be great. I can’t stand it when I miss the messenger events.
---
It's not, though.  Those *also* pass through WV.
---
This debate has happened a trillion times before today.
---
The mission popped up for then during the become part of the enclave though
---
The railway is almost 100%, the harpoon gun is too. If you put flechettes in it you’re guaranteed 2-5 per shot lol. Then the crossbow seems to have the lowest chance
---
I have one as a pet his name is steve
---
I was on a server yesterday for about six hours with friends popping in and out over that time period and there were three stars everywhere. NAR trainyard, Appalachia Antiques, West Tek, Robco etc. I'd make the rounds and start the loop again with the same results.  In a single run from the golf club to the other end of the resort there were 6 three stars. I waited for a couple buddies to hop on and we launched on whitesprings figuring that might up the three star bounties even more, but it turned into a total 1 star dud fest, it was so disappointing.
---
Traveling between spots in the map on foot in higher level areas nets me a lot of legendaries. But yeah, at level 35 you should keep an eye out for horde and uranium fever events and start your white springs farm
---
Yeah well I don't normally go looking for the flux at the Prime site. But since we got screwed on the SBQ I thought I could at least get something out of it. Sadly I was mistaken.
---
I am at the rusty pick. It's not working nor is the snare drum
---
The loot sucks and the sheepsquatch always spawns as a 1*
---
Alright, just wanted check. I've received just about everything except wood and leather. Thanks
---
i'd also love to be able to sell items at a loss, if the damn machine only has 30 scrip but I have a crappy 3 star worth 40 five me the option of taking the 30.
---
I got backpacker without issues.
---
Oh that's a riot! What fun! Maybe I just need to take them all!
---
I remember how disappointed I was after I saved up for the wind instruments plan and found out it was just one.
---
I have that camera too! And I actually use it!
---
Saved up 700 script and went for all 3 star, a sickle a lead pipe a Bowie knife and a meat hook. Ranged weapon got a 3 star .44 handgun. Then I get a one piece of armor. Unreal
---
Think it's happening to everybody. It's not an issue if you've done the quest before as you'll have the terminal password etc. It's supposed to start at Fort Defiance, the first time around, from reading a terminal on the top floor.
---
I got one piece of leather from everything I rolled today .
---
Sneak attack criticals. Chain them up with a handmade or combat rifle or something similar. Absolutely do not let them get into melee range. Outside of power armor, their melee swipes (other than being super strong) will come close to stunlocking you. If there are multiple kings, they might actually stunlock you. They deal less damage with their sonic beams than with melee, but are still dangerous nonetheless.
---
Legendary ones apply a really strong poison/bleed on you every time they hit you, even with the sonic beams. Be very careful with your health
---
Also, diseased ones will inflict rattle hands on you. This decreases your damage with ranged weapons by I think 25%. Absolutely prioritize getting rid of them first, preferably with sneak attacks before they can hit you
---
I got the same but bolt action, sad days.
---
It makes sense with the crossbow at least, since arrows do get dull and break.
---
I have a two shot crossbow, and unfortunately, it doesnt seem to help like I hoped it would.
---
Something like this would fit in perfectly, but camp blasters would simply finish leveling the joint. And we all just got past that hurdle.
---
Nice story!
---
https://xboxclips.com/TANAAS/screenshots/b053321f-297a-45ba-ac8d-b6649fb66b7f
---
You think I’m going to change my whole build? Lol?
---
I put a burnt magazine in for 999 just to see if it sells. Ive sold a lot of recipes and plans but alas the burnt magazine has yet to sell.
---
YES.
---
Dude, everything is downhill from there! That’s an amazing weapon, I have it without the strength and love it.
---
What do you play on?
---
Is he heavy? 😜
---
Uh, why not? Are you short on caps or something?
---
Thanks, too bad I dont have a bloodied build. That would be perfect.
---
That would be so nice.
---
Smoking a cig real quick then I'll see about joing, lvl 79 here
---
Oh no. I meant what’s the recommend level? I’m currently level 15 and would like to give it a shot sooner rather than later.
---
Which sane human being would invest in another account? You can get already 5 characters on each. Imagine grinding 3* on 10 characters...
---
Lmfao earlier I had like 5 scraps left, go to scrap some shit 1 star.. 9 scrips well now I gotta wait until tomorrow cause I can’t just lose the 4 &amp; take my 5 home😂
---
Eh, if that's the case then I'll pass. Good with salt is my baby.
---
Not disagreeing just curious why you feel that way
---
I have 400ish through my hobolike dedication to rummaging through random rubbish bins...
---
Definitely my favorite part about 76 even though the building stuff is a bit limited
---
I have posted a bug on this forum before. And gotten the response of "You are full of shit." "That never happened." "Don't believe you."  
---
There seem to be a lot of fanboys who don't like anyone bagging FO76 at all.
---
[I have something similar here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm8k6q/i_made_an_interactive_checklist_for_all_pioneer/), and it's entirely digital. I'm not sure how well editing works on a phone, but you can try it!
---
My dream.
---
No I have plenty of caps and sold plenty of BE rifles. Not a fan of the playstyle.
---
I know man, what I’m saying is the people who come here posting and showing off their “first purchase” godrolls. No one is buying that bullshit. 
---
I personally love the purveyor, gives you an added incentive to keep playing, gather some junk legendaries for a chance to roll some better ones. 
---
I still have like 500 weight trash legendaries in my box waiting to be scripped.
---
Simple odds. If you are pulling cards from a deck, and want to get 2 good cards, are your chances better pulling only 2 cards or pulling 3 cards?
---
wait what? did they not remove the TSE combo? or did i miss something here?
---
I dropped five 3* wood pieces. Fun day. It would be nice to have those scrip back
---
What effects were on the shovel?
---
Cant beat my 3* assassins, swing speed , blocking rolling pin. With spikes.
---
I wish it was you brought a regular non legendary in and she would enchant it.  But I’d guess you would need the plans for every weapon avalible in game, which wouldn’t be bad either
---
Saying that Arthur Maxson (the best elder) is corrupt is not a great way to get people to join.
---
I Think they should remove the scrip Per Day.. it doesn’t really serve a purpose, other than time gate the gambling. You still have to farm the legendaries anyway
---
The post wasn't negative it's a reach out to the game devs to make QOL Improvments on the game.
---
Yeah, I was paying attention and bought some sweet level 35 legendaries today on an alt... not a good feeling, though thankfully none were great rolls anyway.
---
But the Mounted Owlet is the best one!
---
I dont use PA but dont your legendary armor effects still work with power armor on over top? Would legendary PA stacjed on legendary armor be super OP?
---
I think it 40-50
---
A - Yes, please. More Rose quests.   
---
B - More robotic NPCs like Rose, please.
---
C - Having a DJ'ed radio station would be awesome. New songs would be great too. Not I realize that's a lot of work, but for a effort-lite option....
---
D - Can we get a radio station that combines the standard musical station with her personal station... so just the standard songs, with her drug PSAs in between.  Since that's all in the game, the only thing added would be mixing her chatter with the existing music, and should be a low effort addition.
---
Would be nice to get an option like that, but to be able to set your own limit for how much below your price a person can go. Otherwise you'll end up getting spammed with 1 cap requests
---
Oh don't worry, when they add the next gimmick all the challenges will be related to that.
---
So three characters about 500 per and all crap
---
.308 is really common ammo isnt it? I sell all of mine at 1 cap and it still sits. Run a few forest quests and youll have a few hundred at least.
---
The Frogs only glow when they are happy, something tells me being trapped in a pickle jar is quite depressing for the poor lad.
---
That's just setting a price with extra steps.
---
There is a note on the fourth floor in fort defiance on a table with the password. Picked it up after going to v tec-u and it progressed the quest.
---
I'm down with some dailies being a bit annoying - but the balance has tipped too far, I'd agree.
---
The only way to repair them like other workshop items is with the repair all function which causes you to have to reprice everything. If you repair from the build menu (I mean the press and hold V menu.. well on PC at least) you shouldn't need to reprice anything. OP didn't particularly like that info, I asked him a couple times to add this info to his post and he just argued with me instead.
---
It's still annoyingly tedious, and there was no issue with just having it for a level up
---
The first thing I got was a 2 star bloodied mutant's lead pipe........so far i've gotten a lot of bad rolls. Lmao
---
It's also the token response you get for anything you complain about with proof.
---
I’m trying to do it on Xbox gt: chrischiba4life
---
It's scrip, not script.
---
Save it for the future
---
Sorry, I'm on pc. Thanks for the offer though!!
---
Enemies shooting you with a shotgun drops a pool cue
---
Silt bean or a new plant instead maybe....
---
Razorgrain oatmeal on the other hand.....
---
Yes gt is chrischiba4life
---
Pretty sure all youll be doing is pissing people off
---
Lol yeah
---
ive onlt done some messenger events, what do they give thats so great?
---
You call it alcoholism.
---
I call it liver crossfit.
---
Good idea. But then it would have to apply to all players that loot it 😔
---
Nocturnal so perfect for some late night grave robbing. No idea on the other 2 effects.
---
Really should remove wood from the loot pool. Leather and raider armour are low enough.
---
I'm rifle man maxed out and my lvl 50 hunting rifle does 149
---
Well yeah. That doesn't mean it has to be the exact same weapon just the same type.
---
 Heavy gunner here, and i run legendary armor for ammo reduction. I am the bullet farm. Tallied up a rough count last night, sitting on 25k+ in various rounds. Stabilized is nice, but that accuracy bonus isn't worth (imho) losing out on marathoner, constant slam interruptions from my marsupial jumps, and trading a max of 5 bonuses fron a limited pool for 15 randomized ones from my standard armor
---
ok mine is limitless Jake. I will join your world.
---
Excuse my ignorance, but what’s “instanced”?
---
:(
---
Eh. People are pissy no matter what
---
Soup Can Harry!
---
A quick rundown on what it takes to get things? I understand the script...
---
How bout im at watoga medical centre.... low health, no stimpacks running from a charred ghoul... sprint away back into the elevator and close the door. Barely made it! That was great. Celebrate for .5 seconds and the fucker runs through the closed door and one hits me :(
---
yo I killed like 25 deathclaws. not one deathclaw hide
---
Yeah I wasted 1100 on 3 star weapons, got maybe 2 sellable in vending machine and an anti armor vats damage magnum lol, regrets; probably coulda had more tries on 2 star.
---
I went 3 for maxium best rolls, but the cost and rng feel like future and anyone else should do 2 star for guns at least. I didn't see purveyors choice for sale though.
---
they don't drop royal jelly. Maybe they should, but they don't. there's only two world spawn locations for it, and they are server-dependant 24hr timers. It's a different level of stupid.
---
If anyone on Xbox1 knows the t-60 paladin paint I'm willing to pay in Cap's to have it put on my T-60
---
True. I guess it might help with these long lines everyones reporting lol
---
It’s like a Wile Coyote bit. Drop an anvil next time.
---
they don't drop from deathclaws. Also stupid, but they don't. rare in foot lockers and some tool chests.
---
Nothing good. They are always there and are annoying to complete.
---
Preach. Each time I've done this event I've failed because it's been me and one, maybe two other guys. Or at least have the amount of critters scale to the amount of people participating, like how Uranium Fever works.
---
RIP your lead scrap
---
what weapon class is the cryolator?
---
might have to give my quad+fire rate one a try
---
Boy am I happy you posted... you're after the wrong jelly 😶 There's 3 known locations. NW of Twin Pines Cabins on the road next to a blue car and a body with a bicycle. Middle Mountain Cabins, look behind the cabins for a grave and a picnic basket - jelly is in the basket. Very tipity top of Tanagra Town in the bath tub (highest point).
---
No, thats the opposite. I don't cry to anyone I run the nuke on my own for my own fun and oretty sure that makes it a "legit launch" as any others. Don't like my playstyle, too bad.
---
The problem is you aren't going see the good prefix bloody furious instigating executioner anti armor on the 3rd star, and explosive is always 2nd star, so that why if you want to be cost effective 2 star is better, like my handmade tse I bought is 2 star.
---
Bloodied at 75% HP is better than TS... You don't need a build for it. TS VATS is also completely useless and breaks way faster.
---
Even if you don't want Bloodied for some strange reason, AA and Furious are also better.
---
You need to sell legendary armor and weapons at the vending machine for scrip. The legendary purveyor is now at Berkeley springs train station where you can sell that scrip for a chance to get a lengendary weapon/armor piece. This was my first purchase.
---
It’s okay. I still can’t find my Easter egg.
---
Berkeley springs in the mire, railroad station just a little south on the outskirts of town where the railroad tracks end on the map
---
Too funny! And cool as hell!
---
Yeah im the same right now. I use 5 demo now but my 1* anti armor handmade also does real close. Ill take it kit for a spin tonight and see how close it is.
---
If it makes you feel any better I would if I could.
---
*She* is the nicest sweetest old grandma a mole miner ever had, and she’s at the Berkeley springs railroad station just south of the town
---
idk what's with the downvotes, but bug reports should be sent through the official channels, takes a minute of googling and you can send it directly to the devs. Alternatively use the official forums for it. Makes no sense to do it here unless it gets to the front page.
---
Yeah, I know...
---
I don’t see you on my server, but I’m daphne9674 if you see me. That’s the remaining task I need to complete.
---
Well, don’t forget that’s Fallout 4. I don’t want you to get confused with what’s in 76.
---
At least you could still get to the vending machine. I went to a camp today where the vending machines were all inside a locked building.
---
It’s a random chance at any chosen category of item?   ..all hell im just pooping and I’m  impatient, I’ll be on in a min.
---
My handle is MoppinUpScrubs, btw.
---
Buy the "bladed", yes just plain "bladed" mod, and put him on your tinker's bench.  *** Legendary Grahm now applied bleeding damage.  Blade out your camera while you're at it.  Nothing says auteur like a rusty kitchen knife sticking out of your lens.  "Bladed lens mod".  "Bladed backpack mod".  Blades for everyone!
---
I killed one earlier today and it had 3 royal jelly on it.  Logged off for work 3 minutes later and when I relogged they were missing.
---
Agreed, and at least some indication of how much space items for sale take up.
---
Yeah, there are a bunch of interesting objects you find in the world which would be nice to be able to build in our camps
---
The Sheepsquatch mascot outfit or the impostor Sheepsquatch hat? I've only seen one person selling the hat but I've seen a couple people selling the mascot outfits for like 500 caps and the matching head for like 200 to 300. I think I actually paid 100 for mine.
---
I have a spare. Do u by chance have a spare imposter mask? If so maybe we can figure something out. Yes I'm on xb
---
can u start it or does it just randomly spawn on the map
---
Got a combat sentinel and cavalier piece with weight reduction for ammo
---
Oh good to know thanks
---
MORE👏RAIDER👏CONTENT👏
---
Wait for the encryptid event and revive someone who goes down
---
Really good point. Especially with melee, i dont think any of those 3rd tier effects are worth the same as another 2* weapon.
---
Glad to hear. I’ll take it for a test drive tonight.
---
Dude, you're an asshole. There's no reason to get someone killed. Go join in on Encryptid or Scorched Earth, people go down all the time.
---
Most of what I build is just floors and walls. They could just take up less space then other objects but I'm really not sure
---
Where was this? I feel like I should see this but never have!
---
Yep, I've tried to balance it but a few days I ended up with 1 scrip available. I would be fine with feeding it a 3 scrip piece and losing the extra 2 just for it to empty out completely.
---
The other two...?
---
I'm looking for the imposter outfit, I already have the imposter helmet, and Mascot costume.
---
How about a menu where you can select what events you get notifications for?
---
then why cant you stand it when you miss them? lol
---
same, I was 20 away from being able to buy another 3 star, the machine had 30 left in it but all I had to trade were the crappy 3 stars she had just given me. so I had to spend the next 2 hours looking for horde events so I could actually squeeze the scrip out of the machine.
---
Well, you see, that’s what makes them rad.
---
I would pay you the 152 caps for it, if you want to get rid of it.
---
Unfortunately, I only have one imposter helmet. :/
---
Interesting, I didn't know there was an outfit, I assumed it was just the headpiece. I never actually got a good look at the imposter Sheepsquatch
---
Nice
---
Next two rolls were a nocturnal combat chest and a cloaking robot arm so I guess I jinxed myself.
---
I was being sarcastic lmao
---
No one likes your playstyle, because it's intentionally anti-social.  Aggravating other people for your own amusement is what repressed suburban teens do for fun.  Grow up.
---
I am honestly having a hard time knowing what you are referencing with this post. I looked back through you comment and post history and the worst downvoting you got in the last 5 months was -5. Nothing bug related looked like it got downvoted. Not calling you a liar, just honestly have no reference to respond from.
---
As far as being critical about the game, some people are fine with it and some are not. Especially with bugs, this sub is more responsive to earlier posts and will not upvote a later post. Mainly this is because no one wants 18 posts on the same thing. In general I search the sub for any overlapping recent post (last 2 weeks) before posting my own post.
---
Sorry buddy, and why  does it show 3 stars under the descripion with 1 star show in the inventory?
---
\+karma
---
Wow.  I'd have spent another 25 hours killing HBs for more of the wrong stuff
---
I really do want to buy more atom store camp stuff, but there’s really no point.
---
I’ve worked a long time to get my camp to where I want it and I’m maxed out.
---
Thats a texture
---
I sent you a chat
---
It works on the phone with the Google sheets app. Thanks a mil
---
You get a card pack, it adds those cards to the cards you can equip. You also get to select a card each level that is added to your deck of cards to equip.
---
I got the sword back around level 30-35. Was a grueling run of constantly having to back myself into bottlenecks so the ghouls could only come at me one by one. I think I went up 10 levels and switched to using power armor before I went anywhere near white springs again.
---
And it's never a swing in the better direction...weird...
---
love the Camera and the Carlyle Typewriter :)
---
very good sir
---
Do you play survival mode or hunt bounties?
---
If not, it's probably just worth keeping pacifist on.
---
Thank you, I will give that a try.
---
Oh lol, I’m glad you got an answer though.
---
No I dont play survival
---
Sent a friend request.
---
That looks amazing
---
that was in the Bethesda notes a couple of weeks ago, showing a picture of Murgghthmmm and her wares, and at the bottom of her list was a 3*, called Purveyor's choice for 65 scrip, it wasn't there for me either. But the assumption is it's a lucky dip 3* item for 65, rather than 100. Get a team together and see if you can score each other something you all need. Maybe it'll just be a weekend deal? Like Xur in Destiny.
---
i got a lead pipe. and a cane.
---
Cryo is heavy. It's excellent for slowing SBQ to make the fight super easy. I wouldn't worry about dealing damage with it too much, but you'll enable everyone else to deal damage.
---
Definitely a buggy texture. I've seen it happen to rocks a few times
---
The warehouse set does come close to those but not quite.
---
WE GET IT, YOUR FUCKING LUCKY, (cries in corner due to bad rng)
---
Is that really tbe way they are rolled when a drop is created or is that simply the way they are displayed once the item is created?
---
I totally thought you meant to be able to craft the canned coffee, which I really wish was a thing.
---
I think it's a global thing. I've been farming Sugar Grove and repeatedly dying from the high level Assaultron at the end, and it always respawns you outside. (and annoyingly heals any partial damage to the Assaultron). I'm sure there are other examples but that's what springs to mind.
---
I can't be on board with modding legendaries after 1 day of legendary vending. It's a over reaction to one bad day of drops. Last thing we need is everyone with the same gear the game won't be fun. 
---
We need the variety and it can't be easy. Those of us who work for our gear and trade will have the best stuff. No reason to change this.
---
Thanks.
---
thatd be nice
---
Me too. Now I have the hairstyle, but have to gender swap to use it. :/
---
What better way to use that lead? Looks great
---
Probably not punishment, but I suspect this is actually a limitation of the game engine. It seems like you can only respawn at fixed fast-travel points and not arbitrarily anywhere on the map, or inside any "dungeon" area.

Rose is a discount borderlands character. You can't get much worse.

A 3* War Drum. It was the only thing I got that was even close to being usable and it still wasn't as good as the 2* War Drum I already had it got recycled along with the next heaviest two things I got.
---
How do you get to be a possum? I haven't found a quest for it so I just assumed we were all tadpoles still.
---
I didnt had enough materials this time, which adds to the bad luck
---
Yeah i'm inclined to agree. I could see it both ways as the area where it is looks like it could be a cliff side cave. So i let my imagination run away with me. I do love a good mystery haha

All my * items show only one in the Inventory
---
The other two what?

First thing that happened to me was the game froze

Until pvp is fair and balanced (spoiler alert: never gonna happen) I'm staying pacifist.

Do you need to keep the wasteland whisperer perk equipt to keep them allied? Or does it make them go sicko mode when you unequipt it.
---
Get a syringer mod it with the bloatfly syringer, make sure to spawn and agro one, fly him in there with the afk guy, problem solved
---
 Hell either die or have to leave to fight the fly
---
Yep, my carry weight with backpack and 4 unyielding and radicool is North of 400 all the time.. with only 7 strength. Max str would be what 65 lb more? Then there's under armor, foods, chems.. who knows how many ways to get your weight up.
---
melee are useless against robots, especially the gutsy,s just letting u know, so use a rapid fire weapon, i.e. an automatic assault rifle
---
Radroaches are a mix of a cockroach and a ghost. The ghost part opens doors.
---
Yeah we hit a few legendaries then they just disappeared after we killed them. We couldn't even loot them. Its was  Wham bam NO thank-you-ma'am! I was just like ugh..... excuse me but where are the bodies sir! LOL
---
I wouldn’t if I actually wanted to PvP too. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ahh well

people, each with 5 legendary armor and 20 legendary weapons in their inventory.
---
Probably, Ive seen it happen before but then I just go to another world, no biggie. This time was really had timing tho
---
I'll try to meet u
---
Thx, changed my mind 5 months ago when I wrote this..lol
---
I got two 3 star ranged weapons from the vendor and both times they were a medic with vats bonuses garbage. Both went right into the legendary machine.
---
If it's changed, it needs to be an option or a brightness slider. Some of us don't like playing in the dark.

\+Karma glad we got that annoying shit outta the way lol

Abraham roll at best ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Pasta.
---
Seems like it but think of how many things in Fallout 4 they've taken away. 
---
Just guessing it could be a mulitplayer anti-collision thing. Like rather than trying to detect exact positions to keep two people from spawning into the same space, they limit it to a fixed number of exact spawn points, and then setup a queue so that if someone is spawning in, the next person just has to wait.
---
Legendary armor effects are not active while wearing PA.

---
That airplane kit might have some screws...
---
I'm just doing the numbers and they don't add up with how it is now. And again, it's only reducing the odds, not elimination of chance. Like I put before, almost 1,500 years by the numbers, 3 years with my proposed change. Though they could even out things by making every weapon and armor viable in their own way, but that'll require a big overhaul. Still leaves the armor issue of random pieces from different sets.
---
Oop my original comment got lost, I've got the blue one ready for you whenever you're free! We're friends so you can just pop into my game.
---
Amen
---
Yup the ass head 3 star junkie did this to me :( now it's just a 2 star ass head lol
---
i buy one and need two
---
If I enjoyed PvP maybe it’d be a different feeling, ahh well.
---
Nice!
---
Sorry dude. Hopefully you'll have better luck in the future!
---
Thanks!👍

That’s why you should always make sure you aren’t carrying any pick-a-nic baskets.
---
Request still stands if anyone wouldn't mind helping out.
---
Lol small world 😁
---
Not Everyone. I have like 140 scrip and I haven't visited new vendor yet.
---
Is this a new thing? I logged on yesterday after not playing for quite a while. Went to Whitesprings to check out some vending camps. Fucking bears everywhere.
---
I'm wondering if a Blade of Bastet/Eye of Ra melee combo would work, but you'd need superb rad resistance outside of power armor(I think).  Obviously I'd need more perks, but I think that would be 100% AP.
---
You can. Uaing letters and neon signs, etc.
---
I get it they took basically to insurmountable odds and made them like 1/3 of the previous number which is still quite hard to phathom. It still sucks but is considerable better than before
---
Yeah sorry didn’t check the date
---
If you want to go for efficiency, it's probably best to go for 2 stars weapons and 3* armor. But I still went for 3* weapons because I want that tiny chance of a true god roll. I got something close to it - junkie's explosive weightless assault rifle. Imo 3* weapons are just more personalized - you have your exact weapon, even if it's not that good.
---
And also teleport us inside the burrows when we fast travel there, would be great thanks 😊
---
Btw the perfect storm gun works well against the robots, since its ballistic and is also fire damage
---
Really? Could have swore I have but will have to watch and see
---
Ahhhh wawawawa
---
Junk you mean steel and all that?
---
This would be something that shows up on the map icon/description. To encourage people to come to the shop in the first place.
---
Whoa. All good advice. Thanks. So often I just stumble upon them though, and BAM, there they are in your face! I wonder how hard it was to tame one!
---
Oh, lol no no no my friend. They are impressive pieces of equipment that are otherwise fucking useless..
---
OH

I FREAKIN LOVE THIS yes I would love if that was his idle noise so many foolish players would fall for it (including me) and be dead in seconds or trying to out run him because of how terrifying their would be out of this HUGE sheep chasing them 
---
Sheepsquatch randomly just runs pass you: IM A SHEEP *BAAA...aaaaa*
---
I'd be happy to just be able to inspect the legendary items folks are selling. One fucking time I was able to, otherwise nada.
---
Yeah, gotta love ghouls that can use the elevator lol.
---
So... linking blogs that are mostly commentary on the thing I mentioned (stupid changes as opposed to continuity issues) = proof of majority?
---
I can't upvote this enough
---
I have the exact same problem - with the exact same mod.
---
There are like 30 melee weapons in her list, and of those only like 4 are any good as base items. By which I mean the rest are just worse versions of those 4.
---
Melee is too full of trash tier items to be worth spending scrip on. At least in the guns category there are only like 5 weapons that are bad.
---
Armor is too risky because if you get wood you end up losing stars when logging out. so you can spend 60 scrip on 1 star trash, and wood armor isn't even good with three stars.
---
Pathofcinders....psn......PM me to add just bc I have my settings on ps4 set to private due to weirdos ....level 128
---
I know what you mean but I was just telling him you have to do three out of the things , he thought you had to level up three times
---
Exactly. If you're mostly interested in the first two star's potential prefix, makes sense to go with 2 stars.
---
I missed the opportunity to call it a “Cain roll”....
---
Here we can see the modern gamer in it's natural habitat. Notice how it lacks basic social skills, so it must achieve a friendly gesture the only way it knows how... By being an asshole... Fascinating.
---
Get a handful of people with bloodied melee builds, SBQ is far from actually being a challenge. I've been in groups that drop her in less than 5 minutes multiple times. I honestly think the only reason to consider giving 3* for killing her would be due to the time and effort used in launching the nuke itself.
---
We just need an auction house
---
The other two stars, legendary effects

You just need to check to see if the horde event icon is moving around, then you'll spawn right on the leader and wont have to go through the 'search these areas' guff.
---
Freakin A! I spent all my 1000 scripts at once and the best ive gotten were some furious harpoon guns. Most were junkies. I dont even have junkies in my stash nor inventory. All i wanted was a bloodied handmade. Just my luck, same as in IRL. I spent $30 on dollar scratchers and didnt win anything, guy next in line bought 1 and won $5000 bucks!
---

---
Wanna sell it? 10k is my offer.
---
it's not just an accuracy boost (which equates to a DPS boost unless you're literally on your enemy). It's also the only source of anti-armor outside of a AA weapon.  And the fact that you feel the need to carry 25k rounds kind of supports my point. I carry \~3k unless it's a queen fight. Gatling gun gets me through the day just fine, about 1.5k rounds. 50cal is for big beasts or hordes of fast movers (scorchbeasts or ghoul swarms). About 1.5k of that. Also, ammo reduction is like 2 perks, if you're really dying for it. 
---
Naturally, what you favor pick is going to vastly depend on your playstyle. But from a pure combat efficiency standpoint, PA+stabilized is the best. I'm at the point where I'm oneshotting anything smaller than a supermutant with my instigating 25% fire rate gatling gun.
---
Uh...?
---
I receive offers daily. Just leave a sign asking for offers.
---
Ps4?
---
Whitesprings just murderers me every time. Even if the ghouls aren't too high level a scorchbeast shows up.
---
PC. Out of curiosity, what would such a gun be worth?
---
Much more complex system than what you think.
---
Can't tell if troll or idiot.
---
9k because of duper’s but I won’t be on pc for a month. Currently using my PS4
---
Once you get your backpack, you have technically moved up to Possum level.  The question is when and how can we move up to being Squirrel scouts?  (Thinking about it is driving me nuts)
---
Went to the store but I'm back on if your still interested
---
50 cal fires straight away. Gatlin gun kinda does. Can't remember if gatlin laser has a fire up, only used one once, but the other's do.
---
I would love some more for her though 👀 I thought we would get a small quest before we could buy from her. Something to explain why she isn't as messed up as the others would be cool.
---
The Light Machine Gun fires instantly. I got a ghoul slayers one with +10 damage when aiming today. Quite nice.
---
There will   anyway be someone to complain, today it's you
---
All of the ones you listed except the 50cal have a spinup.
---
I consistently buy lead for crafting bullets adhesive for crafting all kinds of stuff and ballistic scrap for repairing armor. I hear others saying they need acid, I assume for smelting
---
I have a 3 star combat rifle with the aim down speed and it doesn't work worth a fuck, (the aim down speed part that is).
---
How about same perk 10* in strenght? ;)
---
You can take grape nuka cola (for sale at whitespring upstairs) to cure rads and keep your mutations til you get starched genes
---
Exactly why I'm happy you posted! I've definitely done that before and it's a miserable experience 🤦‍♂️ Best of luck now!
---
No, it just some legendary effects are always prefixes, others are middle and rest suffix, with armor its a bit different cause sometimes it says acrobatic armor or sentinel when those stats aren't the first, but weapons it follows those rules.
---
You can inspect when owner is nearby.
---
Well I'm not sure which weapons/armor off the top of my head but I'm sure it's happened to me with other stuff before too
---
Good to know, thank you. Do you if all of the spin up times are the same?
---
If youre on pc, I got you
---
Yeah, I think I'm going go 2 star until I get something good and then focus armor then when I'm fat and satisfied go selfish 3 stars. lol
---
Sent and I hoped back on. Went to the store.
---
This would be awesome.... I loved the Darkner Nights mod for Fallout 4
---
Having a really dark night was awesome fun.... coupled with a pipboy light that actually behaved like a flashlight
---
Yeah I mainly use the warehouse set to try and make stuff look a little more deteriorated and worn. I also try and find creative uses for pieces, and try to use unexpected pieces for walls or defenses. 76’s CAMP system is a tad more restrictive when it comes to snapping pieces or aligning pieces than FO4, but to be fair I used a ton of mods and kinda forgot what Vanilla 4’s Settlement system was like.
---
I love this new system, I've got a sbq crylator express, several monster ranged weapons and my dream armor.
---
Last queen kill I got literally dropped nothing. I’m still mad about it
---
I've found them a couple of times in a box where murgle is. Sneaky bloody cat's hoarding them.
---
Isn't aim down speed just for when your aiming down you can move around faster?
---
I added bulk price to the wall behind my machine to entice this.
---
So you are saying that the crappy 3rd star properties never show up on 2 star legs?
---
Really? Awesome I'll go check it out
---
Ah fair enough
---
You on xbone? I have a 3 star ghoul slayers golf club and a 3 star executioners are that are identical to that, or damn near, (pretty sure the golf club is identical). Willing to trade or sell. I'm on xbox and will be on by 11pm eastern time.
---
Its there for a reason... same as caps limit, if they didnt put in the scrip limit too many good legendaries would be in peoples hands and the prices would be at an even worse state
---
Good tip to know - I need to check them out more often!
---
I have two different ones within my aid.one with rads one without.
---
The community is amazing! Always happy to help! Which is a rare thing these days.
---
If you have pc, it's $30ish bucks right now on Amazon for a physical key, which is definitely worth it
---
How much?
---
Same thing here at WS but no nuke - just legendaries everywhere
---
I used darker nights, another mod to make lights throw more realistically, and one more to add a combat helmet light. It was amazing. I would enjoy 76 a whole lot more of the sky wasn't light pollution gray at night.
---
Way to go! I have noticed my game character’s always outpace my real life self. Should I drink these beers- no, gotta stay healthy. Spend caps? Absolutely not! What if something happens and I need a rainy day fund? Yeah, not quite like real life me. I applaud your real life resourcefulness.
---
But, did you kill him to clear his bounty?  I've done that for peeps in the past.
---
3 legendary weapons (it was beside the stash at the train station by white spring), and 200 10mm ammo).
---
There was a lot more in the newsstand by the stash as well. I still have all of em ;)
---
Yes, I went to all the locations where people said Mr Squeeze was. Or they had encountered him. Same with the Trick-or-Treater. Spent hours specifically focusing on it one night and nothing.. I keep trying but now I’m not focused on it because I got way too frustrated.
---
This sounds right, my mules all got a 3 star btoadsider as their first weapon lol. It's a great btoadsider but not what I use. My main cashed in 1150 and got amazing drops for the most part. Overall I love it
---
As long as you aren't looking for melee.
---
No word yet but hopefully this Tuesday. I've heard people say the bug with the punch bowl was a duping issue so they'll probably fix it at the same time they fix the whitesprings one.
---
I randomly ran into a Sheepsquatch in the Mire like 1 week ago or so, and since then I’ve run into about 10 and they’re a real bitch to kill!
---
Agreed!
---
That is correct :) 
---
I use it so instead of good with salt I can run a Bloody Mess.
---
Did you have a picture? Otherwise it might be the lighted posters put together.
---
20 hours, I think? The same as vendors, I guess.
---
I was wondering why I could never put anything in it. Lol
---
Aye that's correct. 
---
And both are called Sugar Bombs, and the only difference is the 1 RAD you get eating one of them. 
---
Only one can be used in cooking ect, the one with RADs.
---
Hey, I got a 3 Star Board - it's worth 2 caps.  Great value for only 100 Scrip!
---
Yay
---
/s
---
Thank you sir
---
Looking to sell or purchase?
---
You don't need to. Just get a lever action. I don't have a rifleman build but I still use it for scorchbeasts in the air. Then when they land I use my heavy gunner build.
---
OK, so, the last item I got was a "Board", worth 2 caps (for 100 Scrip).  
---
KEK
---
Same as vendor reset for me.
---
Well that's new. I didn't know they added that. Ill look into it. Thanks for telling me.
---
I wish she didn't have so much junk in her drop list. Especially melee weapons.
---
Why do wee need rolling pins, tire irons, and boxing gloves to be in the list, I mean mediocre items sure, but seriously absolute trash that not even god roll effects can make worthwhile.
---
Yep! With the new vendor
---
Thanks! That’s helpful!
---
Which was it? Were you trying to engage in 1v1 combat or did you accidentally shoot someone. 
---
If it’s the latter, simply turn on pacifist till you want to PvP
---
if it’s former, where you attempted to engage a lower level player in PVP to find out he was part of a team with someone higher, I have no sympathy.
---
I should clarify: The royal jelly you want for cooking (there's 2 versions) doesn't drop from honey beasts.
---
You would be making some extra bank
---
Same here, mine was Quad: https://i.imgur.com/TuhOCB5.jpg
---
Pretty sure you're right, posted earlier today, immediate 5 downvotes
---
I see them go anywhere from 7-10k
---
I did that yesterday and leaped up to almost 900. I got a 3* explosive hmar for about 700 caps.
---
OK, so the only thing close to being cool was one of those Automatic Grenade Launchers, but I don't actually remember anything I got other than the most recent item which was: a "Board", worth 2 caps :P  (3 star, for 100 Scrip).
---
Oh tell me about it.  I thought Fallout 4's build setup was a pain in the ass, but damn.  At least there I could use console commands to get up to areas I needed to be for certain things.
---
But, I make do with what we have, although I do agree that more tile sets would be nice.
---
Oh man, a Sheepsquatch with a Super Mutant level (ie rather little) of intellect, and the ability to speak, would be *all kinds* of hilarious! haha
---
*(Speaking of which, I haven't seen Grahm since... probably Patch 8 launched. A shame given there's been a couple Dailies to get a pic with him. Hope he's ok!* *^(\[In jest, as he's an "Essential" flagged character and can't die; witnessed this first hand.\])**)*
---
Excellent!
---
At this point everything is speculation. Ill belive things when i see them or do it. But its always nice to read another persons opinion on a topic right?
---
I honestly thought it was me making my full defended workshops.
---
Wishing you the best of success in your venture. I know for a fact that it’s not easy most of the time, but the reward is well worth it.
---
I just claimed the workshop and defended it against some mirelurks, still didn’t complete the bravery challenge for me.
---
What, were you watching me or something? XD
---
Not all of it but some kind of percentage of it
---
I've had another account for a few months now. It made transferring items to myself significantly easier, and gave me the ability to store every legendary item I've looted since the Purveyor was announced.
---
Oh it scales alright. You and 4 others, it's 1 wolf. You and a single level 25-30 it's 5 wolves.
---
Hahaha can confirm
---
Exactly my point. If players are spending caps to travel off of my home, I want those caps.
---
Agreed
---
I’d love a “junk” tile set. Hell I’d even just like preexisting random objects, like other non-tile objects too. Like I said, apartments in train cars or buses. They’re all in the game still. Lol like you said though, anything would be nice. I know they got a lot of other priorities and I’m sure I’m in the minority, but maybe one day.
---
Somewhere out there's a toad without an eye. You find him, and that thing would be worth it's weight in spoiled vegetables!
---
Thanks i appreciate it. Do you have a business as well?
---
He started pvp with me and the accidental damage was hypothetical
---
Oh I got that one, it was pretty easy after I put some pressure on the vault 76 overseer and cut a chunk of their medical funding. Fortunately I was already 2 years in before this request came in on the day the nurse was caught in the act. He never saw me in the bushes.
---
In my experience 20 hours.
---
Wait, Anti-armor doesn’t work on energy weapons?
---
In a box or suitcase? I don't see no boxes around here
---
Thanks for the offer. Not for sale.
---
I fear I’d start getting WAY under value prices and it would just annoy me
---
Same it's kind of interesting that there was a female miner that became a mile miner
---
The look
---
okay. cool. still though. I've been playing for 4 months. I dont believe I've ever seen one.
---
How is everyone getting it?? I still haven't been able to get the frog habitats
---
Pretty much from what i can tell.
---
Hahaha same. Im pretty strict with my business spending..but personal..im a splurger.
---
Ive been doing it wrong.... of have I?
---
Green box inside the shack. It's not 100% but I've found a couple of times.
---
The message on PS4 seems a bit different - seems like it’s a login server issue.  The message has (login queue) in the message.
---
at what price?
---
Bummer. Hopefully you'll have better luck in the future! 👍
---
Sounds like my experience with her today.
---
On my way
---
Wait, there’s wood armor in this game? I just started playing, I want it.
---
It was strange how there were legendary pick axes but not shovels. Good to see them now and I will let you know if I get one you want.
---
The only thing that needs to be changed is either the amount of scrip you can get from the machine or they need to shorten the refresh time of the 500
---
Yawn. 
---
I’ve seen (and been a part of) item exchanges ranging into the six figures. 
---
The reality is there’s demand to drive these purchases. 
---
You (read: the OP)! can go and get all sensational about it, but recognized it’s not to do with buyers, who view this as a desired use of their caps, or the sellers, who cater to market demand. 
---
It’s to do with your personal emotional regulation troubles.
---
It’s bc your not “bloodied” like your at 70% hp I’m run at like 20-30 I don’t think it passes till abt 50%
---
... and i got nothing but mutant slayer weapons/armour...
---
No idea why, never used them at all, nor stored them in stash...
---
That phrasing didn’t save me any loads 😏
---
Thanks! Just let me know what you find really! I already have instigating
---
They have been killing it lately
---
I'm gonna try explaining it one last time since idk if you're not understanding me or if you just don't know how perk cards work. The cards they show when you level up or open a perk card pack are not the same cards that you can equip at any time from the perk card menu in your pipboy outside of leveling up. Like say you see the Professional Drinker card when you open up a new perk card pack. Until you select that card when you level up, you can't equip it. Every time you level up though, you'll see the Professional Drinker card in that section until you take it to level up a SPECIAL stat, then and only then can you equip or unequip it at any time.
---
Have you purchased a possum uniform or backpack skin?
---
If not, he might be going by the uniform you 'have'
---
What about a vampire, 50% limb damage, plus 50 damage resist while reloading?
---
I'm honestly loving it. Any kind of mob doesn't stand a chance, i can stand right in the open. Got the damage up to 86.
---
Don't forget the flip side, when you stomp repeatedly on the feet of enemies and they don't notice you outside, on a cloudless day, at noon, while wearing shiny tinfoil, carrying a jingling death tambo, with your flashlight pointed in their eyes, radio blasting, chatting with an open mic
---
Ranged is still by far the best category to go with.
---
Melee is full of junk items like boxing gloves and rolling pins, and armor has the horrible wood set clogging it up.
---
Ranged has like 3 items that are bad, which is by far the best odds of any category.
---
Dammit - I’m on PS4 but would love to see +50% damage in cats!!!
---
I know it was spell corrector that effed your typing, but I got a good laugh when I saw it!
---
I grab 1 item then step away and wait for my next turn.
---
Hi Japanese!  English here.  Looks like Japanese to me. All is well. Have fun!
---
an ssd would help you immensely
---
Jeez man. Running a nuke for petty spite seems like an awful lot of effort. Just toss an orbital strike beacon on their kitchen table.
---
It has a “warm up” time but it’s like 1-3 seconds
---
That’s good
---
Also the difference is the ones with rads are world's spawns. Like flatwoods church roof. The farm will make the ones with out rads. 
---
Making brain bombs or sunshine oil?
---
Got 3 3* gamma guns, two of the same, and 1 10mm sub. Seeing positive posts give me hope, maybe tomorrow will be my day
---
r/woooosh
---
Yeah, we ended up getting he bounty cleared.
---
woooosh.
---
I traded my scrip in for 10 3 star weapons. I got some good and some bad. That is balanced and should be kept like that.
---
You're wrong. I just hit 30 on my second character, got Good doggy in the card pack. I have never selected good doggy yet i can equip it. I just equipped it while typing this.
---
I’ll give you 1 1/2 caps for it
---
Brain bombs for the chef tadpole badge. 
---
I've never bought Sugar Bombs before, only ever found them in the world. Guess both are world spawns.
---
Nice.  I got mostly crap that is getting re scrapped.
---
Lvl 92 and 77, and I’m sorry your stuff got wrecked.  I ain’t complaining.  Stuff happens when it happens.
---
It's just a normal event... and costs nothing to initiate... it scales to attendance and can be solo'd.
---
Maybe something on the PIP to subscribe to certain events would be a better suggestion.
---
Congratulations! I wish you all the success going forward!
---
Having the loot algorithm be affected by your inventory items really doesn't make sense to me from a design point of view.
---
It would be making a system more complicated and have a performance hit of having to iterate over the inventory items and tabulating the effects.
---
So, yesterday I got all excited because I found a Mystery Elevator that I had never seen before until I took the ride down and realized it was just another way out of the Abandoned  Waste Site... oh well, at least it was new to me!!! ;)
---
The second shot is 25% more... if it hits.
---
you know they count as a pistol and a rifle if you give them a stock, allowing you to stack a crazy amount of perks on them. Right...
---
Well, my main is lvl 92.  If I get wrecked then I get wrecked.  It wouldn’t be fun if there wasn’t some challenge.
---
Weird I've only gotten rad free from enemies ( and radiation ones too) and the farm.
---
Its to put an upper limit on no lifers.
---
Else people would just go nuts.
---
IDEAL! Especially with the new personal terminal...
---
System
---
How'd you get credit for visiting the bridge? I've crossed it 3 times, ran the length of it from below (you have to be below it to capture it for photos...). Nothing.
---
Odd it appears to be dropping less. Of course leather is what my toon wears.
---
It's a bug and it need to be removed from them not added to more
---
I think they learned a lesson from Anthem lol
---
Still going?
---
Both together. It's 25% above the base damage, and any additional damage the weapon gets from mods (i.e hardened receiver) is not multiplied. But you shoot two separate projectiles that travel in slightly different directions, so if you hit the enemies at a long enough range you might only hit with one projectile, which will deal exactly half the damage displayed in your pip boy
---
It is a completely random roll between all the weapons and legend
---
Logged in today and player vending machines are lit. I got marsupial and speed freak for 400 caps. Haven’t played in like a month and it’s a blast!
---
No once you tame it you can take the perk off
---
Forget that give me weapon weight reduction, aid and food, and +str on some excavator armor.  I will become my stash.
---
Lvl 45 anti armor war drum with swing speed and 90% reduced weight
---
That looks like a fun gun to use, congrats man! I got a bloodied swing speed grognaks with 15% less dmg while blocking, over all I'm pretty happy.
---
That's way more interesting than my excitement over a buggy texture behind a rock :D
---
plans/recipes here. I'm selling them at 1/5 the recommended price and people have a "gotta catch em all" attitude with them.
---
I did not...but that still doesn't change the fact that it's pointless to pick them up after you have a decent one and the way they're made they really should be a source of screws
---
yeah but i need yellowcake to make strike beacons. those fuckers are so much fun.
---
I think I have that same issue, I'm camped just south of robco in the cranberry bog. 119/120 of my shop slots are just plans and recipes. I get the occassional shopper usually in 15mins of play and they might buy 1 thing. The only other items I sell are 100% fusion and plasma cores. That and my 108 prime 2mm electromagnetic rounds that I don't need anymore and can't seem to sell.
---
Maybe I'm an idiot and they always have...
---
which platform do you play on
---
To piggy-back on other's replies: 
---
Go to Fort Defiance, go up to the BoS side top floor, read a note, check Grant's terminal, 
---
And off you go!
---
I did it today, no problem- it repeats for me when I enter the Bog near one of the Forward AA guns.
---
I knew I should have waited a while to make sure something didn't bug out...welp it was only like 200 scrip pissed away...
---
I don't know if you did or not, but you'd have to click INTO the thread, in order to see the first post which, in the bottom right corner, gives an indicator of voting. For example, at my time of posting this message, this thread's first post says " 76% Upvoted "
---
Meaning, of those who voted, 24% ~~are dumbasses~~ have downvoted. :P
---
While I can agree with the second point, even in my case where I've searched for my bug prior to posting, there's downvoting. So I dunno... :\\
---
if on PC i got this fantastic board furious/40%-Swing/+1 End
---
...so then wait till you can play with others. Look I get it its annoying, but there is basically no situation where you can't do this. Like even now, I could invite you to play with me and we could knock it out. It's that simple. Annoying, but simple. What almighty force is preventing you from doing something like that? Take 10 minutes out of your day to just get it over with and join up with a random.
---
I can't go a play session WITHOUT a single, random interaction between me and someone else even when I'm purposely avoiding people. It always turns out pretty well too.
---
I'm selling mine for the low low price of 15k ;)
---
Ah, so they do suck. Good to know. 🤔
---
This mother fucker thinking logically and shit.
---
I follow the market really thoroughly. I believe duping isn’t as prominent on pc so prices are a bit more accurate. Console has been off the hook with duping and listings for such items are a dime a dozen compared to pc.
---
Saw another post earlier, so far glitches are for assualtron heads and wooden armor. I haven't seen any others, but I'm sure someone else will comment if they have.
---
Assaultron heads and wooden armor are bugged and drop stars. Mystery option is MIA.
---
Haha yea... vats
---
Yeah but you're correct to be looking for these because locations will open up in the future ie: the sewers underneath Huntersville - those bilco doors in the pump house will eventually open up!
---
It’s all random 
---
You just had bad luck
---
Chemist is utterly broken; syringer hits don't record and Plasma grenade plans don't seem to exist. The pumpkin house isn't too bad though, I get it regularly. 
---
I can't figure out how to get credit for visiting the Bridge for the Metalworker challenge. I've crossed it 3 times and ran under the bottom of it as well.
---
Hmmm, that's odd. First we've heard of this today?
---
Bethesda said no humans or ghouls. However mutants of varying degree have been added so maybe more of them.
---
OMG! You put that thing in your mouth! I thought it was some kind of butt flosser.
---
I did a nuke on the queen the other day where when her health recharged, it was almost like everyone ran out of ammo for their heavies at the same time. we ended up killing her with like 20 seconds to spare. I feel like everyone was severely underprepared ammo-wise for that queen fight. There must've been 20 of us and I think I was the only one with a heavy still firing at the end. I started with 15 plasma cores and 10 fusion cores, and wore down two plasma gats and almost wore out my laser gat. 
---
I wonder if people were leaving dude's queen fight due to lack of ammo or armor depletion or something.
---
I got a Broadsider with
---
-Reduced Weight
---
-Does more damage the lower your armor rating
---
-25% faster fire rate
---
It is legitimately the worst roll I’ve ever seen for a weapon i’ve never even considered using.
---
That said I really think the concept is a great idea as it gives some assurance that you will have a good reward for your grinding.
---
I'd be cool with that too.....something....and I'm ok  if they made some enemies a lot tougher to balance the need for legendary PA....so we could be actual tanks.....
---
I'm on right now if you want to have a look at what I got.
---
You choose melee weapon, ranged weapon or armor and 1-2 or 3 stars. Then the purveyor give you a random item with those choises
---
Messing with monetary rates is very difficult, and with BGS's record, I would advise against it. Increasing the amount of caps in the game would likely cause more harm than good.
---
Dropped my two shot explosive shotty at fausnaght
---
Can confirm, same thing the assault head changed to 2 stars.
---
Which vendor sells the mod? I didn't see it in watoga.
---
Got a few nice ranged for my 900 scrip. This being the prize of them all. https://i.imgur.com/PPbaNQK.jpg
---
Sorry PS4
---
Don’t say that or your playthrough will be plagued with wooden armor like mine
---
No thanks. I already have two melee weapons I am ha\[\[y with. I also hate using the War Drum. It's size is so obnoxious to me. It blocks out so much of the action that I feel blinded.
---
I just wish they'd be more customizable.  In FO4 they had Winterized Coating (more energy resistance) and Lead lined (more radiation resistance) options which were independent of Calibrated Shocks and other mods.  They might need to reduce the base stats of PA a little so these mods don't bring them up too high, but some level of customization like that would be nice.
---
Lmao 😂
---
Dozens of reports.
---
Lmfao you should see the Xbox LFG. Kids will literally post “Looking for group to help me dupe” “how do you dupe?” “Selling loads of duped guns cheap 5k each” since they patched it I haven’t seen that many but after Ever Upwards it was bad bad
---
No thanks. I have one of those as well. At least similar to it.
---
50 stable flux
---
Personally, I report bugs here instead of the official bug report page, for one major reason: viewers. 
---
Here, they have lay-poeple who will see them, can comment, express if "That's not happening with me", or "OMG I experience that too!", etc etc. To me, this is invaluable, and Bethesda should be wanting these sort of posts in a place of high traffic like this (provided they also get a heads up everytime a new thread with BUG flair is created), since it will give them indication of what's the most important or wide-spread of bugs.
---
So what I don't get is why people downvote Bug reports ***at all***.   
---
IMO, they should not be allowed to be downvoted, period. Users should upvote if they, too, have experienced the bug in question, **but if not**, then they should *comment* and indicate as such. More importantly though, in **both** cases (experiencing it, or not experiencing it), people need to comment and indicate which platform they're on! Issues could very well be down to a specific system type, and so getting downvoted into oblivion hides it from others seeing, preventing the community from weighing in. 
---
That's just my 2 caps on the matter, though.
---
I was being facetious.
---
Well, it's still close to the best universal damage you can get. The only better one is anti-armor, but that reduces the effectiveness of anti-armor perks, mods, etc. All the better ones work either under specific situations (i.e instigating, mutant slayer's) or with certain drawbacks (i.e bloodied)
---
IGN?
---
I’m on pc. LKTien
---
I got 6 guns today. 4 "usable" I might be able to sell, only 1 for my build.  I would expect that type of useful drop rate.
---
Ugh didn't see that you are on pc. Sorry
---
Which 4 do you consider good? I've been using an instigating, +50% limb damage revolutionary sword for a long time and I love it
---
I will, I need to revive someone to
---
Ign xerquz
---
We were promised them sure.
---
But later information has indicated that the 'private servers' are going to be servers you can rent where you don't host them and have only the ability to mod certain aspects of.

---
Being able to make the game how we want... is gonig to have to come through a server emulator I think
---
Pfft.... 500 caps? Sure, but is your TP 2500 caps magic? Because I found some.  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/xnnclxP](https://imgur.com/a/xnnclxP)
---
At least it’s not a Jobe roll.
---
Yes.
---
Okay. I’ll let you do it first.
---
It’s bullshit you have to find this to complete the dumb tadpole challenges. Just want a backpack... had no interest in the camera.
---
Good list though, should help a lot. Thanks dude
---
It's also a honeypot to take junk.
---
The &gt;! Lying Lowe !&lt; storyline has the Robot workbench from Automatron, I'm hoping that's a teaser for more to be added.
---
I'd prefer a toggle like this for all events.
---
I personally couldn't care less about free range, but stuff like distant thunder, Uranium Fever or AWOL are things i'd love to hear about.
---
I don’t think it should be reworked but a time limit would help for sure. I fell victim to it and was like, ok, I get it, I didn’t know that and now I do. I ended up having to go to Whitesprings and ask a stranger to kill me.
---
He did and it was fine but a low level person may not have the options I had.
---
Np. Thanks anyway.
---
nice! remember that most ppl playin this game have some social anxiety so we're all on the same boat here. first time someone spoke to me and i had to answer i was so nervous i just gave 1 word answers because I'm brazilian so i was afraid of my english being terrible but  they were so nice about it. 
---
now, 6 months later I'm talking in english almost everyday on fallout and i have a lot of fun, that's what counts!
---
ever upwards!11
---
&gt;Why do you care?
---
Really?
---
We paid money for the game! No other reason needs to be given. 
---
Sounds like if *anyone* here has been "triggered", it'd be you. There was no need to try and slam the guy as you did...
---
good thing its not a pump. explosive pumps have a lower ttk than a 10mm pistol these days
---
I’ve had good luck and I think the whole idea is very cool. Hopefully they work out any issues.
---
It’s just sick to see level 200+ people kill the level 25 players and steal the scrap they’ve been collecting for the past few hours.
---
This. ^
---
I got one
---
Farm gulpers in the mire, ive heard they drop them as one of the random junk items

I didn't know that, thanks :)

However, you can also select text anywhere on the page, and hit Reply (to any post), and said-highlight-text will be inserted as a quote! :D
---
Can I buy it? 100 caps?
---
The daily quests have a chance to drop badges just not often
---
It isn’t logical for two shot to not be 200% damage. Period.
---
I got a Assassins Harpoon gun on my first 3 star purchase.
---
Im wanting a TSE rifle/lmg/50 cal.
---
The daily’s you get from the camp leaders or any daily quest?
---
Ok
---
Ok what's best way to do this?
---
Well that woullldd be logical....but yanno....Bethesda...
---
There's tents in Morgantown on the east side under the tram overpass where it spawns. Large tent, walk in should be on a table on the left along with somw other outfits. 
---
Unless you mean the marine helmet.
---
I'll give you one for free
---
Campfire tales event has a chance to give one badge per run, I recommend server hopping and just doing it. I farmed 13 badges within 6 hours but it’s mainly rng. Just in summary the challenges are too much work for 1 badge.
---
Sorry I just checked I dont
---
Hmm.. maybe if you down me? I’m not really sure, tbh. Idk how it works, hahah.
---
They should just make the Purveyor instanced when you enter the building.
---
Like you’re gonna dodge the second one. Hahah
---
With survival mode this shouldnt be a thing in adventure mode unless both players accept a duel.  I was doing an event and hitting a radscorpion with my sledge and some dude got in my way and I got a bounty. I ran away from the guy because I just wanted to play the event and ended up having to kill him as he wouldn't back off.  He spawned back into the event and came at me again.  Killed him a second time.  Happened again a third time.  Its annoying.  All this for hitting him once.
---
Honestly, depending on the day it may not help.  It often takes the game longer to load everything in a Nuke Zone and menus can end up freezing (happened to me trying to just pull up the favs wheel and use anything once I realized I was taking rads at all).  I just do my best to avoid having to login at Whitesprings anymore (crashes and disconnects can't be helped, but I never logout there).
---
Then we wouldn't be allies though right?
---
Probably because she just wants that sweet gold, or maybe because she isn't still pissed off at the automation of mines
---
imagine..modders would add npc's. a cool questline. they could make the world feel alive.
---
the map itself is a great blank canvas. sadly it just wasnt filled with much.
---
Enamel bucket**
---
I’ve not heard of it. Seems shady af
---
Probably best for the time being if you (well anyone) scraps any 3\* wood armor or assaults on heads immediately after acquisition before the game has a chance to revert them to 1-2\*'s. I got two 3\* wood armor bits today that I could have scrapped for 48 scrips when I got them and now I'll only get 10.
---
Reduced weight is cool. Takes up less stash space until you can put that bitch in the shredder tomorrow :)
---
We could try to get a ghoul to follow us over here?
---
**SIXTEEN TIMES THE DETAIL**
---
Full BoS Heavy Combat is about 325 325 3 for me. Sturdy will be less.
---
Really? I'm always a fan of pipes but never knowing that, I will reperk a bit to try it then, thanks :D
---
The best! Like finding a pearl.
---
That's fantastic, thank you for sharing that. I just love the stories I hear from other players in this game.
---
Double check to make sure it hasn't been changed first please
---
I think he means the display damage. That's the base, the second shot isn't added into that. Like you said, if it hits. It's not great for vats because of the accuracy penalty. If you can aim it's pretty good.
---
that wouldn't be very bethesda-like, would it?
---
It’s actually a enemys attack that can randomly be added to your inventory. I heard radtoads and snallygasters also have this happen. They are misc items also, so mostly just for collectors.
---
Not a dev room, theres a few weird stuff like that, one is the “gulper acid attack” that can rarely spawn on a dead gulper
---
Bethesda did good. I got a medics lever action with
---
Incr dmg when aiming
---
Incr res when aiming.
---
And it was highest level
---
Thanks bethesda
---
im gonna let you know, you should go play the lottery with those odds because thats not normal whatsoever xD
---
Thanks for the heads up. Do you know if any daily can give the badges or is just the ones pertaining to the camp leaders?
---
Aide bar I've noticed uranium fever dropping 3* more now. I've gotten a number from them.
---
The way the cap max is (25k) the only thing I see from increased cap cashflow is the ability to buy more cool shit from people's camps, but I see what you mean about BGS lol
---
I got one but it will cost you. Do you have any 3 star weapons such as a non duped Hunting rifle?
---
Yes I can confirm dailies give them but it’s not guaranteed!
---
At least one of the hunter questions are incorrect. I failed four times using this guide. I wish I could help and tell you which one
---
It's a glitched item, relatively easy to get. Exactly what it sounds like, it's an item representation of a behemoth's attack. You can also get a snallygaster spit attack. The only value to these items is that they may one day get patched and it will become impossible to get any more
---
So your ok with the loot being bugged and people losing legendary effects?
---
Thanks man I would really appreciate that! Psn: lvlr_lee
---
Thank you!
---
You... You want it?
---
Oh boi you messed up.
---
LOOK HOW MUCH WE GET,
---
AND WE HATE IT!
---
this poor child's gonna turn into a lumberjack of misery.
---
That would be nice but you know how the PVM tax is there to take caps out of the world? Fast Travel is also intended to remove caps and I’m betting it’s doing a better job of this than the PVM tax. 
---
I buy an expensive item only once in a while but I spend 40-50 caps in FT fees each time I join a server and FT between camps to check what’s on sale. 
---
So again, while yours is a nice idea, I doubt it will happen.
---
Ah ok. Valid points. I'm a sneak melee build though, so I don't play with guns too much. I just roll with my 1 star instigating lever if I do.
---
So people who find a way of exploiting the game don't end up being able to rack up thousands of scrip at once. It's also an incentive to play more often.
---
Disabled since the last patch.
---
Yeah, careful though. If that level 25 is in a team, you're initiating pvp with the team.
---
There was some problem with it, possibly related to an exploit.  They disabled it with last week’s patch, until they can get it fixed.
---
I hate that. I accidentally once took a guys stuff when I was level 3, (Was wondering why the bin had nuclear waste in it). 
---
Now I try to protect others stuff, sometimes I die with a load of junk, if it’s a populated area, it’s almost always gone when I come back. :(
---
Oh sorry I was talking about the innocent ones who just picked up the game a few days ago and enjoy the solo experience.
---
Be nice to select events to be notified about them. Would create much more engagement.
---
Fast travel should put you just outside their build radius, in a safe spot nearest the direction from which you fast travelled. 
---
That way, there’s 0% chance of spawning inside their structure.
---
Update: I have the high capacity backpack mod you can borrow to learn it.
---
Ass head, lol.
---
People are blaming the game when their internet is laggy, if their machines are under powered, etc. it would be cutting their nose off to spite their face at this point. 
---
There’s no way at the cost of free content. They are dumping tens of thousands of real money into content and fixes. They are also responsible for creating many of the greatest non-online games of all time and I’m sure there’s a learning curve. 
---
I play from Kentucky on British servers and notice little latency. My teammates see more than I and they live there. I think they are doing the best that can be expected and they are actively trying to make it better for future installment. 
---
The shear amount of coding and development that has gone into this game has a dollar value and that’s an investment they mean to secure.
---
The second shot is added. What you see in the pip boy is what you get when both shots hit
---
What perks/build gets your damage so high? I'm trying to make a rifle character and those are the stats I dream of
---
Just like the queen either you get the perfect weapon with s bad roll or you get something you dont want with s god roll. Its just RNG atleast now we are guaranteed a 3* legendary
---
Bethesda didn't like people putting nukashine in them and causing people to teleport so they disabled them.
---
86? Mine is 186
---
I like this idea. It would be great to see:
---
23 Armor items available, but not one of them is an actual Armor piece. It’s all Asylum Worker Hats and bandanas.
---
Trust me you wouldn’t of been doing a difference, doing a difference is Furious Explosive gat plasma heavy gunners and bloodied melee’s
---
As you already alluded to, the cost/reward ratio for most events is way off. Events either need to be more rewarding, or ammo/healing/repairs need to be less costly.
---
I’ll be testing that out next time I’m on. Thank you in advance for the assistance!
---
ITS GRAFTON DAYYYY
---
A daily quest for 100 scrips would be cool!
---
This same shot happened to me earlier. SO infuriating.
---
I really want to add an Ultracite Gatling 3* FFR to my collection. Sorry for your loss mate.
---
I always thought it was the same, like instigating. Have to craft a handmade to check. Not that I don't trust you! =\]
---
Danggggg
---
Thanks! Nice roll on the axe!
---
Here here!
---
I
---
Did they specifically say it was nuka shines?
---
Wrong event.
---
I created the jars in my Chem workstation, I went out hunting frogs, captured them but they didn't go into the jars... In camp mode, floor decor, created the Frog Habitat, the frog went into the jar... But the challenge never got checked off... So there is either a missing step or the challenge is a little bugged... Either way they sure sound happy being in their jars. I wonder if I should /could equip the jar but since it is in misc &amp; not weapons that may not be possible... I'll try that tomorrow.
---
I think we should have the option to decide through our terminals or pip boys which ones we individually want to be notified about. We can do it with certain events only. It should be all.
---
He said not to nerf it he didnt say not to fix/patch it up a bit
---
I too like this. Either way it beats dumping 1 and 2 stars in a ditch somewhere. Turning over legendary value is nice. And being we can now vend it may lower prices of over all 3 stars as more will be on the market.
---
Devs don't intentionally sabotage their own fucking games, it took more than six months for ESO (and other rough launches) to really find its feet, and 76's player-base isn't on "life support".
---
Join me
---
That’s what I was assuming. I finally got the HC backpack plan so will be buying the possum outfit soon. Maybe it’ll change
---
Hell yeah!
---
You don't need overpowered gear in order to face a challenge. Most players experience just about no difficulty once they are over level 50, and even less difficulty once they have a decent build.
---
The game shouldn't cater to casuals, it should eventually (already) offer up some difficulty. The idea that to you difficulty=exclusivity is an error in thinking.
---
I'm not arguing for difficulty like the division offered with their raid, that only a few groups were able to complete in the first day.. but something more difficulty than what we have. Something that rewards team work.
---
From the leaders. The clean up of goop and the bug parts one.
---
I mean, it's a really easy event to spawn: wait until sundown, travel to Camp Adams, event starts. Basically when the sun sets every day I make my way to the camp. At first I was really lukewarm about this event, but it's kind of grown on me.
---
I almost got a complete set of unyielding marine armor. If I can get luck like that (I have notoriously bad luck anytime rng is involved in any game) than you can too!!!
---
But there are also trolls at player vendors looking for PVP, so there isn't a good answer. People suck, Thanos was right...
---
Damn son.
---
Rescue Ranger damage
---
Yup, the game economy is going to be booming and players will want to stick around longer since they will have much less to work for! It’s not like people leave games out of sheer boredom.
---
Theres this one showing [harvestable resource nodes](https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png) for your CAMP and this one of pretty much all [major locations](https://dan-parker.github.io/Fallout76-Map/)
---
Maybe you’re too deep in the water?
---
That's a very true point
---
...but why thou?
---
Those are so easy to get lasy bastard
---
The one where you protect the Brahmin and the sheepsquatch jumps out.
---
The event sucks. Nobody protects the herd, the plans that you get suck because there aren't legendary variants of the weapons, and the sheepsquatch always spawns as a 1* so you can't even get a max 3* legendary.
---
The free range event sucks.......that's why nobody does it.
---
Adding more caps may initially cause more sales, but it will lead to higher prices in the long term with fewer players in possession of those caps. Without numerous ways to remove those caps from the game entirely, the problem will worsen. Also it's worth mentioning that the cap limit will not prevent items from being valued over 25k (which has already happened).  Think of it this way, when people have more money, they are willing to spend more money. Prices would relatively remain the same at player stores because prices would increase with the willingness to pay more. So adding more caps would only really benefit you if buying from NPCs or other sinks.
---
Being a part of the filthy casual and 76 market discord has added layers of goodness on top of an already fun game. I play for hours and never finish all I want to finish in a night. Keeping me busy!
---
You right.. Is that new? I could have sworn it was always base damage. I have 157 on a tuned tse and 103 on hardened instigating.
---
I stand corrected, Ghoul Slayer.
---
Ah ok.  That makes sense.

---
It's my favorite backstory of any Fallout character!
---
After farming for hours and not getting either piece? Not easy for me apparently.
---
Because I think they’re funny. I’ve always loved the idea of killing things with the shovel and they make a funny bonk sound when you hit stuff! 
---
And I got that backpack with the shovel on it too so
---
Lyme Disease damage
---
This just reminded me the raider armor plans that we only had one chance to roll, guess more raider quests will solve that xD
---
Idiotic.
---
do not buy anything from merchants unless your are desperate.
---
Isn't your side's argument that "libruls" want to create TOO MANY genders? I mean.. at least keep your arguments consistent.
---
Nothing. It's one of the broken challenges. Several are not completable.
---
Please make the frog habitat notbbugged our for the challenge.
---
Kill things, take their stuff. If it's a weapon, Is it better than what you use? Keep it. No? Sell it. Loot or caps! Repeat thousands of times. Ask for help occassionally here and you might make friends to play with
---
I miss "Craft 50 alcohol" challenges now, but everyone had to complain...
---
I wish!
---
wrong mission.
---
Jk ily m8
---
&gt; I wouldn’t mind even going to Mexico maybe I think we could get some hilarious cryptid’s from that heritage.
---
Legendary Chupacabras would be horrifying.
---
Maybe it's just a problem with salvaged assaultrons and wooden armour?
---
Can I have one?
---
A turd
---
I heard that it's rumored that Wastelanders will add them.
---
And then today.. only one window.. butno one is there. I seriously took 20 seconds.. and some asshole comes up and shoots me. What a game.
---
Take a photo of someone wearing mismatched power armor riding a scorchbeast in cranberry bog while fighting a squirrel while intoxicated on nukashine
---
also the syringer only has to be the kill shot, so you can whittle them down with another weapon.
---
Color me suprised...
---
Could deathclaws even fit through doors
---
Wouldn't the obvious solution be to address the exploit instead of capping the progress of the players that play the game legitimately?
---
Ohhh, maybe a “taunting” frame that made things agro  in you to draw in fire.
---
I swear by phrama finder the luck tree early on- keeps you in pocket for stimpaks and Radaway, and then you can flog the other Chems. Chems are light and have decent sale value, and even with one level I find lots of extras, and there are lots of Chem and first aid boxes around. Also do lots of simple quests, they usually have a cap reward. 
---
Guns can sell well too, especially if they have any kind of mod. If you don’t want to scrap it for mods sell em. A circuit of the airport early on can get you plenty of guns to sell at the nearby train station. 
---
Some good types sell well once cooked too. Glowing meat steak springs immediately to mind, sometimes after a run in Whitesprings I can have 30 steaks to sell at 10 caps each
---
Try the bloatfly syringer, it can do some damage. You can do endangerol, but you have to blow them up to a sliver of health to land the final shot. I'm not sure about the bleed effect counting, didn't try. It's possible to complete that one.
---
I got almost a complete set of unyielding marine armor. It was incredible. Best luck I’ve ever had
---
Not for me. At least on PC.
---
I was able to get my hands on a Medic's Lever Action rifle that has faster reload speed and improved bash damage (meh on the bash)
---
Now I feel dumb for not keep some of weird stuff I found in the past. I wonder how much those Scorched Ashes could have sold for.
---
Oh I'm always use my phone so I'm constantly learning new shortcuts. Unfourtunately It won't let me highlight text unless I reply. But I can back out after getting what I need.
---
Are you sure it's not in your inventory on your pipboy?
---
I got wood armor twice
---
I know eh lol
---
Not everyone can just play more often. And why should exploits factor into this?
---
raw flux is aid item.
---
The chemist one is the one that’s glitched, not hunter iirc. I got the hunter one with bleed effect on the Yao guai.
---
Damnit people ssshhhhh if they hear we're having fun and getting good drops  they'll nerf it!
---
Hey, totally unrelated question, but how popular is 76 in Japan? Every time I'm on there are at least a few Japanese players online, which is kind of cool to see that the game seems to be doing pretty well overseas.
---
The notifications for events seemed to be focus on endgame bosses. I don't really see them changing that though it would be nice to know when Free Range happens.
---
I’ll pay 50-100 for bulk lead or adhesive or 10-20/ea for ballistic
---
Mine was a three star 10mm pistol 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
I sing this word for word now.  It’s horrifying.
---
I think max is 24 scrip for selling in a 3* weapon, so you'd have to sell 6 3* or far more 1* at only 3-5 per (depending on if it's armor or weapon) so it would probably take most people quite a few hours to farm enough legendaries to make the 150. 
---
The cap is just there to avoid exploits by the people who duped 1000+ legendaries they've been sitting on with a mule.
---
It’s important to note that caps are much harder to come by on this game. I’ve never had more then 200
---
If this was on PC, I'm pretty sure I was there! If it wasn't we had damn near the same thing happen. I was still firing my prime .50 cal at the end, but in controlled bursts, not full bore like i started. I went through &gt; 2400 rounds of ultracite. 50... an expensive fight to be sure but we got the bitch in the end
---
I think your premise on the OPs fight is right, it seems like folks are a lot less prepared for a hard battle with her these days! !
---
I got 4 guns, all 3 star, and they were all trash besides 1. Its crap dmg but its fun because its a pump shotty with 32 rounds lol. I think its perfectly balanced, please dont bungie nerf it please.
---
Unfortunately not. Tried the repair workbench aswell. The only difference from a normal broken was that it does not showed the message about the gun being broken, just the bare hands free (I play on PC with an XBOX One controller. No hotkey for dropping itens.
---
Right in the title.. I'm going to bed xD Yeah was thinking of hunter.
---
I have a BUNCH in my machine, if you don’t find any I’ll be on tomorrow!
---
Well, D.I.M.A. is surely plugging away at whatever he was up to at the time. Possibly still in the sub base.
---
Lol I shot mine to a sliver of health and bashed with the syringer for the killing blow.
---
Wait those things actually exist?!?! I’ve played the game for over 200 hours and I’m yet to see one ANYWHERE except in the 76 guide. I tried to go to a discord channel to trade for one but could never find one let alone a legendary variant, as a power armor heavy weapons user this is extremely painful. I can’t imagine how it’d feel to finally have a ultracite Gatling laser only to lose it from it breaking
---
I genuinely thought that one would be damn near impossible (unless you nuke white springs and then go into the resort), but it wasn't actually bad. Without PA, I approached a nuke zone until I started taking +5 rads a second. Then they took the picture. Barely suffered any radiation.
---
Bethesda seems to think they'll make more money following the Fortnite model than they will with the Diablo III model.
---
This actually. You can find most stuff easily enough, ask around. Also, plan fast travel carefully.
---
Did u give it a hug also?
---
Heh, s’all good - sleep tight and don’t let the bloatflies bite.
---
all of the pre-war food items that do not cause rads should be called "Preserved 'X' "
---
X being the original name of the food
---
Yeah, there were some holotapes in the lab that talked a little bit about the failed experiments that resulted in some rather strange creatures, and by a couple of their descriptions, they were talking about super mutants and snallies at the very least.
---
Yea that’s no kidding and at least i get a cool 40 scrip back
---
Good plan!
---
I sell all chems except psycho and all its variants (psychobuff etc), anything diluted (except stims), all guns, all landmines, and depending on character, all missiles, mini nukes, fusion cores. Also 99% of super mutants have caps on them. The new player vendor is legit too. Im sure there are faster methods but this had me a couple thousand before i hit level 20. Vendor wasnt out at the time so its probably better now.
---
Yea that seems like a fair drop rate for usable legendaries. I was just laughing at how bad a roll I ended up with.
---
nah, it's always been like that
---
I didnt get any notification? :(
---
Oh yeah they’re rare. I had the luck of getting the plans from a random BoS event. I don’t really remember... haven’t seen a legendary one yet. My dream is a Zealot’s Ultracite Gatling Laser with faster fire rate with Prime mod
---
I've been getting 40 per 3 star weapon. I am sure of it. I think 24 is for 3 star armor.
---
You'll get yours. Keep going!
---
Obviously fix the wood armour. That’s not related to this post.
---
I got HC backpack...
---
Its amazing, how the more you can carry, the higher the minimum you are carrying is.
---
Have max 210 carry, always bumping the limit. 280, bumping  the limit, 380, bumping the limit...
---
And stash always chockers.
---
But yeah, been trying to get badges like crazy to get different uniform to test.
---
Ok!
---
I hear ya. I decided to try another build at level 60..I'm now at 70 and it's like climbing a mountain on your hands and knees...I'll get there eventually..
---
It took them months to address the dupes beforehand, even the most recent one (that was fixed in the past) took a few days of community attention before they hotfixed it. We will already have thousands if not more guaranteed 3* rolls by the time any exploit is addressed
---
I’ve never seen an explosive one but I did find a bloody 50cal the other day
---
Are you aware how easy it is to level without quests?
---
Although I'm currently learning japanese, I was going to make a joke similar to yours. Given your negative karma, I appear to have done the right thing by not doing so. Maybe one day people will loosen up and laugh at a joke instead of instantly attacking it.
---
Nukashine was the best part of the punch bowl. I'd put in around 5 types of alcohol and it was like a Russian roulette game with my friends.
---
It seems that, after an event is out for a week, it's all but abandoned by the community. If your not on the hype train when it arrives, you'll likely never get the chance (Encrypted event, free range, some Scorched Earth events).
---
Only 9 more hymenoptera to go!
---
I mean we are talking about the same creatures in FO4 who discovered trash can armor. It would almost be odd if they couldn't open a simple door.
---
I know there are glitches with wood armor and assaultron heads. A glitch causing gear to disappear would be devastating to the game.
---
I just got one of these also so I guess I'll update this thread if mine disappears.
---
Never saw one aswell. The green lasers was soo fast and absurdly beautiful... Was the first weapon that i could kill a glowing goulper. I'm really sad. 😢
---
id like it if we could upgrade our frog homes. rank 1 is the tiny jar, rank 2 is a small fish tank, rank 3 is a much larger one, and can hold multiple frogs. each version needing more glass to make.
---
Yes there should be plenty around, was duped again this time around
---
I only went with two star ranged weapons, Cheaper, gives you a greater chance to get something with a great primary effect with explosive, and I did get one that fit my build: a bloodied explosive Gatling gun.  Two star weapons are cheaper. and the first two effects are the important ones, IMO.
---
you sure you're not just sippin' on some nukashine? :)
---
Ok - that doesn’t help though. So regardless of my legit playing, I can only try for one a day? Just because Bethesda couldn’t get their sh*t together with dupers?
---
Sure that last statement is true and all, but as for the other stuff I never discussed lag issues (of which there are plenty that are purely server based). I mostly focused on bugs....which you don't mention here.
---
My guy we are already friends? 
---
crazy small world lol!
---

---
Thanks. Hope it doesn't.
---
I have a 1* bloody I got off a drop many levels ago. Been looking for a BE ever since. I use my 1* for the queen regularly
---
The LFG has dozens of posts.
---
I mean at least you get XP, and any legendary can be turned in for script
---
Also 4/5 of the bug parts are classified as junk. You can grind the camp fire event and other bug locations and stash a surplus of them. The only one you need fresh is radroach meat. So to save caps, stash, kill the roach, then go activate the daily and turn it in immediately.
---
Yeah they absolutely exist... I've got one that I primed.
---
That's good to know lol. All I ever see are handmades and damn crappy laser rifles.
---
Traded a 3* BE 50 cal. awhile back. They do exist and are probably held more then traded.
---
Without a cap, anybody who finds an exploit can rack up hundreds of thousands of scrip in a few hours before any kind of fix is addressed. With a cap of 1000 scrip and 150 per day, there's only so much a cheater can do.
---
Ouch. Bet that does some damage
---
Have you done the Enclave quest line? I noticed that the number of legendaries increased after that (especially given that you need to kill 10 of them to receive promotions)  
---
and yeah, definitely watch for Uranium Fever and the horde events- two of my best 3\* weapons came off of horde events, one of which was a mongrel so a super easy kill
---
Made a few more edits. Noticed I'd missed some stuff. That aside did you have a point or were you just being cheeky?
---
Yup
---
Keep trying
---
concentrate on super-muties, they usually carry a few caps each..
---
How is that possible?
---
The burrows is good spot for quick legendaries too.
---
I’m a lumberjack, and I’m OK.
---
Yeah it does but she eats Ultracite Ammo like it's going out of style!!  She's hungry!
---
No worries, I figured that out and proceeded to waste 300 script on three useless radium rifles.
---
While the stuff I sell isn't weird or an oddity, I am surprised at some of the stuff people buy off me. Was about to remove the bulk wood thinking "no one is going to buy that"...I'll be damned, someone did. I've also been selling plans that aren't necessarily rare, but either require steps or knowing where it spawns (like the crossbow, nuka cola PA paint, seemingly basic cooking recipes and whatnot). It's amazing (but I'm grateful for) people will spend their caps buying stuff that you could just easily get by playing the game (like junk).
---
They didn't exist until today.
---
Apparently they aren't too rare because I've seen a dozen people say they got one today.
---
Always avoid having junk when doing events, save yourself from this kind of trouble
---
Yeah I wouldn't even think about wanting to do all that
---
Make it smaller.
---
I've got a BE 50cal with a prime receiver. Thing shreds...
---
I mean, Chemist is hella broken. Syringer challenge component is broken. Plasma grenade one is broken (to the best of my knowledge, the plans for plasma grenades don't exist in game. If they do, they're the rarest item in game because I haven't heard of anyone who has them).
---
(learning to) Crafting serums is a \~12,000 cap thing for new players, since you can't get them from the SBQ anymore. 
---
Seriously, Chemist is fucked.
---
I’ll need to check when I get off work but i think I have one of those from the purveyor this morning. You on PS4?
---
There's still plenty of people doing Encryptid, probably because of the pop-up though. But yeah Free Range is way to difficult to do with &lt;4 people even unless you're one shorting everything in sight. Which I cannot do
---
Good to know they exist. I'll keep grinding/trading. One day I'll find one.
---
Also I just saw someone who had a BE in their inventory!!! Find you one!!
---
Same on xbox. Plans it doesnt seem to do it with which is odd.
---
PS4
---
Thanks. Didn't notice the percentage. But honestly, this is reddit. People downvote for any number of reasons. As long as my post / comment isnt tanking a -30 I am not really caring. People have various ways that they choose to vote.
---
Yeah?....
---
Where can I find this fella lol
---
So what? Why am I as a legit player being punished, now that there are stash limits and a player economy in place?
---
Nice! And yes!!
---
I don’t think he was selling but he just bought some plans from me!
---
Please do!
---
obviously, i know questing isnt the premier form of exp but it is an actual motivation to go out and kill stuff.
---
no one is going to casually go around killing mobs for 50-60 levels. especially since they nerfed mob exp and events aren't worth the time for the xp they give.
---
&gt; Final Pam
---
I had no idea what Final Pam was, so I googled it. ~~I'm not going to get much work done today.~~ DADDY LIKE A PRETTY BABY
---
The big problem with the event was that the Brahmin were very squishy and die too easily and nobody protects them. Most of the time I did the event we failed leaving the only reward as the legendary loot. High level players don't have any use for 1* legendaries.....I don't know what Bethesda was thinking making an event and not having it spawn a 3*.
---
It is better to pick one exact spawn point and server hop. Each time you initiate a spawn at that location you will  get one of the many spawns that are possible.
---
The problem is that people show up to the Encryptid event, but refuse become conduits and instead pour bullets into an invincible beast.
---
How bout the up make it "count" first?
---
Lol, no its not
---
Well ran another three SBQ fights tonight and I am sad to report the adds yesterday were a fluke. Sigh... It was so much fun while it lasted.
---
thanks ill look for you then, so this doesn't happen again...
---
Yeah Bethesda won’t replace them. Just copy paste a message that they’re sorry but they can’t replace them
---
what sucks more is that im in a weird spot where my spec isnt enough to be considered an actual build. so im really not enjoying my time grinding with sub optimal perk slots :(
---
I bet I should know what that stands for but I don't....although it all just turned to inert flux since I hopped around too much trying to find some...
---
That’s my dream.
---
Me too. And with a 2* assaultron head w/ faster fire rate. I don’t remember what the first star was, but it’s gone now. Lol
---
Fair point. One single glowing Yao Gui took out all 3 Brahmin at once (full health btw). Bethesda may want to tweak this event to make it more appealing to those who already rule the wastes.
---
This is one of those problems people don't experience themselves so they don't think it's worth changing. As someone who is level 140, i too have been working on respecing since the nerf patch. It sucks cause you have to get levels to swap special points, then get levels to get cards and level them up.
---
It really isn't easy especially since mob exp is a fraction of what it used to be.
---
Uh.. ESO?
---
I’ve got an exterminators version of it if somebody is interested. 3 stars. Might be good for killing mirelurk queens...
---
That seems unreasonable to do nothing, is it just laziness on their part?
---
Life, uh, finds a way.
---
How much of a waste of life do those people need to be?
---
Tse are overrated. BE are the New king
---
I have no idea.
---
I play and like ESO. It’s not the same.
---
Phrasing.
---
That sounds like bullshit.
---
To clarify, I'm not incredulous that you have a cop friend, or even that he says this, and genuinely believes it. What sounds like bullshit to me is that a particular brand of bag can reasonably be considered probable cause. I use one as a "mini go-bag" for things like USB cables, thumb drives, and wall chargers, etc.
---
Granted, ESO took about a year as did No Man's Sky which arguably took more hits than 76 when it launched. But...honestly I feel like it's very hard to look at the number of missteps happening with 76 and not come to one of two conclusions: intentionally bad handling or ineptly poor handling. The only middle ground is that it's an averagely mediocre game with unpopular direction (multiplayer) that was released in an unpolished state. I'm not calling the game good or bad, but to deny that it's not making anywhere near the strides ESO did without even a 1/4 of the backlash by this time since release just ignores what's occurring. I may have been hyperbolic with the term "life support", but the servers damn sure ain't full. I genuinely wanted this game to be an enjoyable spin off, but it's going the way of FO: BoS.
---
Same goes with selling to vendors in general, let me sell that last item for whatever the vendor has left, with a warning that I will not get full value.
---
'Murica.
---
First time I have heard about this actually.
---
Totally sucks....3 star explosive shotgun with extra damage to ghouls.  The perfect "I want to do a Whitespring run alone".
---
I still cant even find a camera.
---
Exactly $80 worth of quality.
---
Except there are many times you do spawn inside dungeons- When you are at the radio antenna (doing the Order of mysteries quest I think it was) and when you are doing Uranium Fever event-
---
There is no such thing as increasing the amount of caps in the game because it's infinite.
---
Because you get to open them with your eyes
---
It would be interesting if they allowed players to set bounties on other player only in survival. Like for each player you kill you get a marker piece and once you get ten you get a bounty marker. And you can redeem it at a certain area like whitesprings or the correctional facility because of the police Mr handys. Once the marker is set the player with the bounty will be given a notice from a Mr handy and they'll show up on the map. It would be interesting because I assume multiple people will go after it leading to a free for all.
---
Utter junk what it gives for 3 stars better to avoid this and sell your legendary at your vending machine.  Pool queue how the ** is that 3 staff shift Bethesda
---
No. It's in the main menu. Menu/Challenges/World/Tadpole or Possum
---
Where can I find it once I've purchased it? I'm not seeing it anywhere in camp mode
---
I've got the stimpack recipe from that event three times, as well as recipes for psycho and fury.
---
Press Xbox button, scroll over left to multiplayer, go down to looking for group. There are hundreds of listings for buying/selling. It's basically an auction house for Xbox players.
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
Out of all the things wrong with this game, this isn't one to throw a fit about lol. You're not being punished. 150 is more than most people will use in a day. Hell, I spent 900 scrip on weapons today and I still only have two more 3* saved up for tomorrow. Stop making a mountain out of a molehill. If you religiously play this game every day for enough hours to go above the scrip cap, missing out on one or two rolls is nothing compared to what you already find in whitesprings or wherever you go
---
I won't lie, that made me giggle.
---
why
---
yes, Scrap + Chip = Scrip. you Scrap a Legendary, and get Chips. Scrip
---
&gt;!or.. if you are more of a history nut.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrip !&lt;
---
Yeah. I've got a rifle that can drop that thing in one shot. Being that lower level players benefit higher levels who can quickly eliminate those threats, Bethesda most definitely should have made the event more appealing to higher levels. I'm sure those lower levels would have better luck ruling the wastelands themselves if they had a shot at 3* loot also.
---
While we are on this topic: the impostor sheepsquatch event is called encryptid, not cryptid.
---
Both wood and assaultron heads in specific are doing this
---
Yeah well I can't wrap my head around that one either, I mean it clearly states what you need to do. I've had to run multiple conduits many times
---
Haha ya I've seen you in action a few times, this is mpcollins92 from in game *holds buzz blade in air*
---
That’s amazing. I believe the repair is bone.
---
What do you do all night?
---
What about all day?
---
That hasn't been an issue for months
---
Within 60 seconds of starting my game I opened my map found an event. Killed 2 Scorchbeasts, 1 Sheepsquach, and dozens of scorched. Leveled in less than 10 minutes and didn't even have time to start a group for 15% extra exp. Just do events, clear some good areas/dungeons, claim a workshop or two.  Play with a group to speed things up and make new friends.  There are plenty of ways to have fun in this game during end game.
---
Yeah I saw a post about wood armor but had no clue assualtron heads were effected too. Thanks for the info.
---
Nothing changed today though, there was no patch or maintenance
---
Same. Hopefully someone responds. 😟
---
This gun with that mod setup has been duped like crazy recently. So i don't think that your story is legit.
---
If your on xbox, someone just posted one for sale/trade
---
I have an AAE with Reload DR I've been thinking about letting go. She's a fucking animal, but I've had to respec my build to make her viable &amp; I'm not sure I wanna keep it that way.
---
'Throw a fit' - No, mate. I'm not doing that.
---
'Mountain out of molehill' - No, mate, I'm not doing that.
---
' If you religiously play this game every day for enough hours' - Bingo. Spoken like a kid that doesn't realise that a huge portion of this game's base are adults who don't have time to play everyday, hence my OP.
---
There's really no reason to let us filthy casuals have a 500 cap. How does that really affect the dupers? They've got heaps in reserve and 1 vs 5 isn't a big deal.
---
But for us people that can't play often and want one good session per week, 1 vs 5 could be a reason to log on or not.
---
Here's hoping the next wave of DLC brings some actually high level content (80+, compared to the 50+ stuff we've gotten so far)
---
Mine 3 star Ultracite Gatling disapears during scorchbeast queen fight. That sucks
---
The thing is, small tweaks could help them get both. Ah well.
---
Maybe the radiation's fried their brains
---
The amount of caps that players have*
---
Same
---
The spiders were crated and shipped off to Skyrim
---
This made me lol.
---
Ooooo, I want that. 😆
---
No just very peeved off they are giving out crap basically stuff we scrapped to get scrip.  I’m not going to bother using this again and don’t recommend it to others better to keep grinding and selling or as I said sell in your shop
---
Or they're all running Bloodied and physically can't take a conduit. Which is also stupid
---
I've had a lot of chances on the AAE but I'm holding out for the BE. I've heard the damage is comparable but my 1* is killer when I get nerd rage popping.
---
I have a hybrid-- 2H melee + rifles and mutated. Currently, lvl 82. I only PVE. My melee weapons are higher damage than my rifles (though my instigating black powder rifle is up there with my top melee weapon). I consider myself midrange rifles, then switch to melee if hoards track to me heavily. When in close quarters, I'm pretty much melee.
---
I can do Whitesprings by myself in regular legendary armor. I can do Free Range with the single lvl 50 Sheepsquatch by myself. I've killed a lvl 91 deathclaw by myself (not even sure why he ran away from me). I can kill scorchbeasts by myself. Mirelurk kings and queens are more challenging because of the poison. One Yao Guai I can take -- a group will probably kill me lol. But I like the challenge. I'm not sure I'd have as much fun just one shotting everything. I do, however, also play on a team much of the time, so I'm not usually solo. I was glad to discover that I can handle myself solo pretty well though. It didn't really start coming together until about lvls 35-50. I really like my hybrid character even though most people don't recommend it.
---
Like you, I plan to go pure with my next character. She's based on a TV series character that I like, and will be 1H melee. I plan to start her soon.
---
I knew nothing about ESO and literally thought it was Skyrim online. I played maybe 2 hours and just never went back.
---
On marketplace
---
Or xbox
---
If they did it right, it could possibly be the game of the year (of whatever year it's released)
---
Okay, thanks! I left a couple of months back when bugs were rolled back on new patches and servers were crashing every hour or so, and only came back during the recent vendor update, so that’s good to know!
---
It's bugged anyway, you don't get credit for crafting it.
---
Buddeh, its not MILF, but BILF
---
&gt;!Bone Id Like (to) Frick!&lt;
---
Arent you not supposed to kill them?
---
This guy Bethesda's.
---
I'll let you revive me if you let me do the same (preferably in water)!  IGN: Kobold4
---
Yeah it's awesome for sbq. I already had a explosive cryo tho and don't run bloodied. Plus the dmg on cryo is so low even bloodied wouldn't redeem it.
---
 Your numbers for your primary weapons are bang on for a good heavy build, but read the second half of that 25k rounds. I'm carrying all this ammo as currency, usually 1500-3000 5mm and about 5k .50 (I've got 4 variants) the armor penetration is a valid point i hadn't considered, but the utility of 15 legendary effects over 6 modifications is still that deciding factor. Because of my combination of armor i don't need born survivor or mysterious saviour, nor batteries included or bandolier. My power armor is reserved for nuke zones, and mining, go excavator! 
---
Also one shotting with an instigating is kinda the point. My junkies gatling does likely similar damage, but maintains beyond the first shot.
---
You have to upgrade your weapon to Ultracite then craft Ultracite ammo which uses Ultracite and pure flux. Very difficult to come by materials.
---
A man wants what a man wants... Can't argue with that, bro.  Best of luck finding her :)
---
Date older men.
---
Yes or reddit
---
With a shotgun
---
The purveyor went live.  There have been reports of people finding dupe exploits.
---
I can't say what caused it.  All I know is what happened to me.  I don't think I played yesterday, but I played tuesday and everything was fine then.
---
I just added the video I took when I was there to the post. I'll put the link here too.
---
FO76 Unstoppables mural https://imgur.com/gallery/hIDOsJc
---
Beware if you got that from the legendary vendor, it's glitched, scrap it.
---
What do you mean mod setup? Think what you would like, it's a 100% legit drop. 👌 Sorry if you didn't get any lucky rolls!
---
They also have lvl3 lock pick skills. All NPCs in the game have them.
---
The purveyor was in game and it went live without any changes to the game. There is also no duping rn. Most likely could be connection if your game keeps freezing
---
I got a sub machine gun that's perfect for survival, I spent hours grinding for explosive guns. Never got one. But I got one from the purveyor on my second purchase. 10/10 good addition
---
+karma. Thanks for the tip
---
What are you even talking about dude?  You scrapped sentinel armor for scrip?  You scrapped great weapons for scrip?  Are you mad because you rolled the dice and didn’t get anything great?  Keep grinding for what?  Literally most of us grinded FOR scrip.  You’re making zero sense.
---
Add me when you're on. steelyDanger
---
Its fun see people posting items that were duped like crazy recently saying that they got it from the npc
---
I watched molerats open my locked doors.
---
This is just going in circles at this point. You clearly are throwing a fit about this if it's going on for this long. If you don't play often, how does this affect you? You're not magically accumulating legendaries through an extractor while you're gone. If you play once a week, on that one day you will have exactly as many legendaries as somebody who plays everyday for the same amount of time per day that you do on that one day.
---
Wow you must really be annoyed to dig up a 4 months dead reddit thread to whine about the Nuka Dark Rum.
---
It spawned several times with a 3\*. Many times two of them actually spawened, one 1\* and 3\*. So you're either not lucky or you're doing something wrong.
---
Now this, this is a brilliant suggestion
---
That devalues legendaries too much. At that point you might as well not even vend them to other players.
---
Out of the 4 Items I got 2 were good 3 stars rifles and the other 2 useless, so I’m happy with the odds actually.
---
I bought every DLC for Fallout 4 and Diablo III. I doubt I would pay for a DLC for 76 it seems they've put focus on selling cosmetics over lore.  I definitely will never spend a penny to buy I'm game cosmetics.
---
The problem is that Fortnite created a game that people (for some unknown reason) enjoy playing where Fallout 76 is pretty much just hiding behind an addictive skinner box.
---
My wife was disgusted by me having tick blood in my inventory, there's no winning
---
Yup, youre gonna lose that third star, I suggest scripping it asap before leaving server
---
I'd be happy if the damn challenge tracker would just give me credit for making it. I've made six of them and it's still not showing I've even made one.
---
Haha... I play this game since beta. I have any God rolled weapon in the game (the most wanted ones). I can show you my collection if you want but you are just lying about you drop.
---
Cool. This is a fallout reddit.
---
and mushrooms
---
What's the personal terminal for? 
---
In was hoping it would tell me about events going on or dailies I need to do, like a tick box thing, but I've seen nothing on there.
---
Dude, just wait a day. Not a huge deal. Just like caps max or stash weight, everyone wants more, you get what they initially limited it to and likely eventually they'll raise it but they want to delay initial release exploits (likely why grab bag random item wasn't available at launch despite pictures showing it because we already ran the math)
---
Can you say where exactly?  I've been through this place several times with no luck
---
is capped
---
I get you want to rage at anything so you dug through months of old posts, but what I meant was this game has a bad reputation from people  that shouldn't even know it exists.  I don't know what half of teh bad games are that people complain about, this one is known to be bad by name from even the most uninterested random person.
---
Once again, spoken like a kid who misses the point. 
---
Why shouldn’t I be able to log in once or twice and week and have a good, long session of play to build up some legendaries for scrip and then gambling? 
---
500 a day would be much better.
---
I would fast travel back to same spot. One day me and a buddy were fucking shit up had a be shotgun that broke mid fight. Once battle was done i fast traveled but somehow managed to drop my weapon. Got lucky i fast traveled back and there it was in a brown bag. I almost cried
---
I was like WHY IS THIS REDACTED WHO SENT YOU
---
Agreed.
---
Now nuke them from orbit, only way to be sure.
---
Hippity hoppity get off my property.
---
I second that.
---
150 is just too low. I had 450ish (what I just traded in + what I saved up), used to get 4 3* guns. Unfortunately all 4 are shitty heavy guns. Well now I'm stuck with 4 guns I'd never use, taking up 15-20 weight each in my inventory, and I can't trade them in until tomorrow.
---
Maybe a better idea would be to have no cap on the amount of scrip you can get from the machine. Instead have a limit/cap to how much you can spend at the vendor per day? This way players could gain as much scrip as they want and don't have to worry about holding onto legendaries for days and days taking up valuable space while trying to trade them all in, but OP 3* gear/weapons wouldn't oversaturate the market like you said because you'd only be able to spend maybe 200-300 scrip per day at the vendor.
---
I think something like that would work a lot better.
---
I feel your pain.
---
I was super excited for less than 10 minutes....then poof....gone.
---
many thanks....and WOW...that is one humongous rabbit hole waiting for exploration....I had know idea
---
My connection is fine.  I just played overwatch with no problems.  The game only froze up once.  My main problem is my quest line reverting back so far.  I really don't want to have to replay a bunch of missions that I just did earlier this week.
---
I heard about the duping from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=288taxRI1Cw&amp;t=328s).  Maybe he's wrong, but he usually seems like a pretty reliable source.
---
Some people use it for cheap mules to offload things onto because the game doesn't offer any way to transfer items between characters. So if you want to give your alt 10K bullets, you have either trust somebody else to onto it... or transfer it between accounts you own. The game doesn't give you any sort of shared inventory.
---
You’ve come to the wrong place.  Try Banned R Us down the street they might have answers.
---
Shows up as a floor option, for both the wood and concrete bases.
---
Ok cool. Not a huge deal. How many times are you able to play per week? Every night? No issues then.
---
Imagine you can’t play every night and you can only get 150 scrip per day, perhaps per week.
---
Would you bother to keep playing?
---
Probably not.  Don’t do something that will get you banned.
---
That mounted wolf head is the goofiest thing though.
---
Yeah. They should stay home.
---
That dupe got patched 2 days ago, juicehead is the infowars of fo76
---
Maybe, Maybe not. they could find out you came back by getting a new account. they may not. they may wait till you spend money in the Atom shop before banning you. who knows.
---
I had a 3 Star Instigating/Faster Fire Rate/Faster Reload Assaultron Head turn into a 2 Star Faster Fire Rate/Faster Reload after loading back into the game. 
---
It made it worth less scrip which helped me in the moment.
---
Lol, bold statement calling someone you don't know a lier. I'm glad you have found nice weapons too! I would think if you've found nice weapons, you would understand they drop for others as well. Oh well, I wish you the best!
---
🤦‍♂️ no, discs don’t mean anything. Most likely it was a server ban on the account used. They can’t ban a disc... When you log in to the game you have to select a profile and if that profile is banned then well, make a new account on Xbox .... don’t do bannable things hahaha
---
I'm not going to explain inflation too you. Google it.
---
Droids don't pull people's arms off when they lose, kid.
---
Well I do run a Bloodied build but I purposely de-rad and change weapon/s to participate.
---
I did the event a dozen times. I once got two 1* spawns but never once a 3*.
---
I do AWOL and get a 3* gutsy 75% of the time and can't even recall ever getting a 1* spawn from AWOL.
---
I could get into a long winded conversation about binomial probability distributions but I'll just leave it as..... nobody does the event because the return on investment sucks.
---
You mean skyrimtogether project that is literally multiplayer Skyrim?
---
Okay.
---
1.5 3 stars a day is ten a week. By the end of June that’s 40 on top of every other one you find. Seems plenty to me. (Downvote away)
---
Wow! You are super lucky.  I looked all around, you know how sometimes a brown bag can jump? Nothing.  I had it equipped when I fast traveled and then it was just gone.  No weapon equipped after fast traveling,  which we all know that happens often.  Not in my inventory. 
---
I was almost like it was a dream. :(
---
FYI you can srap them to get plans to make em same with metal helms
---
Not on xbox. Your account is tied to a bethesda id
---
I imagine most people have an "I don't want to waste my stimpacks. Somebody else will do it." mentality.
---
It’s the Tragedy of the Commons at work.
---
Ill also add that if your prices are batsh*t crazy or your selling unmodded and damaged lvl 30 power armor pieces or nothing but 10mm pistols i also wont defend your camp.
---
Caps are exactly the same way, and I get it, it sucks for you and I'm sure your schedule is hell. 
---
But they're not going to completely rewrite a game due to your personal life choices that gave you your unique schedule. 
---
So, you wait. Simple as that. We explained already why they're not changing that currently for the entire rest of the player base no matter how it affects you personally, it isn't going to change. 
---
So if you now want to just bail on the game instead of waiting because you're impatient at least player vending makes it easier to sell your stuff the one day you're on
---
Why didn’t this get more attention.
---
Would be good if you’re looking to free up SPECIAL points for another category.
---
It's a variant to the deathclaw statue. Tab over from it.
---
I got a ghoul slayer fat man out of all things
---
Once again, spoken like a kid who has no appreciation for the fact that most adult gamers can’t play everyday. 
---
Do you really think 150 a day is good/fair? 
---
Anyway, enough of this, get back to me when you’ve grown up.
---
xboxone, but still.. I think people have been concentrating on looting legendaries to feed the grinder, and as such are probably not hoarding ammo for queen fights quite like we were a month or two ago.
---
That only works for high capacity, for the rest youll likely have to pay 10k+ if that little
---
i read somewhere that the plasma grenade plans are a drop from ash heap events like lode bearing and breach and clear. i just never got them for a drop.
---
I believe accuracy also effects projectile spread when aiming down sights.
---
I do not have a good understanding of how range is calculated but I do know it’s complicated. There are a few range classes that modify range in a way that makes the number visible on a weapon almost meaningless unless comparing it to a similar weapon. For example, shotguns have the lowest range class while rifles have the highest however 90 range on a shotgun does not equal 90 range on a rifle; it’s actually far less.
---
I really have no idea what unit of measurement is represented by the range value or how it is used to calculate spread/damage. 
---
This mechanic is neither visible or explained in-game. You’d only know about it by looking at the game files or talking to a data miner.
---
Woah! Huh, never seen that before!
---
I'm not struggling with the concept of inflation.  You're right but increasing the amount we can make in a day isn't increasing the caps in the game.
---
Holy shit, you're right. I only have two card I didn't pick and then a bunch of doubles of cards so I never noticed. I could've sworn I saw cards in the perk packs that I'm not seeing now but it's definitely more probable that it's a bug or my memory's playing tricks on me. Thanks for setting me straight on that.
---
Actually spoken like someone who has matured and grown up enough to realize that life doesn't revolve around me or my special life conditions and has enough self realizations to understand the needs of the many outweigh what might personally be best for me.
---
Any wood armor from him and the assaultron head will turn to 1*, even if you only just leave the server
---
Lol. Read - ‘Yep, I’m a kid’.
---
Why wouldn't a female be able to? A ton of miners in Appalachia were women.
---
I’m hopping right on that bus.
---
Depends who you ask. My friends that have not done any troubleshooting of their internet because "other games work" still dc.
---
But that was never a game issue from the start
---
On the contrary, it overvalues them. This means every 3* legendary, even a nocturnal rolling pin, would have an inherent value of at least 400 caps. It's still an awful idea and would shatter any hope of caps ever having value again, but just wanted to point it out
---
I've heard that instead of random they hash your username which means some people trend towards repeated greatness and some people trend toward repeated garbage.  I don't know if it's true but I cling to this because if they can fix it that means there's a reason I only get garbage.
---
I got a mutants broadsider 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
---
Were I the speculative type, I’d suggest that if you could grind up every one star you found you’d never have any incentive to flog legendaries to robot vendors or put them up for sale cheap in your own shop. A lot of players have gotten a leg up finding a good to them weapon for sale. So it makes sense for Bethesda to try and keep some of these legendaries around instead of every one being ground up to gamble with (beyond the people who sell them because they want to help other players).
---
That made me laugh imagining a guy flipping out and beating somone with Gronack Axe for two minutes at the Purveyor's counter.
---
Aah, fair enough. I'm on the computer. :)
---
Ok ty!
---
Dam I did, how it glitches though?
---
No effing thanks
---
Thanks for giving them ideas. Nerf coming in a hotfix any day now.
---
Bet they’ll have a bundle in the fall with them in it
---
Me too.  I kept it, that's how bad the legendary randoms I get are.  I modded it to shadowed for stealth build and it was converted to a 1*
---
I got a totally \*\*\* worthless rocket launcher. I was dissapointed, but figured trade it in and try again... only to fing I met my daily scrip limit. Now that darn thing has to sit in my inventory until tomorrow (dang thing weighs 20 lbs and is essentially worthless). Insult to injury.
---
As a fallout veteran i leveled an alt.
---
The respec we have is for adjustmemts and i won't wait till the end of the time to hopefor something else
---
I was not unhappy with it but hearing all the talk on no camps in Whitesprings I surprised to see one? Just trying to understand what the rules are in building on the Whitesprings location. Frankly it is nice having a spot to fix and prep at instead if having to go into the Whitesprings Hotel.
---
again
---
Didn't even consider bad legendaries because I assumed people would just scrap them in most cases. It would devalue good legendaries by making them more available.
---
Doesn't everyone have a 90% less weight fat man?  I thought it was a named and hard coded reward.
---
To everyone who commented I wanted to say thank you, I just started playing 2 days ago and I love this game every bit. I've ran into a couple people; one tried to fat man me and another 3 gave me free stuff. But overall the community of this game is nice, minus the one guy who downvoted me, he could suck a fat man
---
That *is* horrifying.
---
Tallest building next to old bog town workshop. It's a little tricky. If you have marsupial, you can jump up from the 2nd floor (or third?) through a hole in the ceiling. Otherwise, you climb the stairs to the roof, and drop down the elevator shaft. There are lots of typewriters, fans, a couple of globes, and some loose screws. 
---
You can also do fairly well in the asylum sometimes.
---
Nvm, 3 servers and they all fucked me.
---
I didn't know that.  This is the first I've heard of the dupe.
---
The issues I had with the game freezing and enemies shooting me before they rendered were in Berkley Springs.  At the very least new models and a new AI are in that area of game that weren't there yesterday.
---
The thing with my progress being lost was once I logged in though.  Way across the map in the forest region.
---
Logging out will make it lose legendary effects. It's also glitched with wooden armor.
---
Preach, my friend. PREACH!!!
---
Honestly I just shoot around them, usually gets them confused and causes them to look around. 
---
That's when you jump in and get the vendor screen.
---
Dang, I think a fat man might be a little excessive against ghouls 😁. Hopefully you get a better roll soon!
---
People like the assaultron head?  I have a 2-shot... does it still use your entire ammo cache in the first click?
---
Same here. Only 180
---
Does.....does that have good rewards? I’ve always skipped it after my first run of it
---
Ahh, ill continue guessing
---
Is it an owlet? I assumed chicken hahaha I should read the names of things sometimes lol
---
I will take it!
---
After that I did a 2 star and got a quadruple pipe pistol with explosive rounds
---
You got screwed.
---
Reload speed and rate of fire don't work on Assaultron heads.
---
I wouldn't mind notifications, but it's not exaclty as important as Encryted or Nukes. They would need to do this for the new event, next content drop.
---
No idea :-/
---
How would I find out?
---
I'm gonna have to try it
---
I've only been able to successfully do Encryptid once because of people like that. I've also done the Campfire event multiple times with my husband because he still hasn't gotten the s'mores recipe. We'll go and do everything while all everyone else stands on the roof and waits for the legendary to come out and they insta kill it before anyone that was actually doing the event could get any damage in. It's annoying because people just wanna get the legendary drops without doing any of the event required work.
---
Someone did. You were on the wrong server.
---
I'd probably struggle to find a more accurate representation than that haha
---
Thanks! It is fun confirming that I finally got an item by myself with the stats that some folks consider dupe-worthy. Definitely going to be a keeper for me.
---
I have the opposite. Max carry is 325, I am under 300 and it says no fast travel, over encumbered, EVERY TIME I tried tonight.  I can drink or eat one item and then I am suddenly able to fast travel. Still the same weight.
---
Yes.  A/C repair shop
---
After that I did a 2 star roll and got a quadruple pipe pistol with explosive bullets
---
Lol
---
R2 I suggest you let the Wookie win.
---
If your idea of good is 5 purified water and a few 5.56 ammo. Than absolutely best event by far.
---
We should have a sign saying, please CLOSE THE DOOR!
---
My low level still got high level rolls (thank goodness).
---
Idk about Xbox but on PS4 you need to start a new account and then you could start over and play again. You end up paying for another plus account but it’s your only option.
---
Worth becoming wanted for I think 🤔
---
An important lesson I learned in the CS:GO economy: value is relative. If a 3* pool cue is worth 400 caps, a good roll like an AAE handmade would be worth a couple times what it's worth now. Anything remotely good would have to be treated like TSE and assassin/sentinel pieces were in the old days before they were nerfed: exclusively traded for others of equal quality, maybe bought for 25k caps if you were lucky
---
I have two plans I restock every day. Even at double the default 100 caps I cannot keep them.
---
ESO is totally different gameplay/style.
---
What if I change my Bethesda account and link my Xbox account to that new one
---
Glad to know I'm not the only person bothered by this. I'm considering rebuilding my camp entirely with a separate building for my vendors and keeping the door to my living quarters locked because of it
---
Good to know, thank you!  I'll return them if I get another.
---
Favorite part from fallout 4. Would love to see it in 76 as well.
---
Yeah, server stability first, fluff later.  😉
---
May be the atom challenge. I noticed I need to find quite a few to complete it.
---
So far the only quests that show up in my personal terminal are Biv's daily and two repeatables from the Scout Leaders. Would definitely love having events (with how much time is left for them) listed as well.
---
Absolutely. Can’t play a game that doesn’t work. Haha
---
Can be solo'd? Not when I've tried it.
---
Ok yeah I can get the cows to location on my own, no problem. Get there and then two Sheepsquatches appear, not to mention the Glowing Yao Guai that's now attacking said cows along with insects to boot.
---
That's the laziest statement I've seen.. this is a real AAA studio, not some person on Reddit that decided it's always been a waste.
---
If they were going to give up on this game, they would have long before now. They can fuck up, the person you replied to explained one of many ways things can go wrong.
---
It'd either have to be ridiculously hard and unlikely doable by the majority of people or it'd have to be more like 10 scrip.
---
Lost my 3 star explosive shotgun, with extra damage to ghouls, a perfect whitespring weapon for my character. I got it from the new vendor today and within 10 minutes.... Had it equipped in my hands, fast traveled to whitesprings and poof...it was gone, empty hands, no brown bag, not in my pip boy inventory. 
---
Totally sucks!!
---
Psn? I’ll take
---
&gt;In my experience
---
I'm going to go ahead and guess you have almost no experience and you're just talking out of your ass.
---
I'm guessing you carry a loooot of stuff on you. I don't use batteries included or bandolier. About 5 fusion cores, which is more than I need really, but it means I don't have to pay attention to my core usage daily. I do use Ordinance Express because I'm a HW/Explosives build. 
---
Instigating: 200% damage on the first shot. Junkies... +36%-ish damage per shot if you're maintaining maximum addictions, which also means minor stat debuffs across the board. So yeah, junkies will catch up by shot... 4ish.  And with Stabilized, my Instigating is basically a sniper rifle. Seriously. If you haven't tried a modded gatling gun with Stabilized in PA, try it out. It's very accurate when Aimed. Just do it in third person for the dot (if you practice in first person a lot, you can get pretty damn consistent too; I have) 
---
If I'm up against anything that's going to take more than 3 shots, I'm usually switching to my bloody gatling gun. 60% bonus damage on every shot. I don't bother with born survivor (although no one running a low health build would...) and I only put on mysterious saviour for the sheepsquatch, as it's the only fight where I have a significant risk of dying. 
---
15 legendary effects... when, at least for me, most of them are worse than being in PA.... 
---
unyielding doesn't give me anything I care about for combat. I do wear an ultralight set of Unyielding +int/cha under my PA for selling/crafting. 
---
All the armor boosting ones are less useful than the straight DR I get from PA. It's consistent. 
---
Powered is kind of nifty, but I don't use much AP- I don't power attack, I rarely have a reason to sprint in combat, I don't use jetpacks in combat, I rarely use VATS in combat (just on those pesky shorties like radrats).
---
I'd kill for some poison resist in PA though.
---
Rad resist doesn't even come close to touching PA rad resist.
---
any weight reduction: I get what I need from Ordinance Express and Bear Arms.
---
Sentinel/Cavelier: Not as useful as the straight % reduction a full suit of PA gives you (around 45% I believe.). It's active all the time, so you don't have to stay still or sprint, and it's also not random like Sent/Cav is now. And as a low-health build I stack that with Emergency Protocols (which also makes me move faster). It's insanely effective.
---
This is true. My lvl 50 fixer works well on one bear. Probably not as well when there are more. I was able to get the bear's health down to about 25% before it figured out what hit him. Then I switched to melee as he got close and finished him off.
---
A gang of mirelurk kings killed about 4 or 5 of us one weekend -- all 50+ lol. We were just roaming around messing around, but still. We ended up getting them, but yeah, they are tough.
---
I couldn’t agree any harder.
---
My problem is with vending. Loaded everything up waiting for machines. Now I have to sell it off to clear room. I can't go to a nuke zone. No room for anything.
---
Both messenger events I tried to do tonight were bugged...
---
somebody on another thread brought up that ranged weapons you're better off going with 2 stars, being that the third star is usually not very good. I don't if this is true, I'm going to see tomorrow.
---
Yeah haha, I thought there were a chicken mount in-game but there is only the owlet, basically looks like a baby chicken little
---
No flux that way.
---
My first was a nocturnal hatchet with 90% less weight and... something else
---
I just want half walls and half floors. My roommate and I play together and I made our house that we live in. Only its a little big in some spaces and having a half foundation or even just a half wall would solve so many issues for me.
---
We sloths can only agree so hard, I feel you.
---
I'd try selling it a lot of people love the tse on any gun
---
I’d keep it for sure.
---
Have a 50cap explosive with second perk shooting same enemy does more damage
---
Same as here
---
Thanks for the node map.
---
Omg I know!! I built a bathroom next to my vending machines and everyone opens it and no one ever closes it!!
---
My turrets don’t shoot at things that are standing right in front of them...punching them...
---
Why on God's green earth would they do that?  That requires 5 to 10 extra steps that serve no reasonable purpose.
---
That said, three of the five legendary ranged I got from the vendor were assassin's / +vats crit. I'm not into pvp, and rarely use vats.
---
Yeah, TSEs are very desirable. Don't scrap it.
---
How do you do that? Teach me oh wise one!
---
Uhhh how about no?  They need to release seasons to the survival beta like three months ago to see how the game really will be played.
---
That’s kind of the chance you take camping near a popular spot to nuke.
---
I got a few modest drops. I would recommend that if you don't have much in the way of weapons yet, buy 2 stars. half the cost, and most of the good stuff is [in the first two star](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L5c8ZKCCf4OaNglGc516dl9AFxYWnMUDuhQbHjrlQkQ/edit#gid=1760290048)s.
---
Depends really... I've done it solo and had 1 SS spawn, 1 Yoa Guai, and a few insects... it's about killing things in order... grab the SS aggro, kill the insects, then run to an area where the cows aren't in the line of fire for the SS and then just tank his damage... I honestly find the versions I encounter in the wild a lot harder than the event as there isn't often nice cover to climb on/around and I go through multiple drums on my TSE Handmade.
---
Again, like I said, it scales.  I was there last night where there were 4 people above 200 plus myself and 2 others... I kid you not, all the 200+ people and others all focused on the 2 bloody SS and left me to try stop about a dozen insects in 2 waves... and with cows running all over... obviously failed...
---
Still, it IS just a normal event and the damage output from the SS is not that high.  Best option will always be to have an option to be notified of events you have previously completed.  Similar to the Personal Computer thingy in your CAMP.
---
Id be cool witb double script pool for a weekend.
---
Once you've got all the plans and serums you don't really need caps. This uses up caps just for a legendary roll, and most of the 3* legendaries are not that great anyways. So it bleeds off excess caps and incentivizes high level players to participate in selling items to other players for caps to buy more rolls. Making it a deflationary mechanism for caps in the game.
---
The price of caps to scrip is disputable, but the mechanism to reverse caps inflation in the player economy is needed.
---
Get the metal rolling doors and put a switch on it. Close up shop when you’re done. It’s not the customers responsibility to undertake the responsibilities of poor management. 
---
I’d like to speak to your manager please.
---
I just did the quest again and didn't need the note. so picking it up once seems to work from there on out. (fingers crossed)
---
Does projectile spread when ADSing only effect the spread of shotguns, flamers, cryos and beamspliters?
---
I understand what you're saying but how do you know 90 range on a shotgun is fairly less than 90 range on a rifle? How do you know it's just not the lower accuracy on the shotgun that is giving you less damage output?
---
I don't mind how it works.  It cuts out two levels of RNG ... how many stars and type of drop .... but today didn't go so well for me.
---
I'd buy it, reasonably priced.
---
It is but bethesda advertised this as being able to be played solo and they have been trying to appease people who don’t want to group up and keep them interested in the game. When they make half or more of the dailies hostile to people who don’t want to group up or deal with other people they do a bad job of that. Add in the best way to get people to play together is make the gameplay fun, not try to coerce them with you get no dailies if you don’t. Stuff like vending which gets people to hang around more (note several people say it has made mp more fun) or events that require co op and are fun to work together.
---
You basically get 1/3 the value back, which is a remarkable turnabout. essentially trading two legendarys for one of the same star rating.
---
You get a tadpole uniform when you first talk to the scout master so that can't be true
---
got helped but thank you nice to know people are willing to haha
---
I only got three star because I'm working on a vats build, and vats is the only worthwhile 3rd star.
---
*Congratulations! You have won the Appalachia sweepstake!*
---
I don't have doors. Problem solved.
---
My best item was a Explosive, Quad, - Vats cost Handmade rifle.
---
I have one
---
Looking for group on XBO always has a few. Mostly kiddos though.
---
Yeah, but like the beach boys are about 150 strong, there are some major ones out there
---
I understand. It's ok.
---
3k is pretty average
---
Depending where I spawn in, half the time it's either I'm stuck in a wall or in some back room somewhere. We need fast travel mats.
---
And there's a roach in the cabin next door on the second floor. Behind the locked door.
---
Yeah I guess I was just unlucky with how it scaled for me, not sure if you've ever done it in the Mire but all the cows just stayed right near the house which is pretty much a kill box. They were getting reamed from all sides and I was trying to kill two SS. 
---
But yeah agree with that solution 👍🏻
---
Not gonna tell ya how, but you’re capable of unlinking your Bethesda account from your gaming station. Unless they specifically banned your console, you can just make a new account.
---
Every character immediately respecs to Perception 5, except for anything rifle, which becomes officially fucked. Immediate posts: "Why are there no legendary enemies?!?" as people train every place that has a good chance for spawns.
---
i keep mine open so people can see my house and use my workbenches
---
Yep, but you can only try for one 3 star a day at the purveyor with 150 scrip.
---
The cap applies to scrapping only.
---
It isn’t unusual for the mister handy to hover into a wall and stay there for 20 mins until the event expires lmao
---
My buddy used a level 5 mule and got 3 max level items. So far it looks like the purveyor only drops max level stuff
---
You might do better to exchange two of those 9 rifleman points for an additional 2 points in tank killer.
---
I sell undamaged goods in my Housewares vendor machine. It astounds me, but I assume it's preparing for display cases.
---
Isn't that just the scorcher?
---
Wanna sell it lol
---
Dey took 'ur jerrrrrrrbs!
---
well then the Mounted OWLET is the best one! :D
---
Yeah I guess probably because they've done it enough times to get all the plans they need. Which is shit for those of us that haven't. I still haven't got a single SS plan and have received nothing but White Wolf Fedoras from Encryptid solely due to these people.
---
Wouldnt be a bad idea to tho the same with the Enclave bunker ...
---
I have 3hours daily on my char (600hours/180days), i could do maybe around 500scrips a day. Am i no-lifer? O.o
---
Bloody mess, the explosive perks and the rifle stuff, maybe others too, but not sure.
---
That other option is somehow related to the Daily quest to put scorchbeast DNA in the Centrifuge in VTU.  I'm not entirely sure how, but the first day I did that option, and it gave me that daily, and now I get it every day.
---
A daily like biv’s quest wouldn’t be that game breaking. Give people a chance to roll a legendary a day.
---
Yup. But judging by the responses to this post, it seems like people don’t expect BGS to ever get their shit together and therefore legit players can just deal with it, unless they have the time to play every day for hours.
---
I like the idea of a true survival mode....without legendaries. They just hurt the expierence so much from the nonbalance that goes into them.
---
How the hell has this not gotten a Bethesda reply yet? It's quite lovely.
---
Then it is duped everywhere. That's sad.
---
If the account is banned, your straight up locked out. There's nothing you can do on your end to get past the bethesda server handshake that happens when you log in. But you can make a new GT and start again. Try and play legit though. Everyone was duping on smurfs this past wave. IP address bans are coming in the future. I'm confident.
---
I fuckin' tell him every day, but he doesn't even listen.
---
if only 90% reduced ammo consumption
---
Well yes and no serums recipes have always sold for 2 to 5k per from a player but after they stopped dropping from the queen 3 updates ago they raised to about 3k to 5k and if any one charges more than 5k per theyre insane
---
You're thinking you can transfer script among characters?
---
You’re kinda misunderstanding the entirety of the situation.  OP is talking in regards to -only- during rare double xp weekends.  We’re talking 4K caps more to spend maximum over the three days.    This means farming out materials to actually earn that much.   It wouldn’t lead to inflation as 4K isn’t even a drop in the bucket.     
---
People won’t just spend more on a whim, the most you’ll see is simple scale tips like buying railway rifle plans for 700 instead of hoping you’ll find someone selling for 650.   Inflation wouldn’t be close to enough to work both ways in that situation, no one’s going to shell out 50 more caps, they’ll just continue waiting.
---
The amount of additional fast travel mixed with the 10% tax has already lowered the cap levels of the wastes, a singular weekend every other month would at worse return things to pre vendor levels.   The issue there is that as time moves on everything that isn’t limited time will naturally devalue.      It’s an objective point that the longer the game goes, the more rare outfits will be picked up and eventually enter market.    Just look at the depreciation of imposter squach outfits, 
---
What’s more, a limited time double script pool would only work to lower the value of hot ticket legendaries. As is we’re going to be looking at a price drop on certain weapons within a week or two.
---
And if you’re that worried, don’t be.   Much like how encrypted requires 2k caps, well likely see instance keys pop up for newer events as time goes on creating new ways to remove caps from circulation.     Which coincidentally is also half the reason for the vendor....it goes without saying that we’re seeing the equivalent of 2.5 3* guns go in for every 3* gun coming out.    Stop to think how many subjectively useful 2* it takes to hit the daily 150,      Think about how many people in this sub are going to take three guns they got today and trade them for a single gun tomorrow.     
---
The only issue is script increase, and even the worse case of that would be devaluation of the 25k+ weapons and and leveled increased value of mid tier in response.  Still completely Balanced.
---
If I’m remembering correctly there’s a flag on weapons in the esm that gives the range modifier values. I recall a lengthy discussion about this either on here or the fo76 discord so I’ll see if I can find that and give you some more definitive information tomorrow. Way past my bedtime...
---
But, you can take over Grafton steel for a while and get some good steel and lead scrap for that ammo.
---
No I’m thinking I can use script from lower level characters and transfer to my higher level
---
I just ground through the tadpole bullshit... to discover that the backpacks don’t add cart weight to the power armor.
---
Fuck. I never saw the revised article. I’m mostly heartbroken right now. Those challenges weren’t fun, but I figured the reward would be worth it.
---
Interesting might need to sample this
---
I got mixed results. Two of my low levels, around level 4, got max level items. One of my low level alts who is level 7 got a level 5 pump action.
---
All were rolling for 3* ranged.
---
What if I plug it in to my generator?  Will that work instead?
---
Lucky.  My best pull was a furious vats .50cal.    (Hit chance and cost down)
---
Doubt I’ll be able to even get 4K for that crap
---
Insane? Only other way to get it, is buying it out of enclave for 17k+. If dupers never existed it would go for 10-15k i belive. If i had 4recipes in over 100kills.
---
We don't have to argue over semantics here. It would increase the amount of caps *in circulation between players*
---
It would help with pulling caps out of circulation from fast travel like all the shopping at camps.
---
Never heard of that event.
---
Where does it spawns?
---
And what does it rewards?
---
I think they're just joking. I'm selling perfectly preserved pie for the same price as a joke
---
Freezing when you go into VATS?
---
Seems to be a new things
---
Yeah insane many people farmed the event and you couldnt dupe plans with any new methods since of how they worked so 3k is pretty generous my buddy farmed it hard and has a few coppies of each
---
Prob to air it out cuz that shit stinkzzzzzz!!
---
🤮
---
I don’t think they were lol. They had a lot of low value items jacked way up. Like purified water for 200c. I think they were hoping to get lucky.
---
Wish they had a group up function for an online multiplayer game though. I still can't get a group since nobody has a Mic, plus few and far between on the map to waste caps fast traveling. I'm losing steam on the gane because of this and many many other things, getting ready to quit.
---
I think they should learn from this and if they do multiplayer make it actually like elder scrolls but Co op, like borderlands and destiny. Add pvp arenas and battlegrounds.
---
Legit, this is the only thing i miss about slap damage. Dudes afking and tying up a vendor. I remember it was the only time i took off passive mode during my first 3 months in the game. To kill that guy and open the vendor back up.
---
I do like non-irradiated water
---
it’s the aerodynamic mod
---
Interesting.
---
I wonder if this is because the weapon type that was chosen can't be a level 1 so it defaults to max level?
---
Try the one in the NW. There's only one lvl 50 Sheepsquatch. I solo'd it the other day, lost only one cow.
---
Sounds like you might have the plaguewalker mutation - if not then your best bet would be server hopping in Flatwoods as there are at least 6 Brahmin there
---
I just farm the event for a few hours. It took 3 nights to get the high capacity plan.
---
He looks like a little kid in dads armor lol
---
Had that happen and he also caught on fire and just wouldn’t go out so he was just sitting still with no health and couldn’t regenerate and move.
---
It’s a future where culturally we stayed in the fifties.... and we got a word for guys like you wanting that kinda hair.....     wait, how the hell did -this- mentality survive nuclear war!?!?
---
Yeah stop wasting their time. Bethesda does a great job at listening to the community and you want to stretch their ears over a god damn indoor fast travel marker for WS?   
---
   
---
Lazy, lazy, lazy!
---
I feel it. I also have a 2 shot broadsider with faster fire rate and perception. From what I've been told there's a magazine increase mod for the broadsider you would need to take advantage of faster fire rate tho
---
Take a junk shit in a bush out of the way before you start encryptid. Go back and scoop it when you're done
---
I've held down the 'Milk' button before and it's about a 50/50 chance on whether the Brahmin kicks or it goes through successfully. I think it's the proper way it's supposed to work since real life cows can be uncooperative at times
---
I froze too.  I was in adventure mode.
---
Can I get one too? I just started playing yesterday and I'd love whatever I can have 😩
---
Ooh what about (*cause I feel like not everyone would want a notification*) using the personal terminal (*that you can get for free in the Atom shop*) to setup which events you would like a notification for when it goes live and how much time till it goes live again?
---
If you just started, you can't wear it for quite a while. It's level 50. Sorry!
---
Oh wow that sucks, okay
---
Did you get the code to launch Charlie? Been trying to decipher it..
---
Go to nukacrypt.com they have the codes every week
---
Is the code the actual code or the code relating to my pieces? If that's the actual code, I'll be slightly irked...
---
I just checked ! I don’t have that but I just milked my cow and it worked! But how often can I try again to milk it?
---
I can try to make up a backstory, it’s gonna suck tho.
---
*The purveyor is actually a traveller from another part of nuclear America. She travelled to Appalachia and took refuge in a train station she found. Her purpose here is to collect legendary scrip to take back to her home to create a complicated and special machine that will fix the air quality there and cure her people, as the reason she wears a suit and mask is because her lungs were so badly damaged by chemicals in the air at home that she needs a special suit to maintain her breathing, which also runs on scrip. In return for large amounts of scrip, she is giving back legendary gear. It is made with a portion of the scrip you give to her, but is still very powerful. 
---
Once she collects enough scrip she will return to her home to build the machine that will either save the air quality there or cure the residents, who may move to Appalachia, which has better air quality than back at home. If they arrive here, they may claim Berkeley Springs as their new city and rebuild it, serving as the game’s first friendly town area, similar to Diamond City or other fallout settlements.*
---
That’s my made up backstory that I made on the spot.
---
So the code pieces are the same for every player, but there's a keyword that appears in the Enclave Bunker every week over time. The whole process is pretty complicated, but Nukacrypt has dozens of people who work together and solve it every week early as possible.
---
Or at the bare minimum allow us to sell an item for less than what it’s worth if the vendor has a lower remaining scrip amount.
---
"box"
---
I just added another batch of photos to the gallery this evening.
---
Enjoy!
---
Really wish we could post photos here :(
---
Wait, legacy weapons are obtainable from the purveyor?
---
You're a 25% below averager
---
You can tell by inspecting it, no? They go into two different stacks. The only way I couldn't tell the difference was when I used to run lvl 3 Lead Belly.
---
I havent seen a sbq in weeks. Last one i saw i missed the party.
---
Same, when i was counting cost of all costumes i bought i was around 13k atoms few weeks ago. 600hours played. I think max player could have now from just playing is little over 15k.
---
You can get up to...more than 30..? 
---
Jesus I’m playing wrong
---
I can concur that I have, obsessionally, had issues with the game rendering enemies upon starting the game. In one instance, I was killed by an invisible enemy I only saw after it had been rendered postmortem... and no, it was a "swimming" ghoul.
---
Awesome! Thank you! xxJagMasterGxx Message me on Reddit when you are next on, I have a weird schedule. So it may be hard to work out a time.
---
500 charge is when the core is at double durability right? I don’t think it can go above that no matter how high the intelligence is I’ve never seen a triple or quad durability item.
---
I have invisible missile turrets.. Extremely annoying
---
Also figured out that if you convert your edited photos to PNG files, clean out your photo folder and replace them with your edited PNG files, it will display these for the loading screens... which is nice since I see that screen a lot.
---
It's the Unyielding sets that push it so high.
---
if you pickup you "cow" and replace it in camp it will let you milk it again
---
Oh. I have no idea. A regular crafted core is 100 isn't it?
---
I actually prefer some of Inan Zur's music to what's on the radio, especially if I'm experiencing certain content for the first time. It matches what's happening in the game, readies you for war, and creates a more immersive experience for me.
---
The ambient tracks are nice too, but sometimes I'll turn the music off altogether to just listen to environmental sound. It's peaceful sometimes, but it also helps if I need to hear something sneaking up on me. It's also cool how much stuff you can hear in the distance in this game.
---
If bethesda didn't fuk ap, this could be too. :D
---
I thought that was a given...  Mostly due to Bethesda Clinging to the Amazon CDN rather than rolling out their own servers.  Admittedly smart at the start for a game no one knew would work.
---
This is actually important...  Almost all the Limitations are based around that fact.  If you are going to have servers that hold no actual player data, and thus have to pass it along every time a player does something, you get Stash Limits, you get Player Limits...etc...
---
This and for the enclave bunker/ service entrance, please and thank you!
---
well, if it's a 3-star wooden armor, I would trade it right away and not wait to re-log.
---
This guy is right. I bought it, plan disapear upon using. So 8badges or too much caps for one plan.
---
THEY WANT THEIR ABRAXO CLEANER
---
I’m kind of hoping it keeps track of dailies that you do. I haven’t tried another yet but so far the only ones I have are Bic and the scouts on there
---
I'm pretty sure they tested out doing multiple people at venders and people figured out a way to dupe stuff with it.
---
Bare minimum. I want to *drain* that machine of every Scrip possible every day.
---
That would be ace id love to fish like in red dead 2   i could chill for ages fishin😉
---
Huh interesting. Thanks for the daily history lesson.
---
I am level 230? When there was Double XP week i could do 3levels per day. You don't need more, bcos what you spend 62 poins for? It is just infinite improving your build. I love that you can't switch whole build within one minute.
---
A standard full durability core is 250. The cores I craft are like 150 durability with only 10 int afer debuffs from marsupial. I get 360-380 ish rounds. At double durability, which I assume would be had at max intelligence, will max out at 500 rounds per core.
---
is that right? I wasnt aware of this if it's true. have they said that this wasn't something that could be simply fixed?
---
But then you'd have to be in your camp at your terminal just waiting..
---
Someone nuked Whitesprings today and there were about only 5 players there, all the rest busy at the purveyor, so got ton of legendary for once about 15, mostly one star but a few 2 and one 3. And some flux, made it easier for once. Was on Xbox.
---
This is unrelated.  The latest patch mentions th
---
Bgs fixing that specific daily
---
Won't you help this person even though you already got helped though? Pay it forward and such?
---
Happy cake day, btw.
---
I live in Japan. It's popular enough. Servers are always full of Japanese players if you're in the right timezone and right location as most of time, we will be assigned to the servers based in Tokyo for better performance
---
When Fallout 76 was released, there were ads everywhere. Shops had these big vault boy set up, ... But unfortunately, the game had the same fate as other countries. Japanese people also got mad with the poor quality of the game at its release. Today, you can buy it for $15 on Amazon and the power armor edition for like $90. 
---
Also, in Japan, we are still unable to buy atoms. So everything we want from the atom shop must be earned by grinding.
---
Oh how interesting. I didn't realize that. 
---
It's hard for me to tell on the durability because they stack with the older ones with less durability. So maybe they are maxed out at 46 int and I don't have to keep pushing it. Although I still want to lol. 
---
But on the ~350 charges it looks slightly less than halfway for the extra durability bar, so that seems about right.
---
Reverse the situation and people would call the Japanese racist and xenophobic.
---
yeah.. remarkable
---
Hahaha but thanks for your input anyway, so perhaps if you’re under level 50 you get a chance to receive level 1-50 Legendary gear? Possibly to prevent people from getting god rolls on low level items to sell to the market for shit tons of money. Low level legacies have been going for 15-20k as of late.
---
So if I find a great legendary fire axe I can’t use I can’t gift it to someone that can? That’ll never fly.
---
Her.
---
That seems like a bug. My cores only stack when they are in the same durability. If your cores are already at 500 charges while at 200% durability then there is no going any further.
---
Apparently, that's how it is in most mmos nowadays
---
I haven't even seen the word "Enclave" in the game yet. I'll look for that, and try those events.
---
I couldn’t even find an instrument to play at the Rusty Pick.
---
Demolition expert gives explosives a boost, I’m pretty sure that’s the one
---
It has to be a bug with the character then. Because im lvl 8 now and i legit dont have any extra cards. i only have the ones ive picked.
---
Also can we not do Damage to the cows? A lot of people with explosive weapons end up killing them all before the Sheepsquatch can come out the ground.
---
How do I unbug them?
---
They are just outside.
---
ESO gives a two hour cool down for trading dungeon weapons, that could maybe work?
---
nah, i like being well over 260 with things that go boom
---
Thanks a bunch do you happen to know which special ?!
---
Interesting, i have problem to sell bulk lead for anything over 30caps/each.
---
Yeah, was happening at enclave trader by having three terminals open, I thought they fixed that though
---
Yeah, demo expert in the intelligence tree.
---
Excuse my ignorance but, how do you get the damage that high?
---
Intelligence. you must be smart to maximize your blast power.
---
Glad someone in the know showed up was going to say perception
---
Eh. I wouldn't appreciate how much better the game is if I just got it now tbh. A lot of this stuff can very easily be taken for granted if not for the fact that you played for 400 hours without it
---
Here's a trick that's time consuming but quicker than doing it naturally.
---
Try to milk the Brahmin. If he says no, go into workshop mode and store it, then place it again. It resets the timer. I had to do it like 30 times but it was better than just going between mine and Flatwoods.
---
Not bad, just don't let the dupes get hold it or you'll be seeing it all over the place. E.g. Everyone seems to own the exact same 2 shot explosive handmade......
---
If I remember correctly, Bethesda once said spiders are a no-go for the sake of arachnophobic players (think about the reaction to frost spiders in Skyrim then multiply that by a factor of Snallygaster).
---
I regularly restart. It’s a bad habit I picked up in Skyrim. But if you mean about the first impression thing, eh, I joined 6 months ago, dropped it after two weeks, but have been back 2 months.
---
I sell toilet paper for 1 cap because I’m not a monster
---
IMO buying 1 star rolls is a horrible idea, 2 star rolls are Meh, but if you get a great 3 star roll you will feel like a king
---
Which shotgun? I've heard of this happening to wood armor and assaultron heads from the purveyor, and I even have a 2* assaultron head without a prefix to prove it now, but not for anything else
---
I recommend going to the Mothman Museum &amp; server hopping until the tourist spawns in front of the Mothman Statue.
---
that's how it used to be in the games, it'd tell you they can't pay and if you'd be ok with losing the difference.
---
Quad Severe Pump
---
And yes the other one was an assaultron head
---
Try over 1000 hours, but I feel you we will all be able to talk about the days where you would drop a nuke and get kicked from the server with no one to join back on!
---
Got a gatling plasma that's weights 1.6 and sentinal raider right arm. Spent about 900 script...
---
Yeah, but a bad roll and I’ll feel like an idiot. At least I have two chances with the two two-stars... right? It took a long time to get to 100 scrip for me.
---
Is there a difference in price between leather coat and traveling leather coat?
---
They should just let you set alerts yourself from the personal terminal thing, seems like it would be right up its alley
---
cram the bad roll into a scrip machine and get 40 back, better then getting 15 back for a 2\* trash roll, or 5 back for a 1\*
---
All the time. Normally takes like 30 seconds plus to load my base.
---
I spent 1000 on 10 3* but all were worse than I would pick up on an average whitesprings run boards colfclub bat etc
---
Interesting sales I've had so far include a Wedding Ring, an Old Ring, and random magazines...
---
There's not much lore on the mole miners in general. Was it the ultracite that mutated them? The radiation that seemed into the caverns? Did the shelter in place waiting for help, and help never came... and they just transformed? Did their breathers malfunction and cause them to be irradiated?
---
So many questions, and there's no real answers in any of the mines.
---
A griefer grieving? Wut..
---
Why dont you try the pvp mode? It has everything you are asking for
---
Oh that’s how it works? I’ve never scrapped a three-star before. Then maybe that is better.
---
Ikr man I am/was part of a incredibly feared Xbox faction the beach boys but now were pointless because theirs no pvp or grieving at all, the removal of base destructions in pve wasn’t my problem it’s that they ruined pvp in adventure and survival is so stupid because you never find anyone, I can camp whitespring station for a hour and only see 1 person who I’ll end up insta killing and they never come back
---
I was pretty sure I had the same issue and I'm honestly still not sure what's going on with it but I do definitely have more cards than I picked, even though I also think I saw stuff in the perk packs that I don't have. I'm close to a perk pack though so I'm gonna pay more attention to the next one and see if I can definitively tell what's going on one way or the other.
---
That doesn't even make sense
---
I sell mine at 3k. And they're not duped. I just end up with recipes that I don't care for. Rather have caps or a nice rifle :)
---
My girlfriend yelled at me too for it, she was appalled.
---
Lmao just enjoy it. Some people can’t handle loss.
---
It’s coming. I promise
---
Im just a week or so in and only 1 guy tried to shoot me. Everyone else drops a bag with water and stims. I did an event today and i was by far the lowest lvl player but 6 other people wanted to escort some brahmin. Was fun and with all the high lvl player was big xp for kills. I saved 1 guy with a stim when he went down so i fell like i contributed. Good times.
---
Totally, thoroughly, completely Jelly Belly at that weapon.  Congrats MG42 are awesome weapons!
---
I have to ask, which 2 pieces of Unyielding are you missing with +1 Intelligence?
---
That reminds me, I have to do some spring cleaning in my screenshots folder.
---
I got a 1\* Suppressor's pipe rifle today, so I am pretty excited I guess...
---
I have it and I'm pretty sure it's just the same as maxed out good with sat perk but without using up the perk slots. Also it can't be stacked with the actual perk.
---
If it was the Western Revolver,  I'd buy it right now.
---
damn i still cant find a place to build a salt extractor
---
Now I've had my fair share of havi ng my ass handed to me already but it just seems people freak out . I purposefully picked someone's lock just to get wanted. Its surprising how many people try to kill you for ten caps. And they end up losing 50 per death. I made like 600 caps off of players trying to kill me. Lol
---
What u/NoctD said, its insane when i first hit 50 and meandered over there to check out Whitesprings. I was content and really was enjoying myself.
---
seems easy to make your day
---
Yeah every now and then I'll get someone who drops me a few stims and water, the very first guy I ran into on PS4 "The010dad", he showed me the ropes a little within 5 minutes. Told me how to play and what I'll figure out on my own. Gave me weapons, stims, got me on my feet. As for the events, I killed a few ghouls and It helped us beat the event. Every little counts
---
Do what I did: 
---
Step 1: obtain a 10 cap bounty
---
Step 2: ?
---
Step 3: profit
---
I’m at about net right now. Occasionally I win, occasionally I lose. But I’m not salty about it. If I die twice to camping I just hop. Easy out, saves my caps. 🤷‍♂️
---
 His gripe is about survival mode. The camp change effected both modes.
---
You arnt doing 500 scripts in three hours.
---
people still trying to wear power armor like in fallout 3 and NV. its too bulky
---
Well, game crashed, so sorry if you didn't make it.
---
I like to think she’s the treasurer for the mole miners union. Mole miners really only protect their territory and stockpile resources. The union appointed her to clear inventory now that it has value, in exchange for scrip for their economy.
---
Great thanks
---
Reminds me of people complaining about getting killed by players on a PvP WoW server. The standard response was 'PvP happened on a PvP server'
---
hah someone downvoted you just for that comment.
---
Some advice... Do not live life worrying about these freakheads on reddit downvoting you to the point it controls what you say.  Or in life.  They want control.  They can not have it.
---
If they get too salty they might get your ip address and than your fkd!
---
This person lost 70 pounds with this one easy trick. Doctors hate him!
---
I would like my camp to be able to be destroyed also
---
I like defending my camp when I'm on the leader board, makes it pointless now
---
Yeaaah. Thanks. 
---
Warning people isn’t a crime though.
---
you know this game is pretty open for people to roleplay and do some shits with rare weapons, not necesary 3 star legendaries...
---
i sold like 49 plasma core to a guy and make like 5k, so we know that plasma isn't the hot weapon around apallachia but there is always some dude that would make some good use of the things you don't want. Last weak someone bought my old arpoon and ammo for a weapon that i didn't use not even once.
---
Someone mentioned phrma farmer perk and i swear by it so far. Make sure you actually search the container... That took a bit to figure out. But chems sell prettt well and has been keeping me around 500. Not much but i dont sweat the fast travel and can buy a few plans while im out.
---
At least a discount for an atom shop purchased camp space... like the valtec armor bench would use half as much space in storage as a regular armor bench...
---
Yeah I see way less, got a couple of queen runs but no whitesprings runs in a while. The recent times I've nuked whitesprings I got no legendary spawns so I just do regular WS loops and westek or certain events.
---
Tbh I think it's helped, spend way to long fighting gouls and it's so boring.
---
lol wtf is cake day
---
They are “Radroaches”-new race of superinteligent being, using telekinetic as they see fit😉
---
i got a wood chest with 50% reduce fall damages and some resistances while full health, wood bros unite!
---
I get you and yes getting a 3\* shovel and 3\* wood armour it does sucks, but I am ok with it and I also think ppl had thier expectations too high. I think it a win win, legends that we just sold for caps can actually be used for something, and it still faster to get a 3\* out off the vendor than it is to find a 3\* enemie that will actually drop a 3\*. It would also make no sense for logevity purpose to give a god roll to everyone that uses the vendor. 
---
I for one love the fact that now farming legendaries got a hole lot better, and I hope BGS doesnt make it works with a nerf.
---
That's not how woooosh works.
---
Hey man, I don’t think it’s what you were after sorry. It’s a furious ultracite Gatling laser with bash damage and perception.
---
definitely let me know. I have a conveniently level 76 character and i dont remember having the problem on him. But now i open a pack only to have the card i just picked available. none from the pack. Its really turning me off on a replay.
---
Yeah, Fallout 4 had a placeable fast travel marker in the form of a door mat, I had expected something like this to be a part of FO76's system too.
---
What a stupid idea.
---
pssst i got some flamer for ya kiddo
---
i closed the game already but i can tell you tomorrow xd
---
If you want a hardcore fallout online experience, you can try the FOnline clients. They're heavily modified versions of fallout 2, and all of them have virtually no restrictions to PvP. They are also more hardcore survival games in general, you need very high stats to run some dungeons and many encounters are simply impossible to solo without perfect luck + a min-max build. Just as an example, an enclave patrol can have a squad of heavily armed and armored troops with twice as much health as your character does. Oh, and you lose EVERYTHING you have on you when you die, including your guns and armor.
---
Pretty bad drops for me.  BSG must hate half their player base.
---
I’m a fan of the changes to Adventure Mode, but I agree that they shouldn’t have extended to Survival. 
---
At this point I think Adventure is probably where it should be. 
---
Survival should at the very least leave you the ability to destroy hostile turrets. I’d also like to see the cap limit bumped to 100 and a more creative way to show/not show people on the map—something like a heat map, showing where activity is but not necessarily exact player positions.
---
it was a copypasta and you thought it was real. thats what a woosh is.
---
Whelp, I got a Troubleshooter’s Pipe Bolt-Action Pistol with +30% damage to robots, criticals do +50% damage, and 90% reduced weight.
---
Not great, I’ll keep grinding I guess haha
---
just buy the 100 ones, believe!
---
All you need to do is wait for the stutter of the spinning item thats current to become a smother animation. Its about a 5 to 10 second wait.
---
Take all the time you need to read my comment very, very slowly. It's 5 letters long.
---
I would agree with you, except for the fact that the entire endgame of FO76 is grinding for good legendary loot. 
---
The way you stated has a major problem, that being far to limiting of choices. If after days of grinding legendaries and you don't get any you want to use yourself or hold on to for later, that leaves you with only three (not great) options; sell them to robot vendors so cheaply it's not even really worth dragging (and yes I mean dragging because of all the inventory space taken up to store them) the items to them.. OR sell them in your own vendor and hope that someone someday wants to buy it, which means it's still taking up space while you are waiting to get rid of it.. OR simply drop them on the ground. If I have 20 legendaries taking up all my inventory and stash space I shouldn't have to choose between selling them for next to nothing, dropping them, or giving them away. If I want to I should be able to trade them all in so I can free up storage space and have a chance to gain something after all the grinding to get those legendaries instead of being left empty handed after all that time and effort just to get some storage space.
---
There's never really been any incentive to sell legendaries to NPC vendors anyways other than to clear space, as they give you next to no caps for them. If I spend an entire day grinding legendaries and get nothing but dozens and dozens of shit 1*s, why can't I trade them all in for scrip and try my luck at getting one decent 3*? Why do I have to have that restriction placed on me so that newer players have a chance to benefit off my bad luck? If you get a decent legendary from an NPC vendor that some player sold to it and that helps get you further in the game, go for it that's great, but I shouldn't be limited on what I can do with MY items so that you have a chance to benefit from when I'm forced to get rid of stuff just so I can run again.
---
Yeah, that one and the salt one. So food last longer. My only problem is I'm partially a hoarder and my carry limit is 160, so I find myself going back and forth a lot. I'm currently at 530 caps which isn't too bad but Im realizing how hard it is to get really up there with caps
---
Scrip is much less common than script. I'd imagine a lot of people are being auto corrected.
---
Thanks!
---
Good advice.  I don't have luck with this vendor (at least today).  Wonder if a legendary friendly server would increase the chance of a better drop.  The server I was on this morning was a crappy legendary server. Should have waited and hit a loot server tonight.  I'll try it tommorrow.
---
i do understand what you are saying, but it wouldnt make any sense for them to give us what we want from the first try. this is not burger king where you get it your way, its a business and like every other type off game like FO76 is based on longevity.
---
I also do not agree with the 150 scrips cap but I fully understand why they did it.  longevity and to make us have/want to login every day. 
---
also your post its in the line off a me me me me post just saying.
---
i sold an single action revolver grip for 10k but bro .. thats free gas for life ..... LIFE MANG!!! know how much lewtz that'll save you!? id kill and eat the guy for that wonderful parchment
---
I agree to an extent... If they started everyone out as a new character and not let anything move over to new servers things would be a lot different but they didn’t do that.
---
Survival would and or should mean survival... no safe return to the other server to farm stuff... survive or die. Again, they didn’t do that. 
---
I can see factions getting together for survival which would help out each factions group... maybe that’s in the works...
---
This needs more upvotes
---
With over 300 up in mine, I feel your pain.
---
Needs a 5.56 conversion tbh.
---
Use xcel before you click, it will increase your chances,
---
Beer, then Photography.
---
I wonder what the devs' next kick will be.
---
There are some good 2* out there. If you get a type of weapon that you like with only 2 good perks, it's better than having a 3* with garbage perks...
---
Wouldn’t know try dropping them all and picking them all back up. Maybe it will properly sort them by durability on pickup.
---
oh you have problems dealing with loading times?
---
i present you Mr. "i fast travel to whitesprings just to walk 10 steps and get another loading screen"
---
rose is innocent! all hail raiders!
---
People are always friendly when they aren't getting stomped!
---
I just tried it, the damage did increased both when I having rifle and pistol perks, now it's almost better than my two shot lever action since it just literally always hit xD
---
Thinking the same, ESO also has bond on equip so I could see that working.
---
i would but im on PC .. [but ima leave this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9kf0ZvWMZw) to help you recruit should attract some winners ... plus might help attract a cackle or 2 of females
---
Level 91 ones or lower levelled ones?
---
Sorry, I was replying to "the zoom function is pretty pointless" to say that the zoom is supposed to change after upgrading to the 105mm lens. 
---
Totally unrelated to the disappearing legendary star bug which is lame &amp; hopefully has been submitted in a formal bug report and will get patched.
---
Bunker changed to only one can use it not 3-4 anymore...
---
Incenerator from 3? It was such a beast. Nerfed hard in NV though.
---
If you've ever played Ark, you'll know that this is not a good idea. I'm a builder, so I would LOVE more space... but the game already has trouble with crashing and rendering the buildings that are supposed to be there. Giving us more space will make it even worse. Right now, both my boyfriend and I have to spend a few minutes every time we log on watching our bases load in one piece at a time. There's really no need to have a castle sized building....build smarter, not bigger. Replace old things with new things. Bethesda has no obligation to make it so that we can place absolutely everything they put out in our camps.
---
&gt;  It would be awesome if they kept her voice actress around to record tidbits every now and then when new content comes out
---
don't worry they had that voice actress in tied in the basement or something bc she does a lot of voices every new events, from kids, women, grandma's the latest is the robot that tell you stories in the campfire.
---
I despise these things. I will go out of my way to kill them, wish it tracked individual enemie kills so I could see the damage I've done to thier population.
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I always try to "tip" people who I think have extra cool camps via buying something from their vending machines (assuming they have something affordable enough).
---
&gt; people don’t expect BGS to ever get their shit together 
---
I sure don't.   They have proven over and over they are clueless, talentless, and tedious.
---
I mean I usually play survival solo, so when I get on the leader board it's a lot of fun to stay in my camp and use traps and my base to defend myself. It's griefers or hunters can't get in because they aren't able to destroy it they won't even try. Changes the whole game up for me
---
oh poopy, i replied to the wrong person.
---
brb gonna woosh the other person
---
Why is there just one vendor.  Why can't multiple people interact with an NPC.  Bethesda should be addressing that because you will always get an asshat in a multiplayer game.
---
&gt; if it hits.
---
^ big if
---
Unless you see the list of all potential events and select ones that you wish to get notifications for.
---
Put in a ticket for a refund. 250 points is worth getting back for 2 minutes of effort
---
&gt;Can be solo'd? Not when I've tried it.
---
Yes. He's just a big bullet sponge.
---
That fan is near identical. Is that all metal or some 3d print?
---
Not any more, they fixed it. Its *similar* to the *laser musket* in Fo4 in that you can keep reloading/charging it (up to a max of 5 charges) to get more damage (maybe normal dmg x 5?) from a single shot. The quad version has up to 20 charges. It takes ages to load all 20, but the damage is obscene, I oneshot a level 80 scorchbeast with a sneak attack when it flew close by :)
---
I think mine was too, TBH.  I got two other quad weapons: a radium rifle and an ultracite laser pistol.  I remember being a little taken aback by seeing three quad weapons in a row, which is probably why I didn't think anything at all about seeing a legendary assaultron head.  I got word back from Bethesda Support and they don't have the tools to 'fix' these oddball weapons or reimburse us, but they'll be working to make sure we don't get ripped off again in the future.  So yeah, these will probably be called legacy legendary assaultron heads someday.  
---
I really wish I had tried out the assaultron head when it was still 'quad' to see what would happen.  Would it charge 4x as many times, or would it fire 4x for each charge?  Or would the game just crash?
---
Nope.  Not the answer.  The same or more trolls would sit there engaging in pvp.  Bethesda should be solving this not the players of their game.
---
Up by the crashed space station is good area for lead.
---
Damn, didn’t know that. I’ll do it next time.
---
she isnt working fine as is. there are weapons and armor that when you log off and back on or switch worlds the weapon goes from a 3 star to 1 or 2 star. there is also an issue where you are unable to get sturdy or heavy combat armor left arm i think it was along with some missing weapons that should really be on there and arent.
---
I am soloing this event numerous time, I don't see what the issue is...?
---
besides, it pops very often, this would be a bit spammy to get a notification...
---
Since players who use vats are wussies who can't shoot you are probably stretching it to get 500 caps.
---
There was no survival. It was just death
---
I get asked a lot over microphone and messages how I’m doing it or if I’m hacking. Sadly it’s nothing exciting, I was just really careful to pick every perk card I could that increased DR or increased rad resistance. Then, I only do the SBQ very rarely and only when I have a metric fuck ton of rad away and basically just constantly spam rad away and die a lot.
---
Projectile spread when ADSing affects all weapon, but often it's too small to see easily. Pretty clear with a two-shot black powder weapon though. The ADS spread is a fractional multiple (dependent on the sight) of the hipfire spread, so improving hipfire spread improves ADS spread too, and two-shot is far worse than normal weapons for both.
---
Shotguns drop to a lower damage value (10%) than most weapons when out of range. I'm not sure if that's a minimum at the end of a falloff slope, or immediately after the range value.
---
Aluminum and lead (I think) are the only 2 junk items that actually get lighter when you bulk them.
---
All the other weight reduction that you see is just the space from the plastic that you used to bulk them.
---
I tried it and I bought all 3* armor, got all pieces of forest scout armor but one was urban. Also got a Marine and heavy combat 3* as well.
---
Why?
---
u sure? cause my stash got hella lighter when i bulked everything
---
You roll the dice and hope for something good. Only choices are weapons or armor. And how many stars. 100 scrip for a 3 star.
---
Unless it was changed without them adding any notes, 100% sure.
---
Wait what?
---
F nvm then
---
That's... kinda sad really.
---
Found a teddy bear in a cowboy hat riding  Giddyup Buttercup on the backside of Warwick Homestead, if I recall. I really want to find this tea party everyone here is talking about, LOL.
---
For now. Man wouldn’t that be some shit if they could fly in Fallout five. It’s bad enough and chaos ensues when one of those fuckers takes flight in real life, imagine being in a bathroom with a radroach  that could that could fly and were hard to hit in flight.
---
Hmm, place your bet. Average you get 5legendaries per serverhop at whitespring. 20server hops for average 500scrips, Thats doable in 3hours. 
---
Also my daily playtime is average. Sometimes i don't play at all, some weekends 16hours a day.
---
Stop I can only get so erect!
---
What platform? If PS4 feel free to add xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero)
---
I would gladly pay 3k/per given that I have all of 0 of them
---
I think it's fine, personally. An increase would be nice for sure, but it seems wholly unnecessary. Free legendary loot for crap you would've tossed otherwise. If you are really hurting for it, get a friend to help you mule some to an different character and do it there too.
---
[Now cue the "i have no friends and play alone."](/spoiler)
---
The legendary vendor seems to be dropping stuff that never dropped before: Legendary ultracite gatlings &amp; scout armor, 3-star wood and assaultron heads. They don't necessarily exist for very long though.
---
Its because you used up alot of plastic
---
I have a ton of outfits and I'm happy to pose with Rose, or at Vault 76, so peeps get pics.
---
If only there was some way to let you guys know server wide...
---
It would boof most builds to have that. Because most have to have ow sight
---
Which would make perception a guaranteed 8. Instead of 3.
---
I would play this Survival
---
Make it 10. Only range builds can get it.
---
I feel your pain on a spiritual level my friend
---
Explosive is not that good with a snipe tho...
---
I also don't really get the fuzz with explosives legendaries, as if they  would be the absolute power, (but they are not...).
---
To add to what the others have said... If I'm at a vendor and sell it a 3 star legendary, someone else can now buy that legendary.... if 3 people can access a vendor at once and they all want that legendary I just sold, what now? If 2 people click 'buy' at the exact same time, who gets it? Or does it duplicate? Either way, causes problems for the game.
---
Looking into doesn't become a refund. Best you will get is a sorry about your luck.
---
I support this message.
---
Ah, I see the issue. Still, they should maybe put a timer on people using the vendors or something to avoid *those* people from hogging important vendors.
---
Ive gotten this as well
---
Only go for 2 star range weapons. That last star is usually garbage anyway
---
Maybe in 2020..Election year.
---
This is a fantastic idea,  and when other players are close to you they have -2 luck or something lol
---
yes it is it have usually exit 2 times for it to actually do it.
---
Ive heard of ass hat, butt head, etc. Ass head feels new to me. I like it.
---
My wife walked in on me getting the business from Fisto
---
This would be the best Option i think
---
I don't see how you can say she doesn't have the weapon at all  because it didn't drop for you on the first day.
---
I saw 3 simultaneous nukes last night, 2on fissure prime and one on Whitesprings.
---
i as well
---
Nothing at all.  Just give them to me so I can properly dispose of them for you.
---
Yeah cus it’s totally lame to use a game mechanic for its intended purpose
---
Yeah same here.  Can't think of a single three star weapon I have where the third star isn't expendable.
---
You are being VERY generous on all points.  
---
I think 150 per day is doable in three hours for a no lifer who knows exactly what to do.
---
not an issue of actual amount, more like my incredibly obsessive self being driven up the wall and back by not having the numbers that are divisible by a fairly high common denominator.
---
It can also be 1200 max carry and 160 daily gain for all I care. Since the daily gain will still be divisible by the highest possible trade in and the max carry is divisible by both 60 and 100
---
Yeah I agree.  Everyone bitched about it until it was made baby proof. Probably a bunch of minecraft queers.
---
Hey, you could have received a Ghoul Slayer’s gamma gun.
---
Sometimes it's less about being obstinate for its own sake and more about previous bad experiences. I'll hop on a mic and game with teenage guys but many of my female friends will not. They prefer using male characters and not outing themselves because they've experienced harassment in other games. And the emotes are pretty limited and there isn't a good text chat option... :/
---
PC unfortunately 😕
---
I'll give you everything I have for it.
---
Fuck the brahmin
---
Trade you for it m8 have a few options for you
---
And all I got is a fork.
---
Yeah cause no one want be a trader or sell items in their vending machines.
---
Then become the dirt I walk on
---
They shouldn’t even have passive mode in survival, wasn’t the whole point of survival to be a PvP mode?
---
Seriously. And it seems to happen more often on certain items.  Like the wooden gate in defenses.  I was trying to build a a closed off area for my farm and the only thing that wont place is the gate.  I can put the straight fence to close it off but just the gate says item is intersecting.
---
Well that's what I was afraid of, which is why I made this thread, politely asking them not to nerf it lol.
---
Fuck the dirt you walk on
---
As my good friend insult bot would say "insult package delivered"
---
Late reply but there are often plenty of ticks at Mosstown which is right next to a fissure. Get the scorchbeast to attack and you'll have DIY scorched ticks.
---
Yeah, I have a VATS-heavy character so I often just periodically hit RB to scan for enemies... but also, the whole point of having a high perception build is supposed to be perceiving them on radar.
---
It does seem to work sometimes in stealth mode but other times goes from nothing to danger in a flash... and I have maxed out stealth perks &amp; stealth armor vs PA
---
Since the last patch it is impossible to place slanted walls on half walls at ground level. If you can avoid it.....
---
Even in 1700's lol? You mean those famous 1700s when last irl nuclear war was? Or why the heck you talking about those years?
---
Yerr man, do you really believe that you would build fancy house with shiny floors and perfectly painted walls after the whole world been destroyed? 
---
It's Bethesdas fault that they've beed adding silly pre-war like items in atomic shop from the beginning of release, they've made a joke out of this game.
---
For those of us who don’t play GTA, can you elaborate?
---
Use my spreadsheet to figure out which mods you have left that you don't already know that can be unlocked by scrapping first. It will take some time at the workbench to figure it out, but will save you lots when you've already learned all the mods for a weapon or armor that you can by scrapping.
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/
---
How do you know shotguns drop to a lower value when out of range?
---
Agreed.  Maybe she needs her daily fix?  Something to bring her chems?  You'd think she would have stuff similar to Biv's quests.
---
As a lower level player who was new to the game, I avoided travelling to the cranberry bog because I was afraid high level enemies might swarm me. So you could try testing a location closer to newer players...
---
That's why I thought they made two different modes. I'm disappointed for sure
---
so what your saying is that it would actually be faster to farm for the 3\* legendary you want than to try your luck with the vendor, lol 
---
also the vendor is not a burger king that you can have it your way. 
---
you go ahead keep on farming for your unicorn, and I will gladly try my luck with the vendor.
---
They had them in B.E.T.A. but removed them.
---
This is very out of character, Clayton. Fyi
---
I was so excited to get a pipe revolver or ultracite gatling laser. Got neither of those, but my drops were pretty good so I can't really complain. I just really wish they added them into the regular legendary drop pool, but I have yet to see any confirmed drops so I guess they're not in
---
Lol!!!
---
You went into survival and got murdered? I'm SHOCKED.
---
Are mole miners people who turned into mole like creatures?
---
Or moles who turned into people like creatures?
---
Yeah so many questions =,=
---
Never buy if you've emptied the scrip machine,  recycle your wood immediately.
---
Nope., Your duping ass is still banned. You have to start alll over again. Technically, you're ban evading and this new account also deserves a ban.
---
2 things or maybe 2 mistakes you made,
---
1) what did you think it was going to happened in survival, you can read here every day atleast 10 post on how bad it is.
---
2) you are playing in survival at lvl 16 everyone and thier mama would see you as easy traget to kill. 
---
maybe you shuold just stay in adventure until you get better equipment/perks.
---
Datamining.
---
Me. Too. :p
---
But sometimes it’s a little ridiculous.
---
Like when a dude has a tse mini gun and he literally shoots my cabin in HALF. 
---
I have a lvl 10 pipe revolver rifle. Ahahahahaha
---
Wait pipe revolvers are rare as legendaries?
---
Ricky in a storm drain
---
Nah. I come here to birch about times like this, but a majority of the time I am able to wander and wave at people soon enough to pass by. 20% exp bonus is nice too.
---
The whole clipping and snapping is screwed up. I have issues just building walls/floor where I keep getting intersecting/floating areas and it's literally just floor and walls.
---
I would say give it a try. It's in a much different game state than when it released. It's still buggy (Bethesda norm though) but it keeps sucking me back in each time I  turn on my PS4
---
Yea I'm a dataminer. I know the entire loot pool and even what weapons can get what legendary stats
---
Think purveyor only so far
---
nope. you're fucked. 
---
duping was totally worth it, huh?
---
Just do it.
---
I will literally blow you thank you please update if you find more
---
Maybe don't play on survival if you're against being repeatedly murdered by level 300 toons with high level gear?
---
I didn't try melee but on all ranged weapon 3* i did had by memory: .50 mg(junkie), .50mg(mutant), Auto grenade (Junkie), 2 assaultron head( i don't remember what they did), instigating plasma gun, nocturnal missile launcher then in armor got cloaking metal, and raider vanguard if i remember correctly, after second and third effect were soso like 1+ perception, 25% vats cost  no fancy explosing bullet here...

this has been known since beta.

Alternatively, allow us to use the Harpoon Gun for...larger catches. There are probably some monster catches in the Mire.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm saying we're prioritizing different things. Power armor has its uses yes, and power armor makes heavy weapons better, yes, but there's just too much utility being left on the table. Carrying around all that ammo gives me another form of currency when trading, because odds are I've got ammo you want. 
---
Oh, and junkie has been buffed since 4, its somewhere between 8-10% per addiction, capped at 5. Best combo I've found is mentat, day tripper, daddy-o, alcohol and buffout.
---
First thing I do is crouch (stealth build) back up (so I'm not trapped in the foundation) and wait for the load in.
---
Lol why? It’s a small part of the experience. It’s obscene. And makes me stop playing.
---
But that’s usually after a few hours of normal experiences.
---
It only existed in the legendary vendor, I actually got one luckily, it's one of my currently using gun atm
---
What are her system specs.
---
Just place them last.
---
I feel that. I got one that was 30 percent more damage to robots, increased bashing and plus one Agi. Then again, got two semi alright heavy weapons before hand so eh
---
&gt; Take a junk shit
---
Lol  My new favorite in-game jargon.
---
They finally ended that in the last patch. Now they have to be in the workshop zone.
---
*woooosh*
---
Huh. I got a bloodied pipe revolver. I don't use bloodied though
---
People would rather have that one star wooden left leg than the recipes and mods from the event reward.
---
I've got the fridge mod and I have to say it\`s the perfect choice for me at least, I like to hoard cooked meat. It reduces the spoil rate by 60%, and as far as I saw, it includes flux. I had spare raw flux for a good deal of hours  before I managed to drink it all, and it did not go below 50% ish "durability" in that time. But keep in mind as you asked "never spoils" - it does spoil but a lot harder than it used to. If you don\`t need the luck points, use 90% good with salt and just get the carry weight upgrade, to keep more flux :)
---
Soooo, that's why my stealth damage not always same. Damn.
---
Only lead and aluminium are lighter in weight when bulked. The rest is just burning plastic...wouldn't recomment that. Smells bad man.
---
It's ridiculous. Like I get it, ooo legendary but you'd get better rewards if you kept all the brahmin alive!
---
I thought we didnt. First time I solo the event I used my TSE rifle to fight wolves because of the amount of them. After I killed them I thought can I accidentally kill the brahmin? And unloaded a dozen or so shots into one and the bar didn't seem to move.
---
i’m now realizing the L i have taken
---
Just so you know chems dont stack. Whichever chem you used last is the active one. Food is the only thing that stacks different effects I believe. Check your effects screen in the pipboy to be sure.
---
That's a lot of cans
---
Check your other weapons by 'examining' them...to see the details, image enlarged etc.
---
Yesterday I thought one of my weapons disappeared but what happened was the name was changed to duplicate another weapon I had....when I realized I don't really have two explosive combat shotguns I started comparing and there the missing weapon was....wrong name but still there...
---
Hmm when i will have time for playing i will make video then.
---
Would be nice, or the ability to make perk card loadouts so you can switch between them.
---
What are those icons on left to its name?
---
Even so, I feel like with the purveyor multiple people should be able to talk to her. It's not like she has items we buy with caps that everyone are able to also see.
---
It's the icons mod. Helps you sort things at a glance without all of the lengthy default names. It's automatic btw.
---

Yeah few minutes at whitespring. Diablo was good at this rng grindfest. Fallout is more like mobile game, waiting for energy to be able to play.
---
Yes. 100% have had this happen about a dozen times.
---
Exterminator's weapon, Exterminator/Glow Sight perk, sneak attacks as long as possible.
---
My teammate has been diligently searching servers for two weeks and doesn’t have one. If that guy hadn’t just been laying on the hood of the car at Whitesprings I wouldn’t have one either. It shouldn’t be so hard to find with all the things we’re expected to use it to accomplish.
---
 [Yeaaaa they are guuud. Only few lbs in vending machine, much betta than fkin heavy weapons.](https://scontent-prg1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/60173561_2433410866689373_8096221615924183040_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-prg1-1.xx&amp;oh=d5820a3fceaba3af3241c5dc89f2a7e0&amp;oe=5D67E4A9)

Fallout Shelter 76

&gt; Within 60 seconds of starting my game I opened my map found an event. Killed 2 Scorchbeasts, 1 Sheepsquach, and dozens of scorched. Leveled in less than 10 minutes and didn't even have time to start a group for 15% extra exp.

Where exactly are you getting your serum recipes from that you can afford to sell at 3k?
---
Max level Vampire's Gatling Gun with 10% damage while aiming, which I myself dropped accidentally and could fast travel back to find it untaken.
---
Dude, I'd love the opportunity to purchase or trade with you for that aae .50 Cal.
---
What? on GTA if you are in passive mode, you are immortal to other players. In fallout if you are in passive mode other players are immortal for you. There is fucking 2089441% difference.
---
I started the event,people came, and nobody wanted to take the pylons, so I took 2 which ate at my stimpaks the whole time. I ended up dying right as we killed the sheepsquatch and some guy took all my junk. I messaged him if I could have it back and he said “git good” wow.
---
That would be quite useful. On couple occasions I have failed Free Range couse I was on my own with to many monsters attacking brahmin. Shame though. There are two spots, that I know off, where Free Range is triggered once You show. One is Big Fred’s BBQ Shaq and the other is Southern Belle Motel.
---
Can’t you keep them alive yourself? What you gonna do if no one joins? If they focus on the ss then you can kill the bugs or whatever attack the bramin. Do it quick and get a hit on the legendary before it dies.
---
He looks like Spongebob's bully.
---
Now i want mr.handy in my camp, and sex with other dwellers to make more of us.
---
Hahaha hell yes
---
Can't do it by myself. As of right now I can't do enough damage. Plus, why should I be the only one handling the bugs while the rest of people shoot the ss? It's a team effort everyone should be helping on both sides. Also if I was alone, I wouldn't do the event in the first place
---
If it was that big of an issue I'd just server hop. But I havnt even seen anyone at the legendary vender all day.
---
No it's not, even when it's the 10th or 20th warning posted in the past roughly 12 hours.
---
Delete this! Don't tell bethesda you enjoy this, don't be selfish OK?! :D
---
Not true. You become a tadpole to start. Getting the backpack isn't a rite of passage for a pioneer scout. It's a reward. You become a possum once you finish the tadpole quests/challenges.
---
And a functioning Nuka Cola plant..
---
Every.time!

There has been a lot of QOL updates and additional content. Stash space has been increased. All the disconnects have been solved and only ever happen occasionally maybe once a month for me and I play every day for at least an hr at a time.  Player vending really gives players a way to socialize and a fun way to play the game as a vendor. Things like over powered weapons have been toned down while weaker weapons like energy and plasma guns have been buffed.  New events and quests have been added more plans for camp items.  Vendor inventories have been improved with weapon mod plans and have a larger cap pool. Just so many improvements and updates. And now with the legendary vendor grinding for that perfect weapon or armor set has been made so much easier and with the vending machines. It’s hard to not find something  you like that fits your play style.
---
SBQ. I'm a trader, so caps are no big deal. Also, 3k is very standard with today's market. Anymore than 3k you're getting ripped off. I see traders sell for 1-2k all the time.
---
K I'll try for a few hours. Add me. steelyDanger
---
Damn son. Hardcore.
---
💀💀💀💀💀Im Dead 😂😂😂😂
---
I dunno, I saved 500 odd scrip and got some decent weapons out of it. I didn't feel it was unrewarding for the effort, all the stuff I have found in trying to obtain another 3* star weapon  I converted into that scrip which gave me a guaranteed 3* drop to keep, barter with or convert to scrip again. Better than killing a 3* legendary and finding sod all but regular junk items. The daily limit allows you to get one 3* weapon roll and a couple of lower * rolls if you insist on spending your scrip, that's better odds of scoring a 3* than many players have in a week or longer. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
But that flamer helped me through Vault 22.
---
Roll up on a group of plants?  Burn it.  Easiest vault run I did in NV.
---
Make me an offer
---
I see these all day long ranging from 100c to 5000c. In reality it's worth the scrap it's made of. You can get one free if you know the spawn, same goes for the plans and ammo for it. Granted you wont stack up thousands of AB rounds quickly, you can still get 30ish a day. Also it is a very weak gun compared to older fallout series. 
---
Long story short, it's not worth much to ME. I can't speak for everyone however.
---
I agree so so much. We can track progress on challenges. I want to track events so we know when they are able to be triggered or trigger on their own. I think a lot more people would join if they got notified of them.
---
They are the wasteland spy set up by a secret government
---
Camp turret AI has to be the worst AI in the game, they are even more blind than ghouls when it comes to spotting targets. The patch that supposedly fixed the range on the turrets has done nothing in terms of improving them; they are still bugged on the range and enemy AI has pretty much infinite range as long as they have just a sliver of line of sight. Turrets should be able to detect enemies moving nearby without relying on getting damaged from close range before the AI targets them; never seen AI this bad in Fallout.
---
Found one in a green footlocker at Fort Defiance, 4th floor.
---
I think the OP meant legendary enemies, not legendary items.
---
Yes this is the first day she's been here, we had a week to stock on scrip it's only natural you'll have an abundant amount of scrip for her today. But after today I'm positive everyone is back to 0 or at least 100. But from here on we have to wait a full 24 hours to get 150 scrip that will quickly be used. Think about it that way. :)
---
Also the story has always been good if you prefer the method of environmental story telling. If you like npcs to talk to and give quests you will be happy to know they have added three new robot npcs that you can talk to for quests hat also can give you daily relatable quests.
---
Thanks adding now
---
In my head i see all I see are  the 3 eyed fish from that one simpsons episode
---
Yeah my GF got a TSE pipe revolver this morning I'm really jealous.
---
Feels like people missed the point of your message, ie if you bulk a ton of stuff, don’t forget it goes in your characters inventory, not the stash. 70lbs? Ouch!
---
LMFAO I want that 🤣
---
I had this problem when I was using explosives and shotguns as my main ways to damage her. I received a lot of anecdotal advice telling me these weapons don’t work for tagging the queen, for whatever reason. I was also told that I wasn’t doing enough damage. Either way, I swapped to a random Gatling gun with no perks, and it worked. I now get loot every time. 
---
Not sure if that will work for you, but try out a different weapon type if you’re shotguns/explosives. And if that doesn’t work, try to not shoot her until you’re fully loaded in, if you’re warping in midway. Other than that... good luck.
---
Nobody's ever suggested this before.
---
If on xbone I can scope/grip/ammo type mode for you for a low low price of 5mm ammo
---
I agree I always kill the bugs firsts. Then switch my attention to the squatch. Of course my Explosive Gatling plasma deletes the enemies from the game within a few shots so the bugs never stand a chance. If you were a melee build and the only one defending the cows your going to have a bad time for sure lol.
---
I roll with an one star Instigating plasma rifle, with prime receiver. With maxed out rifleman perks (perception) and the 2.5x sneak attack perk it does pretty good damage as long as the target has full health. It does around 170 damage without adding the Instigating and sneak calculations.
---
Well he's just roleplaying that he is a victim of the horseman armor he is wearing right now
---
I still think the prize should kick off a quest for a plan to build a new car as a camp item.
---
Ive got a 2 for 20k fire sale going on.
---
Ope. Imma just head out.
---
Yup!
---
I wish the beta had been extended further than what it was.  Like a year or so.
---
I have a diverse selection of weapons. Idk what decision your going with ur build but I'll start with 8k caps.
---
Whats your price point? Sounds like you found a middle ground
---
I got a three star Flamethrower with better reload, scorch dmg, and better crit dmg. yay ;-; also now im broke now.
---
And also, molerat brood mothers. She burst into my home earlier this evening and now her corpse is stinking up my crafting room. 😒
---
Place 1 at your camp then milk it. Scrap or save it, then replace and milk it again.
---
Yess they made “fixes” to help us place things directly on the ground but they actually just broke it more. OF COURSE.
---
Yes! I have made like 5 frog jars trying to get it to work. No luck.
---
I am in Japan. I can buy atom anytime in Xbox.You buy Xbox too ?
---
Just ran across it, but think I did both ways west - east and east - west. Don’t remember which triggered it.
---
I switched back to riflemen build. As far as caps, I payed 15k for this piece and I'd want to turn a small profit if I were to let it go. 16k and it's yours.
---
It's a reddit anniversary. See the little cake next to your name? It will be gone tomorrow.
---
Ya they didnt have 3 star before purveyor now its glitching out
---
pretty sure i have it, but i’m on PS4 :/
---
Yup, tons of posts on here all day. Wood armor and assaultron heads seem to be affected
---
What is it used for?
---
Im on PS :(
---
I'm a heavy guns build but I'm only level 35 so I can't do as much damage to most of the enemies
---
How much do you want for it
---
The way I see it, you still have to do something to earn those legendaries. If they handed to you on a silver plater then what is the point? You have a choice, spend your daily allowance or save it up. Basic finances. 
---
Yeah I'm nowhere near what I had before but my teammates and friends have all their scrip. We know more or less what we have preference for so we trade our finds. I'm giving priority to them before I sell or scrip the ones I don't want. That's going to happen in the game off the back of the introduction especially with player vending on.
---
I dunno, what more do you want? They've given a better route to some top tier and high tier weapons and armour by turning in unwanted ones. It's a pretty good system.
---
That came in mind, but not really. In crafted gear I have done SBQ 4 times in a hour, in legendary gear I have done 1 or 2  SBQ in hour. Same is with all these legendary locations- The damage is irrelevant. I can have BiS gear and that wouldn't matter, because first I need to beat RnG and RnG doesn't give a sh#t if you got crafted gear or BiS.
---
and this has upset you enough you are leaving?
---
Russian users join Japanese this time!
---
Think I might have the uniform, I will check now.
---
I took down a wanted player standing at a train station and got lots of nasty homophobic messages for a few minutes. 
---
I assumed he was there to have his bounty removed.
---
or in the data section of the pip boy to look at the details of the challenges that I have tracked so i don't have to open my map open the challenges scroll all the way down  to find the one I need for the what feels like the  twentieth time during that play session.
---
And I’ll be waiting patiently :)
---
I thought the same thing lol. Stop it OP!! We don’t want more of these!!
---
You should all convince you're significant other to play with you, then they will be the ones with the tic blood and frogs.
---
The best way unfortunately is to find more alien blasters and scrap them to learn the mods, that's how I did it.
---
The only mod you can actually find in game is the one in dome 2
---
how would i give it to you if i’m on PS4 lmao???
---
i’ll check my stash box gimme a sec
---
Oooo that's awkward. I was playing NV for the first time and my girlfriend was watching me and I "tested him out" and we laughed for like ten minutes.
---
Are you on ps4?
---
Surely there's nothing going on here:

Tagging /u/valseek for attention
---
Built a store separate from my house for that reason
---
Or a wooden armour left leg
---
It's sad people do this. I'm sorry you had to deal with all of that.
---
This is also the reason I never team up with people I don't know. If somebody needs help they can message me and I'll follow them and help out, but that's about it.
---
Location of AB Rounds? :p
---
You can fix some floating by use a carpet to 'glue' it(you might be unable to build it again via the blueprints though), but the rest is hopeless, I'm always mad about the end of the structure somehow can made the whole thing inaccessible, and they don't really provides any information about what is conflicting with what, at least If it shows the thing with red I can adjust it tons of easier
---
The solution so far is I always blueprint when it hit a point and model&amp;series it as 'Workbench Set A-1&amp;East Main Building B-3&amp;Section C-1,' then I test build it&amp;recheck the whole thing in the nebor area(sometimes workshops), the inaccessible problem can also be solved by the blueprinting as well, just excluded the part when you making the blueprints, it's important that you build the saved blueprints for at least once though, since one misplaced item(items stacked on other items usually causing this) can ruin your whole blueprint
---
It's a weapon parameter in the ESM. Called "Damage - OutofRange mult" in FO76Edit.
---
Lol. Same here!
---
Ahh man I’m sorry it was the paramedic uniform I was thinking of :(
---
Oof. It’s all good :)
---
ah cool lol sorry don't use reddit to much but happy cake day too you!
---
Damn you're lucky. I got scrip and went off to go mad on them. Im a melee character...tire iron and a rolling pin. Sigh. 🤣
---
TNT dome #2 there will be some on the table with the plans for the fusion conversion, and more in a box beside the table.
---
Where is the spawn Location? I think I picked mine up in a safe underwater
---
Nah paying for 3* armour getting 3* wood and it reverting to 1* is not fine
---
Yes it's a great system but as I've said I feel as though it was implemented poorly. If the scrip was increased to 500-1k and reset weekly so it couldn't be taken advantage of I think that would be the better option. The max scrip we can hold is 1k anyway so resetting it after a week wouldn't be too far fetched. I still feel as though it's silly to have to wait a day for 150 scrip, I also disagree that it would just be "handed" to us, because we still have to go out and farm the legendaries to scrap in the first place. If x person put in more time than y person to farm legendaries to scrap for scrip I feel as though they should be rewarded properly for their time. But I respect your opinion if you enjoy waiting 24 hours just for 150 scrip. :)
---
Furious Explosive 50 cal works well. Damage stacks fast. Ran a prime receiver on it for a while but burned through too much ammo. Now I run a Prime TSE Gatling that does about 550 a shot while at half health. Through on some chems and you can chunk her down while not burning through a ton of ammo. I still use the FE 50 cal if other people aren't doing enough damage since it has the better rate of fire then switch to the gatling once I know we can finish it. The prime receiver on the gatling makes it pretty slow but I can get over 700 damage around 30% health if the mobs aren't swarming me.
---
That is good advice.  I haven't rolled the dice yet but I think I will go for 2 star items and see what I get.
---
It's a video game.  Not real frog.
---
Powered gate &amp; pressure pads.  Problem solved
---
I have a bloodied 3* lever action with faster fire rate and +1 agility. That + some caps if interested.i have more selection than that.
---
That's the one. Couldn't remember the name. I never used heavy weapons until 76 lol
---
The spawn location is in a safe underwater north-west'ish from the butterfly on the map In toxic valley
---
Im selling heads in a jar from the airport. No takers so far. I think people get distracted by the legendaries
---
Nice! My first was a bloodied explosive handmade with reduced vats cost myself.
---
Get a IE level like me it's better I have both a tse and ie
---
50 cal take 40 steel and 10 lead. 5mm is 30 steel and 15 lead. Steel is easier to farm but you burn through ammo faster. It really depends on the weapon stats but usually the 50 cal's rate of fire gives it a little bit of an edge.
---
yeah, you're right
---
Wow it's cheap on XBox. The helm alone goes for 6-10K on PS4
---
I like the camera challenges. I waited through all the stupid alcohol challenges, you can wait out my photo challenges.
---
There's a mod in TNT Dome 2 that changes it to fusion cells I believe.
---
Dude I literally got back on for the first time since launch about 3 days ago. Had about 90 caps. I now have 5000 and have spent at least a few thousand in player vending. What are you taking about?
---
i never ever ever accept team invites because of this mess.  they get their jollies off on this pathetic nonsense.  Its as if they only get gratification off of impulsive, anonymous bully tactics.  YAY internet. :(
---
Sorry, i should have mentioned that I run Vanguard's armor. Bloodied os useless to me. Do you happen to have an Explosive Western Revolver?
---
I have to admit, this grind is pretty pointless and if I could sew a vaultsuit together, then a backpack shouldn’t be shit.  Bethesda went above and beyond with the busy work on this one and I’m losing interest quick.
---
This is why I always create a party chat even if I’m playing solo, so I cant hear what people say.
---
No, I'm on PS4 with Japanese account.
---
&gt; I can buy atom anytime in Xbox.You buy Xbox too ?
---
Weird.
---
[You're the same one who made a post a month ago saying you own a PS4 and you couldn't purchase atoms here too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2umsj/bethesdawhy_cant_we_buy_atom_with_ps4_in_japan/)
---
**Bethesda:** "I’m not sure... why do you? Maybe you need one of these.. BANHAMMERS! haha... it just works!"
---
I’m max caps on all 3 of my accounts lol
---
Interesting strategy.
---
Holy shit are they an actual thing now, I was too excited to get legendary scout armor to go try getting any weapons with my scrip.
---
Now my mission is to get a tse pipe revolver
---
I think it would be nice if it was dialed back a little bit for The Elder Scrolls - we've already got ESO to fit the "large-scale online game" for that series, so a more confined co-optional sort of game for TES might work better than a direct TES conversion of 76.
---
I would them to add new achievements because as sad as it is once I have 1000g on xbox I won't play anymore
---
I never said it ddn't fail, I'm saying that these morons thought it wouldn't; no clue why I got downvotes lol.
---
Launched my first last week on Whitesprings, got all rigid, and wanted to see it go off in person. Fast traveled into the Golf Club just in time to get turned into a shadow.. Haven't done one since, as feeling a bit stink about flubbing that first one so bad.
---
It is a zealots revolver, it's a 3* don't remember what the third perk is. I can check in 4 hours when I get home
---
They no longer drop. You could sell them for 10k easy. Serum recipes make their money back by selling serums to vendors.
---
&gt; Got some pretty good drops today from the vendor. But didn't make this post to brag about my fantastic drops 
---
Of course not. That's why you said it...
---
If you're not looking to brag, you just wouldn't have mentioned how good your drops were, let alone open with it.
---
At least own the bragging dude. Nothing wrong with that.
---
To do that you’d need to either make servers dedicated. As in when people join a server, that’s the only server they can join. Or they would need to have the listing go across ALL servers, which would just not work at all. The quantity of people, the market information being shared and updates over every server simultaneously. It just isn’t feasible.
---
Yes its had a lot of bugs &amp; has been frustrating, but I've put in over 800 hours now &amp; don't regret any of it.
---
I would like if i could get more scrip per day. I'm still sitting on 1000 pounds of bad legendaries and can't get rid of them. I know i can sell them for caps but it just feels like a waste.
---
Yep. Well, half that, half downvote brigades from /r/Fallout, anyway.
---
No.  Bethesda believes that this would “take the fun out it.”
---
&gt;The notifications for events seemed to be focus on endgame bosses.
---
Violent Night has a notification, and it's just a regular event.
---
I know I can... I choose not to. I have like 90,000+ caps spread out on my characters.
---
Just because that’s what he/she is offering, doesn’t mean that’s the going rate for it.
---
I’ll have another look when I’m on as i got the level 20 one and does no damage at all lol
---
I got a good gauss and a great quad double barrel explosive low weight. The rest was mostly pipe guns. The experience felt balanced.
---
Saving
---
I DO NOT want slugs.  A Fallout Slug is just a Fallout Slime, and those things are never good times.
---
There's a 3rd spot up in the NW corner of the map. I forget where it starts, but it ends at the farmstead up there.
---
The backpack grind may have actually killed this game for me.
---
Similar duping issue at the Whitesprings restaurant last week, so its better if they just limit it to one person at a time
---
Like 10K for a 2\* Deathtambo (Mutant Slayer Swing Speed) or 15k for a 3\* (Instigating something)
---
Tbh the LVL 50 doesn't either which is a shame, the mod in dome 2 converts the ammo type to normal fusion cells which does less damage but is more readily available than AB ammo
---
inb4 no one does SBQ or ISQ anymore unless they just want prime plans or the costume pieces.
---
There should be a hardcore survival mode.  You loose one active weapon on death, one random piece of worn armor on death, and all other things (aids, junk, misc.)
---
Max active weapon stash of 3.  All others held in misc.
---
You loose 2 levels on death.  You respawn anywhere of your choosing.  Literally anywhere.  Immune for 10 minutes after to pvp.
---
Naw, no worries.  I'm not interested in Zealots. 
---
Sorry, man... I have a pretty good arsenal already, as I've been collecting since beta launch. I don't wanna sound booshie lol. There's just very few and specific things that interest me for trade. I mostly just dealcin caps for this reason. But like I said, 16k and it's all yours. If not, no hard feelings, friend :)
---
reduced carry weight is always nice. means you can hold onto it until the exchange machine resets
---
Tinfoil hats... Tinfoil hats for sale... Get your own  tinfoil hat today...
---
Got a mutants Gatling gun with 25% fire rate. The damage is one less than my AAE one. It's my all around weapon now.
---
Using camera select allows you to close and pull up the menu faster. Its not much of a hassle.
---
I mean, gotta' kill the sheepsquatch so it doesn't turn the brahmin into it's dinner..
---
Pacifist is broken bugged piece of shit, available under map&gt;menu&gt;settings&gt;gameplay
---
Passive perk card slots already exist. They just require you to take up a spot that any other perk card takes up.
---
It's all trade-offs. That's what makes the game interesting. 
---
Otherwise, why not have separate perk card slots for melee, short ranged, medium ranged, long ranged, heavy guns, crafting, buying and selling etc. It's so unfair that you can't do that...
---
Don't get me wrong, I think there could be some quality of life improvements made. Just not a fan of people thinking that the only relevant cards to occupy a perk slot are combat ones.
---
The true end game is standing patiently in a line waiting for your turn to roll the dice on the Purveyors wears.
---
Which sucks because to me the SBQ is a fun fight
---
Bloodied Explosive 250res dam when reloading 50 cal machine gun.
---
I decided it was good, and tried to buy a melee weapon. Berserker faster swing +1 endurance SuperSledge. (I'm unarmed, but it wasn't bad).
---
I can't wait to go back.
---
Lol i did the same! :)
---
She really is. I wish we had more world bosses like her it would be pretty cool. A giant behemoth for starters would be nice. :)
---
There are two types of barrels. Regular one with high RoF and charged one that does more per shot, but greatly reduced RoF. Unless the gatling has the +25% RoF 2nd star, stick to the regular barrels. Bethesda gimped the gun to oblivion with charged barrels a few weeks ago.
---
Radiation heals ghouls. Gamma gun shoots radiation. It's super fun :D
---
Yeah I’ve already changed it to Fusion Cells as i bought the Plans or Mod whichever it was for 50 caps in someone’s vendor 
---
Maybe the Alien Blaster just isn’t the gun it’s meant to be lol
---
I can't find anything on it. Can you guide me where to search?
---
Technically there are fish in the water if you swim underwater in ponds or rivers.
---
I use the refrigerator backpack and the booze ages just fine in my inventory (in slower rate ofcource compering in the fermentor)
---
I don’t even install doors anymore because of this
---
Would be nice since levelling up doesn't mean much for people who've decided on their builds.
---
Totally agree with this. We're already benefitting with the chance to get better legendaries. 
---
Worrying about the few scrip here or there you're missing while overlooking all the scrip you're getting to be able to have a redo for a (hopefully) better/useful legendary.
---
The devs have replied to a few of these posts, they know. Hopefully its added to patch 9.5.
---
Also... you guys are really up in arms about wood armor?
---
I kill SBQ only if i have to do one of these shitty dailies or run out of repair kits.
---
Possum Leatherworker badge quest, it's the one thing holding most up on it
---
SBQ still drops the Improved Repair Kits, as well as some other rare stuff. Same goes for the SSI and the real Sheepsquatch who both drop unique plans, apparel and recipes. Not to mention the enjoyment value of the events themselves. Besides, if they drop garbage legendaries, you can always exchange them for scrip.
---
You are doing great work reasearching this madness and sharing the results. I'm not myself 100% sure ypu are right,  but I am 100% sure of other thing: whoever downvoted your post is piece of shit
---
That's why I had opted to build a garage outside my base with the door, people may close it, but it looks pretty cool open anyways.
---
Exactly :-)  Manbabies cannot control us.  Have an upvote!
---
Yeah that will make things hard if the other players don’t help out. Eventually you will get higher level and will be able to take care of them all yourself.  You shouldn’t have to but people don’t care. They think some one else will do it. I had a guy who completely ignored the hole mission and just sat until of the house while we escorted the cows at the end two sheep popped up and he just tunnel visioned them well at this time my gun unluckily broke so I’m frantically trying to swap to another gun. But I was too slow and all the damn blood bugs gave our cows the good suck while every one had their tunnel vision on. And then his guy I mention gets on his mic and tell every one how bad they are that we can’t kill a few bugs while he kills the sheep for us. Some people are actually that entitled.
---
I luckily started like 2 months ago so ines’s There When the fasnacht came out but i had preordered the game and become dissapointed and then one i jumped in to see if its any better and my first fasnacht i realized that it was going better so i am still actively playing it so i was pretty lucky with my timing
---
Bloodied explosive reduced vats handmade
---
Or you can mine out Lucky Hole Mine in excavator PA. Lead for days... (maybe weeks?)
---
Caps are sitting at 14k so sorry I wasted time. May message you if I make some caps today or tomorrow
---
Wood armor mod that should make you fast as sonic while crouching and gives you pretty good armor exists. So yes
---
It is Bugged, but not in the way you've mentioned (Or maybe in addition)
---
It activates, you go to the terminal, and then told to go to VTU, and get a SB DNA.
---
The glitch, you go to VTU and have to power up the reactor, that works fine, however, if you don't complete the quest there and then it *seems* that the game check points the mission prompt, but powers down the reactor, thus you can never power it back up to get the sample analysed.
---
So these are not Japanese characters? (Obviously Joking)
---
The water everywhere is heavily irradiated. It's unlikely there would be many fish or if any ať all.
---
No worries,  man. It's 00:30 here. I've got nothing but time to waste before bed lol. Yeah, shoot me a message if you get the caps together. I'll close this post and hold till tomorrow for you :)
---
--close
---
The numbers in there make no sense. I see huge numbers like that and than zeros for stuff I do actually have. I jave no idea what those numbers are supposed to actually mean since it seems tied to nothing.
---
Yeah I want perk load outs at the very least. Like maybe add it to the quick wheel. Tired of switching from commando to rifleman during a nuke/sbq run while out of automatic ammo in the middle of an open field.
---
I feel you. I had that happen before. It sucks
---
Ehmm sry i might be dumb but dosn´t the free states vendor in Withe Springs always have that shematic for sale?
---
Another thing with the horde events, if you pay attention to what area a specific horde is in (for instance scorched in cranberry bog or liberators in the savage divide) it will be in the same spot the next time that event pops up. So a good example (unless location changed somehow in an update) if the liberator horde is in the savage divide it will always pop up at the atlas research dome thing, every single time. So watch out for that stuff and it’s a lot easier. Also as mentioned just see if it’s moving which really helps too.
---
Imagine giving a high way pass for 50000 duped AAE weapons straight to every player on the market at any time at their convenience..
---
Shudder
---
What tips? You just buy a melee vat 1,2 or 3 stars. That's all
---
I want to catch them by fishing tho
---
Or i can do uranium fever for 3 times more legendaries. IRK is the only reason to kill it once you got all prime plans
---
No tips, but if you don't try you'll never no
---
I got a couple of pretty good armor pieces, not what I wanted, but still pretty good
---
Definitly people in mining gear that were mutated. My personal opinion is radiation exposure combined with fev combined with gear that looked mole like before he war.
---
I'll legit give you 2500 caps for it
---
yea i had to transfer it back but it took a lot of weight off me still
---
There is heavy radiation in other parts and there are still animals there. There is fish in rl that live in sulphuric acid rich water.
---
I get your point, but if you can express your bug reports as well as you express yourself, then imo you should just send it straight to the devs, there's a reason that channel exists.
---
&gt; IMO, they should not be allowed to be downvoted, period. 
---
the Reddit KarmaRouletteGod decides the fate of us all ¯\\\_(ツ)_\/¯
---
I find I am more successful if I stand in front and wait for both heads to look at me, then she might let me have her milk.
---
Pretty valuable, I'd pay top dollar for it at least.
---
They did get a buff, but from what I recall, the weapon used to break in 60+ shots, and now it breaks in around 100+ with max Gunsmith.
---
The sad energy weapon life is getting buffed from useless to useless and then Bethesda leaves them untouched for about 3 months one.
---
Plasma's pretty OK right now, though. Could still use a crafting requirements nerf because it costs 12 lead to make 50 bullets.
---
You quadbox? You fucking quadbox? As a doubleboxer I now felt "average".
---
Make purified water generators at your camp. You literally just make free money for doing nothing.
---
The different plans are at a few vendors and such, and one of the purified gens doesn't even need to be placed in water.
---
Pretty sure they were joking.
---
You missed the point of my entire post. I'm saying instead of randomizing both the armor/weapon you CHOOSE the base item, and the mod is randomized. You can even get one made by a high int character since intelligence needs to serve a purpose, otherwise why have it when all of your gear is bought?
---
Mine tells me which dailies are available. Helping the two scout bots, and Biv...
---
You think there are complaints about player vendor death traps now. Give people to ability to ensure you land in their pit of doom and the threads will be non stop.
---
Sooo ah yes please. Cause I honestly do love seeing some of the funny ways people come up with to trap and kill other players.
---
You just got wolves? Count yourself lucky. I got a pack of wolves, a wave of the giant ass mosquitoes and as I was arriving to the ranch where I was supposed to deliver the Brahmin, a frigging legendary sheepsquatch appeared. Needless to say I failed the mission.
---
Takes garbage to buy from purveyor.
---
PS4 and I appreciate that but I don't have the spare caps to use on even just 1000 5mm
---
wish I could give you all more than 1 upvote...
---
Scrapped 3 combat helmets. Got no plans.
---
No, you could use the TERMINAL to sync missions, as they become available, to your pipboy.  Repeating missions, and Events could be made into a list, where you check the box next to the ones you want to keep up to date with.  
---
They could even make a mission of it, by activating and hacking repeater stations to extend your terminal sync/(radio signal) to reach all areas of the map.
---
Waste of time trying to explain this to people with 100hours ingame.....
---
A few hundred is 3 or 4 mags and is empty in 22 minute of firing aha. It is common just in small amounts.
---
Yeah to other players, minimum 1 cap though so for people running automatic heavy weapons it's a bummer
---
Probably get a good amount of that in the silos too. Thanks
---
I have so many of the poor things stuck in jars around my camp now! I made like five of them just to really make sure it wouldn't mark off.. I feel so sorry for them.
---
Pc or console? T
---
I've seen them do free play weekends a couple times on xb1
---
Well yea, but theese species developed over hundreds of thousands of years. Given that water life is quite sensitive to pullution I think nuclear fallout would wipe out most species of water life. And on land there insn't that much radiation some regions are clear, but water is heavily irradiated everywhere.
---
It's not that bad when you first start levelling not everyone starts the game out with a bankroll of script or a stash box full of legendary fodder
---
[Around 15minutes.](https://youtu.be/HBPrSO0w7As) If you repair 15mainframe cores before coming in and you use granades to destroy ones you have to destroy, you could run thru without any god roll weapon. When people was using texture glitch it took them 7minutes.
---
Over in the Mire, along the road south out of Berkeley Springs. If you've ever seen the abandoned train station there, that's where she set up shop.
---
Okay just ruin my fun then. Good day to you sir! Hahaha
---
Oof...
---
thanks :(  hopefully they will fix i guess.
---
i can't buy stuff if we can't see what it is
---
You can inspect when the owner is nearby
---
oh ok, that explains why sometimes it works.  THANKS.
---
I went in with a lvl 35 bloodied baseball bat set up for ranged lol took me an hour of running thro a lot of stuff
---
I am playing on the PC.
---
i can solo it in around 20-15 mins, i just hack all terminals and turn off the turrets in each room, i skip the whole reactor part and repairing the cores instead of looking for them saves alot of time, even more so if you repair last run’s leftovers before going into the silo
---
Sweet jesus. Never even occurred to me to use nades.  Guessing you buy cores from other people?
---
I went there but there was no way to enter the train station
---
Berkley springs train station. I knew it was berkley springs but then it took me a minute to realize she was at the train station
---
My point insn't to ruin your fun at all. I just like some realism in my games.
---
Possibly, I've been playing since beta with a little under 500 hours. I'm just trying to suggest something that would make this game more rewarding and fun.  ): Can get more gear by just farming whitesprings and all the other hotspots sadly. I'm positive they only made the cap 150 so dupers can't destroy the game with the purveyor which is very unfortunate.
---
I thought you could try it for couple of hours and get a refund if you didn't like it?
---
I don’t even try anymore. Last literally 4-5 times I’ve tried we hammer on her for 20 min and maybe take 15% of her health off the first bar.
---
I got my first one last night, harvested a Junk Pile.
---
I know I’m just joking. I will settle for one spices of fish to survive so we can both have what we want 😃
---
That's strange, it was working earlier today.
---
Did you at least discover the map marker for it?
---
Is there a trick to hacking terminals quickly? Sometimes I'm at a terminal for a solid 3 minutes or more. I do the whole removing duds and getting bonus guesses but sometimes that's not enough. Other times I get it on the first try.
---
Passive mode means u can’t kill other players and they can’t kill you. People in gta online would kill someone then pop passive mode so the person they killed couldn’t kill them back.
---
If you pick those broken ones it goes to your inventory (15). Also you can pick new one around in that room. So by just doing it over and over i have now 40 cores all time.
---
Try first three words, ten close and try again so you don't have to wait 10sec after failing. This is fastest method.
---
Cool.  I'll try and be on tomorrow and I'll add you m8!
---
God damn. I wish I had known that yesterday.
---
Campfire Tales too please
---
😱
---
I don't get a notification for it.
---
Give it time to load in.
---
There is usually an Abel at the Giant Teapot slumped over a picnic table. Many are in parking lots by cars at attractions in my experience.
---
Killed the impostor twice yesterday, got a 1\* each time.
---
I am going to go for 'no'.
---
I've been wondering that too.
---
I have an ultracite gatling laser, a zealot gatling laser and a gatling laser with a prime receiver. 
---
They all do more damages to scorched, but which one would be the best ? It's not like I can really see that when fighting the queen...
---
No I’ve just visited and he open and trading
---
That is something I have not tried! Fingers crossed it works and thank you!!
---
An egg-cellent Idea. Totally agree.  
---
(It's called free-range isn't it?)
---
The game has been out for half a year, a majority of the playerbase is likely level 100+. With the amount of 1 🌟 legendaries 3 🌟 enemies drop I'm sure everyone has a lot of chameleon wood pieces they wouldn't mind scrapping for more scrip.
---
That is what I have seen people offering to buy it for.
---
It's just laggy, also after the door goes away the sign sometimes stays, still takes a second
---
Just play survival lol
---
You just farm it and scrap it and it unlocks mods. Not sure how many there are. I try not to do that very much, though, because it would be shitty to work to find it and it not be there. I will sell them cheap occasionally because really casual players are unlikely to find it unless they look it up online.
---
Lol all I could think of was the Chupacabra &amp; ghouls with sombrero’s
---
If people didn't cheat the game would be way more fun. 
---
Being killed by some sweaty trihards with top tier armour and weapons they bought from eBay isn't fun for anyone.
---
Well if u played it just few hours then yes
---
No. She is a terrible, unfunny, uninteresting character that everyone  never wants to hear another piece of dialogue from ever again.
---
No it's not it's a trap worst game ever never getting better just play minecraft
---
Yes it is! Lot's of bugs fixed (some although were reintroduced back), lots of new content!
---
This purveyor idea was brilliant but completely crippled by this daily cap which is way too dumb. What kind of game company DOESN’T want people to play their game as much as possible. This is really a commie approach, ‘you shouldn’t work too much because you will make your colleagues feel bad’.
---
Killed a SBQ a few times yesterday and also got a 1 star each time, also gonna say no. You're just super lucky.
---
I got like half way through the story and I just couldn’t enjoy it with no npcs. I then grinded to level 50 but got bored
---
It's terrible, even when modified. Waste of time in my singular opinion.
---
Play with rock, outside. Best way to spend time.
---
Gotta wait 22 hours, but I assume you know that, I'd try a reset on game, maybe even system
---
I’m sorry but I have to disagree with the pvp players have no voice pretty much all major content is being aimed at pvp there isn’t any pve after the main story and the wild Appalachia content has been small only lasting a week at most to me it seems like Bethesda is catering to the smaller part of the player base who actually does pvp and ignoring the largest part of the player base that prefer pve I mean the next game mode is apparently going to be battle royal. I do agree with you about survival mode being a joke
---
If you love soooo much PvP, why do you play adventure?
---
Meh. I walked to the vendor tonight after work with about 250 scrip... Got nothing I particular need, but got a decent handmade that sold for 5k. I've been working on a single toon since the beta and have a respectable build from grinding and trading.. I mean I obviously wasn't going to get the hyper specific drop that would add to what I already have. But getting 5k for what amounted from a single legendary farming run made it worth it.
---
That sucks. I've never experienced this and some of my best moments in 76 have been from random team invites because doing quests with others can be so much fun where I don't know a lot of people that play this game and after playing alome in the wasteland for a while it really starts to feel lonely haha
---
Yeah if it’s on steam you can play it for 2 hours and return it before the 2 hours are up
---
And yeah I know, pretty obvious stuff, but sometimes 1 reset doesnt do it and gotta reset game a couple times or server hop
---
This.
---
"Waaaahh, I can't grief people anymore so Bethesda clearly hates PvP"
---
Yep survival just dont cry when we murder you over here.
---
Tell them that New Vegas is shit and more buggy than 76.
---
Then turn your phone off for the night.
---
Yeah Im beginning to think it is now lol
---
Yes. It's amazing, assuming you like Fallout that is.
---
We're not mindreaders.
---
Sure am. PurpleKingAtlas
---
Lag spike. New content is the last to load in, so it might take a minute or five after logging into a server for it to show up.
---
It would save me sending messages to all the people in the server at the time when its up. 2 days and over 100 messages sent to let people know the event was up and going.
---
Realism in Fallout? Weirdo.
---
I played fallout 3, NV and 4, I loved them all but this game is weird compared to them
---
Citing lorespade as a person who is a good example of PvP has lost you any credibility on my book. The dude runs around with a full squad of goons harassing people who he knows for sure have no chance. Whether that be because they are low leveled or clearly aren't rocking decent gear. It doesn't help that he's your typical God complex try-hard who's fragile ego gets bruised at the slightest hint that anyone tell him he's only winning because he spams stealth boys like their in style this year and uses the most broken gear known to this game.
---
My goal was to be higher lvl than my friends and get all the power armors and very good weapons and after that i Haven't feel like coming back but I'm hyped about that "prestige" lvl thing that is coming this summer because it sounds interesting because then enemies are more harder and rewarding etc
---
Never said you were tbf
---
You played for more than a few hours if you made it to level 50. If you can't get into the story without NPC's just telling you what's happening you're probably not going to enjoy any of the new content. Your loss.
---
I rented Fallout as I do with most games, but I did then go on to keep it (the same day it arrived!), never regretted my choice. It's not perfect, but no game is, and it's getting better over time.
---
I got shit drops but that's typical RNG fucking me
---
I just did this last night. Got a badge for almost every campfire. So i can confirm it works.
---
Check your pip boy under stat -&gt; collections
---
Some good arguments there nice nice
---
yeah, kinda did. Your question is entirely personal. We have no context to decide if this game is worth playing _for you_. Expecting us to answer that is expecting us to be able to read your mind.
---
True tbf. Me and my friends played the game for a few weeks but I feel the story can’t be played with other people
---
Its wood. There are laser weapons and nukes. Wood burns. Also its not that light in real life. 
---
I get it if you're going for a fun joke look, thats cool. I'm trying to make a full robot set, with tinfoil under-armor and a sentry bot helmet for a Daft Punk outfit. (Might even get on my mic with a DP soundboard and everything). Robot armor isn't particularly great either.
---
I got 2 useless auto grenade launchers, useless black powder pistol, useless mutant slayer handmade and a useless pipe pistol. 
---
Well, kinda expected...
---
You're not gonna get much support here, but I mostly agree with what you're saying. 
---
I truly fail to understand why an evil or raider playstyle is so frowned up by Bethesda and what seems to be the majority of the player base. It's a fallout game after all. 
---
What seems to happen is that fully grown adults get so angry and upset when you kill them, or mess with them. I fail to see why these people are so easily offended and weak minded. Whenever I got griefed initially, I would just server hop or run away, yet people act like their real life is being threatened. 
---
We're all playing a game with specific mechanics, yet some really do not like when you play the game how you want, within those mechanics. 
---
PvP can be really fun, except it's becoming less and less profitable or fun to do.
---
Bethesda please stop capilitulating to the feeble minded and easily offended. It's a fucking game after all, and a FALLOUT one at that.
---
I asked is the game worth coming back to. The game was in a horrible state back at release.
---
Most people would hate that for giving advantage to atomic shop items. Look at the repair kits
---
The upcoming Nuclear Winter mode might be good news for PvP players, as it is rumored to be something similar to battle royale, or possibly team deathmatch, but likely PvP focused in any case. I would expect a trailer for the summer updates soon, maybe at the E3 conference in about 3 weeks.
---
What effects are left on the pump? Is it the primary(Quad) that vanished, the major or the minor?
---
Key to the Past has had this bug forever where it gets set back a few stages. Nothing to do with today's patch; always happened.
---
Yeah but nukes are pretty fun with friends and Making good bases but i think they should add some kinda dungeons in the game where there is boss fight at the end it would totally bring me back
---
Can confirm, am super terrified of bugs and regularly have jump-out-of-bed nightmares about spiders, the ticks are already gross enough
---
Sign a rage chronicle petition? Talking about toxic behavior :') No ty
---
Just go kill people in survival if that makes you feel better about yourself. Or just go bully people in RL and see how that works out for you
---
Yeah i no longer accept invites. Had someone invite me at an event to join a team i go back to my camp right after i get it which is marked and i get shot by somebody in stealth. I never accepted invite but it was a bit odd since he left right away. People shoot at you but this guy was there waiting for me. Couldve been nothing but seemed fishy to me.
---
Yea the game just feels like a scorched and mole miner killing simulator, I haven’t played that far into the story to be able to launch nukes yet but have experienced them
---
Don't listen to them, it's terrible and should be banned from the internets... /s
---
My phone auto turns scrip into script and I browse reddit on my phone
---
Everyone who likes PVP is akin to a real life bully?? Go back to your fucking safe space you feeble minded manlet.
---
Yeah, they are blatantly trying to get around the zero CAMP damage unless hostile situation.  
---
Also, I get random players sending me a team-invite just so they can get free travel to me and my vending, if you want to visit, make the effort.  
---
Would love to have a "f\*ck off" or "flip the finger" emote/s. (Not going to happen I suspect)
---
I agree, but players like OP don't want actual PvP they want to fight those who don't want to fight. They want to grief and troll because "I'm a raidurr"
---
Or some who actually suck at PvP who want to attack those who avoid PvP because they are even worse at it to feel better about themselves.
---
In PvP modes he may actually run into people who want to PvP because they are even better at it.
---
I am... whooooooo!!!
---
Im never going to get the shower. First so many crashes and now no one will do it.
---
The game is in a much better state, objectively. It’s in my opinion not as fun without friends. And people need to understand that THE ASKER WANTS AN OPINION, not to have their minds read.
---
I accidentally swung my melee weapon trying to hit a rad roach and I had hit poor old Bessie and she was laid out afterwards. Maybe you had gotten lucky but so far they die to my damage
---
You must have had the most pampered and easy life if you someone whacking you and doing no damage in a game is classed as briefing lol.
---
How much would you sell just the uniform for?  
---
I'm on PS4
---
Thanks, I will give it ago later today, do you think I should use my lvl 50 character or just restart?
---
I'm not sure if you are PC player or console player, and maybe on console it looks differently, but on PC survival is infinitely awesome.
---
Being honest with you, my definition of PvP is when two+ good consenting teams compete. Claiming its an uneducated players fault they consented to PvP on adventure by taking workshops is like saying its perfectly legal to be a douchebag hence you will be one and all negative comments are unfair and unbased. Thats one way to look at it, but don't expect support, I myself hunt such people down.
---
Then, there are tens of thousands of people who wanted PvP-less adventure, and few thousands of people who wanted PvP. We're the elite minority. Behave like fucking one, please. Don't go after chanceless noobs. Hunt the hunters.
---
The only changes that should be done to PvP is to:
---
Increase the caps to 100% player level capped at 50. I dunno why they made it this damned 25% after they implemented the cap.
---
Remove respawn protection. Add "seek revenge" to survival mode, and if used it spawns you in randomly 300m radius from nearest station, without any bugged bullshit invincibility.
---
Remove pacifist from survival mode, fucking period. It should instantly disconnect a survival player when they turn pacifist on, but they should also die first, leaving their lootbags for people who don't fucking cheat. This is sonofabitchism that's heavily exploited.
---
Sounds like bad luck lol
---
As a console player, I'd like to point that we still limited to 50 photos in gallery. And we need to do 20-30 photos for challenges per week. I really bored of cleaning my photo gallery and just stopped doing those challenges, it's too boring overall.
---
Hmm interesting. Next time I'm solo at the event I'm gonna try and kill them again. Maybe only vulnerable to melee... or most likely one of us encountered a bug.
---
People get super salty and accuse me of cheating, because I use chameleon armour and stealth boys. Even though it’s literally part of the game, and if you look into it you can easily counteract it.
---
I guess it’s because people develop this idea that they’re untouchable gods, because they can one shot brain dead AI enemies. And when they get their asses handed to them, it’s like a reality check that they aren’t as untouchable as they thought they were.
---
Try relogging, I've noticed that sometimes the scrips and badges dont update on what it shows in collections until you do. Hopefully that's what it is in your case.
---
Yeah definitely don't nerf. Didn't get one thing I needed for either of my characters from 670 script only trying to get armour. But I understand that, a bit of low chances, a bit of me always having bad luck and not much time to get more script than that, it's probably just about right the way it is
---
Had similar over 10 tries. Nothing good or relevant in 3 star weapon choice. Just going trade them all again or sell on the cheap.
---
Who said anything about that? Y'all fuckin' griefers just wanna be mad about something.
---
What pisses me off is having a badass hairstyle like Megaton (which I’ve been literally using since January) &amp; having 4 different fucking Mohawks &amp; Hornets nest.... we get new outfits &amp; PA skins &amp; all that like every week why can’t I get some actual damn hairstyles man... or they should start selling skins of old players from the Fallout universe. I’d easily pay to run around as Moira or Benny from NV!
---
Cute. I have a full time job and other life things so my gaming time I make count by playing smarter to get the most out of less time. 💁🏻‍♀️ But whatever makes you feel better.
---
If you have a level 50, and some 3*’s that aren’t as useful anymore, no matter their level you can exchange for scrip, which would be good for new weapons. Level 50 would be fine, as no early features have been changed heavily. Going through the story again would be a waste of energy, in my opinion.
---
Well to be fair... The joke isn't that funny and it adds nothing to the discussion of the problem at hand either so I think it's worth the down votes.
---
I have 2 sledgehammers with the same mod and skin one is my faster swing speed ghoul killer one and the other is my bloodied power attack, of them will dissapear from my weapon wheel when I leg back in almost every time
---
I bought Xbox for Atoms now.
---
I asked this in another thread but would really appreciate some advice: I picked up one of these bad boys today also, and want to know what mods I should be applying for max effectiveness. Does anyone have any advice?
---
I can't be the only one who thinks bosses like SBQ and imposter should guarentee a 3*
---
Also the amount of stars an enemy has should be what we get in the drop. Sick of a 3* mutant giving me a 1*
---
Drops should also scale to our level, max level enemy giving me level 35 gun is also a pain.
---
my friend got into the closed beta of eso and I wasnt impressed when he showed it to me
---
Im not using improved repair kits until atom shop ones aren't removed.
---
Ok thanks boss.
---
That's some crazy dedication to the game right there.  
---
Todd Howard must love you.
---
U also get very good power armor when you finish the story
---
I found after going back to the game, that there were more bugs than before.
---
That was my point really. I see more and more "Pvp-er" whining about not being able to destroy other peoples buildings. If your only enjoyment out of a game is to annoy and grief other people you should go play Rust. Bullying people on the internet or via a game is somewhat anonymous and feels 'safe' to these goons. Making them feel big while in RL they are most likely very insecure.
---
If you only get pleasure out of hurting others you are a lowlife in my book.
---
Yeah, put a blade on your camera to get really Sharp photos 😁
---
I don't remember where I read it, think it was a community manager reply about the issues. However they said they are aware of this and working on a fix.
---
Hopefully sooner then later.
---
So... you own the game, then the only reason you may be having second thoughts is you don't have fast internet and unlimited download plan? The download is +50gb, but if that is not the case I'd definitely have another bash at it, there is new content to try out.
---
But be warned, the game is still the same but different from the previous Fallout releases, I still miss the lack of npcs sometimes, but I've just hit level 200 and still love it. You have survival mode with everything that brings to the game, not my cup of tea but many love it.
---
Welcome back :)
---
I love Fallout, all of them, but when it was announced Fallout 76 would be online I was not happy.  
---
However, I do enjoy this new Fallout, and have done so since launch!  
---
Although, I tend to play almost exclusively Solo, other than Events that is.  
---
Thankfully the majority of other players are friendly, with the occasional petulant child or keyboard warrior, which are easily ignored.
---
naw I got my exploding gatling laser legit, in hindsight though I should have kept the second one I got instead of selling it to a vendor because it was too heavy
---
Eurgh Bethesda is so shit I'm quitting reeeeeeee
---
Dang i got 5 and wanted a shotgun.
---
日本語だけじゃなくて、英語以外の言語も同じくバグっているらしいです。  
---
パッチが出るのを待つしかありませんね。
---
First weapon i got was a bloodied explosive railway rifle with 15% something else on it
---
If you don't care about the 3rd star then rolling a 2 star costs half the price so you can get double the tries on weapons
---
I recommend you buy Xbox, If you want Atoms in Japan,Sincerity.
---
Still not many npcs and that wont change so if that is a deal breaker this game is not for you.  I love the game for what it is but I did not expect a single player adventure. Great community and the game is huge. Kind of empty in the late game when it comes to challenging fights though
---
I have the game still downloaded and all but the problem is last time I played it it was in a horrible state and just got boring after grinding the golf course for the 20th time
---
Literally his only claim to fame.
---
"Sup dudebros, I nuked a thing, go ahead and click subscribe so I can get ad money for weed and brewskis for my bruh's."
---
I would think because it can't give you a .9 of a cap so I would believe
---
REEEEEEing as well actually, was hoping for a more immersive game experience. We got a game that’s very unimmersive and entirely loot based. The experience just doesn’t feel personalized at all, and that’s the problem.
---
Ive got one. Ps4.
---
If you sold a single item for 1 cap I suspect you will get one cap, but sell multiple items at 1 cap and after the "tax" the amount paid to you is either it's rounded up or down before paying out to you.
---
I did that before I posted here but forgot to include it in the post due to how angry I was, my bad
---
I think they attack all surface stuff because we are just different.
---
Or previous surface dwellers shot them because they are different and they don't trust outsiders.
---
I figured they came to the surface for other reasons already like food and scavenge. They were human after all but your reason for nana quail farts I like.
---
You say that like others don't go to work. So we should be limited to scrap legendaries in first hour of our free time and then get bored, because you have little more RL things to do than us? Cool.
---
You'll get it one day. 🙏
---
No worries bugs like that are super irritating.
---
Good news! You can use then. Atom shops ones haven't been removed!
---
いやそうでもないですよ。バグってない言語もあるよ

Awesome 
---
Those were static or just a "hey, heads up, look in green footlockers"?
---
I've never 'griefed' or destroyed someone's camp unless they started something with me. I just hunt bounties, retaliate and sometimes mess with people in a funny and non violent way. Not everyone that plays games is some feeble nerd, but who cares about real life because this is a GAME.  
---
Good try at using me as your straw man though.
---
Myself usualy just shoot once at the sheepsquatch, or any other legie for that matter, and focus on adds. So I still get the drop, couse I marked the target I do get the loot and in the same time I deal with the adds.
---
Legendary Urban Scout, too.
---
Yes, communism that good old feeling centric mode of government that makes you stop working because it might make comrade jones feel bad about something.
---
So i guess all those people who starved due to the five year plans where actually not working so the people in the city's would feel more productive.
---
Careful throwing the word dumb around glass houses and all that.
---
They didn't exist as a legendary but the weapon exists since release.
---
Raging at Todd make no sense, I seriously doubt he is hands on the single reason for all the issues, BGS has a significant number of people responsible for various elements of the game.  
---
Just log-off, and when you log back in it might be ok, hopefully.
---
First weapon I got was a 2 shot, Anti armor, +250% DR while aiming.... FATMAN  
---
IT does 1k damage, which means 2k damage if I stealth fire it. IT is for sell for 4,000 caps. as mini nukes weight to much.   
---
Takes chunks out of the SBQ though.
---
A few weeks ago, I took down a guy hiding in his camp. He had a 530 cap bounty on him. I use chameleon armour and stealth boys and so I was able to kill him even though he had an explosive .50 cal machine gun. Legit the dude got so angry, he messaged me calling me a bitch among other nasty things for using stealth boys.
---
He then somehow found my camp and destroyed it. I didn’t really care. You can just move your camp and everything will get fixed without using resources.
---
"Slowly strangling the PvP community" Hmm, I do like the sound of that.
---
I can't even go in the fucking building to access the vendor.
---
Wow really?
---
THIS!! It actually worked! lol
---
With hacker level 3 equipped you can hack a terminal all 4 times and not get locked out, just reset.
---
I also work and attend college. Which is another reason I feel as though the scrip should be a weekly thing instead of daily. So there isn't that sense of urgency to feel obligated to log in for a measly 150 scrip for that day just so it can stack up.
---
Actually you have a point. All theese mutated animals just 25 years after the bombs dropped  make no sence at all. You can have your fish 😁
---
To be perfectly honest I have never heard of player deathtraps after the vending update. I have considered it but never gotten trapped or heard of other people getting trapped.
---
I didn't blame him for "all the issues" , it was just an offhanded remark based on my anger at the time?  Rushing to defend him makes less sense either way
---
Yes, I have also noticed this, I just removed the spotlights, they don't seem to make much of a difference anyway.
---
Thank you. Up with you.
---
GAS, preserved pies, salt, head in a jar, you name it im angling for a get rich quick scheme.
---
i agree with everything thing people are saying but, it’s immersive. they are raiders. real life raiders. hardware town in fallout 4 did it, harvey in nuka world did it. it’s annoying but being just a “player” and not like the lone wanderer or anything we are subject to people wanting to be raiders too and in that aspect alone, kinda cool. (sorry they messed up your house tho bro)
---
you got the choice, survival or adventure, you could expect what might happen, you actually experienced what happens, and you complain?!
---
wtf is wrong with people these days?
---
like, what do you want?
---
a "below lvl 20 survival mode"?
---
i dont get it, leave survival mode alone when it's not your taste, and go on, easy...
---
instead you make a fool of yourself with coming here and complaining...
---
I think it's ok if you leave their junk
---
I think it's a great game and I'm looking farward to playing it again. You eathier like it or u don't. Heaps of players playing anyways so all ways meeting new people.
---
wouldn't the "commie approach" be to work *as hard* as your fellow man? limitations set by the highest performance as to know the true limitations of the worker?
---
I get how you feel about the Scrip and Cap limit but idk if I agree on the last part.
---
Yeah go nuts
---
If you don't wanna be a dick about it, you could just ask someone if you could kill them for a challenge. Hell, they might even be happy to get rid of the bounty.
---
Have you ever actually watched lorespades videos 99 percent of the time he rolls alone and i have never seen him use a stealth boy , you should watch the vids before you run your ignorant mouth
---
If you own the game, wouldn't the best way to know is play it? If you felt like there wasn't a decent story, then you should just find another game and cut your losses. I don't want to focus this frustration directly at you, because I know you're asking because your interested, but between Bethesda's updates, the onslaught of posts already answering this, and many other fo76 subreddits, and a flood of you tube videos, and that a lot of people own the game and can't be bothered to sign in and see...
---
I hope you get your answer, but there are so many of these posts with different opinions, that if you read through them, you'd get more information. People are downvoting because the frustration of answering in good faith and then people not even bothering paying attention to the posts where they answer. Fucking help us help you.
---
I started playing a few weeks before they increased the stash weight. I think people who started before vending have an experience that future players will never have. The vast isolation and the actual jarring feeling of finding another person after hours of wandering this giant world.
---
I understand where some people might not be able to digest the story as easily in the way it's presented, but this game does such a great job building on the existing lore and a lot of the origins, but also creating a unique experience different than the other games. I keep repeating myself, but the objective is to rebuild from nothing. We did that for months. Now vending is here, the world is moving and growing.
---
I feel like the bugs seem more rampant for some people than others. I'm not sure if what they are playing the game on is the issue or what. It is infinitely more stable than when I started, but even then my own experience was different than I read about on here.
---
If you don't take the time to invest in the story, then none of the world is going to matter or make sense. If you take the time and follow threads, then you'll get so much more out of this game.
---
This game could easily not be for you. I think that is okay, but I can't understand how the impulse isn't to sign in and see--again, not trying to focus frustration directly at you--but the things I'm really liking about this game seems to be something you didn't like.
---
Just fucking play it and then if it still isn't for you, move to the next.
---
For this I just found a low-level player on the map (under lvl 10) and fast travelled to near them, followed them stealthily, and rushed in when they died, Done!
---
instead of 150 scrip a day 
---
what if the vendor has 1050 which is a weeks worth of scrip and only reset each tuesday that way you can either slowly drain the vendor as you play or you can take all your stockpiled legendaries and blow through all the scrip it has in one go 
---
of course we might need an increase because 1000 is the cap I would be fine with 2,000
---
Just a guess, herbivore mutation?
---
yeah i don't care about their stuff i just want to clear the trophy that just leaves the kill 20 players trophy then
---
I just got back from a vacation and haven't started the quest yet. I'm only on during weekend mornings but you can add me if all else fails. IGN raskol.
---
Also:
---
If you have full Unyielding or Vanguard equipped the massive intelligence boost helps to reduce the amount of duds.
---
I depolishified my English sentence to be actual English. Still ignoring the repair kits tho.
---
Then don't grind the golf course, try exploring, take your time searching for new locations and fighting the enemies you come across. Try no to develope or try to suppress that (must beat the game, must get to end game) mentality, if you rush rush rush to the 'end game' you will then have nothing further to do.
---
I see this game first and foremost as exploration and delighting the senses with the huge map and amazing environment with some fighting thrown in, I am a PVE player though so may be completely different from you.
---
Good luck regardless.
---
I had some disconnection yesterday because of the seveers struggling with the Legendary Verndor release, but it basically seems pretty stable now.
---

---
I didn't call you a "feeble nerd". Not sure if you are calling me one? I was just responding to your reply and not talking about you specificly.. as I don't know you. Not sure what you mean with the straw-man thing. 
---
You do seem pretty angry for a non-griefer though. Did I hit a string?
---
well crap ya know what? i think you’re right. i was so confused.
---
I'm level 110 and I've set up my base where you spawn on stone (never! Inside foundations), with 4 vendor machines, a nice little house, workbenches in the cellar, a sundeck... and I also have a bar built into the cave near vault 76. I thought there would be more visitors since it's free to get there, but so far it's been OK but not great. I have a few legendaries both weapons and armor (sadly my armor is mostly 1/2 star) I really don't want to ruin my bar since it took forever to get it right, but I consider moving the shop to a more high traffic area...
---
Equip cannibal perk, Kill them, eat them, take junk. They had bounty for reasons. Lockpicking things at camps is sin, which is executed with death.
---
546 Damage! Goddamn!
---
I had this problem to and so did my brother, I think it had something to do with dying. When you pick up your dropped loot all the objectives should re-
---
complete themselves very weird and stupid shit. Good luck hope you figure it out and don’t have to do it twice like me.
---
They go for around 8k to 11k Caps
---
Did you scrap all junk, by any chance? All except radroach meat are junk items. So when you scrap them, you have to hunt again. I have completed this quest 5 times already, so I don't think it's a bug.
---
Haha I'm just having a bit of fun.
---
I knew what you intended to say.
---
Also ignoring the repair kits as well.
---
i tried talkinh on area chat but i think my mic is broken because they just stand there staring at me
---
It's done through the tinkers bench
---
I wouldn't feel too bad about going against players near lvl 50. They might not have fully optimized dmg/res perks, but most should have some capable build to still be a threat to any high lvl player. I've even taken down lvl 100+ players with a lvl 30 character as they tried to take my workshop.
---
If a player is wanted in adventure mode, it's typically because they did something they shouldn't have (specially now that they removed slap dmg). That's why I feel no shame playing the bounty hunter.
---
I'm allowed to love todd/bethesda and even this game for the most part and also get angry at them irrationally sometimes. Especially when it's warranted like in this situation. Maybe instead of down voting and rushing to defend Todd at all costs people should consider how they'd feel in a situation like this? Down voting and burying threads like these is arguably worse for the game than the occasional angry outburst because it lowers the chance of bugs being reported and discovered properly.
---
I dont think they do anti Collison in this game, I constantly spawn in people when traveling  to vault 76 or white springs service entrance.
---
Very good idea, did not think of the encrypted event by the way I am on PC but I do not have a means of communicating in the game, I think I will try the encrypted event first though thanks for the reply.
---
Maybe. Or maybe they don't have mics or something, Idk.
---
Good luck with the trophy, hope you find someone soon
---
lol. I had a You Guai just before hte Sheepsquatch too.
---
The sheepsquatch willalways appear.
---
I've watched several of his recent videos. In every so one he does exactly that. When he's solo he's popping stealth boys over and over. Even if he wasn't in SOME videos, he STILL clearly picks on people he KNOWS have no chance of winning and most of the time CLEARLY have no interest in PvP to begin with but want the asshat who keeps smacking at them to just go away. Please return to the waste puddle with him in which you came at me with your nonsense.
---
There are people who, when corrected, say "no you". There are also those who correct themselves. I prefer to be on the side of those who are right, hence I am happy to be corrected.
---
If it helps someone poweree down my powered door using a switch...so basically they "locked " my venders lol
---
Depends, i go for the highcap wanteds, cuz they earn to get reckt and looted. And hey, raider life, easy caps, easy scraps
---
Any word back on that "escalation"?  I never got a reply after clarifying my problem, so I'm probably going to have to submit another ticket and hope I get the same person you did.
---
Hopefully the sombreroed ghouls are easier to find than the golf-clad ones.
---
I am on PC but thanks for the offer much appreciated. A subsequent post suggested I try to revive a player if they go down in the small body of water at the encrypted event so I will give that a go, thanks again.
---
I removed the “ini” files and restarted the launcher and game and now it works every time, and with no lag....
---
Stwike him, centuwion, vewwy woughly
---
I must have been, just weird considering I genuinely can't remember the last time I even got one 3* loot from a 3* enemy. Both of them yesterday were from glowing ones at WS
---
I've spotted the Wal-Mart clerk needing the internet as an outlet for the security and fortitude they haven't found elsewhere.
---
Perk card loadouts could be a way to get an advantage in the game in terms of being able to easily switch from a heavy weapons loadout to melee or even from one handed to two handed. So maybe just make it so you get the passive slots for stuff like lockpicking and hacking, but also your crafting perks for extra ammo when crafting, and being able to repair to 200% and being able to craft top tier armour mods etc.
---
The machines themselves only have so much to give just like vendors only have so many caps to barter with.
---
You were likely nowhere near the cap, and simply traded your items for zero scrip because the machine was out of scrip.
---
Agree, I have done it quite a few times now and always become a conduit but I get bloody hammered though and die a few times.
---
Nice move to needless hostility and baseless assumptions.  Ii I thought you had actually even tried to understand what I said, I'd feel like you may have missed the point.  As I am sure the only thing you want to hear is that I don't have experience as a dev, no I do not.  Experience with various large corporations at different levels and watching issues with management not listening or caring result in uneeded issues and damages, I have plenty.  I'm guessing you are either looking to argue or just being overreactive because you have absolute certainty about what happened, so I will just concede to either your omniscience or bow out of a pointless fight.
---
I can clear a silo by myself in under 20 minutes. Premake mainframe cores, ignore the turrets, use energy nades to remove mainframe cores.
---
And you don't see anything wrong with that mechanic? You can't trade shit with robot vendors when they're at zero. You shouldn't be able to trade with the leg exchange past the limit. Especially when it's been established I was nowhere near the limit.
---
that's taking bounty hunting to a whole new kind of creepy level but i love it anyway
---
That makes no sense business wise at all, ok you get what you want an then what. I understand where your coming from, but this is also a business and it's main source off income is having ppl login in daily. Having ppl get their uniform gear the first few try is counter productive for BGS, but you might lucky and get it in a few tries.
---
So the backpack applies to it.
---
**Bug?** *Maybe not new*. I'm using an Executioner's Ultracite Gatling Laser. When I switch to another weapon or the camera, the game still shows the ammo type to be Fusion cores and gives an error that the wrong ammo type is in use. I have to switch back and forth to get it fixed several times.
---
I know, I have stopped using mine as it tells me bugger all when I do go on it, what is the use of it Bethesda!!!!!
---
You are dramatic. Are you like this irl? Lol
---
I have quad vatscrit damage level 35 double-barrel and its now my main easy farming tool for my main character. I have 9 characters, two accounts, five endgame armor sets and few dozen godrolled weapons.
---
QVatsCrit DB shotty somehow became my farming choice. Sweet spot between quick farming and not being an auto-rifle.
---
They make it so your able to, so that makes it ok
---
What really bothered me was I thought it meant clear the immediate area, it just means find and kill the appropriate creatures for the relevant items, took me a little while to realise this.
---
since the patch it has gotten harder to become wanted and someone is going to claim the bounty at least im not interested in their junk
---
uhm, are you actually that whiney in real life?
---
"mooooooooom, there are bullies on the internet again!!!"
---
I wish they used engine that can handle the game. But you know...
---
&gt; And you don't see anything wrong with that mechanic?
---
Considering the UI very clearly indicates how much scrip the machine has, no, I don't.
---
Are you being bullied?
---
I always loot my legendary stuff from the enemies located at The Whitespring Golf Club!
---
if it's after 20 hours and still says 0 sell something small that usually resets the clock. As long as it's after the 20 hours from your first purchase or sale.
---
Yes, all the time. I’ll log on just for the game to disconnect me before I even load into the world. Sometimes I get this weird glitch where I will spawn into a world, but keep getting the “server not responding” message every couple of seconds until the game inevitably disconnects. I pay for good internet, so I know it’s not because of my connection.

Absolutely, I killed a wanted level 30 not long ago and gave him 50 stimpaks afterwards. Pretty sure he was upset I killed him but hopefully those stimpaks made it up. Just didn't want someone to possibly bully them over 5 caps.
---
Uranium Fever 👍
---
90% reduced weight but still 8.8 weight? That doesn't sound quite right.
---
Etiquette for unfucking peoples bounties: get nearby, do hello emote, do love emote, do fingergun emote. You see thumbs up, you execute. 5 cap bounties are usually accident when unlocking random world container within camp range.
---
you have to fishins the bucket list quest first and then you should get the 105mm plans for the camara and then you can mod the camara on the thinkers bench.
---
Yes. They're criminals, kill them and dance on their corpse, after emptying their paper bag that is.  
---
If they don't want to lose their junk, they should behave better.
---
I mean white springs is probably the most reliable area for getting them, if not there’s uranium fever, watoga if you’ve done the quest they’ll just let you kill them. 
---
Last night I found a few legendaries at the vendors at white springs that people had sold so if you have lots of caps that’s an option, or even peoples in camp vending machines
---
Is making the game literally unplayable!
---
Personally it refreshing. I haven't seen so many 2⭐ weapons at once since I catalogued my mule for trade. On top of it being literally free (seriously, literally free. What the fuck were you doing with that nocturnal wood arm otherwise), it's cathartic to get the promised star level 100% of the time.
---
In my eyes, it really just highlights why 2⭐ and 3⭐ enemies should always drop an item of their star level.
---
*"fikaja, fooavag viowlqgfk goocod."*
---
That part got me. Not gonna lie.
---
does not makes sense, machine should not accept items if it can't pay. and i have no idea where you can see the amount of script the machine has, i can only see how much i can still get from the daily 150
---
i suppose they did get the bounty for a reason
---
I'll gladly keep being a wuss. Saves my thumbs and gets me easy caps and aid off of you
---
I mean technically yeah, it is. I've been avoiding that bit because I keep hoping they will give Prince a bigger tank.
---
Uranium fever guarantee 3 legendary.  White springs, hord events, randoms, and pretty much anything you do
---
Ok I’ll have a look, thanks!
---
I got royally fist fucked by Murmrgh... traded about 15 Legendaries including a three star TSE.. 
---
Went for a *** Ranged weapon for 100 scrip...  hoping for a nice TSE hunting rifle or something...
---
Got a bullshit fucking .44 revolver that does +30 damage to Animals.. BFD.   Way to fuck me over Bethesda.  100 scrip for a revolver that is only worth 40.
---
The PlayStation isn’t the problem, so you just wasted money. The problem is with Bethesda’s servers and the stability of the game itself.
---
If no one else joins there are much fewer mobs attacking the cows just by being there you make it much harder on the others even more so when you arbitrarily decide that you are doing this part of a task and not the other because  . . . . . .  reasons.
---
I mean its a free world and you can do what you like but people will also be free to call you out as an arsehole for doing so.
---
"Good morning! Vault-Tec calling!"
---
And yet you assumed I only have 100 hours of time in. 
---
Fact is the amount of time put into it doesn't entitle anybody to the best of rewards. The scrip system has given everybody a better shot at gaining them. 
---
If you have limited time to game then you can either accept that certain things will take time to gain or if you are that keen, then you figure out a way to maximise it given the constraints.  I don't see what is so difficult to understand about that. Nothing comes free and without a bit of effort. Even in games that's just how it works.
---
Okay but the ui very clearly indicates how much gold a vendor has. When a vendors at zero, that's it. You can't keep blindly trading your items for nothing. If you don't see the difference and nothing wrong with it there's not much more I can say to make that clearer. You're clearly bent on proving me wrong or saying it's somehow my fault, and that is the bane of this entire subreddit honestly. Any remotely negative thread with valid concerns about bugs that should not be occurring gets instantly contested and the OP has to like defend their post from all the people making these ridiculous assumptions that something "simply" went wrong on their end, or they made a mistake. It's ridiculous and serves nobody. By the way when I relogged the machine limit at 63 so your point is moot anyway.
---
im on xbox, im pretty sure I go it.
---
I thought bugthesda stated when releasing the game it would be pvp / pve mixed. I dont do pvp but dont mind it. This game is really turning into a single player game
---
was buying 3 star armour. kept getting mutant slayer armour.
---
Never used, have none in storage.
---
Give me stuff I have been using not 5 almost identical items that I have never ever used.
---
Until they fix this bug never buy armor from the legendary vendor if there is zero scrip in the machine.
---
Accumulate scrip; next day buy from vendor; if get wood then sell for scrip; sell all unwanted legendaries; wait a day.  Rinse, repeat.
---
If you’re on PS4 I won’t be on for a while but I’m happy to let you kill me 20 times
---
Because they were stapled to a chicken.
---
If you don’t mind, can you link your perk build? I’m really torn about which ones to pick to maximize damage..
---
Yes, it's worth it. 100%. Assuming you like Fallout, the online element is not a concern, I play almost exclusively Solo and I'm really enjoying this new Fallout. Much better now since launch.
---
Pvp in equal terms would be great. But with legendary effects, no thank you. I fail to see to see the logic behind worldwide PvP, when you take a workshop. Outside of the workshop I have no incentive to defend the patch of grass I stand on. And if you are not after the extractors or resources, which there is no guarantee I have on me, you have no incentive to attack. Also destroying people's camp when they clearly do not want to engage in PvP is griefing.
---
When someone attacked you and they lost, thats on them. But since this game only protects level 5, only pure luck can protect the passive players from you if it weren't the changes applied in this patch.
---
You might wanna hold off on trying for armor as Wood armor is in the trade table, and it's been reported that getting 3\* Wood armor turns into 1\* upon relogging. So if you try for a 3\* armor piece, you're at risk of ending up with a 1\* and losing on scrip in the re-exchange.
---
Nothing to 'avoid' because that part is bugged anyway. It literally makes zero difference to gameplay whether you make it or not.
---
I really would love more CAMP budget, but I don't think it would be good for the server stability.
---
no better way to find out if you will enjoy or not than to play. 
---
but i can say that with the last updates that we got it feels like a different game, bugs are still present, and you will get the disconnected, or crash to dashboard once in a while specially right after an update. 
---
but give it a try, you might find yourself enjoying the game.
---
yesss "accident" \*shifty eyes\* but yeah i was on a US server and i was Uk and i honestly didnt target the bases haha but again sorry
---
Absolutely agree!
---
I was at like maybe 52% I should have taken a pic of the health stats as well. I hear you but it used to work fine at 50 to 60%.
---
As you can see I have most weapons and I started with the tse version of most and traded up. Each time I would check the damage and they did more until a few weeks a go when I got a tse pistol and smg. It was then I noticed that they were doing more damage than my bloodied versions at that health level. 
---
I still feel that I shouldn't have to be at close to 20% with perk cards to deal ever so slightly more damage on some weapons but there you go. It seems the lower the initial damage of the weapon the less use it is now to a bloodied build. For example if you want to use a pistol or smg having the bloodied version is pointless even at 20% health as the damage you gain is minuscule vs the trade off of no health. Things like levers or handmade are better but still they used to do more damage than they do now. Ah well.
---
Ironic how you say no one can here anything over pacifist player crying. 🤷‍♀️
---
You literally have 5 complete end game sets. Like unyileding sentinel kind of end game. That's just amazing
---
I’m all for introducing a new enclosure, but I don’t want them to scrap this one. This is a video game, and Prince isn’t real (sorry guys, I know this is tough for you). This item makes for an amusing item on a shelf. When we can put junk down this will look great alongside the scorched bits in jars.
---
yeah i got 5 cap bounties early on because of this, the fingergun emote seems to be a good idea though i will try it thanks
---
I get the reason why there is finite space for combat perks and other strategic perks such as weight carrying / armour durability and so forth. Creating a finite amount of spaces forces players to make strategic choices.
---
However, non combat perks such as ammo crafting, base building etc should all be passive. There is no strategic point in having to switch between commando perk, for example, an ramp crafting.
---
Put posts on here asking for players to help, or just play the game and forget about atoms. They're not exactly necessary. I've not bothered since they started making challenges instead of getting rewarded them for things like scrapping etc.
---
This was confirmed to be a bug and will be fixed sooner or later.
---
are you in pc? i am interested for the coat &lt;3
---
PvP in this game is dead on arrival with insane imbalance, should not be here at all.
---
Your 3rd point is pure bullshit. If I am not at the workshop - I dont want to defend it, so attackers should not be able to kill me halfway across the map.
---
My verdict: 6/10 at launch, 8.5/10 now and I honestly believe 10/10 by the end of this year.
---
Lots of the criticism it received is valid, some of its is unrelated - IMO marketing team fuckups does not reflect on actual game - and big portion of it is simply fake news. I had my RL friends laugh at me when I admitted I play this game, then went out ranting about what they seen said on Youtube what simply did NEVER happened. Not saying all criticism is bullshit, but frankly, by volume, most of it is.
---
Its getting a major tweak and update every two-three weeks. It started glitchy, and aint bug free, but there are no major game-breaking bugs as of now, major gameplay change was released yesterday and a major location is getting released next week. Previous time major game change was released is the beggining of this month - completely new equipment category, backpacks.
---
This game is not dead, doesn't seem to be dying, on the contrary, it keeps being improved. There are no PC trials, but as a CD key can be bought for about 15$ its just simply worth this money.
---
Did you like Mass Effect (1-3)? I did. It was a great RPG game. I spent like 600h on these three games in a single playthrough.
---
I'm now above 800h in F76 and when I go asleep I review my plans for next day, and more often than not part of these plans are F76 plans. F76 aint as good RPG as F1-FNV. Imagine if Apex Legends and F3 had a baby, and F3 gone MIA leaving Apex to raise that baby. As a result you got one of world's most funky and interesting shooters with a world full of superb environmental storytelling pieces. The story is not spoonfed and is mostly a series of flashbacks, but its good enough to make you wonder about the conditions of these people when you are falling asleep.
---
Yea.. saw it pop up last night and didnt even bother attempting because no one was around.
---
I do not understand why anyone would want to destroy someone's CAMP in either mode, unless they are an angry little child raging at everyone that is.
---
Read somewhere once... or maybe made it up in my head... not sure which.
---
However I believe the explanation for the lack of spiders is that they still exist but instead of mutating into some big monstrosity they instead shrank to almost being invisible from their size.
---
My fix for this was to make a power shed for my camp. Wired all the lights/turrets/buildings to different switches. But powering them off and on real quick fixes them
---
Binding items would ruin the player vending.
---
that's the problem, they could be a new player might have gotten the bounty by accident and i don't them thinking that fallout 76 is just a PVP game when we have such a great community that's always willing to help each other
---
They added the same ones you get from the tourists to some containers and they can be repaired at a Tinkers Workbench (they list in the Misc tab and not as junk).
---
You're pissed you can't play the way you want, because all the many people you wanted to attack finally get to play the way they want?   
---
Why are you so entitled?   
---
There's an entire game mode designed to cater to you, but you would rather bottom feed on unprepared people who do not want to PVP and usually can't even fight back because of the pacifist toggle?
---
Nope. Not had this. I only play in Adventure Mode though.
---
Even better...
---
After completing an event, let us track it more actively.  As in; it already goes into it's own Events tab in the pipboy.  We can give function to it's form by allowing flagged events, when they appear, to do the flourish like Encryptid &amp; Scorched Earth do.
---
Then similarly if you don't have an event flagged, it won't flourish.
---
It isn't that they can't do it in other ways; like with the Sons of Dane compound and One Violent Night event, where pretty much every time it's nightfall, the radio pop up appears and you can expect to just hop over there and do it real quick.  There doesn't really need to be *only* a flourish like Encryptid/Scorched Earth, but some way to notify us of *the events we actually want to do*.
---
;;
---
As an aside, it wouldn't hurt to add Camden Park daily to the tracker, alongside Biv &amp; Campfire Scouts, the Forest/Responders daily (or dailies), etc etc.  Overall that whole terminal is neat and great, but only having 3 "daily status" trackers on it is annoying when there's several other dailies around.
---
I got nothing of any real use so far but i am more than happy with how its working.It has made me farm more than normal as i know even if i only loot some meh drops i can trade it in and try again.
---
I enjoy playing pvp in survival, sometimes I get mopped. But I've built my camp based on pvp, I've built traps and pits and made it like a fortress. I used to get on the leader board and wait for the mobs of people coming to attack me and my base. But now that my base can't be destroyed nobody even tries once they show up, so it really switched the game up for me. I can't use my base at all like how I was. Really don't enjoy the game as much because of it, basically because people can't destroy my base
---
That makes no sense at all. If PlayStation really had connectivity issues. It would be a known fact and Sony would have already addressed it by now.
---
I play other online games and the only game I consistently experience connectivity issues on a daily basis is with Fallout 76.
---
West tec is pretty nice too
---
Tinkers bench.
---
you're so butthurt you dont even notice what a whimsey whiney douche you made out of yourself with your posts
---
I would be happy with base requirements for each perk, you have that they can all be loaded.
---
how? like fallout 4, you have the luck for mysterious stranger, you can have that perk and have it loaded, you don't you cant.
---
change the perks to be based apon minimum to use, and simply let it go at that.
---
want a strength build, at 15 strength, have all perks on and usable, but by having it so high, other perks cant be loaded under other stats due to not being able to get them high enough.
---
Ditto
---
They believe they have an inherent right to be outraged and offended. Really it's because they have never had to struggle or fight for anything, hence why they get so fervent about the things they believe matter.
---
i am on ps4 but i don't know if it has to be 20 different players but if you are willing to try my PSN is blaine_anderson i will be online later thanks
---
Neat!
---
NO U
---
So you ruined your own experience.  
---
I'm not a competitive person/player so I don't feel the need to be "top of the tree" or however you might say.
---
Yeah I'd say if you left their junk alone it'd be cool. The low bounties I'm sure are usually gotten by accident or lack of knowledge that lockpicking makes you wanted. But if they have like a 500+ cap bounty I'm sure they were just being an irradiated toenail and you have every right to kill em. :)
---
Sounds like it's corrupted somehow. Would contact support
---
yes you were and it wasnt me lol
---
Quite a lot less sad than my experience this week when I decided to grind workshops for plans with my alt at about lvl 18. I took the lakeside cabins, the airport and the junk yard nearby. When going to the junk yard I get a defend mission but being overencumbered I ignored it. When I was defending the just taken junkyard a level 100-something shows up and I think, well  do he want to join in the defence? But he was just waiting for his team mate the lvl 70-something to show up and kill me. Ad surely he took my loot. I know that I set myself up for PvP by taking workshops, but I didn't really think that players that much higher level would kick at such low level character.
---
I'm thinking that if I had been a new player at that level I would have been seriously turned off from the game and that kind of behaviour is going to damage the future of this game. But since the only thing they did to the workshops was add lvl 0 locks to the extractors I had built but not adding any where I had not, I got the feeling that they just wanted to PvP but not on equal terms.
---
The PvPers in adventure mode are the absolute worst. They are not good enough to do it on survival. They only succeed when they are prepared and their victim is not and they outmatch them at least 3 to 1 in in level.
---
Most players are nice. Some are great. A select few are the absolute worst.
---
Medical wing, just the info I needed, cheers :)
---
Assasin/sentinel (well it was complete until yesterday as I traded one piece), assassin cavalier, weightless sentinel, unyielding sentinel, two imprezobus(tm) funky mixes that are imo better than any complete set could be, and like a 10 more random godroll pieces.
---
I have been trading extensively and on my roads met a researcher just as good as me, and even a better trader. Better trader guy is gonna be a father soon, so I took over his account and his wares. The deal is that I'm gonna keep trading the non-unique-and-infinitely-valuable gear and if/when he returns I'm gonna split my stuff with him. This served us both well before, there was a point in which he held 100% of my tradable items and exchanged them for stuff our collection lacked. In that period I focused heavily on math game research, so while he kept us equipped, I kept us informed, and that allowed us to stockpile on stuff before it rose to value, so that we could expand our collection further.
---
One pro-tip is that while there are pieces of publicly known value I hold, there are also many more that people haven't come up with a playstyle for yet, or dont know how they work, and they are still fairly cheap. That was my specialization, while he focused on things that were expensive, I looked out for new things to become expensive in the future.
---
The other pro-tip is to gang up and to actively seek knowledge. This is this game most important currency.
---
I’m zuperfly1 it doesn’t have to be different players me and a friend did it a while back and just killed each other 20 times so unless they’ve changed it you’re all good. 
---
If we could just work out how many caps I lose from it that’d be good because I’m like lvl 75 so don’t fancy losing 1500 caps lol
---
Exactly my philosophy. Especially if theyre within twenty or so levels under my 60. They know exactly what they did. If it's any above that, they should know by now to just fast travel to vault with an empty junk tab and wait to be killed. Not my problem.
---
Not sure what your saying. I don't feel any need to be top of a tree. Except that when your on the top of the leader board you show up on the map. Then people come to kill you (it's pvp). If I'm at my camp I use it to defend myself. I enjoy that. making it so you can't destroy my camp changes the game in a negative way for me. That's all
---
Whitsprings after a nuke has dropped is the best of the best.... not all 3\* obviously but sooo many 1\* drops - even from non-legendary baddies.
---
Some of the easier challenges have a higher payout than the harder ones too,they need to fix the challenge reward amts. if 100 points is about equal to 1.00$ then I’m spending way to much time trying to make 40 cents lol
---
Framed photos would be nice, but I don't see them working, it's just another thing that would impact server stability, I mean for you alone maybe not so bad, but for other players visiting your CAMP, FO76 would need to access your photos on your system (PC or Console) which is outside the main servers, and relay that to them, in their server. I'm no server expert, but it just screams lag or instability.
---
It wasn’t, but thanks for agreeing anyway
---
Multiple load-outs I could get behind.  The whole "passive cards" crud, not so much.
---
There is a new workbench idea; Photoshop tables!
---
And I just went and checked the main page for it and there wasn’t any posts, like there weren’t any on there for me when I made this
---
Here is what I think is a good heavy gunner-power armor build:
---
\[Fallout 76 Build with 15/3/5/4/15/6/8\]([https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#Aw4CBAMOBQcBAQEHAQMHCQ0PBihPAycCJQHwAQM7Aw0D0AEBfgNwBZgBA1QDCwM5A5kBA7QBAnED6gEDNgIkAxkDAA==](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#Aw4CBAMOBQcBAQEHAQMHCQ0PBihPAycCJQHwAQM7Aw0D0AEBfgNwBZgBA1QDCwM5A5kBA7QBAnED6gEDNgIkAxkDAA==))
---
Also constantly attract bloatflys.
---
There wasn’t any warnings about this on the main screen for me when I posted this. So??
---
That really seems like something they should fix.
---
Ive got a ton of carnivore serums if ya want to switch up that food situation :)
---
I find you deeply disturbing
---
This advice is golden. The best minor by far is reduced weight, so unless you’re really encumbered, two-star seems the way to go.
---
That vaultboy watching....giving me ideas
---
Pls explain what disturbs you, i can't see it
---
yeah you can't get a large bounty like that by accident
---
Thats definetly some weird kind of humor
---
The floor goes in 2 different directions ಠ_ಠ
---
That was my thinking tbh
---
I know, it just boggled my mind, that's all. People seem to think I like bugs, as a QA, that's a hard no.
---
Well that's fine tbh, as long as I get some caps out of selling the gunpower and bullets im not overly bothered lol
---
im level 150 or so we could kill each other and see what the difference in caps is so that you don't lose out plus i can give you some junk and i have might still have a 3* weapon you can have as well
---
Also the rad roach meat can spoil so get that last.
---
Especially if they're fresh out the vault and it's a 5c bounty. Gotta teach them while they're young.
---
I like that idea, I do message people offers (Mostly on ammo) but hardly anyone ever replies.
---
To add to the advice given here if you happen to have a explosive weapon you can blast out all the mainframe cores within no time at all, especially with an explosive shotgun.
---
Jup...yesterday two assaultron heads 3 stars...and logged off because daily scrip limit reached...
---
And reading today on reddit, that assaultron head and wood armor are glitched.
---
And probably(99%) screwed again...just my luck
---
I'm not in any way trying to blast your point, but didn't this get patched out in the last one? Isn't it now that you can only initiate pvp with the person inside the workshop itself if that person who took it is there? I hope I worded that in a way that makes sense, I just woke up.
---
OP is full of shite and obviously doesn't play the mod or even possibly the game.
---
Passive mod in survival DOES NOT make you inmortal.
---
Yeah I hear that a lot
---
Go for bloodied with unyielding
---
You have been reported to the Pun Police
---
This post, a helpful post. Wanting to be able to launch three nukes on my own on a single server in on day at some point in the future, the four keycards I have are burning a hole in my pocket.
---
The Insult Bot hit me with a joke yesterday! He said to me, "Knock knock... who's there? An organic lifeform with a finite lifespan. ZING!" 
---
He's the Rodney Dangerfield of the Wasteland, folks! It's the way he tells them that makes them so good, and he gets no respect at all!
---
Some kind of weird wizardry! Nuke him.
---
How many friends do you have? If you have a lot this may cause this. I heard this from a player who had to delete 300 friends and then he got back in. At your own risk if you delete your friends and I cannot confirm this works. Good luck
---
The Whitespring, West Tek, Huntersville, Robco, NAR, the rail yard east of Watoga are all places that reliably spawn starred legendaries. Your mileage may vary with some sites so you may have to hop a little, but they have to be starred to count.
---
and how do you keep your hp low,  radiations&gt;?   thank you.
---
I have done this event 3 times and failed it 3 times FeelsbBadMan
---
Nope. I remember the first deathclaw I met in FO3 was in the basement of a hospital, and I managed to run for a door and close it. It eventually opened the door and kept swiping away from the other side, but couldn't get through.
---
lol ok, yeah the 20% is nice but is it worth it, you can easy have that in adventure too and dont have to worry about ppl as much as in adventure.
---
Rifles are very good atm. I do 560 damage with my tse gauss rifle
---
Jealousy is ugly
---
Enters door in Whitsepring, starts sprinting immediately, gets teleported back to door.
---
I've read that too. Apparently it's if you log out. Mine would've just gone straight in the blender though.
---
Damn those are some rare items Kappa
---
really? omg thats crazy 😂😂😂
---
WAIT WHAT
---
Rowches can fly IRL? Sweet fucken jesus that's terrifying
---
Some just don't know what they've got for sale.
---
Got an Instigating Gatling Gun for just over 400c from a guy who had mostly trash and then this beauty.
---
okey thanks i will check them out
---
The Enclave shows their mercy as they always do:
---
Thank you for your service. Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!  ;)
---
Facts, I'll watch as mole rats eat your bed.
---
Oh hell, those are insane legendary effects for a gatling gun - anti armor, which is good on any weapon, 250 damage resistance while reloading, which is useful when reloading in the middle of being shot at, but the faster fire rate is the best one because gatling guns' fire rate is very bad, and the faster fire rate really helps in damage per second.
---
omg really? thats crazy😂😂😂
---
I would like to feel his pain, but my 3* wood leg feels nothing.
---
Beats the endless rolling pins I seem to be getting!
---
Gonna have to agree here. Until or if they give us dedicated servers, that likely just won't happen without a serious amount of communication, either by invite chaining until a server is just full of people trying to group up together, everyone being in area chat, or everyone using some kind of third party service, like discord. This goes doubly for console, where even if people have microphones, they don't like to talk and seem oblivious to emote charades. Does PC even have a text chat??
---
Pogchamp
---
I would use this broadsider. You still have? Sts
---
A man of culture as well
---
It is the quest that gives you access to Whitespring bunker and the ability to launch nukes
---
i don't think you know it is Enclave until you get inside- you are just following up on something about Senator Blackwell, so you may want to look for that instead
---
(seems like you want to experience it more organically, so don' wan to give he start location away, at any rate, there are tons of youtube walkthroughs I am sure)
---
Turning into mothman?
---
Jup 80% radiation and 20% gives Bloodied weapons Max power :)
---
nice collection
---
*20%hp
---
Still bugged here in the future.
---
Ohh ok I get what you are saying.
---
Why? I'm.not following.
---
I agree.
---
I find your disturbed state disturbing.
---
Does Talon work on Melee? I thought it was just Power Fist, Knuckle, &amp; Unarmed.
---
Try the auto receiver first, if not happy rifles are pretty good, handmade or lever action
---
i play both pve and pvp. let me just start with that.
---
1. hitting a workshop then killing a person across map is __not contesting/fighting for a workshop__, its greifing, not "workshop pvp."  
---
2. the cap nerf was good and filled the survical servers more, high levels who were losing 200+ caps a death and only gaining 30 back per kill,  not a fun time for them. reversing this will kill servers again and you will see nothing but those low level toons farming that 20% exp.
---
3. sentinel nerf is tiny compared to past nerfs and you should not be relying on 1 OP armor effect as a crutch
---
4.nobody carries items: yup, blaming beth here for a community problem
---
5. camp is the only solid argument you have, and i agree it should be destructible in SURVIVAL
---
got em
---
Same.here. Spawn in on people all the time.
---
それ英語ｗｗｗｗ
---
Brtiain approves.
---
Don’t feel to bad, I was excited until I received a 3* sickle, 3*lead pipe, 3*Bowie knife,  44 magnum and a gun and a 3* railway rifle.  Completely disappointed but I will go back and try to stay positive
---
was just going to say that lol
---
No
---
Stat modifiers have no bearing on how many cards you can slot
---
Yep. Different door. One I never noticed till a few weeks ago myself. Haha
---
I had this, weirdly it fixed itself when i got into my power armour, so i guess keep a chassis spare.
---
Let get ‘im, boys...
---
power fists is  melee yes,  it does work.  also there is a 20% dmg card you can use in the str tree for it as well.
---
Try getting into a power armour chassis, for some reason this worked for me with the same glitch.
---
Same here but was already at the daily scrip limit that day...
---
It'd be hard to actually fire full auto but numerous people have fired 50 cal machine guns from the hip before in short bursts, i don't know rules about linking content on this sub but fullmag on youtube has a video on it if you wanna see https://youtu.be/U1mG9Yf9yQ0
---
This is how big power armor was in FO3 and New Vegas lol.
---
Well this ruins it for me cause I have no one to really play with so I team with randoms but now that this is happening
---
I will make a in-deph guide for my char (updated) soon. I will sent it to you when its done.
---
The Burrows.
---
Thank you so much! 
---
And how it really affects me? 
---
I mean if i still have the cards on strenght, how this -4 points works?
---
Bloodied with swing speed for melee
---
I'm with you. I rotate concrete floors to break up the pattern, I make sure wood grain floors are lined up so that the floorboards blend together properly (along with reversing the direction of adjacent floors to again break up the pattern), and I even rotate my crops around so they don't all have the same orientation. It's the details, man!
---
But if someone bought 20 caps worth of GP from you, then I guess they'd take 2 caps.
---
I was thinking that they'll only take 10% from sales of 10 caps and above.
---
Thanks for the heads up. It is a shame. I invite random people to team up just because you can. You can get stuck in your own rut and seeing what other people are doing is a good way to do something different.
---
Kinda wishing that they take the whole pvp out of adventure... but that view is also partly cos of the constant numtties that want to pvp when I try to do the 'starting rock hound' mission. Had 5 150+ guys turn up just to pvp me... if that's all you want, hit the survival server.
---
okey thanks
---
Considering the steaming shite she's given me, I'm pretty sure she's still hostile.  Albeit in a passive-aggressive sort of way.
---
Just like a REAL Grandma!
---
I got a stalkers bone club with faster swing speed. I don’t know if I should be happy or not
---
Bloodied is greater risk for greater reward. It will get you far better damage than Anti-Armor, and it synergizes with a ton of other low-health buffs to make for the highest damage build in the game... but you're giving up a *lot* of health to make up for that, and it can be a pain to stay alive. 
---
Anti-Armor is just a good general purpose effect, you don't need to bend your build in any specific way to utilize it. You get diminishing returns from stacking various armor penetration effects though, so it might not be the best choice if say, it's a melee weapon and you've got the Incisor perk.
---
Wow, such empty.... I guess everyone loves EATT
---
That's mostly right, but the one NW of Twin Pines is the unusable junk  Royal Jelly. I can canfirm I got the aid kind from the 2 other spots though.
---
Nerf it?????
---
I only got junk and he pays back less than half.
---
It's disturbing how disturbed I am at the disturbingly amount of disturbed people here.
---
yes i need to see it.
---
I got this : https://imgur.com/a/2Q7kdkB
---
I never crafted Ultracite guns and don't know shit about laser, is it as good as i think ?
---
Does the railway rifle fall under rifles or heavy weapons?
---
I know where it is.  I havent received one...
---
Wouldn't mind a notification section in settings with a list of the events and the ability to toggle notifications on or off for whichever I am interested in.
---
Ok thanks alot, so the bloodied can also be more superior than anti-armour in PvP? Or is it the other way around
---
Don't think anyone can top this one
---
way better than my summerset special, so , if you don't want it, throw it in my direction.
---
If you think your luck is bad, you really don't want mine.
---
cheers

---
Well it’s best that you have bloodied rifles, and then you can stack them with the adrenal reaction mutation
---
It hurt my brain typing it...
---
The stupidly simple solution is the same as mods in Fo4: Let hazmat work under armor.
---
Same goes for US-centric Tadpole exams. 
---
I get it fits the scenario but some allowances would be nice.
---
Got to balance these purveyor tales out...
---
1000 script. 10 3 star ranged weapon rolls. 9 pieces of garbage... and one instigating shotgun that I may try out... the rest...
---
Some gamma gun. Hunters exploding pipe pistol. Two 10mms. A robot killing crossbow. Can't even recall the other 4 they were that dull... 
---
For every 'great roll' there are probably ten poor ones we're not being told about...
---
It's nothing to do with pemmican. You have to collect 15 bones while wearing a fedora hat.
---
So your biggest issue with -4 str, is it’s going to hit your carry weight
---
1str = 5carry points if I recall correctly
---
Was just thinking this yesterday.
---
I would really love private servers that's not through Bethesda.
---
Only invited players would ensure that the idea of that server would be followed and my idea would be immersion. Don't use discord, only area voice. Talk as your character. (No I don't mind male/female voice mismatch.) Actually role play your character.
---
I would want to remove all legendaries from the game. This would remove a lot of meta-play from the game and let you focus on things actually in-world. Yes, I could modify your reciever in different ways, but looking for magical effects that makes two exact copies of a weapon totally different in how you would use them? No.
---
I would want a persistent world with all building staying on the server. You can place your CAMP and it will stay there while you are off-line. Walls and some stuff would be indestructable even from environment and some stuff like turrets, defences, crops and stuff could still be damaged.
---
I would want to change lots conserning the building system too. Place everywhere definately! There would be an understanding though that a CAMP that defies physics get you kicked off the server.
---
I'm guessing my heaven would be others hell and that's why private servers would be fantastic. Let us do our thing and not bother others!
---
Wow!
---
* Fixer is mentioned in a terminal at Med-Tek
---
* Cabot mentions an alien city under the Mojave

* The slot machines introduced in the Vault DLC are pretty much identical to NV's slot machines.
---
...as for more important references: Boston is one end of the United States, to the East, New Vegas is at the other end of the United States, on the West. How could people in the Commonwealth know what's going on in Nevada? Why would they care? Hell, some people didn't even know who the Brotherhood is, despite DC is closer to Boston than Vegas.
---
This 'hurr Bethesda hates Obsidian' is just idiotic.
---
How does it happend? Can not imagine how.
---
no you must earn it. i have the refrigerator mod it is amazing and freed up 2 perk points  in luck
---
Yes but very risky
---
I keep getting Tesla rifles. Don’t use Tesla rifles but RNG seems to think I like them.
---
It is worth noting many players will have substantially more armor than most npc’s
---
Every weapon has a Real life counterpart as far as I can See,  Minimum the balistic weapon. For laser, plasma not sure
---
Bloodied explosive*
---
Can we have a notification to remind people to DEFEND THE BRAHMIN after the Baa-squanch has spawned..? 
---
Oh, that’s right, we already have one (!!) 😏
---
Repair kits were a handy feature I feel no need or urge to purchase change my mind
---
It’s almost 1:1 but it’s a bit off. I think it’s like 0.9%:1%.
---
It really varies. I just visited a camp where the person had listed the legendaries for the default prices. In another camp I saw them listed in the ‘000s. 
---
I put mine in for 500c per star, plus a bit depending on features/build.
---
If they don’t sell in a few days then I reduce prices.
---
Was dropping it for a buddy of mine and while we were both fixing our stuff he grabbed em and fast traveled to him, We tried trading but it kept exiting out. We both weren’t starving we even server hopped to see if that was the case and it wasn’t 
---
This was also at his camp too
---
If they don’t sell in a few days then I’ll reduce prices.
---
This isn’t even that bad
---
corn soup for you
---
X-01 has the highest radiation protection. But you might be better off using regular armour with lead lining and RadShield on
---
Speed Demon, marsupial &amp; eagle eyes are the main ones. You can always add carnivore/herbivore depending on your preference in food. 
---
I recently added bird bones &amp; adrenal reaction to my rifle build which works well in most situations
---
X-01 has the highest rad resist.
---
Not too hard to find people selling the plan. I seen two. One for 12500 and like 8k which I bought. Idk why but when I learned the plan and applied it to my backpack I think I was given another copy of the plan.. selling it on PC if you're interested
---
He thought you are duper, he took your things and threw it in fisure site. Also this is witchhunting, you facked up...
---
At least it has a low weight so you can store it for scrapping tomorrow. My sniper got 8 of 10 worthless heavy weapons, nothing like 150 weight of worthless 3 star weapons you have to carry for days because you can only re scrap 3 a day. I wish I got 10 crap handguns.
---
you scraped it
---
How about a Ghoul Slayers Gammer gun. Gives health to the Ghouls lol.
---
Building in this game just absolutely sucks.
---
I have my Decon shower attached to a switch. No one turns it off. Ever. Hell, half the people flip it on and then don't even use it and end up just running away. It's like they look at it...
---
"Hey what's this switch do?"
---
\*Flip it\* 
---
"Oh that's boring... Oh look a squirrel!"
---
\*Off they run\*
---
It's not meant to be perfectly divisible
---
I didn't ask what I should do to get it. I asked for help. I know how to acquire plans but if someone willing to give the plan for a minute I'll be glad. Because of a bug you don't need to use plan. You just need to have it in your inventory to be able to craft high capacity mod for backpack.
---
I always take the adds at the end (after tagging, obviously), but let people know over mic beforehand so there's some strategy to things, at least.
---
Would you mind sharing? Or at least tell us which are the best and why
---
People can already roll 1.5 3 stars a day, farming up 150 scrip isn't that hard. Biv's quest is for neat side stuff not the best gear in the game. Want to roll a single star per day side quest? Fine that's cool. You're asking for a free easy 3 star **per day**. To put that into context, beth are making people do convoluted (usually, sometimes they're easy) weekly challenges in pvp mode for 3 stars. That's one per week from a series of challenges in the more dangerous server. No they're not going to give away a free 3 star per day lol.
---
That's what I was wondering about . How-to survive a nuke zone without PA ? Yesterday a level 32 was runing in the nuke zone without his PA . IS's the lead lining the only good rad resistance armor ? Do you need all pieces ?
---
Haha I’d love to know how after reading that you think I’m a duper??? What’re you smoking
---
Being able to see and loot corpses reasonably easy should not require a perk.
---
Your customers will dictate if your prices are too high, they just won’t sell over time. I find a really good resource are the reddit marketplaces. Use the search feature and find what things have sold for. Even still, I keep my prices lower than reddit because here you have a wide market if people looking for specific things. Unless you advertise what you’re selling, what you get in-game are curious browsers. Prices have to be low to get people to pull the trigger on something they didn’t specifically come to purchase.
---
Big picture: sell as low as you can. You’re not using it, and it frees up space in your stash!
---
Happened to me with two 3* salvaged assualtron heads and a 3* wood piece of armor.
---
somebody on another thread brought up that ranged weapons you're better off going with 2 stars, being that the third star is usually not very good. I don't if this is true, but it would save some scrip.
---
I absolutely love photo mode. The camera is awesome and I always have it on me because I love wandering the wastes taking pictures. But I'm also a solo player, I have zero(0) friends to play with and no interest in making new ones so I just ignore any challenge that requires another player. I'm fine with all the camera challenges because they *could* be fun but instead most of them just require you to travel to a certain spot with another player and get free atoms. That's not fun.
---
A notification for the free range event would be nice. I have tried to do it a few times and only half the time at most other ppl show up.
---
I just paid 13 000 for a weapon i have been looking for for a long time. AA/E .50cal heavy barrel. 
---
Might have been ripped off.
---
At least make it 160 so I can turn in 4 garbage 3* weapons a day.
---
This is the kind of gun you rip out for a tough monster, it's not a bread and butter gun, it's your trump card. 
---
 Congrats!
---
Yeah I had it all boarded up too, I was running around trying to find a way in but I couldn’t. Then I got to the front and it was open suddenly with people inside. Bethesda did a good job in my opinion at making this new vendor balanced but they had to fuck something up or they wouldn’t be Bethesda.
---
Maybe it’s similar to how camps take a while to spawn in as well as enemies in places like the whitesprings.
---
Doesn't really matter tbh. You're still going to be chugging radaway every other minute or so. I prefer excavator for the weight.
---
I got a level 5 berserker's pipe find (ew) on one of my mules last night, so not always.
---
Couple of questions - thanks for the video, thinking of doing my first silo run this weekend.
---
1. How much steel and circuits do you need for the repairs?
---
2. How do you get 3.5x sneak attack? I have 2.5 on the maxes card?
---
They taint all discussion about weapon condition or repair.
---
Example:  I posted an idea that laser weapons should have triple durability but require harder to find components to fix.  Someone immediately replied "make weapons harder to repair and sell repair kits for real money."
---
Even though it would be a good balance and make sense from a realism perspective, (since lasers don't have moving parts) someone immediately brought up repair kits, and rightfully so.  They take design and balance decisions and turn them into revenue decisions.
---
&gt; a frigging legendary sheepsquatch appeared.
---
I've only done the event 4 times because it's hardly worth doing, but this always happens. Some of the other mobs have changed from run to run, but I usually get wolves &gt; yao guai &gt; sheepsquatch with bloodbugs at the same time. I haven't had any issues soloing it though.
---
Saved plan maybe
---
PC
---
I'm finding that over 2000 is too much.
---
Voice RP is not my thing but more power to you!
---
At least do 160. One weapon, one armor.
---
Its better than dropping the bullets on the ground lol. As long as I get something out of it I don't really mind. I just want the caps to start going round buying all the plans I don't have.
---
completly depends on your prefered tactics. A shotgun pretty useless at long range \_ a sniper rifle gets you killed at close quarters.
---
But you can always fiddle with the combat shot at next to no expense. Fiddle.
---
personally, i'm rifles, but always carry a combat shot gun.
---
I'm sure your also aware, that the stats on weapons is not all there is, swapping in a auto reciever shits on the damage , AND  penetration.
---
If you swap to rifles, carefull to make them all hardened recievers and penetrating mags,
---
the difference is substantial.
---
you might get both.....shotguns and rifles are in different specials - what price are you willing to pay, cos something has to give.
---
I've never done it anything but solo and I don't have any issues. I don't have any god tier weapons either. All my stuff is 1 star and I wear excavator PA, so not super defense either.
---
I get it in my head a lot. Argh.
---
Yeah, I know right? This thing must be heavy!
---
That’s about the price range for that weapon.
---
In 1st century BC, Publilius Syrus wrote: "Something is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it".
---
Thanks for the tip! 👍
---
I hope you stub your toe against a wall.
---
Rifles are great, with my stealth sniper build, I'll two shot a level 68 super mutant with a hardened lever action rifle. If I get a headshot at night with mr sandman I'll oneshot them.

---
Unfortunately you have to follow the trends, what weapons were heavily duped and what is still rare
---
Great now i feel better.
---
Nope, the 3* Ghoul Slayer gamma gun I got yesterday is the. worst. ever.
---
Yeah I know that, I just mean in general
---
Every time i've done that event the max number of people i've had join is 3. every other time i've only had about 1 other person there.
---
What platform?
---
No laser weapons could use a large durability buff. Odd they are using that to milk cash outta people since they just buffed a ton of weapon durabilities 🤔
---
Bummer! Hopefully you get a better roll soon!
---
Xbox one
---
I actually tend to agree. I also think it's fair to warn people about it here too. I'm not a raider myself but it's kind of interesting to know there are threats other than the ones created by Bethesda.
---
Which is exactly my plan. I'll happily take the hit to carry weight if it means I can run both a spoilage reduction effect and Cannibal at the same time.
---
Or you can just add a skin. If you already have one on, remove it and then reattach it. It counts as modding. That's what I did.
---
How about we stop begging for bethesda to hold our hands, and just play the game?
---
That's awesome for you bud, but some of us are not really happy with the garbage we got back after feeding the grinder the all garbage the mobs have been giving us.
---
Given the framework three have established for the legendary vendor, I would like to see additional price points  to get more specific with the loot table.
---
E.G. it's 100 script for a 3* ranged. Add a 150 level for 3* firearm or energy or pipe weapons &amp; xbows.  Then add a 200 price point for firearms/handguns/, and a 350 price point for fire arms/longarms. Then a 400 price point for either rifles, combat rifles, etc.
---
And so forth and so on for all the types of weapons and armor. 
---
If you want to guarantee that you get a 3* combat shotgun, it's going to cost you... But it still might might have garbage rolls. If you feel lucky, you can only pay 200 and be guaranteed you will get something 3* that's going to go hang.
---
Thanks! I'll keep you in mind when I need some!
---
You misunderstand, the player thought you were a duper
---
Most events are triggered by people being in range of them at the right time. For instance, you trigger the campfire event by going to camp adams at night. Some of the others don't have a specific time to trigger, they just have a cooldown from the last time they were completed.
---
One of the effects I'm after is reduced weight which is a 3rd star effect. At this stage with storage being the premium resource, every legendary I pick up is reduced to its total weight divided by its scrip value to give me a weight/scrip to decide if its worth storage.
---
Weren’t there repair kits in Fallout NV too? Why are we all so upset about them? I sincerely do not understand the gripe. 
---
I haven’t purchased a single one, and still somehow have a few. (Which have come in handy more than once.)
---
I'd like a full respec system. However 2 other things on my wishlist are when creating an alt to have a few options. Like start at level 1 with nothing, or choose to start at level 50 with all then same quests marked as complete.
---
The other big thing is the perk system needs some serious quality of life. I'd like to be able to do something with duplicate cards... discard them, trade them or anything.
---
I then would also like to be able to hide cards I don't use so when I swap them out I see only the ones I want.
---
Cards like lock picking and hacking should be 1 card. 
---
I'd also like to be able to switch what levels of the card I apply. For example depending on what I'm doing I have level 3 first aid but sometimes I run level 1 first aid I had to buy a second card. Let me choose when swapping in to adjust my level 3 to level 1 or back.
---
Her choice of pet is a mega sloth, a deathclaw, or a mirelurk king
---
My favorite area personally is the Ash Heap. IDK why it's just something about exploring old ghost towns and mines.
---
You should have lied and told everyone you can get 3 stars from it lol.
---
The lever action is not bad however even before the recent buff to the .50 cal receiver the perforating mag let the hunting rifle hit harder per shot than a lever action on the more armored enemies like super mutants etc
---
Hmm, that'd be interesting. There really aren't many modifications to make on it currently except for a prime receiver. Hopefully Bethesda releases some more options for it!
---
silenced weapon + nightime = mr sandman 
---
repairs i don't remember, but it is noticable ammound if you run it multiple times. You can also pick them around in that room, without needing material, or pick all junk on your way and you should be gtg.
---
Thus kind of games improve over the years and ESO certainly has improved.
---
So nothing else works basically?
---
Made me laugh at 6:40 am. Thank you.
---
Watching for replies
---
More importantly, why can mole rats dig through several storeys of concrete and thin air?
---
They probably already nerfed world drops of 2 and 3 star legendary drops.
---
Haha, thanks but unfortunately it's not for sale.
---
I think this would work really well. I had the same last night - I'd bought 7 3* ranged from the vendor, most of them were garbage, one was great, and I could only sell back 3 until later tonight. And yeah, 160 scrip limit would be great for exactly that reason. Most of the rest of the night was spent on micromanaging my carry weight, since I got lucky enough to land on a server where a team was launching nukes on FP in rapid succession. I am carrying SO many weapons in my lil backpack now.
---
Mix a lever with the gunfu perk, it's awesome
---
leave it at your camp door to deter unwanted visitors.
---
NO , really , i'm not shitting you
---
Thanks for the compliment and commiserations for the early start!
---
If it's any help, I was also up at Stupid O'Clock this morning :)
---
that is an impressive god roll if only we were all so lucky
---
Sorry bud! Hopefully you'll get something useful soon!
---
I am trying to run without PA on but I have died trying to get inside the resort due to loading into a nuked WS. Thins would be great!  The load screens are awful.
---
Yeah, there is only a few "special spawn" locations on the map. And only a special creature, that spawns at that special location can be tamed. You can't just tame any creature you want.  
---
I have one location I use when I want a creature at my camp. A creature doesn't last forever, it eventually dies or vanishes. But it is cool to have a deathclaw hanging around your camp, that helps defend it.
---
I set up my camp near a free range event. Almost everytime i join a server the event also starts and some dudes doing it afterwards. This is a event where people actually need to go to the location before it even starts.
---
I know, I don't expect to ever get an item of this quality again...
---
EXCEPT FOR THE VERY NEXT TIME I BUY SOMETHING FROM THAT SCARF WEARING CON-ARTIST!!
---
Use some diluted Rad-X, that'll help things a bit, and not mess with mutations.
---
I mean, I don't even have god tier weapons or anything special and I've solod the one in the mire with literally no problems across 3 different toons. So yes, it can very easily be solo'd if you have a decent build.
---
thanks for all the tips guys!  helped me get out of the rut i was in.
---
Oh yeah, can wait to try it against the scorchbeast queen and sheepsquatch! Thanks!
---
I can barely move it! I only have 1 Strength! I was hoping to roll it down the hills into the Forest...
---
So you're mad somebody stole something that you dropped on the ground? Lol

This is my first bloodied melee build. Just to give you an idea. But take care. Even if it still works pretty well, it is outdated. Atm i am playing a different setup for my melee char.
---
Aye
---
Player Vending I sell cores for 125 caps and ammo for 1 cap each until Bethesda let's us bulk ammo.
---
Did it ever get resolved because now it’s happening to me. Main character won’t load new character will. PS4 btw
---
Not going to question that but ok.
---
Best thing I've gotten so far is a Executioner's Harpoon Gun with explosive and reload speed.
---
Executioner's isn't the most optimal on a Harpoon Gun, but at least it makes sure that no normal enemy will be able to survive two hits from it.
---
Do you have any suggestions on where she can look kind sir?
---
I came here to say that! This is a nice roll!!!!
---
Insomniacs unite! 😁
---
Get the healing mutation, hit up the pylons, tag the squach and bog off and lurk so you're out of contact and heal.  You'll use far fewer stimpacks.
---
Its a moral imperative.
---
When your in the screen you posted hit X to inspect, it will show you what the other legendary effects are.
---
Awesome dude!
---
Eh, I don't feel anything for the taxidermy, unless it's a non-hostile enemy.
---
im guessing bloodied something..
---
its always bloodied...
---
I got an instigating explosive 10% damage 10mm my friend got an aa 3* harpoongun lol
---
Yeah, return it, after alle, Bethesda must have some kind of warranty on it, dont they ? :D
---
Sweet tato stew and noodle cups are the herbivore's bread and plant-based butter. 40% food each.
---
This post needs pulled - trying to name shame someone who did nothing wrong isn’t cool.
---
Bummer! Hopefully something nice will drop for you soon!
---
Did you ever get this resolved because it’s happening to me now. PS4 btw
---
Has anyone bought a core for 125 caps
---
Likewise.  In fact i prefer the free range event alone, i let the squach fully emerge and then have ended up with a couple of good drops and some fair ones.
---
Yeah, don't hit scrap all junk until you're done, and save the radroach meat for last so it doesn't spoil.
---
How? Did you do anything or did it just start working?
---
Craft it in your chemistry station under "Science Projects."
---
Gatling Laser isn't a very good weapon even after the energy weapon buffs and the anti-armor effect currently doesn't work on laser/plasma weapons.
---
This right here is a brilliant idea!
---
It is not a bug. It is an Exploit.
---
Ok you win I'll never top that
---
Huh figured they did stack since they were different chem effects.  I knew it wouldn't stack damage buffs from psycho and it's various upgrades.
---
For me what's misding is the timer, i cant count the number of events i hop to and its nearly ended so i get nada.  Also whats up with the hoard events, 9 out of ten i join its empty, probably because some one wiped it an jumped.
---
I just eat whatever I find and have a few irradiated meat on me as backup. 40% food and never rots, baby!
---
Thanks x)
---
Diluted rad-x doesnt suppress mutations? Didnt know that thanks!
---
My boss always told me to test properly
---
Yeah, I would be fine with that since they aren't a living creature. You could have like a little shelf with a collection of them!
---
you can team up with people and then you share rad sponge, everyone will be mostly rad free if you stick together. 
---
you can also use a radiation suit but then you might die of other causes
---
How many can you save?! Because now there is a third house.
---
Check out the circled zones. Needs a an animal to spawn alone in a random spawn point. [http://puu.sh/Dttmu.jpg](http://puu.sh/Dttmu.jpg)
---
Don’t bother, the amount of hoops needs to compete with the hidden “enclosed suit” bonus that PA and Hazmat have aren’t typically worth it.
---
Hmm. I'll see if I can message you a screen shot with a map marker. Goto the map marker, and you should find a small lake with a crashed vertibird in it. That is where the special tameable mob will spawn.  
---
Sometimes you might find super mutants there, sometimes radstages, or a few other things. But if you see a deathclaw, a sloth, or a mirelirk king, it should be tameable. atleast every time I have seen one of those things there it was.  
---
If something tameable isn't there, just server jump and try again.
---
I got an extremely varied selection with my 7 rolls yesterday - unfortunately most of them (like the Ghoul Slayer's gamma gun) were complete garbage and I could only trade 3 back in yesterday. The only decent one was a Medics hunting rifle with faster fire rate and I forget what else. Most of the decent legendaries I got yesterday came from 3 SBQ runs.
---
Have an upvote for your immersion.
---
useless goddamn lump of shit, that was great. but really it is lol
---
Bought 16 3* armors with the first 1000 scrip. Got one good, marine unyielding AP regen ... Right leg, which I already have an unyielding AP regen combat armor for :( RNG hates me
---
If you do it piece by piece how many you want. You might need to stich 3 blueprints for one complete traphouse but its possible.
---
Lol.
---
Yeah don’t know how someone could honestly think an explosive weapon is complete ass but 🤷‍♂️
---
It's just the rng. I got a quite a few useless primary effects but had more explosive effects that I have gotten from playing since launch.
---
Crap that sounds like what could be my problem. Joined a server said “can’t place camp” but decided to stay in world because I had friends in server I wanted to trade with. Never placed down another camp and after logging off now I keep getting “disconnected from server” message
---
We’ll work it not don’t worry about the weapon we’ll just make sure we start and end on the same caps haha
---
North of abbies bunker is the most common. Its a lil hike and itd on a lake with crashed vertibird. Tamed a yaoi goai(dunno how to spell it) also south of abbies bunker jst follow the road and past the wendigo there should be a random encounter there. Tamed a mirelurk king and a mega sloth on that location..
---
Lock the damn door, put vending machine outside your CAMP walls. I have.
---
Here try this.

---
The decent ones drop ingame from the scorched earth event.
---
Completely understand about the location discovery ones. Mine have been broken since launch.
---
Cant discover already discovered locations.
---
Honestly... don't be too sure :'(
---
Bloodied doesn't usually sit at 90% damage and explosive is 20%. Your typical bloodied user is sitting at 65% to 85% damage boost, most don't sit in nerd rage all the time, they allow themselves a cushion so fights aren't as dangerous. Besides that, bloodied really gets its power from synergizing with a lot of other low hp multipliers. If you utilized all the same multipliers the bloodied build did then you'd really be doing almost the same damage per shot as the bloodied.
---
I got a junkies/explosive/15% vats fill rate minigun yesterday and I'm pretty happy with it. Silly dps and I haven't even put it on my heavy weapons toon.
---
I killed 3 SBQs yesterday and got mostly 2*. Got some 2 and 3* from 3* ghoulies. I'm definitely getting better drops lately.
---
Ok cool, thanks on both counts
---
I agree I love it for those of us who can’t farm 24 hours a day it’s amazing, I got an explosive don’t think I’ve ever got one by farming lol
---
Nope. You have to be logged in for your camp to appear in the World
---
Core price at a real vendor is over 320 caps, so set 10 of min to 149, haven't sold 1 :/
---
Thought it would be a fair price, but seems i have to lower them ...
---
Nope
---
oh nice one,  very nice.  do you play on PC or  ps4?
---
Or maybe they're friendless people trying to complete one of the many "in a team" challenges.
---
bloodied would be my guess, i have a 45 1\* bloodied hammer that I can get 1,2k per hit with just the perk cards(passive) or no aid items.
---
It really is this simple ain’t lol
---
got to hand it to you, that has to be one of the best posts ever.I'm still laughing. I also note, that, I dare say,wasn't a five minute job ?
---
cheers and all the best.
---
Got all worthless junk, but it was junk before script so I guess it just followed along, lol.  Anyway good job! It was needed, some day I'll get a decent drop.  Though maybe I need to start just using those 3\* boards, pipe wrenches, lead pipes, wood armor and such.  Maybe be a crazy plumber or something?  lol
---
Did you do anything to fix it or did it just start working?
---
Yeah but also fixing the scaling would be great... just yesterday: two people there and what spawns 2 lvl 80 sheepsquatch and a legendary bear and tons of insects. Same Day 10 People 1 lvl 50 Sheep and a few insects...
---
I've been selling them at 1cap per % charge, so 100 caps for a fully charged one. Been selling them alright like that but not selling out ever.
---
I haven’t seen that little bastard, outside the path to enlightenment event, since they upped the spawn rate during a weekend event a few months back. 
---
I’m hunting for him to complete the hunter badge too.
---
when something is tied to your character and is different for each person/group. So dungeons in MMOs are instanced - if you go into one, progress will be tied to you in your own 'instance' of that specific area. This also means that a whole load of people could enter an area, but when you load in you'll be alone, as will everyone else.
---
Group instances work the same way - with everyone having to group up to be in the same instance together and progress is shared.
---
I’d have loved more options for a higher cost. I.E 200 to specify 2h melee, 500 to specify a super sledge. It could still be a garbage roll but it’d increase the chance of it being useful.
---
You do gods work my friend :)
---
I have played ESO and Skyrim, but I would happily re-play Skyrim not so much ESO.
---
I would prefer a „checklist“ with all available events. You could mark the events you want to play and each time one of those events starts, you would get a notification. (Just like the encrypted event)
---
This. The auto grenade launcher and missile launcher do not get stored.
---
I got better stuff from 3 SBQ runs last night than 7 rolls from the Purveyor.
---
I also prefer to lone wolf events that aren't raid level events like SBQ and ISS. Other people tend to do silly things, be greedy and ruin stuff.
---
I have no friends and play alone, so I just pester randoms with friend invites.  A few agree and I can mule away with no problems.
---
Is the only way to get a backpack to become a tadpole? They’re not naturally occurring in the world at all?
---
Bloodied unyielding
---
They're exploiting an oversight. They're not any kind of raider. What now? Exploiting every weakness / overlooked mechanics makes you a raider ? please guys. "Sup guys just duped that weapon I'm such an hardcore raider"  really ?
---
google the codes.
---
I try to take over all 3 Power Plant workshops I build a generator to power the fusion core generator but you can also power up the plant to power it. Take the perk card batteries included to reduce the fusion cores weight to .3 pounds put 15-30 in your vending machine ( they will weigh 3 pounds each again) the easiest passive caps you will ever make just check the generators every 15 minutes they only hold 3 cores each.
---
Can't let the raiders ruin the game for us more respectable wastelanders. Other than the stress such a confrontation can cause the non pvp-er, all it costs is a little junk. Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and team up . Appalachia needs us to rebuild, Atom knows the raiders aren't gonna do it.
---
Bless you, kind stranger!
---
I sell them for their charge or half their charge like 1 cap we 2%
---
It’s literally this and the guy fully knows lol
---
Yea same
---
I got a god roll bloodied 3 star... Unfortunately it rolled onto a crossbow. Still 300 damage per shot with a bunch of nice vats modifiers? I kind of want to cry.
---
If you're needing a photo of it you can still take photos of dead ones and it counts
---
Incurable dysentery? Is that for real?
---
Hahah, thanks kindly - no it was at least half an hour. Photoshop is just scary powerful these days xD
---
I only really purchase two star stuff. As in, I only had enough scrip for a single two star. But it was chameleon’s leather with a decent second effect, not that I remember what it was. Put it up for sale at my vending machine for like 1.1k Caps. 
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
If you could either spend more scrip choose the effect/effects, but keep the item random, or choose what item you want and keep effects random, the system would be a bit more friendly, but I’m indifferent, really.
---
Here may be of use to you.

---
I was confused by this.
---
Got a Level 15 1* AA Pipe Revolver, and a Level 50 3* Ghoul Slayers Explosive +1 AGI Railway Rifle that I can't use for another 20ish levels.
---
I thought everything would be level appropriate, but if it's a bug, that explains it (as per usual).
---
Nobody knows the tadpole answers. I live in a rural are where this stuff is routine and the best I could do without google was 3/5 on any of them. 
---
But you raise a valid point on the nuke codes. Problem is the words have to be complex enough that (in a world without nuka dragon) you can’t guess them immediately.
---
TLDR
---
Oh this event! It was me (level 40) and a level 100ish player. 
---
We had 2, bloody 2 legendary deseased sheepsquach at level 50 turn up. I still havent recovered from that eventn run out of junk trying to repair power armour, run out of most of my ammo trying to take one out. And now got no stimpaks left.
---
Yeah, didn't consider that, but I did actually message one player who sent me a random team-invite and asked why, he said it was to get free travel to see my vending items, I declined, but he eventually turned up.  
---
I'm not paranoid, but I don't trust easily, never have.
---
Wares.  Unless you're buying armor I suppose.
---
Not a bad idea, actually
---
Actually, no kidding - I'd love a super god-roll crossbow. Not bloodied though... I'm not specced for that :)
---
But the Frustration is real, right? xD
---
They should have a little notification in the top right corner saying "events available" When there active and then we can open our pip boys to the events tab and see all active events then we should be able to to click on it and fast to it. 🤔😇
---
Well, except Stingwing Barbs, they don't seem to auto-scrap.
---
I didn't research that fully, if I'm going to be completely honest :)
---
Technically, they're palmetto bugs.
---
Pray they never do Fallout: Florida. It's already kinda prehistoric down here.
---
Buddy got a Vampire’s FFR Handmade with +1 agi and an EE FFR Lever action
---
Forgot to mention Bandolier perk in strength reduces ballistic ammo weight some ammo like 45 weighs zero check it out.
---
what i do is send my dude to sleep and then i make sure to tilt the aim stick to either side to avoid been disconnected, down side is that your controler could die.
---
Def. Does not stack with good with salt.:( Now grinding the high cap. Mod.
---
Because everyone in the wasteland is S.P.E.C.I.A.L
---
I have to agree, 7 rolls last night and 5 of them were nocturnal -.- I took down the SBQ twice, and got some 3 star armor I could use with both Vanguard and sentinel. 
---
I know it's all random and it all comes down to luck, but it's still annoying turning in 3 legendaries to exchance it for Zealot's Nocturnal Gamma Gun. She just doesn't seem worth it to me.
---
Where is your camp I moved by White Spring and I get more sales now.
---
Once you get the exact gear you want what else is there to do in game? Grinding forever IS the endgame for this game
---
Also in stash?
---
Yes this would make so much sense! Like Diamond city in FO4, it had the option to go inside to the traders or outside the main gates.
---
90% reduced weight is a vendors dream tho! I've got a fat man with it (not daisy cutter)  and stacked with bear arms it weighs less than a can of cram
---
You pick up the quest just inside off a dead bos soldier. Its a...holotape.
---
Good w/ salt3=90%, refrigerated backpack=60%, spoilage reduction. Does not stack
---
I got a berserkers explosive shotgun weeks ago and sold it to a vender 20 minutes later, very bad mix of effects, no armor to increase damage with splash damage from explosions at close range = suicide.
---
The only problem with this is in a few months every player will have "god roll" gear. 
---
I think what people are missing is this should really increase the amount of good items in the economy thus increasing trading.
---
While I'd love to be able to get every Legendary I've every dreamed of without ever having to trade. It would also mean every other player can also get said gear by grinding for scrip. I mainly play solo PvE but the PvP players won't have much fun if everyone has the same set up.
---
I may reevaluate this in a month or two but it's still to early to make any drastic decisions.
---
And now for something which needs immediate attention #where's our mystery pick!!!
---
Easy fix bethsda: is someone is in passive, they're not engaged automatically if a team member sparks pvp. Really if someone is in passive, it should only be possible to be hostile to people in the circle of a workshop they own, thats being contested.
---
You dropped it? Really? It is your fault, it is a wasteland with no rules.
---
Second that with 5 pieces of unyielding my bloodied knuckles do over 700.
---
Well on a shotgun explosive is mostly suicide anyway and needs to be played carefully. But this person could just ignore berserkers and use an explosive .44. Certainly better than the worst.
---
Sorry for the time, Yup i'm on PS4 
---
ID : Aexens
---
 But i dunno the price :/ (But i'm a rifle guy if you want to trade)
---
Darthnick69
---
I love when this one happens, it’s hilarious.
---
When i do UF i try to team with others doing it so we can co-operate and all benefit.  Some times it works and makes it more enjoyable rather than sprinting after bosses before somone one shots them before anyone else gets a look in.
---
and not "encrypted" either.
---
Thanks, I am so bad about overlooking the obvious
---
Depends. If you're talking about logging out of the game, your camp disappears from the world within several seconds of you leaving.  If you're talking about staying in the world and just going AFK, than people can still use your vending machine even when it's not powered (all powering/unpowering it does is determine whether or not your camp is displayed on the map for everyone).
---
The jar is jarring, because you’d have to be a dumb dumb to squish a frog in a jar. Im no dumb dumb. I have mentats. Me hate jar.
---
Powerfist is unarmed though, not 1h.
---
I sell for 125 I restock 10 at a time due to the weight and they're gone in an hour tops.
---
Id actually be pretty pumped about some extremely rare gag items comeing out of the purveyor.
---
Dude, I'm a raider and even i think that's pathetic.   An anonymous attack, just blowing up a camp (when it was still possible) was right up the alley of any raider, and it got you a wanted level to bait out bounty hunters. Tricking some merchant into letting you join their team just so your buddy can demolish? Utter bullshit
---
lol getting mad at raiders being raider
---
My favorite part is that it has a short nv scope...which shows how useful THEY are.
---
Just on the player :/
---
Take a look at the RADICOOL perk card under Endurance. The more rads/lower health you have in your health bar the higher your strength.
---
This boosts all damage in either ranged or melee, and as another bonus, raises your personal carry weight. You’d be surprised how much of a boost even keeping a quarter or third of your bar “Red” will give you.
---
Helpful to back this up with an auto stim armor piece in case you’re taking rads in a ghoul fight, or the perk card Born Survivor which will yield the same effect.
---
If anyone is whining, ranting or crying it’s you lol
---
Lol..OCD I see. I rotate my woodgrain floors so I guess my camp would drive you bonkers. I think it looks good.
---
I see. That's fascinating!
---
Should be not even then, as the passive person can't fight back!
---
What's the point of creating a murder box if you don't reap the rewards?
---
the scrip limit of 150/day is fine. i don't want to be "forced" to farm even more hours to get useless legendaries to sell.
---
i just play casually, i had 160 scrip. went to the vendor, got a crappy 3star. sold it for 40 and got me another 3star. "almost" what i wanted: a lever action explosive with something else.
---
still don't want to go back to 5 month ago when i was farming whitesping all day long, every day. been there, done that.
---
how about to actually have DECENT LOOT when killing stuff like the SB queen? now THAT would be an improvement...
---
I have all the mods unlocked - there's only one for each slot. I'm happy to stick them on there for you if you want. No charge, tho if you have any adhesive to spare, donations are always acceptable. PSN thekikibee
---
Yes. Let us craft an aquarium tank. 30 gallon or greater so the poor guy can move around!
---
A friend and I were trying to farm that event with hopes of getting a specific drop, and we would watch people IMMEDIATELY swarm to people's bodies as they died to steal loot. No one would take pylons, and would not try to clear the robot mobs. I'm convinced it's just an easy event for assholes to "farm" dropped loot, because conduits die a lot. 
---
When I say immediately, I mean player would drop to their knees, they won't revive and just crowd around to grab the bag as they go to respawn. If I even attempt that event I store my junk.
---
That's one heavy poop. You should send that in to Guinness. Also get some stitches.
---
I I sell every type of ammo for 1 cap each, including missiles and nukes lol. They sell quick.
---
In Power Armor I use an Anti Armor Pole Hook ( my favorite go to weapon for the last 100 levels) and a Instigating Grognak Axe with 40% power attack in regular armor I use unyielding armor 4 or 5 pieces and the bloodied melee weapon of the day I have a bunch. Lots of chems fury is your friend, glowing meat steak for 10% melee, and mole rat chunks for increased strength.
---
I've  seen the texture elsewhere on mountains.
---
This would be a great spot for a hidden door.
---
Or personal vault...
---
I would buy that. I’m a pistol build and go into nuke zones in a hazmat suit so that would be great for those runs. :)
---
Because if your PVPing and the other players gun brakes and they have bought a repair kit within seconds there guns back in action.
---
“Do you see amy cows around here, detective?” 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ey8Q6AVMLx0
---
150-350 for good one-stars like bloodied, instigating (if high dmg), vampire’s (if high firerate), anti-armor ranged.
---
Two stars 700-2000 but it’s gotta be good. If the second effect is bad it’s scrips or cheap like one-stars.
---
Three stars like above and beyond. Really depends on the roll.
---
This is great. If it wasn't for the item name you could have passed this off as legit.
---
Go up to a frog and it tell u a vurtin ti push to carch it. Then u place it in camp
---
Feel bad? Why?
---
If they are wanted than they did something bad. 
---
I've managed to play this game for 500 hours now and I've only been wanted once. And that was because I wanted to see if you could pick locks in survival (you cant but you can just shotgun down the door) 
---
Take their junk without remorse. They knew what they were doing. Especially by level 30.
---
Grahm. He sells the plan but I'm not sure how much
---
Its a craftable item in build mode, you must capture a wild frog tho
---
No such feature found in humans though. I hate to admit that this saved me a couple of barbs, but  my fingers automatically scrap them. Now I think at least three times before scrapping something and this quest taught me a lesson.
---
This theory is genius!  I hope Bethesda is listening and they incorporate this.
---
On the ground decot tab you can build it
---
The short night vision scope on it though......
---
This was funny for me at 6:24 am. Thanks!
---
I was a low level the first time I found vengeful moth man he whooped my ass. In 155 levels I have come across him twice.
---
I was plesently surprised by the number of decent items people we're sharing. I am ok with a pile of junk if one of those weapons is very nice. For me, I got a few sellable pieces, some trash, and a instigating explosive hunting rifle. For any sniper build that weapon is one of the best choices. It will be easy to sell for a good stack of caps or trade for something useful for my character.
---
Does your weapon have the **+250 DR while reloading** effect? There is currently a bug which breaks the damage number when you reload.
---
^ You don’t have to buy them.
---
It won't be god roll for everyone. Hitting a god roll is still extremely hard.
---
Yesterday everyone was happy 'cause they had like 10 tries. But now it's gonna be 1 or 2 per day and it will be harder to get what you want.
---
I think this is also the reason beth didn't add the mistery pick. They want us to use all the hoarded scripts,before givong us the cheaper option.
---
I had 1000 scrip yesterday, 4 of the 10 weapons my first toon rolled were crossbows.
---
I usually ignore any unsolicited team requests as well.  You're not alone on this.
---
Yeah. I am optimistic that prices on God rolls will drop as people use the legendary vender more.
---
They should.  After all the prep for that event, I needed a laugh.  Maybe the bone was their idea of a joke, 'cause I feel like I got boned...
---
Actually got 2 decent pieces of armor, they just were close copies of what I already have so... *shrug* time to set up a vending machine I guess.
---
NO, YOU!
---
Can't remember which one but it's a camp build option. One of the floor decoration ones I believe.
---
We raid with honor god damn it. Now GIVE ME YOUR FUCKING SKULL!
---
She's just testing you, seeing if you're worthy of the Good Stuff. Go save the wasteland with what she gives you, maybe you'll make her proud.
---
For sure. Those explosive mellee weapons are just as dangerous for the user though.
---
Aluminum scrap IS aluminum
---
He didnt for me
---
AntiArmor is great for mellee. Of perhaps furious if you arnt into the bloodied thing
---
Start with Anti-armor and finish off with Executioner's when the target is below 40% health.
---
If your on PC i sell lead
---
I just want to reroll the unused perk cards. Do i really need 4 copies of lvl 1 action boy when I already have a lvl 3 action boy aslready equipped?
---
Thanks for the info!
---
What?
---
You turn aluminium ore into alu scrap, with a chem bench, smelting and acid
---
Aluminium scrap is aluminium, same as “loose screws” are screws
---
Just weird naming on things
---
How can people seriously get mad over stuff like this?
---
As long as it comes with a warning that you would be trading for less scrip than you could get if you waited. Then it keeps both types of players happy.
---
None but I only last for 10 seconds I hate when I server hop into a nuke zone at White Spring without power armor on. Rad Sponge and Ghoulish perks are awesome in a Nuke Zone if you are on a team you will not take hardly any radiation damage.
---
Adventure pvpers tend to fall in 2 categories. The ones who didn't and don't want to see this game be successful, and people cutting their teeth learning how pvp works, figuring out if their build is halfway viable for ambushing, teaching their gang the ins and outs of 76 pvp. Survival mode you see the former group sitting a train stations until the server sees the death icons and avoids that area like the plague. You see the latter popping to events as a group and turning the event end into a bloodbath.
---
Let's call it a logic joke based on the title
---
Get acid and smelt it at chemistry station. Uses quite a bit of acid and ore for aluminium though if I remember correctly.
---
At least they were low weight... except...  wait, are you complaining about a 3 star RAILWAY rifle?
---
Buy it from you ;-)
---
Easily doable if you’re exchanging caps for legendaries at player vendors. Theres always going to be some cheap ones around, especially with the purveyor now.
---
My only beef with the purveyor is that I saved well over 600 scrip, and didn't get a single decent ranged weapon out of the rng... Come by my camp vendor if you want some salt.
---
I'm level 51 and fought mothmans 5 or 6 times, most of are stalker mothmans.
---
I had one person send me 4+ team invites when i was doing the possum exams on the terminal.
---
Im like im not gonna exit an exam to answer your team invite.
---
Wow :/
---
 It's out front on a stick!
---
You have noticed the updates? There are lots of things to do besides grind out legendaries.
---
But, if that's the way you feel, just buy the cheap stuff and enjoy your grinding. Hell, don't even use the vendor and just try to get your perfect weapon the old fashioned way, one sbq at a time.
---
Also, unless you are one of the blessed, it's still going to take many many purchases to get the ideal perfect weapon. And with the limit of how much script you can get her day, that would limit you to two chances a week? And think of all the grinding required for that. 
---
In short don't potentially limit my options when it doesn't limit yours.
---
Refresh time of the 500?  What is that, a sequel to Sparta?
---
Oh...Thanks !!!! I want to craft the power armor X-01.
---
I got 3 more weapons to scrap for script. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Tell all the rookies to move over. Here's mine. 100% kill ratio in pvp. 100% junk and aid acquisition. People teleport into the trap and restock my shop. I then sell their stuff on pve. 
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/MildFuriousCattleCoolStoryBro
---
Won’t you run out of legendaries to turn in eventually?
---
The French translation is crappy as well. Out looks like they just replace strings of words without any care for syntax.
---
Im level 105 and before yesterday I had never even touched a TSE weapon let alone owned one.  I used nearly 700 scrip rolling 2 star ranged and the best I got was a TSE western revolver, everything else was tat. 
---
Was a little bit deflated but looking forward to using my first TSE even if it was a little underpowered. 10 minutes later I killed a legendary cave cricket and picked up a TSE Combat Rifle. 
---
Have I just flick some RNG switch?
---
It shouldn't show it though.
---
So say I pout item X in for 500 caps... but i would accept 400. I set my price to 500 and that's what potential buyers see. I also set my low point of 400 caps. You come along and offer 399 caps I don't get a notification. You offer 400 I get the chance to accept or decline. But if you just pay the 500 then yay for me.
---
Its like a market with haggling you set your price higher then you want. When you get talked down you sell... they are happy because they got a "deal" and your happy because you got at least the price you wanted.
---
However I don't think such a system would be easy for them to put in place and most people would start at a low point and keep adding a few caps until an offer went through. So yes it would end up in the game just setting your price with extra steps.
---
They sure do.
---
I do exactly that. Feel free to check it, or not.
---
What are you talking about? The Queen gave me a level 20 pool cue. That's GOD TIER right there! haha
---
I am playing on PC. You?
---
Yeah Will since the purveyor opened yesterday I have a crap load of legendary‘s I can’t even sell because I hit my limit that’s been over 12 hours ago!  Just plain silly
---
I want to know what a murder box is and why you would step inside it loaded with junk.
---
Lots of things to do like what? The quests are only repeatable in that you can do them to get loot. Once you get the best loot the game is pretty over.
---
You thought Bethesda created the gatling gun?
---
you might want to add in long shot,as a swappable, The reach you can get with even 2 is well worth it. same for bloody mess. pain in the ass swapping out sometimes but......oh aye.....one of sniper
---
sort of bugs me, that we can't, fully max out rifles, to their full potential. that requires 18 points.
---
What about perk cards? Whats a great tank build?
---
You have tricked RNGesus, but remember that He can only be tricked once.
---
PC my man do you have any bloodied weapons  i can buy from you i am trying to figure out a build soon,  let me know if you want to do any trading thanks you sir :)
---
There are always frogs at the pool by the whitespring golf club. Just walk up to one and it will give you the option to collect it.
---
Doors is the last thing i place when building a base.
---
It always seems to be the same in the Mire for me. Wolves, Bloodbugs, Yao Gui, two Sheepsquatches, more Bloodbugs and Bloatflys'. In that order
---
Do you really live in fear of something like this?
---
When I click to blueprint something, the menu has a bunch of free slots to save camps. They probably switched it out so that people are more likely to fall for the trick twice (even though they won't have junk the second time), and because most traps break when you use them.
---
Oh no you better haven’t...
---
I believe we visited the same home, friend. PS4?
---
I think this is a very real possibility I've seen a lot of new god roll items on here already.
---
*sarcastically* How wonderfully serendipitous. :)
---
r/fo76Guides/a_working_guide_to_taming_creatures_in_appalachia/
---
You don’t know it’s a murder box. And then it is.
---
I think it should only be available for events that have 3 stars, but also bump up the guaranteed Squanch at the end
---
I'm not reading that wall of text until you tell me who you are and why should your review be important to me?
---
Are you on Ps4 I have some extra pieces of unyielding armor along with an Instigating Power Fist and a couple of other melee weapons I could give you.
---
I love stomping people for this reason. 
---
I've never started a fight. But I can finish most of them.
---
I just bought some mods for it in watoga
---
You can build *ridiculous* floating shit and put stuff inside stuff anyway. There is NO POINT with these arbitrary restrictions on our gameplay because whatever they intended to prevent is possible anyway
---
Awesome. Now my CAMP won't be able to be on the golf course any more. I just came back after dumping this game for months too.
---
There’s a hard cap limit on the server though as only so many players can be on that server plus the legendary vendor/exchange should reduce pricing
---
Awesome! I thought maybe I was just being anti-social, but it's a tactic being used some to get round a change in the game that they don't like.
---
(For the record I was being somewhat ani-social, but that's just me!)
---
There are only 1* Sheepsquash in the game anyway, which is why the objective is far more important!
---
Still better than a bowie
---
This is not bad thinking. It could be limited so you could only have x amount of passive cards active.
---
It's their humor. I think it's appropriate for the world
---
Your camp and everything in it disappears when you log out.
---
They are currently working on ways to be able to leave your camps in game while you are not playing and offline.
---
Yeah it seems to be a big issue. The best thing you can do now is just instantly scrap them for scrip so you at least get 40 scrip back instead of 3 when it turns to a 1 star.
---
On sniper rifles I like Instigating since you can one shot most thing from stealth. Handmade AA or Bloodied. Explosive as secondary is good for most so is VATS crit damage.
---
I was finally able to join this illusive club after 3 nights of farming for it 😂 I have to say it looks even better in person 👌🏻
---
I don't remember reading anything "Official" on Factions/Guilds, just a lot of player speculation.
---
On the other hand, I agree completely, Player Factions are a typical feature of games like this.
---
Sure, the "Factions" we have are a start, but without Cosmetics based on them, we're literally just Vault Dwellers playing at being Responders/BOS, etc, instead of actually being those Factions.
---
There's a lot we as players can do for ourselves about this, and we have, but we need Bethesda's help to make it work, not just a thumbs up from them.
---
Things like if you're BoS, you can fast travel to other BoS members for a discount, something to make us feel like part of these groups, and not the guy who's late to the Party, dressing up from the Lost and Found Box.
---
Sorry, went on too long, but I see real potential for Factions, just we can't do it alone.
---
Respectable weight!
---
4 Crossbows? I wonder if there's real substance to the idea that each server hands out a preferred kind of weapon and legendary effect?
---
Still, dat minigun doh :D
---
I personally don't like the charging barrels. The gatling Laser's strength is in its fire rate. 
---
Get the power user perk maxed out and it'll have 1000 shots per core.
---
Thank you muchly, I hope the rest of your day is entertaining too!
---
10/10
---
Yes, i fully ranked it, also power user because i’m trying to do a combo between marsupial/speeddemon/birdbones+jetpack, and i want to know how much it will affect me having 3 mutation even with Class Freak; 
---
I think that is really sad that you think that. I feel really sad for you.
---
For all the sake of all that is good and holy DO NOT put your eye near that scope...
---
You've disproved your own point there.
---
They do want people to play lots. But the key subtle difference is they want us to play *often*, not necessarily for long periods.
---
Hence the daily resetting things
---
Yeah, my bloodied melee girl can kill the sheep squash in 4 punches, waiting to let people get hits in causes us to fail due to brahmin death, so after loosing 4 times I just go all out on the sheep squash to guarantee the plan rewards. The guaranteed 1* legendary isn't worth it anyway!
---
It's the world's most boring game-play location anyway.
---
Is it like Mjolnir, only for the worthy, or unworthy maybe?
---
I was a bit overzealous in saying four, however looking at the lists.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmv494/datamined\_list\_of\_all\_weapons\_and\_armor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmv494/datamined_list_of_all_weapons_and_armor/)
---
There are no weapons in the ranged category I would call unusable with the right combination of effects, even the worse ones like the missile launcher and crossbow could be workable as a perfect three star in the right configuration, and the only weapon that is just strictly worse than another is the assault rifle (a worse handmade), and that isn't even that bad so much as the handmade being arguably the best weapon in the game.
---
Then there is melee, with over half the list being absolute trash items like the lead pipe, rolling pin, baton, and golf club, weapons that are so terrible that even with a perfect god roll they feel like an absolute insult. DId we really need to put all of the crap weapons in the list, really.
---
The odds of getting a god melee are half the odds of getting a god ranged, even taking into account ranged weapons that only have one possible god setup.
---
I've seen a lot of people posting some seriously good finds from the Purveyor. 
---
I myself recieved an Instigating Bone Hammer with Power attack and a 3* Furious Gatling Plasma just yesterday. Both of those weapons imo are pretty good maybe not god roll but I'm happy. 
---
I'll say the bone Hammer is great I already had a Grog axe with the same roll but I was getting bored with it. Just seeing a different animation when I play has been fun.
---
I have to test the Gat Plasma as I'm unsure if they ever fixed furious.
---
Bwa ha ha, maybe so! But this is the name I call most of the legendaries I find :)
---
In fo4 we could walk through items when they were selected and turned transparent. I would love to see this in 76 as well for sure
---
The whole Fallout universe is cruel and unforgiving - it fits perfectly into the world that he's crammed into a jar
---
It's ok - it was the Purveyor that 'produced' it. Mole Miner anatomy must be further removed from our own than we thought! :O
---
Yes sounds the same
---
It's the floor panels, they didn't line them up!
---
None of the weapons I got were good for my build.
---
 I had some pretty good God role weapons for other builds though but that really doesn't help me at all.
---
I will just scrap them for more scrip to trade in for more useless (to me) weapons.
---
 Hopefully I'll get lucky and find the weapons I seek on somebody's vendor but I highly doubt it.
---
If you have class freak, load up, lol
---
Makes the downsides negligible, I’m running like 13 since I got class freak
---
Use both that's what I do also chems like Fury give 30% melee damage, glowing meat steak 10% melee damage, mole rat chunks for +1 strength and the incisor perk card
---
Hey! When I want to see something in the dead of night... that's admittedly very, very marginally darker than the middle of the afternoon... there's only one choice for me!
---
I want the scrip cap raised as a way to dump off my legendaries as much as anything.
---
I’d know that poo anywhere, that’s Ark poo right there. Medium Dino if I’m not mistaken, high grade hydrogen content, low weight. The perfect poop.
---
I did two other toons on the same server (joined a friend) and didn't get any other crossbows out of the 20 other rolls.
---
I stream on twitch, I give away all my farmed gear as I stream, I am an experienced competitive FGC player who dominated western Canada in 3s, and CvS2, I am lvl 360+, I can one shot SheepSquatches and 6 shot Imposter, I can solo SBQ.
---
There has to be something suspicious about it. No way a murder box dosnt tip you off some how 😂 Bet it had big neon signs telling people they'd die.
---
I'm all for xp weekend, but I'd really not want a reason to hold off vendoring things on the off chance a double scrib weekend is coming up.
---
In NV you had to craft them, or buy them with caps, etc. It was all done in-game.
---
In 76, while you can get better ones from SBQ, people are pissed that you can buy them outside the Game (Main Menu/Atomic Shop).
---
The fact you can earn atoms means they're not technically pay-to-win, some nobody has to pay for them, but Semantics and Reddit don't mix.
---
I'm not going to lie, when this rare item came out of the Purveyor I was definitely gagging...
---
You must be the oldest tadpole i know.
---
That’s awesome information. Thank you
---
I only fight the Queen in hopes for a calibrated shocks ultracite plan, but she seems to have stopped dropping ultracite mods for me....
---
I picked up a junkies explosive pipe revolver from a player vendor last night for 1000 caps. Guess that's where they got it.
---
Just some a hole from bethesda austin trying to defend the shit job they have done.  Hey, wow, the game is about taking pictures now! What great content!  BGS just let me know when fo5 is out.  Im out!
---
The house keeps changing, too. Thought I had lost my fucking mind when I went back.
---
Dickhead.
---
You are a true connoisseur of videogame poo! You are also entirely right. There aren't that many games that render poop in the detail that I needed for the image xD
---
Im a lvl 76 that soloed uranium fever. Video post coming later.
---
God what a dick.
---
Oh hey look, it's every drop I've ever gotten condensed into its final form. 😂😂😂👏
---
If lying about me makes you feel better about being wrong about this game, then go ahead and lie.  But just recognize you’re lying. I hate the camera too, but the game is good :c). Try at least 1 rebuttal next time.
---
Aw man im on xbox but thanks for the offer.
---
Really thinking about making a new character to see what the game is like now..
---
so, the vendor is a Vogon?
---
for the record, I am hoping someone actually gets the reference.
---
Get rid of the switch, use a pressure plate, thr wiring looks a little uglier, but at least the shower only runs when they stand under it then!
---
I’m entitled? what makes their playstyle more important than mine? This game is a fallout game and should be a about player choice. I never said to bethesda that pve should’t be allowed. I’m not asking them to stop their playstyle nor am I stopping them from doing what they want show me where I am doing that. The can do pve all they want if they claim a workshop i murder them. Its very simple dont claim a workshop have pacifist mode on and you will never be killed again. Or is that too much too ask of you and the other pve players?
---
I don’t just prey on unprepared people I won’t say i don’t but i fight whoever will fight me, if i happen to kill somone in excavator with all carry weight perks no combat perks I’ll kill them more loot for me. I fought the ex dupers with thousands of duped nuka colas and bobble heads and got my ass handed to me but i did learn some valuable lessons.
---
Don’t straw man me saying i only prey on the weak. I wouldn’t be suprised if you are one of those guys that hides in pacifist but then when a fight comes along you think you can win you turn it off and go ham.
---
What I’m saying it my playstyle is becoming less and less viable you earn jack shit for killing people and its harder to rob people now. Critcise my playstyle all you want how im a terrible person I literally don’t care. Did you not listen to me how i play survival and adventure and survival sucks ass for multiple reasons or did you ignore that part? Is that because you can’t handle someone being killed in a game? 
---
Honestly you just seem to blinded by how against my playstyle you are too look at what im saying objectively.
---
It does feel like that sometimes, doesn't it? :)
---
About 4.2 couric.
---
I promise, it didn’t. It also came in three different models so that you would maybe think you just hallucinated the entire event. It was fucking nuts.
---
\[stares in Texan\]
---
Ahhhhhh explosive makes far more sense as to bumping that damage so high up but thanks
---
I’ve always been a fallout fan and I held off way too long to get started on this one. I just jumped in a couple weeks ago and I can’t stop playing.  
---
Let me know if you have any melee build tips(w/o PA).  I’m lvl 29 rn and feel like I’m heading in the right direction but could possibly be using better perk combos?
---
Oh finally something I hope the dupers get a hold of
---
I believe it will make it tough to sell anything that isn't a good roll for more than 1000 caps
---
Honestly I used all my scrip about 8 hours after release then had more people buy my stuff then ever, probably everyone disappointed with there drops. I sell stuff at decently cheap prices but made almost 5k last night and cleared up 100 stash weight!
---
Absolutely not! It encourages player trade by adding more desireable weapons to the pool and providing a sink for poorly rolled legendaries.
---
Is that by European Fecal Standards measurements or are you using the Marsh scale? :)
---
Only if you are a pure weapon /armor dealer.
---
 Most of my money comes from plans recipes and ammo.
---
I held out for a very long time. Many times ice been at cap limit and could have just bought one from modus.  Didn't.  Saw dupers in the markets selling them for 1-2k each. Still held out. Recently saw then selling stacks for 3k each. Held out. But since player vending hit if I see a recipe in a machine for under 4k I'm gonna buy it. By taking them from the SBQ loot pool (which she never dropped me 1 even prior) bethesda basically gave us all a big FU anyway.  They know that they're duped to hell and decided to make the barrier to acquire them legit even larger. So don't feel bad. Use them in good mutated health I say.
---
Neither 
---
It’s a spawning event
---
Explain how it was un balanced? Everthing has always had a counter in this game. Thats the excuse players use when somone has better gear better builds and they are a better player than you to protect your own ego cos you can’t handle having your ass handed to you in a game.
---
My 3rd point gives people the ability to rob people play a raider and play the villain which is true to the fallout franchchise.
---
I haven't found the camera yet...
---
Until now ;)
---
Oh gods, imagine opening your Artillery crate and it's full of these... the horror... the  horror...
---
It's not a dev item, more of a glitch, normally when an enemy throws a object at you, excluding grenades, you can spam E on PC and have the chance to get it in your inventory. Got so many Snallygaster spit attacks XD
---
Correct.
---
Ohhh, perfect then! 
---
Thanks! 
---
Great news!
---
It’s a great image thanks for the laugh :) Indeed Ark poo is a high quality render, and also a handy tool to escape should you ever be captured by miscreants and imprisoned. Poop has saved my life and time on Ark more than once. 
---
But alas, my time on officials is over. Now I live in peace with a few friends on a private dedicated, poo is just for our crops and beetles, but I will always hold a special place in my heart for Ark poo.
---
+karma
---
there are only 13 third star effects, 4 of those are melee only, and 7 ranged only.
---
meaning you have a 1/9 chance of getting any one of the three star effects, which is pretty good. 
---
considering 2.5 of them are really good for vats builds (+1agility is 0.5), and two are universally decent and you have 50/50 chance of getting a good effect if you are vats heavy. otherwise it's better to go for 2 stars.
---
Nah, she's definitely not Vogon. Otherwise you'd have to fill out a form in triplicate to get a license that will allow you to contact your local representative about sending you the forms you need to get a committee approved ID badge that will allow you to request an application for selling one of her items.
---
Aaand the new NPC is a purveyor, not a purveyour
---
*Looks for tl;dr*
---
Moving on. Good luck sir
---
This game is already ridiculously easy as it is, if I also take this shortcut I might as well just quit playing it.
---
I will keep rolling until I get my bloodied, +50% crit, +1 perception handmade lol.
---
Not likely. You still need recipes, plans, food, water, aid, ammo, mutations, and legendaries to burn.
---
Oh right so like the normal events but in a new area?
---
Spawning event? Like one of the events that just pop up across the map? Sorry if it’s a dumb question.
---
He hasn't nuked it yet. he has plans too.
---
No. Bethesda should further nerf hotswapping. You should need to make choices about what you specialize in and if you need to pass up looting that level 3 safe because you wanted to do +15% shotgun damage instead, that's your choice.
---
I think you just wasted all your luck, RNGod be praised.
---
Correct, assume it’s like Grafton Day for example, walk into Arktos Pharma, it’ll trigger and direct you down to the basements
---
Yeah I figured it out, it was a wrong translation on several languages, but thanks anyway :)
---
Yis, in the basement of the Arktos Pharma (which does already exist)
---
Odly enough 1* prices will probably stay stable. They are still useful but no one is getting them from the vender.
---
I dont think you know what the pacifist option does.
---
Go look it up and then consider deleting this post because its making you look stupid
---
Try the Fallout76 Market community;
---
Why don't you literally go outside and fish irl?
---
I meant like specific for melee and specific for ranged lol
---
I've had the same issue building near any water that's more than ankle deep. Scorched and mutants will sit on the other side of the water and shoot aimlessly instead of moving closer, and the turrets don't do shit about it
---
Maybe they could do something where passive is automatically disabled in workshops to avoid being unable to fight back.
---
First you take off the lid...
---
I just remember playing with a buddy and he's running around and he says "hey oats! I'm flexion on you with my t 45 power armor" and I see this
---
For me, I’ve noticed, for half the battles she’s on the ground most of the time, just letting us wail on her, not even moving (those times are great). The other half, she’s incredibly aloof, landing rarely. Those events are always failed.
---
Dont think its classed as a group even like sheepsquatch and scorched earth
---
I *definitely* like the idea of progressive "drip feed" refilling of the pools at the same rate that it would go 0-max within 20hrs.
---
That seems to work great for everyone with no more downsides than the current system.
---
Yesterday I had a little under 500 scrip, so I decided to only roll 3* Armor. Out of 8 pieces that dropped, 3 were cavalier, refresh, 2 of which were REALLY good rolls. Out of the other 5 pieces, 2 were keepers as they had AP refresh or weight reduction. Maybe I got really lucky, but this lead me to a few conclusions:
---
Unless the legendary vendor is like Xur (Destiny) and shows up randomly or periodically, the market will be flooded in legendaries more than it is currently. This will drive prices down as these items will be more common.
---
This could be good or bad. For me personally, I immediately thought "well, all the time Ive grinded has been invalidated by this fast path to high-end legendaries." Without a reason to grind out legendaries, I think a lot of endgame players will jump ship because there are few challenges left.
---
I think there should be a level system where it's like after you reach level 20 (or 30 or 40) the game gives you a message saying "You know how this world works, or not. Who cares? Its a harsh world and If you do bad, then people will be after you" and then make it eligible for them to get bounties, because when you hit level 50, you're already at max character development excluding weapons and armours.
---
This would be also stop people running around as a low level and get bounties to bait people, BUT there may be an exploit in what I said that I can't see, but I sense it... Hmmm...
---
No one said they were mad. Need something to use orbital strikes on.
---
Yes, it is patched now and I like it, but OP complains that it is bad thing and suggests to make reverse this change.
---
Ops got some luck for sure! Just wow!
---
Tbh, I think it's a lot more likely that the vaults may play into it somehow since those haven't opened yet. 
---
Also there's reference to "open world" workshops, which seems to be workshop dynamic that anyone on the server can access and build. 
---
Not sure if it's additive only and not subtractive (kinda like team access to your CAMP or a workshop you don't own) but either way that would be a cool start to building "settlements" that become shared resource and utility for all players to use. 
---
So if you want the world workshop to produce aluminum or food, that's what that server workshop is producing because it's what the current players have chosen to do, and it's a constant state of musical chairs based on who is logged in as to what is being added since once a player logs off their placed items can either stay or be removed as they've been converted to open.
---
Personally i went two star untill i got something usable.
---
Now that i finaly have a weapin that i can use, ill be going for 3 star from now on
---
I'm sorry but I rarely venture into the clown world that is the wider internet, but what the fuck is a non binary gender? Lol.
---
Nice weapon btw.
---
I used to have a camp the overlooked Watoga from a mountain, that would have been quite the site.
---
Orbital strike
---
That sucks, especially with how annoying and grindey the challenges are
---
The ever upwards quest line and the purveyor are completely unrelated. Why would the vendor give a rats ass about your tadpole badges and give you a higher scrip cap as a result of you having more.
---
Slugger is the best weapon set, and you can take the shotgun and heavy weapon perks! The Bos underarmor and the enclave ones give strength bonuses. I use an instigating grognaks axe just one star that I bought from another player it's awesome for soloing. Do you wear power armor a lot? I play mostly without it and use the excavator when I need to carry more, had to grind a while to get those calibrated shocks for sure. Perception isnt super necessary but a high endurance helps. Without power armor I have all of the non power armor protective cards on, barbarian, evasive, junk shield, ironclad. The one handed weapon set is faster but less damage I started with that one but I recommend Slugger honestly. Having the first aid perk equipped so you can heal almost fully with one stimpack is great. And perks white knight and makeshift warrior help keep repairs to a minimum. If you are going for a power armor build most of this advice may not help but get that strength maxed out either way. Happy hunting bro!
---
I'm selling more weapon modification plans than ever. I price them pretty low and they're getting eaten up as folks now have new great weapons to try.  I don't have vendor space for all my armor kid plans but they'll be in once I run out of the weapon ones.  Ammo is also a bigger seller now for folks with new caliburs they need for their new type of gun.
---
Interesting idea, but the player character is the only one inoculated against the scorch virus. Every other human in the area would be subject to exposure, and ultimately, become scorched.
---
Someone else got him. 👍
---
WHAT LOL
---
I’m glad you replied so i can explain why you are wrong.
---
Legendary effects - this game is built upon the legendary system and would have died out in a month probs less because its based on gambling and therefore addictive. Remove legendaries and you may as well just play cod. Its what seperates this games pvp from others.
---
You say equal terms? This game is an rpg/survival it is not anthem or cod where the game is primarily about player skill in pvp its a combination of player skill character build and character gear. You need all three.
---
Again the workshop catered to a raider lifestyle where you could he robbed if you were careless then i can catch you off guard and take your loot that is my incentive. Even better if you seek revenge then i get more caps as you try to get your stuff back. 
---
I think camps should be destructable unless you are in pacifist while i dont usually so this the option should be there as a playstyle choice. Anyone against this is anti player choice which is what fallout is about.
---
Why are you getting downvoted
---
Okay so the purveyor enabled several new legendary items. Two of those are legendary wood and legendary ultracite gatling. We already have confirmed reports of wood armor losing all but 1 legendary star on login, so it wouldn't surprise me if the other newly-legendary items are broken too
---
It just started working again. My friend told me he was playing and the servers went down and were back up again and for me to try to join a world after the restarted the servers. I was able to log in fine. Must have been a bug.
---
The Major modifier on Melee makes a huge difference I'm always going for 2☆ on those. Except fkr weight reduction or strength the third star isn't great.
---
Ranged you have to go 3☆ because the major and minor modifiers are nice for them. 
---
I'm just happy we finally have a way to get a guarenteed 3☆ drop
---
Since learning you can use them without becoming wanted I crafted me a few, haven't had to use any yet tho
---
My friend has a quad explosive double barrel which he uses on her wings. That usually cripples her and can keep her on the ground for a long time. While he does that I focus on her head with a furious .50 cal. Most fights like that don't last 10 min. Hope that helps. 👍
---
All legendarys seem to be glitched, yesterday I found 4 legendary supermutants in one spot (one *, two ** and a ***) and I got legendary loot of the one * and one of the ** but the three star dropped a non legendary board and I the two star dropped nothing, even tho I was the only one there
---
Says the pacifist player. Typical hypocrite....
---
Dude use nuka crypt I don't understand to begin with why a general need to decrypt codes anyways
---
Sounds like somebody scrubbed out of PvP.
---
Yup. It would be the same rate. Just gives more flexability.
---
I wont be able to play till monday again (out of town). So ill have to hop home after work just to sell my crap so im not in the same situation again when i do. Originally i was planing to leave straight from work.
---
Well a bit off topic but - is it me or everybody else has no practical results during interaction with air purifiers or with machine at Abandoned Mine Shaft Elaine?
---
Yeah if it's one thing fo4 did right it was the power armor changes 1000% better it actually feels like your in a tank
---
Yeah that's what I meant with "clipping into the ground or whatever" she doesn't do it too often for me but when it does happen I appreciate the guaranteed kill ofc, but it just feels silly that's the main way in which she's able to be killed by most groups, through a bug or a large number of people wielding supposedly very rare weaponry, who just so happen to be on the same server. If the rewards were god tier I could understand, but there isn't even a guaranteed three star at the end, just some flux and prime receiver plans.
---
I got an assassins, explosive +250 damage res while reloading weapon.
---
&gt;wastelanders of non binary gender
---
owo
---
With paragraphs lol
---
People's gear has been disappearing for different reasons for months. Either they're aware, or they don't care.
---
If something have a counter, that does not meat it is balanced. Also camps should be destructible on survival, not in adventure, this change was really good for the game. Hope they make survival good one day, so all pvp players will play this mode.
---
Also, I died 0 times to other players in this game.
---
It’s nowhere near as hard as the other two event tho, one lvl 40 could do it
---
LMFAO! This was great. I don't know why I laughed harder when I read Short Night Vision Scope as a possible mod.
---
I’d buy it from you if you were on PS4! One mans trash is another mans treasure! Haha
---
Yeah you can max out at 1000 scrip did that yesterday morning haven’t been able to sell anything since all of the legendary machine shows zero strip it sucks to have her inventory full of legendary’s and can’t even sell them dead weight so stupid
---
Like the other guy said its not that simple. Its not easy to find a good fight and ill partipate against people like yourself no worries. But because of the minority of the player base robbing less prepared players supplies me with junk money so that i don’t have to do pve all the time. Like I said raider + pvp player.
---
I think it should be 500
---
How are they making these murder boxes? Is this in survival or adventure mode because I thought as long as I don't attack anyone I can't be harmed by players and adventure mode...
---
Your tears fuel my joy tbh.
---
Every one of those tower owners need to be reported for griefing.  That is all it is, plain and simple. 
---
I had to take a break from Survival because the spawn camping was getting ridiculous. And they love doing it! They think it's "pvp yo, go to adventure if you don't like it."
---
Bethesda, please, fix spawn camping.  The stations need to be exclusion zones.  Survival is not Fallnite (or Fort out) battle royal, but is intended as a challenge mode with uncertain player interactions.
---
Been using the Summerset special for a long long time. I’ve yet to find another better .44
---
They can bring back the Gatorclaws.
---
I don't know a lot about the Florida fauna, but something like a giant mutated snapping turtle would look cool. Maybe two heads and stuff.
---
Assuming they live there.
---
Yeah, same with the constant "can you say [something something]".
---
Then again, I always interpreted his name as meaning he's pompous.
---
It should definitely be more consistent, with a clear set of fair rules. Still, infinitely better and more enjoyable than the chaotic mess known as the Encryptid Event.
---
Lmfao. That was epic.
---
You do relize sweats like you being triggered is what he wants
---
Just trade it with someone
---
out of 6 rolls i got a railway rifle, 2 grenade launchers, one rocket launcher, and ok pistol and an ok handmade... 2/6 nice....
---
Yeah. It took me and my buddy 6hrs of grinding to get the backpacks, luckily the high capacity mod was bugged and when you bought it it would show up as known and you can craft it without having to actually consume it so he was able to let me hold it and upgrade my backpack without me having to grind for those other 8 badges lol ...so yay for an additional 120 carry weight!
---
Yup im keen for it.
---
Yes. Exactly. They do stack buuuuut... Only 75 percent chance of any of it to work.
---
I got a junkies rolling pin first try.
---
Because launching an nuke was supposed to be end game content that takes a lot of time and effort to achieve and only have a week's time to do it before it all reset the website just made it trivial by making a work around.
---
I hear you. I wouldn't mind the towers so much if I could air strike them to oblivion like before the camp patch. I pop into the servers Ocassionally when I want the extra xp or if I'm feeling in the mood for some danger.  Wasn't fun to spawn in to like 6 rocket turrets already aimed in my direction. If I wasn't using 3 lvls of fireproof I'm sure I'd have died
---
You can run more than one mutation at a time?
---
I uhh... Had the same feeling while listening to Disturbed?
---
Lol, I think so too. Hopefully Todd continues to smile down on me. 😊
---
True on both counts, though if you manage to bring two friends to the encryptid event who just keep the pylons up it becomes quite easy imo.
---
How do u get it?
---
That's just like, your opinion, man...
---
I’M GLAD YOU ASKED! I have no idea. There isn’t lore for our Moley Minery friend, yet. If I’ve learned anything from George Lucas, it’s that ANYTHING can be retconned.
---
2☆ melee the 3rd star would only get at most +1str or 90% reduced weight for good perks
---
3☆ Ranged there are some pretty useful modifiers with that 3rd star.
---
Also if you server hop there you might die in a nuke zone
---
Well thats nothing compared to my Weightless ghoul slayer's gamma gun with +1 agility...........................
---
Like a Zealot golf club? 😂
---
Thanks for the offer! Unfortunately I'm on xb1 ☹️
---
Holy Shit!
---
Hah raiders.   They are not RP raiders.  They are internet trolls at best.  Pieces of shit irl with mental issues that use justifications to try and cover up their crazy.
---
Wow!  Congrats!
---
Sweet! What type?
---
Sry. Atm none for trade available. But you dont need the bloodied effect on weapons for this to work. You only need the Adrenal Reaction Mutation. Bloodied is just a "nice to have".
---
Otherwise try your luck at the new vendor :)
---
Thanks man appreciate the support
---
i dont actually mind blocking perks personally... reduce and reflect lol
---
Jeez, well it could be worse, like a ghoul slayer's gamma lol
---
That's no big achievement the number of enemies that spawn is related to player count
---
does opening the social menu close the terminal?
---
Sounds like we need a second Curie ^_^
---
Is it weird I want this?
---
Splody guns are always worth keeping. Stick it in your vending machine for a couple thousand caps and make some pistol build happy.
---
7 times I tried for 3* rifles and nothing but junk. Well done!
---
Welcome to 2019.
---
People here are mostly uneducated. Pacifist mode on survival servers is bugged, and often gives you and your base invincibility against other players.
---
Holy shit!  Good (brown) eye!
---
That must weigh several courics!
---
Would be interesting to see.  I bet a video like that would bring in some views as well.
---
I’ve been to encryptid where almost the entire “world” was there, and they were reliably Manning the pylons. And I STILL died once every 5 seconds. I’ve never been killed in an SBQ event.... I digress. Back you’re original post. :)
---
I invite people to a team whenever I want to see item stats. The team doesnt do anything too allow us to inspect, but I'm trying to signal that u need to return to your base. In order to be able to inspect people's stuff the owner has to be like 20-40 feet away, i.e nearby. So dont join the team, but please come back so I actually see if your 5-20k item is worth buying.
---
It was created in America and was used during the civil war.
---
Nice man you just self-pwned yourself because you confuse adventure pacifist with survival one and they are two different things. Actually, they are one thing that works two different ways depending on gamemode.
---
One little comment and you get triggered, wow!
---
not only that, i now have loading screens of crap instead of cool moments or things... 
---
before it was like... yea our first scorch beast kill, take a photo. loading screen is a cool memory
---
now its like... remember that time that we went to dress up as a clown and take a picture in the wendigo cave while drunk.... for 10 atoms.
---
Absolutely amazing, I love the style and story Bravo!
---
I tried to get random 3* armor and all but two of them had "breath underwater" so I got junk.
---
Did you get past all the other creatures first. He appears last. And only if you get the cows back to the farm?
---
Ok. Thats nice.
---
Bethesda did, and that’s why the limit is 150, and that’s why it’s not going to go up. Even with the limit you believe is way too small, everyone can get a 3 star weapon or a couple of 3 star armor pieces EVERY DAY. How long will it take to have everything everyone wants at that pace, a month? With your increase that reduces to a week or less. And then what does everyone do?
---
Bethesda is working from the Book of Online Games. It’s too bad they didn’t get a newer copy though, where we might have a way to grind up a specific weapon exactly how we want rather than continually pulling that one armed bandit.
---
Sounds like COMMUNISM.
---
Im not sure. I didnt try. I just ignored the invites.
---
From what I’ve seen from players vending unwanted items it would seem to be lowering the value of legendary items to a far more realistic level. I’m vending several unwanted 2 and 3 star weapons for between 500 and 1500 caps, hopefully Bethesda has finally implemented a system that will finally balance the economy and put an end to people changing +10k for a single item.
---
Have you had anything “reduce” down from a 3-star to a 2-star yet?
---
I somehow had a set of stairs "intersecting" with a roof... but the stairs were well below the roof and had no possible way of intersecting it. Somethings fucky.
---
Two simple questions, how big are your balls and how does this effect your daily life?
---
You are kidding me right are we talking about the same guy? You mustnt have watched his vids. He has the literal opposite of a god complex. His gear is trash average at best I’ve never seen him use a steathboy in his vids he does love his chameleon armour tho. Link me one video where he shows he is a poor loser he is the exact opposite i met him in game dumpstered his ass we chatted after he gave up and was nothing but nice. Also link me a vid of his where he uses a single stealth boy ive seen most of them...
---
Personally stick to 2 star weapons for now, when I get good ones for myself, will change to 3 stars for godroll hunting.
---
Is the UK region locked? I thought we could play and trade with anyone from anywhere?
---
Also good work holding the camera if I wasn't at work and on PS4 I'd be running to you right now
---
From everyone who hasn't found the tourist yet Thank You
---
Best tip i can give is put a foundation down to get your walls started and dont use any more than minimal. Use dirt floors on the ground. Half walls can be built to the ground.
---
Lol, the Charlie Brown roll 😂
---
You see the issue as that we have to swap out cards to go from non-combat to combat. 
---
The real issue might be that they didn't expect people to be swapping cards so frequently.  
---
You have to think of this from the design perspective - what were they trying to accomplish:  People constantly ask for respecs in games where they have builds, and people clearly are going to want to have a different build for groups vs. solo.  This design may have been their attempt (even if it was poorly executed) to allow people to respec. 
---
It could be "be careful what you wish for" since the solution might end up in less Special points for you to slot your cards (since you don't need those spots for things like lockpicking) or even some form of cost involved in doing a respec (since you shouldn't need to respec as often if you have passives). 
---
It also begs the question of what is going to be a "passive" ability - sure hacking or lockpicking might not have much combat applications, but some others might: Weight reduction perks allow you to stay moving without loosing AP, wouldn't that count as combat related?  If you eat a corpse with cannibal to get some quick healing or fill your hunger bar, doesn't that count as combat related?  
---
Maybe the real solution is that we need more scenarios where during the heat of battle we WANT those cards slotted - such as when you might want to hack a terminal and turn off defeneses.
---
So... its not the creepy Pip-Boy statue that’s peeking out the window?
---
Around these parts Radrat is a delicacy lol
---
if you have 2/3 star items on your vendor you are losing out on business. inviting u to a team is the only way I can notify you I need you to come back so I can spec your items.
---
That's RADdiculous
---
If you carry that thing around, it probably _would_ be permanent.
---
I would go 3* for melee for that small chance at getting Str. Ranged I would just go 2* to get something good to use than go for 3* after that.
---
Yep i swear he just doesnt like me i goto pther places he spawns and nothing
---
I'm not sure about region locked or not but thought it was worth mentioning just in case! Amd thanks for the kind words, it's been a frustrating time so it made sense to share the love if possible! Good luck on your hunt!
---
I've done it 4 times, catch frog (from the whitesprings pool near golf course spawn locale), craft a habitat, and place in my camp and it's never registered. So I'm wondering if it's bugged. Let me know if you succeed and how you did it!
---
:D
---
Haha add me and we can try if your on xbox.
---
The mental image of someone pressing it up against their face with an intense look of concentration... rofl
---
Damn just saw it now, got 2 Assaultron 3* yesterday and now its 2* both and same legendary effect both, previously they were not same... Also its their Primary legendary effect that i lost, one was a medecine assaultron...
---
r/whiteknights
---
I completely agree. I get a few hits on the sheepsquatch then protect the Brahmin if no one else is. If someone is then I go to town on the sheepsquatch. What really bugs me the most are the people that come in with the TSE’s and just blow everything away...including the Brahmin. Pull out a non explosive weapon for group events please. We’re here for the event, even if you’re not. 😤
---
Did you read at all? survival has been garbage for 2 patches I explained why... come back here when you read the post....
---
I have one and people still ignore it. :( I'll come back after a day and literally every goddamn door is just hanging open.
---
I don't quite agree. First time I launched a nuke it was sort of by accident. I realized I could enter the silos and went into Site Alpha just to see what was there and how far I could get. With some help from a random high level player midway through I managed to get to the end, but by then he had disappeared already and I was standing there with like 1 or 2 code pieces in my inventory. So I Googled the current code and launched my first nuke. Felt a bit cheaty, but I also don't have time to find all 8 pieces so I accepted it.
---
Happy to help,  on most days from 17.00 bst. ( gmt +1) natDread
---
Load them in a broadsider!
---
I lived in survival.  I love the risk and the restricted fast travel.  I hoped they would add more challenging mechanics as time went on.
---
It just got too griefy. I don't mind losing a fight.  But to sit and camp one  of the few travel spots... Ugh.
---
i pointed this out months ago and it irritated the hell out of me enemies would go 6th sense sniper mode the moment you put a single crop or water purifier down.
---
this is made worse by the turrets with low sensors and the spotlights barely help as it doesnt detect the things from further away
---
What am I actually looking at? I dont think ive seen it before
---
Then why make the post? 
---
you talked about your problem, I gave you a possible solution that was it.
---
They can't track items. They can't track your inventory in real time. It's a hold over from using a single player engine.
---
Oh I know. 
---
I just find peoples' usage of the word 'and' funnier than I should 
---
Ha!
---
Watoga is a ghost town since player vending came out. I'd love to see them do something to draw activity there again. Oh, tl:Dr, just commenting on watoga.
---
Lol, crazy, thanks for the Plat? =D
---
What platform r u on, if u have some to spare I could make a trade
---
It's a minigun,  I'll definetly use it for survival
---
Yeah, I hate how even if we move it in build mode, it still blocks the doorway.
---
FYI if you tame a mega sloth be aware that they vocalize loudly and constantly.  Amusing for a while but I found that it got old pretty quickly.
---
I was literally stood on the back porch of my CAMP watching some little lvl 10ish skipper come up the river bank help himself to my unlocked purifiers.  "Godspeed" I wished him, as that is why they are there.
---
As he approached the only one I keep locked for personal use I was thinking, "No, no, no little dude, don't do it, you just got at least 15 drinks you'll be fine for a while, it's locked for a reason..." (as I pulled out a BP pistol).
---
Sure enough down he crouched, red went the tag, explode went his head - didn't even feel bad.
---
Then why the post something about it.
---
You talked about your problem and I gave you a possible solution.
---
As a sniper who really wants a good hunting rifle, I'm not jelous.  Now had it been AAE with -90% weight, then I'd be jealous.
---
How about some kind of system where you can select what events you want tracked and will get notified whenever they pop up?
---
It must be in the washing machine, if u get my white springs reference
---
bring back the bonus rad damage as a minor trait and you have yourself a ghoul preserver
---
Awesome 👍 have fun!
---
You know what?  I'll take the L on this one. I totally had lorespade name mixed up with ragechronicals for some reason. Take literally everything I said, remove it from spade, and dump it onto ragecheonicals.
---
I actually did it on the first time, but after that screw that I'm googling them
---
She speaks Fozzy Bear.
---
Thanks! Hopefully you'll have better luck in the future!
---
Entitled, because you think other people should indulge your play style by being unwilling and unexpecting fodder for you to kill. It's hardly a strawman when you yourself said there's no point shooting someone if they're gonna shoot back.  It's literally what you said...  
---
Bethesda made the PVP mechanics for workshops and camps and now Bethesda have tweaked those rules. There is absolutely no argument that Bethesda meant for PVPers to prey on non-PVPers because they have made their intention clear with the changes to close up a few loopholes where people could accidentally slip into PVPing without being fully aware.  
---
There's an entire game mode that Bethesda have created for you to PVP against knowing and willing participants.  You may not like what they've created, but it's obvious they disapprove of 'evil' or 'villainous' playstyles. They've gone to great lengths to demonstrate that. It makes sense because even if a handful of toxic players leave because they can't grief other players for their fun, a hell of a lot more will stay playing because it's enjoyable rather than having their game spoiled by a few imposing on their playing.
---
I fight anyone: thats just a delusional stereotype over used story you tell yourself to make yourself feel better. I’ve got a screenshot of my going 100 kills without dying in that mode...  not saying im the best but i do alright.
---
I’m arguing that you should be able to be a villain in a fallout game - explain me to why that should no be allowed?
---
Wow. This is some next level shit. Amazing!
---
You're doing Atoms work my friend
---
You are so sweaty, and a nuke zone isn't worth what you get. I think until they make nuze zones better its fair to use nuka crypt. I think it's fair either way. You still have to do a dungeon anyways. It doesn't make any sense why a general has too decrypt as well
---
Congratulations &amp; thanks for including my kind human.
---
Thanks, I'll give that a try. I server hopped the light house and the sweet water place, but he never spawned.
---
this jingle haunts me, grinding that thing was awful and this version came up a ton.
---

---
Thanks for the extra info and look into the game files. Obviously we know it's non functioning, which has been a common theme for most Energy Weapons in 76 thus far. 
---
Was hoping to at least get a "Hi, we are working on this" from the team, but received silence instead, once again.
---
Yeah you are pobably right, solely because the implementation of my idea would be quite hard and yours would be more easy. Behind my idea was mainly to literraly rebuild West Virginia. Even with the camp system all of this is in a certain way missing. This would have changed the elements of the old world and not only some cabins in the woods
---
One time it was me and 2 guys and at the end like 20 bloatflies spawned, and another time when i was with 4 guys, like 3 bloatflies spawned
---
No problems at all, polite Mutant! :)
---
No explosives but I got instigating gauss and a rail rifles with the exact same stats.
---
Instigating, +50% limb dmg, and faster movement while aiming.
---
It’s all about crippling the wings. If you got a good team 4 people can take her down in 5 minutes consistently
---
Yet another reason not to accept team invites.  
---
Some guy wanted to trade me and of course he wanted my prime explosive Gauss rifle and AAE combat shotgun.  I gave him the thumbs down.  He then sent me a team invite and I declined.  He tried to gank and I one shotted him with said Gauss.  Then he starts yelling at me and I shoot him again.  Finally left me alone after that. 
---
He’s probably the same guy that sets up his trading camp and you fast travel into 
---
the basement and can’t access anything.  So annoying. 
---
Honestly those players aren’t fun in either adventure or survival mode.  They need to just fuck right off.
---
\*rich man walks into a bank fanning himself with money\*
---
"my good man, is there a limit to my riches? For I am RICH!!!"
---
Thats u
---
Yeah i love them so much :D
---
Well written and entertaining. Good job.
---
You bigoted cishet white male
---
Are you sure? I mean, like really sure? On a surety scale between one and ten, where do you think you sit on not having seen this particular thing before? ;D
---
They’re just gonna tell you sorry about your luck.
---
I disagree. If you're on a team, your actions should be considered team actions.
---
I don't think so. Pretty sure you need the receiver specific to that weapon's caliber
---
Pass along the nukashine and i will feel your pain with you ... before we vanish like your weapon !
---
Bunch of berserker junk, some decent ones, explosive but nothing amazing
---
That's what survival was made for, hence being called "survival mode".
---
bandolier + batteries included I keep all ammo on my person. Have thousands of round of each type. Hardly affects me at all. I drop all mini nukes missles and 40mm grenades.
---
I'm on xbox. Folks can just send me a message through the player menu. Or not.  I won't lose sleep. Teaming up is not required for vending.
---
Shocking Drops so far !!!! i think they need to up the amount of script you can get in a day !!
---
No you can farm legendarys way easier than turning in weapons for script. Adding 1 3star drop a day is useless
---
Oh. My. GOD... I think I'd rather take a Sheepsquatch to the face than be on the wrong end of that! :O
---
Ok again you didn’t read what I said pvp is being implemented because its 1 of 2 end game content options. Grinding legendaries and pvp. If bethesda was hearing the pvp players they would balance the pvp based what people who know what they are talking about. Not the cry babies. Bethesda knows this game needs pvp to keep it alive because you can only deliver new pve new quests so fast (not fast enough). Right now none of what actual pvp players have said has been implemented into balancing - just what some random people said when they tried survival when it came out.
---
Yeah remove trading from game. Fortunately, this ain't gonna happen.
---
Nope! I’m checking out player vendors more frequently and buying more.
---
Go to Charleston and jump off the suspension bridge over the shallow pool of water.
---
Have friend revive you.
---
So, does "not useless" = "God roll", because the game is broken if their are only two categories : 1) you get this and you kill everyone easy -and- 2) you get this and don't even bother fighting back because it'll just be like a toddler punching a brick wall?
---
Everbody *should* be able to at least find "good enough" items that the PVP fights are at least somewhat even, otherwise, it's not really even worth calling it a "game" at that point, it's just : here, eat this bowl of poop.
---
I don't have to be the best, but I shouldn't even be able to pay diligently for months and not have found stuff that can be "good" (meaning I'll at least win ***some*** PVP fights vs. players with the best stuff and the best builds.
---
It should not be possible for the difference to  be so extreme as to make the fights pointless.
---
Yes, I don't think it would be a very good idea to load it into a nice new backpack, certainly!
---
My bad, I confused the lmg with then 50cal
---
Good Grief! xD
---
At lv 6, naw. But I'd happily make you gear. At your lv you can't do any of the big stuff, but at lv 50 everything will be open to you, making it much easier to find companions
---
Strength definitely does not affect ranged damage, I have a bloodied unyielding melee main who hits 40str and a max level gun in his hands might as well be a peashooter
---
You should be able to damage camps in Survival.
---
never leave home without it, but i'de scrap it in favour of that one.
---
I don't have any pistol perks, i would like to see what that could do. Now theres a, thought, might try that tonight as a temp. test . Can one get a hardend reciever for a .44 ? . that one has a standard reciever on it,and its still above a combat or hand made with all 9 rifle perks. I'de be chuffed with it.
---
??????? wots on the summerset ?...can't scrap that.....find other 44's or plans for 44's. build,scrap,and repeat, till the reciever shows up................hmmm.
---
People aren't disappointed about lack of speach challenges, they're disappointed about not being able to interact with NPCs in an immersive way. And not being able to effect the world and own it the way you would in a previous fallout game. You don't feel like it's your world which you are an important part of and can do real good or real bad to the world which makes it an immersive experience. And so along with other aspects like those make it nothing like a fallout game which is what people were expecting from a game named fallout. I was one of those people trying to explore and adventure like in previous fallout games, collecting little notes and adding them up from around the map to make a story and just taking my time. And it was impossible, too much always going on around me, people already having explored places first and it hadn't reloaded yet. For example getting a key code in a note to open a storage area in a mine. The area was already open and looted. So I stopped playing the game.
---
Queue a month or so ago I started playing again but forgetting it was a fallout game, focusing on battles and trading and events and loot and camp building and now thoroughly enjoying the game, not as a fallout game but as a completely different game. It wear the face of a fallout game and that's what caused alot of disappointment from people wanting just that. Forget it's a fallout game and it's a very enjoyable game, still a ways to go but they're not slowing down in getting there
---
I legit dont know what it is! Is it just an actual shit?
---
Ouch really? Should stay this way I think.
---
The Measurement people are still making their final decision, but preliminary tests show it's at least 0.8 Bono!
---
No weirder than me spending the time to create it ;D
---
Well open world workshops technically would be the first step towards "town building" and would leave "lasting impact". Theoretically something a player places today could last all the way til the game enda
---
Appreciate it! Any tips on how to level up faster?
---
while I do agree with you on most of your points you do have to admit bethesda (and FUCKING TODD HOWARD!) did screw up on some parts, foremost being the fact that they used the game engine that is basically this meme:  [https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bc/e0/ee/bce0ee3569cda9356b4b67549c61f819.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bc/e0/ee/bce0ee3569cda9356b4b67549c61f819.jpg)
---
Yeah it is quite some text but you are right. It even was intended to be a ghosttown according to the questline, but after completing the mayor questline in Watoga it could be a safe haven for NPCs ^^
---
If you want to be a raider where every session is death and destruction then go on the survival mode. You can kill who you like, but need to avoid being killed yourself.
---
But really they're less interested in "being a raider" and are just interested in being a dick with no repercussion, since they like the killing/destroying aspect but are too chickenshit to risk their own stuff
---
Absolutely but it's bugged right now due to the vender update.
---
I mean it sucks people have gotten good gear from ebay but its very possible to get good stuff  from the market there is plenty to go around just make connections. 
---
Also good gear isn’t the end all it gives you an edge but you can do very well with 1 star gear and a well thought out build and good play.
---
Ok, what is AAE. Personally what I really want is an instigating one but I would have been happy with a two shot explosive. Best I’ve found and I didn’t even find it, my friend did and got it so I could, was a hunting rifle that does 10% more when aiming and 50 percent more when they have 40% health or less with 90 percent health reduction found for sale at some one’s camp. Come to think of it if it was instigating vs the 40 percent health that would be the perfect rifle.
---
It would be if you pull out the night vision scope, but I'm not touching that for all the tea in Whitespring :)
---
supressing explosive 50 cal lmg and an anti armor 20% limb damage gatling laser, both 2 stars. 
---
Not what I wanted but still pretty devent I guess?
---
I got some pretty good drops that weren’t meant for my build, so I’m selling them. The best thing I got for me was a two star quad hunting rifle with extra limb damage.
---
ahh I am on PC.
---
Are you on PC?  
---
I don't mind dying so your friend can revive me.
---
Cards like home defense begs to differ from your statement. If Bethesda wanted us to focus and specialize on one specific build than they should have designed way more cards towards that agenda. 
---
The only specialization they have is for weapons ie; shot gun, rifles, energy weapons etc. "Home defense, lock picking, and hacking" was not on their list as far as "specialization goes". Trust me, no one logs into fo76 for the first time and says "iM GoInG tO bE a LoCkPiCk sPeCiAlIsT..."
---
replace Yzma with "the creation engine" and you get what I'm saying
---
All mine changed to Stalkers prefix for no reason
---
It was a labour of love and a process of unburdening ;D Thank you!
---
No. Your reward for completing all merit badges is the sweet, sweet knowledge that you've completed all the merit badges.

Then, as a real life reward, if you take that knowledge, and $1, you can buy a $.99 snack!

I can mod it for you. 200caps each. psn AfricanDungbeetle69

i dont really like the idea of relating it to an already grindy questline but there should definetly be a way to increase the scrip per day because 150 is not even two 3 star weapons if you grind out enough legendarys to get the 150 scrip you already ran across two or the three stars already so the purveyor as is doesnt really change anything imo
---
Lmao
---
I just haven't bothered to spend any yet. If I'm capped it gives me a reason to spend them instead of hoarding.
---
Instagating explosive .44 revolver
---
In the original image that's what was in that mod slot and I just thought, "Yeah, that makes about as much sense as the rest of them!" xD
---
I agree with that statement, I meant player activity though, it was a great place to farm alot of materials, caps, and legendaries. They done watoga way wrong. I actually moved my camp down south to cut my traveling costs down as alot of my daily doings were in watoga. Not any more.
---
Why is my post stuck at 0 when so many I people agree w/me?
---
😭
---
Same mechanic as cap vendors
---
Got a 3 star furious handmade yesterday.  I cashed in 500 so got 5 chances and that was a solid pickup but the other 4 left a lot to be desired.  
---
I’m definitely a handmade rifle hoarder.  I have 4 other legendaries so it’s all good.
---
Close, but no Bono.
---
Again you didn’t listen to what i said at all. Survival sucks but you didn’t read why because you are afraid what you read will shatter your fragile belief system.
---
Even then why shoudn’t you be allowed to play a villain in a multiplayer fallout which is a franchise about player choice? Explain.
---
They just need to give perk cards like these some sort of passive combat buff
---
the last time I was there, it was swarming with players.. maybe it's my region?
---
Is her will her own?
---
I rolled a couple Three-Star wood pieces. After logging in on my next play session, they were One-Star pieces.
---
 I got a pipe pistol and turned it back in.
---
Took your loot?
---
Hoarding them for what purpose exactly?
---
Read try very hard.
---
If they made it similar to rust I'd be down. But in that mode, I think they should either buff our armor and damage to npc's across the board and remove legendary effects, or make nearly every armor drop have a fun substat.
---
Equal terms, means that people are ready and consented to fight. Also the legendary effects are great, but should not be active during PvP, because there you will rely on your skill and BUILD, which does not make the game cod or whatever shooter you throw in. For example Blade &amp; Soul made this in the PvP aspect.
---
For the workshop, if you get me unprepared in the the premise of the said shop, great. But since you can see my name and location on the map, this is not a fair play, it's just shooting fish in the barrel. Since it requires someone to contest the workshop to render me hostile.
---
As for camps I already said this, they should be destructible on a mutual agreement for PvP.
---
I see you are salty, because the majority of people are casual players, who play on pacifist mode. And by your comments you want to be the bigger fish in the majority of situations for the cap and junk bounty. Is this why you don't like the Survival mode? On my survival character I keep minimal camp, junk and aids so I can hunt people like you. There I have consent for PvP and to lose my junk if I fail.
---
That's illegal!
---
... unless you're part of the Free States, then I guess it's fine.
---
Umm and that is which? 😅 Sorry didn't ever notice when exactly they reset
---
90% chance of pink eye 🤣
---
4 weapons with a lot of VAT stats (and I never use VATs)
---
I did see his apology, actually, way after this threat.  It seemed to be genuine.  So maybe he's become a good person and matured since then.
---
150 is such a weird number when you can turn in things that are worth 9, 24, or 40.
---
Well there's quite the variance in description but if I had to condense it, "A person who doesn't consider themselves to be either one of the two 'historically popular' genders of male or female."
---
That's not a great way of saying it, but it's probably ok as far as a comment on a pic of some poo is worth :)
---
Adventure. Apparently those rules don’t apply to traps.
---
Oh I know. It’s more of a tongue and cheek dig at the salt on the sub this morning. 
---
I grind *because I can*.  Glad to see you are having fun.
---
No it worked for me, you need a third person to knock your friend down, that’s how it worked for me and my friends
---
I just haven't bothered to spend them.  If I'm capped it gives me a reason to to do so.
---
You put it in a better way than I did, that’s for sure.  Yes, you are exactly right, it wasn’t just speech challenges, it was the immersive dialogue system as a whole that would affect your experience.  Thanks for the insight.  And yes, it wasn’t meant to be that kind of game but many people judged it based on their desires for it to be a fully fledged Fallout game.  I think it’s unfair for them to have those expectations though, because Bethesda was clear that such things would not be in the game.  I do hold Bethesda partly responsible, though, because they could have been clear about it’s ARPG nature.  Banking on the Fallout name did blow up in their faces, but it really shouldn’t have if the game was judged properly from the beginning.  
---
Your current experience with the game is exactly what I think everyone would feel if they stopped trying to fit this game within the Fallout bubble and compared the gameplay to similar style games.  It is indeed very fun, and gives a great farming/loot experience! Cheers :)
---
I’d actually love to see this!  I find things like this interesting.  I rarely have any junk on me, I’m always scrapping and dumping. But if this happened to me I’d laugh my ass off then want to go back to inspect the place!  I get why people don’t like them, I’m just a little strange I guess, and it’s just a game.
---
The gods were smiling down on me that day. Or giggling. It really did sound a little like giggling, now I think back.
---
Alle 20 Stunden werden die Händler und der tauschautomat wieder aufgefüllt ;)
---
Yes, but can you reduce the weight of the Mini-Nukes? Because those suckers get heavy.
---
&gt; I got a god roll bloodied 3 star... Unfortunately it rolled onto a crossbow.
---
I would **love** to take that one out of your hands for my Daryl build. PS4, by any chance? Would give you 4k for it, but I won't be online for another seven or eight hours from now.
---
Oh now you're just being cruel ;D
---
I always figured AA was the answer to bloodied in pvp. I mean you’re already lower health and It’s ignoring 50% of the armor already. AA with some vats crit works nicely. 
---
I’ve killed many in pvp. Also been killed by many lol.
---
You can stack every single one, except...
---
Herbivore and carnivore
---
Can only have one or the other of them
---
Just kill stuff. Super mutants give the best xp, but finding a lot at you lv is hard. No large groups at lv 5, just a few here and there. You also want to look into how you want to speck out so your not wasting attribute points. You can change your stats at lv 50, but you can only move one point per lv, so re speaking takes time. 
---
I.e. I am specked as a rifle build, so I have high perseption, agility, and luck. Str and endurance low. But with the right ruffle I deal over 600 damage per trigger pull, and double if sneaking.  
---
However your malee people have high st, and low perception. Idk your play style,  so it's up to you
---
And I've been Dc'd 😕 sorry y'all! Good luck with your hunts!
---
The Snozzberries taste like Snozzberries
---
But I do, more xp its focused on pvp and you aim to kill other players and they aim to kill you.
---
It is just an actual shit. A dinosaur shit from ARK, if I'm going to be forced to admit :)
---
I had a 2 shot Fatman and sold it for 200 caps. It had 33% VATS feature.  Not a very good weapon.
---
Update 5-15-19 damage values with no perks on:
---
* QE Flechette Harpoon = 420
---
* QE Standard or Barbed Harpoon = 210
---
* TS Fatman (level 45) = 916
---
(Not: if changed to a MIRV the level 45 would do 296... MIRV always does the same no matter the level)
---
* TS MIRV (level 25) = 296
---
(Note: if changed to standard launcher this would do 716)
---
* TS Broadsider = 276
---
* TS M79 = 237
---
(Note: my level 35 instigating M79 shows 110, sure its 10 levels lower but that’s a huge difference from Two Shot)
---
* TS Missile Launcher = 316
---
* TS Auto GL = 237
---
* Bonus: my AAE crystallizing cryolator shows 31 energy damage with no perks. Ballistic damage unknown at explosive causes the value to be hidden from the stat screen for unknown reasons
---
Let me know if this helps your data!
---
Well, that depends entirely on your definition of reality. Are a collection of pixels forming an image, in a virtual game "real"? If so, then could consider this "actual"? if not, does that make it not "real"?
---
But what if you don't, but someone else does, is their reality more "real" than yours??? **kapow**, mind blown!
---
For sure
---
Yeah. I keep showing up in the last 30 seconds; not because I'm reluctant to carry my weight, but because I haven't noticed the event starting.
---
Can you suppress it for me? Not the noise, the smell. OMG the s m e l l...
---
GRIND BABY GRIND! I’m all in favor of reputation grinding. The tadpole stuff isn’t even that “grindy”, at least it’s different things (looking at you Eve and WoW). Maybe I’m just coming from a different gaming culture.
---
Yeah my Ps4 must be full any moment.
---
You need to go back to fort defiance 4th floor to get the password. Its on the desk in the last room to the left. After you read it again, the terminal at VTU gives you the option to run the test. After that, it'll give you a marker to reset the power allowing you to finish the quest. But yes, it seems it's bugged because you have to go to VTU then back to Fort Defiance, then BACK to VTU again. Sucks to spend caps travelling back and forth across the whole map...
---
Only with ordinance express maxed do they become reasonable weight.
---
see, thats why I asked,' will I shit on my starred weapons if I tinker with it'.
---
unlucky, yes, but you just might..... bummer !
---
been there,done that, and no amount of nuka shine
---
What a way to twist my words. 
---
So it is just your choice and freedom that counts? Or do I also get the freedom to not care for PvP and be disgusted by players that feel the need to grief others?
---
I don't play this game as a 'survival multiplayer' but rather as a co-op Fallout. I enjoy pve and working together. Yet I am not forcing you to be on my team and farm events together, just as you shouldnt force me into PvP.
---
Lastly with 30% HG, rank 5 DE, and rank 3 BM, the QE harpoon shows 848 flechette and 345 standard
---
Thank you very much! :)
---
Crap and an Assassin Explosiv Handmade
---
I don't really use power armour as I always feel a bit clunky in it, plus I love my heated power fist too much (tho I do carry around a set just in case I feel like jumping off a cliff lol), maxed out Strength and all strong back perks etc etc and always carry a few grilled radstags/buffout for the boost if things get tight. 
---
Without radstag/buffout, but with my deep pocket raider armour it's normally around the 300-mark, and I just make sure to keep popping back to my stash to unload if I need to. I haven't got the backpack yet either.
---
Thank you! Glad you like it! :)
---
That, is worth it's weight in ~~gold~~ spoiled vegetables! You will never want (for spoiled vegetables) for the rest of your day(s)!
---

“I never asked for this”
---
The way it's written, it sounds like the OP is suggesting doubling the cap, so 300 scrip daily turn-in and 2,800 caps available from robots; not that items would sell for double. I don't think that causes the FOMO that you're rightly concerned about.
---
Campfire tales
---
Thank you! Will add you tonight!!
---
hahaha I got you. hit me up at whitesprings. I'll need 2 stable stools though
---
I got 700 caps and 4 cram
---
Lower level. They are gonna end up as level 21 after you tame them regardless.
---
Yes the event Campfire Tales and the scout daily quests have a chance for badges. Didn't complete a single achievement and I have 5 badges already.
---
Some stuff needs/needed balace. TSE guns were stupid powerful, far and above any other legendary effects. Changing them was the right thing to do.
---
Wow... hate to say it but welcome to the club?  I tried everything to resolve this issue and finally submitted a ticket. I'm waiting for the next maintenance update which I think comes on the 21st of May. After that if it doesn't help, discontinue playing the game for awhile.  Don't know what else to do?  Several of my friends are experiencing this same issue.  They said Bethesda never got back with them so I'm not really sure they care to reply to anyone's complaints?
---
You can put well over 100 radiation traps underneath a floor connected to a switch or pressure plate.  Haven’t tested if works in the latest round of patches, but as of a few weeks ago it would hit EVERYONE in adventure mode - non-combatants, allies, and myself - with enough rads to nearly drop me with full health using rank 2 Ghoulish!
---
I made the same mistake and gender swapped. My wife also made the mistake (on the opposite gender as me) and refused to change to a man. She won't miss the atoms since she really grinds challenges and has \~9K right now, but I felt the loss as it was 20% of what I had.
---
you people do know that the mole miners are the poor schmuck mine workers of the area and had their suits fused to their body's when the shit hit the fan, right? as for why they're hostile, well, I'm pretty sure their skittish AF so whenever they see a non mole miner person they go into full panic mode, Purveyor Murmrgh is the only one so far who isn't as skittish as her drinking buddys, honestly i think internally she's in full panic mode whenever anyone enters her shop it's just that she has a little thing called self preservation and thus burys that panic deep down and resits the urge to open fire on everything that moves in the general area
---
Where does this take place at?
---
I'll team, if your your down with the 'Sabbath' ;)
---
Anti-Armor Explosive, reduced weight would be a cherry on top too.
---
I'm with you, they can get off my kawn too, while they're at it.
---
There will still be certain items, yesterday I bought a TSE Tesla rifle with 90% reduced weigh for 15k :) couldn’t be happier tho, being ill never be able to get this gun from a drop
---
That seems like an oversight since people default to being non-hostile unless they attack you.  I'll have to make sure to watch my back while I shop!
---
That's what I was afraid of. Considering a heavy weapons build, but Fat Man/missile launchers seem like a problem due to ammo weight.
---
Somewhat op. 200 for pocketed, and 500 for deep pocketed.
---
Camp Adams.  Anytime at night after 930
---
you lucky SOB, all i got was shit
---
I ALREADY DON'T WANT FOR SPOILED VEGETABLES! ARE YOU THEM?? ARE YOU THE ONE WHO KEEPS LEAVING SPOILED VEGETABLES IN MY CAMP? A R E  Y O U???
---
Forest region I think camp Adams
---
I cried laughing when I saw the Short NV Scope
---
Mine eventually loaded in a couple days later but I think people are still having this issue though I’m not sure
---
Just be careful how you hold your poo. Using that scope brings it mightily close to your mouth.
---
My prime explosive Gauss comes in right under 600 dmg.  All rifle perks maxed, demo expert 5, bloody mess 3.  Drop a psycho chem or initiate adrenaline perk (I’m maxed at 5) and that weapon does crazy shit.
---
This sounds like something that could not possibly go wrong! :D
---
Isn’t that a legacy weapon?
---
Keep eating the cram and you won't need 700 caps - you'll get one of these soon enough :)
---
Like it.  Good idea.
---
ah, because the game is meant to be played stupidly then. And i wont be giving any more of my money and time to it. 
---
Also-- No. Half the challenges are bugged as well. But nice try, troll.
---
Started out decent a great piece of unyielding combat armor and an AAE submachine gun, but then they all sucked after that.  Nothing to replace the gear I already have.
---
Please add to the menu an event interface that shows all events in progress and those that are in queue/cool-down. I would love this.
---
A dense chest mod and a few perk card choices and you can be point blank with an explossive shotgun and never feel it. Of course this still kinda sucks if the perk cards make you remove something else important. I ultitmatly switched away from mine becasue of this.
---
Yes. I've done it dozens of times.
---
Damn I thought it was a new weapon :(
---
My first thought was, if I can throw it like a grenade, or pickpocket that \*into\* someone else's inventory, that's an AMAZING item!
---
yes
---
and you would think that a blast in the face would to the job. No it wont. still have to hit the ground at their feet for max damage.
---
hmmm  just thought.. i have the charging shot gun mod, but before that, yes , I had to charge it.
---
This would make trading with alts easier. I hope that this happens sooner than later.
---
You humans and your language
---
“Let’s see him take the scorched menace down with this 3 star hunters lead pipe!” 
---
With +33 vats hit and reduced weight! 😀 
---
Talk about the godliest of rolls.
---
My problem is “give me a proper challenge” not “don’t give me a challenge at all”.
---
Wow! Congrats!
---
It wasn't just me either.   After I posted this I asked my crew and the same for them.  Cue organ music and bats lol
---
You forgot to add "while walking on a gravel road."
---
Would be great!
---
If you go under the "World" section of your challenges and scroll down, you'll see a cluster of challenges beginning with Tadpole. If if remember right, you have to completely finish three of the categories in addition to the other quest tasks (like reviving another player)
---
Well because up to now I've already got some of the best two star guns for my build. The only way they get better is if they're 3* instead.
---
Thanks for the tips!! I’m not a big fan of power armor. I just spent a bunch of hours gathering everything for the excavator set only to realize I’ll probably never use it.  I’ve been mostly focusing on one-handed so far with gladiator perks(using a modded black diamond and death tambo) and then shotgunning as my secondary.  Definitely need to upgrade that first aid perk.  I’m also thinking my armor situation could be improved. Currently using a mish-mash of self crafted leather and random pieces I’ve found in the wasteland.
---
That's  Bethesda failing at the basics. If your teammate goes rogue, you should be given a quick choice - stay and go rogue yourself, or leave party. Many games did just that, and it works fine. Also Pacifist toggle should already immediately drop group if one of your groupmates goes rogue. That's just baby frolics that Bethesda still hasn't figured this out. It's been done for years. Decades even.
---
Saving to read later but I like the title so upvote for that.
---
The EFSMI ofc. Does't everyone use it?
---
Not a bad review in General, but I disagree with 1 part. This IS a Fallout game. It's a different Fallout than past ones but it is still Fallout. If you say that this isn't a Fallout game, then you have to also conclude that Fo3 isn't a Fallout game because it was so different from the first 2 games. Things always change over time
---
Of course they screwed up some things, I pointed out a few things, and there are still bugs, but I play games to have fun/reach a goal/challenge, not to have a flawless experience.  The sum of this game’s parts provide a very satisfying experience one would expect from an ARPG, and it is very involved and satisfying even upkeeping your gear.  I don’t think harping on the engine they used is fair if the result is this much fun.  I’m sure they could have done BETTER if they made a brand new engine for the game, but what they have done should be judged on its own merits, and I believe it holds up very well compared to its relevant competition.  Also the future of the game could come with engine updates similar to how WoW upgrades theirs, so you can have hope in that sense.  As for what the game is, it is very good for an ARPG.
---
It usually gives me an area to search for a scorchbeast but any scorchbeast will do.  Area is usually south of trainyard.
---
Thanks, the main negatives to come out of Bethesda not emphasizing enough that this game was going to be a whole different type of game, just based in the same universe, is that people who don't enjoy these type of games at all but love fallout will have bought this game and been disappointed, and that people who enjoy fallout but would also enjoy this type of game based in fallout were playing it like a regular fallout game which wasn't working as that's not exactly possible, causing them to be disappointed. And also caused alot of backlash on release from customers and press all expecting a regular fallout game that you could play with friends. They didn't help themselves with the huge amount of bugs (now mostly fixed) and lack of content (now being fixed quite well) on release. Not to mention the nylon bag situation. But I'm glad they opened their ears entirely to the community and have been doing much better at creating the game that they wanted and players and Bethesda have both been better off due to all the updates coming out
---
No kidding, if Pickpocket was a thing in 76 my _whole gameplay loop_ would be reverse pickpocketing shit into player inventories while they were distracted :)
---
hell thats a pain, thanks for the assist tho
---
maybe lower the price to like 20,000 or 15,000
---
at 25k you would have to have exactly a full cap limit, this way there can be some wiggle room for people that want a "cap sink"
---
God Howard smiles upon thee lol
---
I had modded another Purveyor (ultracite gatling) and had no issues with that one thanks be to Murmrgh.  I run a heavy weapons build so that fun actually is more valuable to me than the other, but damn it stings to lose a good weapon like that.
---
um... blueprints?
---
Good link, and in contrast, script(s) reference a whole bunch of other concepts.
---
junk items weigh 20% less is a sweet drop, you should sell those
---
I wil!
---
Certainly it's the industry standard, but in recent years breakaway groups have been measuring specimens against the Kardashian scale, so I always check :)
---
Maaaan this looks amazing I want that
---
Depends on the item, I wouldn't sell my AAE shotty for anywhere near that price (though I'm not trying to sell it, so don't ask people :P )
---
Any decent bloodied weapon will start at 2K or higher.  I've sold most of the ones I've had for 4-5K (except the 1 star machete, I may have to drop that one a bit).
---
AAE is the new TSE, those seem to got quite high, relatively speaking.  Any explosive will get a decent pride, unless it has 'pipe' in the title.  I have a great explosive pipe gun, I might get 1500 for it, if that.
---
Now, my 3 star assaultron head (assuming it's still 3 stars today)...yeah I doubt I'll get 1000 for that, it will probably end up as scrip.  But it doesn't hurt to put it up and see.
---
Hahaha
---
Welcome to a slightly better version of cs:go tradeups
---
Ok, I can understand that.
---
For me at this point the hole look for the codes, desypher it, it's not a challenge anymore is more like work. Plus I can only play 2-3 hours when i can play, so when I do play have the chance to play I would rather spend it farming WS than doing all this craziness. So I Google it lol
---
Ty!
---
I'm a totally different build but I'd universally suggest PA users have power user.  Lowers the amount of cores you run through
---
Weight reduction armor is pretty good, man. And you could do a lot worse than mutants.
---
You rolled the dice three times and got a decent item. Pretty good odds.
---
There is not, but here's a write-up I did for all of the "Is it worth it" posts we get every day:  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/
---
Add me, PSN: yawnbringer
---
Got a little group that plays together. Would be happy to help. Will be on later tonight, EST.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/
---
YES wanted to post this myself eventually... Yes, "passive" is the right word I was looking for
---
I don't know about the event, but the flare gun as causing a server-wide notification would be an interesting option for people who are trying to find allies for campfire tales and/or home on the range.
---
I think it's definitely fair what they've done. I had 1000 scrips and only got 1 thing that I found useful, but I'm still happy about it. One day, I'll get that bolstering weapon weight reduction leather piece that I want.
---
I’ve been seeing these type of posts more frequently on here lately.  What type of legendary prefixes do you think they could add? Power Armor already has much much higher Mitigation than normal armor. The pipboy night state 500 DR, but that’s not the case.  You can test this yourself by getting a character with normal armor up to 500 DR and realize they are definitely squishier out of PA than in it.  So you couldn’t have vanguard/bolstering/unyielding/Sent/Cav and many others because it would be just too powerful.  I’m afraid if they do Legendary prefixes, it would be silly stuff like weightless armor pieces (PA already weighs next to nothing) or increase durability (currently almost never breaks either).  LMK what you think.
---
Keep expectations low. You only get a badge about 10% of the time. That said, it's a short and relatively painless event. It's really easy to trigger by server hopping at that location.
---
At school atm but later
---
Nah, you didn't mate. Two shot and anti armor are both primary effects and there's no +250 DR while aiming effect.
---
Sorry PC.
---
Yeah, I’ve been enlightened. Didn’t occur to me that you could have that many sets, I guess.🤷‍♀️
---
Vamps ultracite gatling laser with faster fire rate and a furious handmade with crit damage.
---
No complaints here.
---
"mom said it's my turn on the xbox"
---
Best comment so far
---
I think it has saved my bacon a couple of times in a WS nuke zone in the club house when getting mobed.  But your right it’s most useful in a bloodied build.
---
All of the items I’ve gotten have been pants with the exception of an instigating tesla rifle. Before the option to scrap them, I’d have just sold off the really awful legendary items to the vendor for a couple of caps so given the option to roll for something better feels like a fun solution.  
---
I absolutely accept that the chance to roll a decent legendary is still incredibly low but then rolling a decent legendary was never meant to be too easy lol.
---
but hey its got a night vision scope!
---
Do both scout dailies give possum badges? I thought the bug one in the mire gave possum but the cleanup one in the toxic valley gave tadpole badges?
---
Some of the PA mods that got left out of the game like Explosive Shielding could come back as Legendary Effects. Or, you know, as mods. Also I'd love if a vendor sold Untracite mods.
---
What does make something balanced then? Cos pretty sure my definition is spot on.
---
Yep.
---
I'd be fine if they just raised it temporarily, like for a bonus weekend or something.  I'm overloaded with heavy three-star legendaries, and I can only trade in a handful each day.
---
There is really nothing to equip for power armor while having a 2H melee. I run a 2H melee solo build and i have nothing equipped for power armor. You can get Fix it good , power smith etc the ones on the intelligence line. But that's only for like fixing the power armor , crafting mods etc. Unless you run a heavy weapons with power armor then stabilized would be a great addition since it adds ignore armor and heavy weapons weight less. But it all depends on your points. Power patcher makes the PA pieces break slowly but i never had an issue with my PA getting destroyed ever. Also power user for fusion cores to last longer , but they are easy to come by.
---
A great idea but practically don’t think this would work. 
---
As an example, I could shoot my flare because I need help killing a SB etc. Someone comes to me and stands next to me for 2 mins and doesn’t help at all, then in your idea because I haven’t paid them they can pvp me? 
---
For this to work it would need such complex programming, the person firing the flare would need to sort of create the event by indicating what they need help with. Then there would also need to be some sort of indicator to show the person has actually helped other than just being near you, %damage to target etc? I think a good idea but don’t think it would work in practice
---
Eventually I’ll do the same but I want first to fully taste the game and later the shortcuts lol
---
so....she's reciting poetry when she's grumbling?
---
I already explained 
---
1 survival is garbage

2 you can’t be a villain in survival cos its expected you kill people. Fallout should be be about player choice as it always has been
---
Yesssssssssssssssss... Thissssssssssssssss... :(
---
I think it was sarcasm
---
well i havent really touched the quest myself and i do enjoy a little grind here and there i didnt want to say youre wrong on that part the increase in scrip should definitely require some effort for those who want to have it i rather meant the opportunity shouldnt be wasted on combining it with a already existing questline make it its own that has relation to legendarys like "scrap 3 explosive weapons" "get hands on a legendary flamer" "kill a mirelurk queen with a nocturnal weapon between the hors of 8pm an 6 am" something among those lines so you have to earn the bigger scrip pool while also encourage trading keeping the trade market a bit fresh give otherwise useless weapons a use
---
I've just resigned myself to doing it solo, then if someone else shows up, it's a bonus.
---
Almost impossible to complete the event solo, when 2 of those horned bastards show up though.
---
Set up camp in Flatwoods during the beta, got to around level 20ish during beta. Once the game came out I played full time and started leaving bags of aid, guns, plans, etc on the hwy coming into town. Was cool seeing lvl 2-3 people stop and pick up the stuff I dropped for them. Back then they were new players, now the majority isn't new, just mules. I quit dropping bags because of that.
---
A sliver lining to every cloud, right? :D
---
The junk would be nice, but I seldom go looking for junk anymore.  My stores are pretty well built up.  But I'll probably sell these instead of shred them.
---
As for the wood, that already went back into the shredder.  Cost of doing business I guess?
---
Thanks so much! :)
---
Ok and its very easy to play your playstyle - pacifist mode never take a workshop. Job done. I can’t do anything too you. 
---
Is your freedom being inhibited? No.
---
Look at my list how are you against those changes?
---
I got one in hundreds of kills
---
I think this might be the way I go in the future.  I got a stack of mediocre three-stars, but then my single two-star purchase was an explosive, anti-armor combat rifle.
---
Fob up...oh, wait your on unofficial now...as you were civilian ;)
---
Uranium fever
---
It’s says 24 hours I think but I think it’s like 20. Same as regular vendors for me at least.
---
The fan is real, and operable but it's a finger chopper, not for use around kids or stupid people. Hard to find model with the silver button :) Hot plate works, but same thing, in the 50's you were expected to think for yourself. Typewriter is broken, needs a repair and I need to do that someday. Camera is real, I have never tried to see if it works actually. Caps are from Coca-cola glass bottles made in Mexico that you can still buy here and there (at least on the left coast). Fun to have this but my gf rolls her eyes lol.
---
Personally I am going for 2 star weapons. Way less scrip cost and a good 2 star is still really good. I think once I get my godroll 2 star, I will start saving up more scrip and start trying for a 3 star.
---
lol dupers
---
Oh I'm not complaining too much about the quality.  I needed a new chest piece, so this worked out well for me.  But the crash, glitches, and then three extremely similar items?  That's what makes me a bit disappointed.
---
I would have bought it for that!
---
Please no. Power armor is already the be all end all of this game. How bout a bone for those of us who never touch a piece of power armor?
---
You'd be fine because you're fighting/in combat. Once out of combat you can pay them for their help. But while in combat you or the helper, the helper can't open pvp till combats over and a time limit thats shown on the right side of the screen with the quests been reached.
---
Thats what I thought but like yesterday it went the whole day without refilling. It just refilled now at 9am today. Guess it was just bugged or the server was wonky. It literally just kicked me off mid horde event lol
---
What I mean when I say “Fallout game” is basically the main thing everyone thinks of when it comes to Fallout, and that is the immersive dialogue system that shapes the world.  Fo3 has this, which is why I would consider that game a Fallout game, even though the gameplay went from Isometric to 3rd person.  This game is definitely in the Fallout Universe, but shouldn’t be compared in the same aspects as Fallout games, since the major aspect of world building through decisions is completely missing, while other aspects like loot farming are accentuated.  This dialogue system is the main star of fallout games, and its absence is the cause of most of the reviewer ire from what I have seen.
---
I honestly think that when Fo5 comes out, we will see this dialogue system come back, because that is certainly what makes a Fallout game play like it does.  It’s what you expect from a Falliut game.  I don’t think Fallout 76 is the evolution of Fallout games, but is simply a step into another genre.  An established multiplayer genre that has had a history of success with legendary games like Diablo.  That’s why I say it “isn’t a Fallout game”.  It’s not really even in the same genre.
---
This poor dude tries to insult me via pm.
---
But Honestly, why you was  dropping valueable goods in a public area, do not do such Things, please. Bethesda can not help in this case (hopefully will not help).
---
I guess you never tried to mod wooden armor
---
Without going into a low-health build, these are your best bet;
---
Speed demon for the faster run and reload speed.
---
Eagle eye for the 25% crit bonus, and +4 PER
---
Bird bones is nice to pair with marsupial, to avoid fall damage from over jumping. The boost to AP is noce as well.
---
Ehrenmann haha
---
It’s mainly there for a laugh. You think someone would actually buy it to free up cap space?
---
"Describe Self-Descriptive Article Here."
---
you just won the internet
---
I would like it if the number of badges you have increases your chance of getting badges from campfire tales and the bug-hunt dailies, but I cannot see it adding to other unrelated factions and mechanics.
---
Stuff like this and the other glitch’s like the one where people could steal all your non-equipped items from your inventory when doing a trade need to be HOT FIXED or bring down the servers to fix these kinds of issues Asap!
---
If you're on PC I'll buy that marine piece from ya.
---
You can have as many that will fit in your camp budget.
---
The issue is that the 50% Damage Resistance while aiming destroys the damage gain from being Berserker
---
changed it, now it has the magnificent feature of pristine new "paragraphs" :D
---
Ps4, sorry! Wanting to sell it
---
You literally just identified which video game a piece of poop was sourced from. That's like the real life equivalent of being able to pick your best friend's dong out of a police lineup!
---
The laundry building is such a pain in the ass.
---

---
This game isn’t blade and soul. Legendaries are what keeps this game going. Removing them is taking a core part of the game out.
---
This is the last time i will repeat myself survival is trash. And there was ways consent in adventure. If you take a workshop you consent.
---
Look at the changes i have suggested are they not reasonable?
---
Well that took some traction
---
I'd say I got decent ish equipment.  And I needed a new chest piece, so no complaints here about that.  But the crash, glitches, and then three extremely similar pieces of armor?  That's one hell of a random pull.
---
Still not the worst possible weapon in the game
---
Batteries included is a must. I'd say put points in blocker too. It's not exclusively PA but it makes a huge difference when your getting smacked about.
---
Ok so name me all the problems it has besides the ones ive mentioned if you are so knowledable?
---
You can just trigger it. My camp is north of Harper's ferry, I trigger it accidentally Everytime I log on. I do think you should be able to track when events go live. You should be able to setup alerts.
---
i dies on one of these to but actually i kind of enyojed beeing raided it gives appalachia a more realistic vibe if every here and than someone lays a trap for you 
---
what pisses me of is people coming at you hitting you for literally minutes without getting bored yesterday i built my camp and was caught in the middle of some guys doing pvp at some point one of them started clawing me with his deathclaw gauntlet
---
i was in pacifist mode so i didnt care but after 7 minutes probably even 8 (yes i stopped time) i really started worrying about my followers mental state because he seemed to enjoy it at one point i changed out of pacifist mode blew his head off with my FE ultracite laser shotgun and had pretty much the most fun in a lot of time watching him and 3 of his friends standing all around me (after they killed me once i changed back to pacifist) and punching,hitting and shooting me for another 5 minutes straight while i heard them insulting me over voice chat and raging like shit
---
i absolutely laughed my ass off on how toxic and easy to enrage some people are :D
---
"Scrip" is now part of the "script," eh?
---
I put 4k in and best I got was an Inst/meh/meh Grog axe and a Gat plasma. All going back in the mangler (over the next week)
---
I'm pretty damn happy with the vendor tbh. I think 100 scrip for a guaranteed 3 star is pretty damn good considering you only need to spend an hour at whitesprungs to get enough 1 stars to get 150 scrip.
---
what happened was all the adult miners realized there was a catastrophic event coming, so they tried to secure all their children, they put them in a safe room with food and the adults mining uniforms.  As toxic gas was seeping into the area, the parents figured the best way to safeguard the childrens respiratory systems from the poison was to just temporarily put the kids into a miner suit so they  could breathe for that short bit of time the parent would have to leave them there.
---
The adults then left the children to deal with the catastrophe, but unfortunately the adults all died.
---
So, the children, now stuck in the miner suits, grew up IN those suits, and without further education, they started to create their own language.
---
hence, the mole miners all children that have grown up INSIDE the suits
---
creepy!
---
These numbers would come in handy if I already had the base numbers, but I don't have many explosive weapons to begin with.
---
My point was what happens if someone travels to me when I fire my flare, but just stands next to me and doesn’t help? Or if they shoot one enemy once? Where’s the line of me having to pay or not?
---
And I don't believe someone when they say the got an AAE handmade.  But since they do exist, it has to happen to someone now and again.
---
Does he get that every time?  Hell no.  CAN it happen?  Absolutely.
---
We need a side deck, badly. 
---
The perk interface is so cluttered. I'd rather have a side deck first just so I can keep the interface clean. 
---
As of now, I have to traverse through like three menus, scroll through 100's of cards I don't use to equip my lockpicking card. To be honest, I don't even bother anymore unless it's for a quest.
---
2* ranged is a safe bet. You could always get a godroll, but more than likely 2/3 of the 3* will be terrible. 2* is alot cheaper to buy, and you still have a chance at a fantastic roll
---
Wow! Thanks! That's really handy as it's where most of my stuff is! :D
---
This made my morning, haha, amazing!
---
I got a mutants explosive railway rifle with extra critical damage
---
Not in the least, RNG and tons of crap in the loot table will keep it that way.
---
Indeed, this is a disturbing universe.
---
The only thing I do not like is that I feel in a way limited by the 150 a day scrip and the 1000 overall limit. I know this probably for game balance but I still got a bunch of legendaries I did not scrap because of the 1000 limit. Perhaps double both values would be nice.
---
I would like some sort of a "sealed" mod for rad resistance. Blocks all radiation but slowly leaks as it degrades. Only for static radiation though, it wouldn't block rad damage from enemies like the glowies. For bloodied players that would be very helpful in nuke zones.
---
there ARE fish in the water, go swimming and see for yourself
---
i know for sure by deathclaw island there are fish in the river
---
4k in scrip?  You must have a number of accounts I take it.  I've never seen a Grognak's Axe yet in this game.  That's gotta be a neat get.
---
you're a special type of stupid, arent you?
---
I've wanted to know if long shot was worth it. I had the pistol build equivalent but didn't see the advantage. I think I have it as a spare card and I'm sitting on a spare perk point so I'll give it a go this weekend. thanks. 
---
I agree, I hope they allow us to add more points to specials in a future update.  I will have to get sniper as well now  and have a play around with that and tank killer. I've been wondering what to spend future points on.
---
I don't know about less but spawning without power armour in the midst of nuked Harpers Ferry following three "Please log off immediately.  This Server will be undergoing maintenance." alerts, was plenty of nuking for me.  :(
---
Some neat stuff. Only one meta item, though. 3* Bloodied pistol for a vats build.
---
rip
---
Press the buttons faster.
---
That was a rumor
---
Just steak-out the front door and just tell em what my dad used to tell me:
---
"You born on a barn!?"
---
"You heating the street!?"
---
"Hey farm-boy, close the door"
---
needless to say, I left the front door open a lot as a kid.
---
ugh super slow walk, at 1600 pounds
---
Omg, this killed me.
---
3 star instigating lever action was the best I got. Other ones I just returned for scrip.
---
I mean getting the materials...
---
Oh, a quad, ffr, 90% rw 10mm. Pistol that I carry around just to plink things for funsies. :D
---
The little jar? Craft it at either a tinkerer’s or chemistry station
---
I got crap.  Still love her tho. Great addition.
---
Still a 3*, just saying...
---
Loot shit? Lol idk, is there a specific material?
---
Shame, well as a tip if yu need lead, go to the lucky hole mine in excavator armour and mine all the ore, you need a lot of acid too but ive gotten 1400 lead from 1 run of there with super duper on too
---
Tag the required materials and only pick up that stuff.
---
🎶 sometimes i feeel like...somebody's watching meeeeeee! 🎶
---
Alll hail the cat all hail the cat were do I join this religion
---
I wish I could upvote this twice...
---
Let me get da poo
---
Yeah,chest and Left leg. Can't really afford an Unyielding cav piece just for int.  Lol unless you're on PS4 and selling it cheap 🤣
---
would be nice if we had to start a new character, otherwise some ppl would be too powerful
---
I thought that it did, ive started it off a few times and people show up from all over, but one time nobody came... I had a good time with the sheepsquash though.
---
A fake 3 star assaultron head....
---
Just play the game
---
I dont kill people in survival, I try to survive cause I play how I want.
---
Attacked by Vengeful Mothman as I approached the new Berkeley Springs Train Station this morning.  Scared the crap out of me but did yield a piece of Torn Mothman Wing.   Too busy shooting to take selfies . . .
---
In Str you want incisor , martial artist and all slugger, in endurance you want Revenant , in Charisma Tenderizer, in Inteligence Nerd Rage , in agility Adrenaline and ninja , in Luck Bloody Mess and mysterious savior (to proc Revenant)
---
Sooo, swing speed or no swing speed for buzzy?
---
I think there will be a lot less 1* and2* legendaries in vending, since people will trade for scrip. I expect alot more 3* though. Only people it will really effect are low levels, who won't have an easy time finding gear for sale
---
Start a new character unfortunately
---
*Alligator snapping turtles.* 
---
70+ pounds, size of a manhole cover, double the bite size. They're already a thing.
---
Good4U
---
I got the caps, won't be on till later. GT is a7xogg
---
Two star robot chest piece auto stim. 20% venom resistance. 30 DR. 
---
Turned it in for scrip.
---
It’s also ok if you take their junk. 
---
Also, level 50 is just as effective as level 150 if you plan your build properly.
---
partially sust it out last night. yes I get the notification, but thats it. checked my daily quest.....aaaahhhh.
---
thats my mistake. cource, now someone drops a nuke, its 00:30 and I have work in the morning...........There's a distant thunder,thats only going to take 20min, right?.....................wrong
---
however I am now more informed. thanks for replying.
---
I can't recall doing order 099 from defiance to university ,so might just go back a bit. might make thing more clear. the scorched detection system is also unclear, what was the purpose of all that, if Its a dead end . might be missing something there as well.   . more googling/reddit.
---
Swing speed, this guys chattin shit ^ 😂
---
Wait, is the achievemt based on the character not the challenge?
---
“Get you a man who can do both”
---
In case anyone missed it, check out the recently posted Mappalachia project
---
Ok well good for you my argument still stands, most people will shoot you on sight
---
Buzzzzzz blades!!!! \*Whirrrrr!\* 😂
---
Claim workshops that contain the steel, aluminum, and other metals need. Through down a mineral extractor.
---
Oh my god that would be awesome but so horrible at the same time
---
Maybe something like this will happen with Nuclear Winter. I dont play pvp much, but I'd be down to try it if it's like this! I like the idea.
---
This is a new problem for me too. But it's every door.
---
Great english.
---
Plus, all the rednecks are in power armour and the giant ticks aren't nearly creepy as real life.
---
welcome to, another episode of incompetent game system design!
---
Good point.
---
To elaborate on this person post, it doss need a full charge to deal the listed damage if you fire at the target directly.
---
However, there currently exists a bug where the rebound does full damage (as if full charge). So if you shoot at an area near the target without charging (single click) it will deal full dmg.
---
That counts as one rebound though, and as such can only chain to one additional target.
---
Yeah but its just a game man they worked for their stuff its not that hard to get most things
---
Do u need plans?
---
In case anyone missed it, check out the recently posted Mappalachia Project.  VERY extensive set of datamined map locations.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/
---
My bet would be (depending on the event) players would help for free anyhow. Maybe just pops up as a misc quest for the duration of the event?
---
Yes !!! It has ... but it reduces the damage as well or is just a visual bug ? I didnt played yesterday to test it

I think you just need to start the scout quest
---
These days I’d rather be a civilian and live on our peaceful mountaintop than deal with pillar city and the dreaded mesh wars. Keep fighting the good fight soldier o7
---
Something you can circumvent by pressing two buttons is not something the devs should concern themselves with right now.
---
Great write-up!
---
Tancs. i preti gud at englis.
---
I know ase for a standard harpoon is 175. Not sure on fletchettes though. 
---
I can work on getting you the other information too. I can craft a handful of these so I’ll see what their normal damage values are. Want max level or all levels?
---
It is just a game. They can get it again! And anyone can claim any bounty and take or leave that bag. If I go to the trouble of running down someone and claiming their bounty, a paltry 5 caps isn’t going to suffice.
---
Nothing amazing yet, but it's nice to be able to choose ranged weapons. My dropped loot has largely been armour and melee so far.
---
Not all of them. Back when blowing camps was still possible, I had some buddies who would go around doing it. Even they think this situation is messed up. It's like someone else said a few comments above. "We raid with honor god damn it!"
---
Why did you wink... what are you doing to those fish when you catch them? Oh god please don’t
---
I've never figured out the proper timing.  I suspect there's probably some lag involved.  It's like when you're doing One Violent Night and the Ghouls lunge toward the jukebox - you can stab when they are halfway across the barn and you'll kill them.  The timing has to be something weird like that - long before I think I need to block is when I need to block.
---
Achievements are account-based. I discovered some locations during Beta that didn't count. Second character did the trick.
---
Maybe not the worst but still a pretty messed up roll with the two canceling each other out. That's exactly why I find it so disappointing on a 3 star...
---
If anything it has created a market for completely useless 1* legendaries.  I put a bunch of 1* items on my vendor for 50 caps and they were gone in less than an hour and I got more for them than the vendors would have paid.
---
Yeah I've only ever found level 91 ones in that spot and im not over 180 to tame them so was curious.
---
I hang out on the discord server for InnovSurvivalist on youtube to find other players to complete the challenges. But yeah, these challenges can be really annoying.
---
I'm going 2 star for ranged. None of the tertiary stats are worth 50 scrip to me.
---
Oh dang, dekotora camp!
---
Finally a useful comment. Thanks !
---
Is anyone looking into the fact that MIRV frags and Nuka Cola Quantum grenades still don't work?
---
Thanks! Well if anyone on xbox wants it I'm happy to sell.
---
Yeah it's weird melee's won't register sometimes
---
Even if you *are* the oldest tadpole I’ve ever seen.
---
Is that like a personal attack or something????????????????
---
Yeah, I find certain environment objects cause problems. For example, I was trying to snap a wall to a piece of foundation, and despite being green on my end - it was claiming the item was intersecting with an existing object. I wanted to build a small shack to house my Fusion Generator, it was backing a large tree. Perhaps I was too close to the tree because moving the foundation an inch worked. 
---
Regardless, if it's green on my end, it should work. I like building bases, but once it becomes cumbersome due to the fact that I can't place stuff - kind of defeats the purpose.
---
This is not true. I got level 35 and level 40 gear mostly on my level 42 mule last night.
---
I’m not going to buy them, but if I randomly get them, well, shame not to use them
---
What system are you on?
---
Little proofread, much type
---
Holy fuck.
---
I gotta scrap my camp and start over.
---
I mean, I agree except in the case of bounty hunting. As far as I'm concerned, if you're wanted, you're fair game. Even in adventure.
---
The title alone is good. Would actually promote playing together with people who actually want to play together.
---
No need for payments to get involved.
---
Part of the problem too is that you can't always see all the legendary effects unless the owner is at their base.  I have seen a number of 2 or 3 star items I thought about getting but since I couldnt tell what the other effects were I wasn't willing to pay thousands of caps for them.  Hopefully this gets fixed soon because I think it will help both buyers and sellers a lot.
---
If it is the be all end all then why don’t you use it? More and more of the highest levels use sentinel gear. No legendary perks, no backpacks, use fusion cores, and PA is slower. If it’s the be all end all why not use it?
---
Theres a glitch going around where if you go to the edge of the nuke zone just before you start taking rads,place your power armor so that it's in the nuke zone but you're outside the nuke zone and then just enter your armor and you wont be taking rads. So I'd say pick your power armor that has the most carry weight
---
I mean yeah but its just a dick move to take their stuff when they most likely got the bounty from an accident
---
Nothing good, let's put it that way. 😂
---
I've been doing 2\* Melee weapons.  I got a rather diverse haul, but as I feared, there are *so many joke weapons* in the melee pool that you have an incredibly small chance of getting something useful.
---
The one in the mire gets a lot tougher when you encounter the random spawn events on the way to the farm. We actually had 2 deathclaws spawn on one run. And a sheepsquatch before the boss battle.
---
ok how many do you have, i can give some .308 away
---
Beth should have sold us "rescue flares" instead of repair kits.  I would love a way to call helpers when I get a Fucking insane spawn of 7 lvl 60 SB while alone looking for bloatfly.
---
Here's a page that shows all the possibilities. If your ideal weapon or armor doesn't depend on anything in that third minor modifier, go for 2 star. [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
Had my X-01 on.  Rad damage before and after three RAD-X exactly the same.   Just keep the RADAWAY handy, eh?
---
Fastest way I read was doing the main story line, I've just got level 15 but I spent a lot of time scavenging to finish my C.a.m.p and ammo etc. Pick up everything u find and scrap it! All so u will need a lot of wood for cooking food, boiling water and building! Best explore into the woods and find wood from fallen trees. U have a lot of work ahead of you! Enjoy the game my friend :)
---
 I never take tank killer out. not ever. That and piercing rounds make a huge difference
---
add long shot. beast out at sunrise field, me , top of wotogw high school
---
308 sniper ,no muts, no b/mess, no legendary. beast down in 5 clips of 5.
---
308 was at l50 / 138 damage. hit rate with 1 in sniper 90%
---
works for me. No good to man nor beast against a goul 10 ft away, so I swap them out as req. But if you've got the cards.....
---
cheers.
---
Thanks man, A few hundred, if you need other ammo I could always trade for more?
---
I have a QE with Vats , problem solved
---
I like the idea of just sending out a serverwide call for help. I think plenty of players would go without the need for player to player rewards, just make it an event that’s free to travel too for “X” number of minutes.
---
They could have reduced weights on different things, faster reloads, better stability, slower fusion core use age. These are just a few examples of how PA can have things to strive for without being OP in combat.
---
I think lockpicking shouldn't be a perk at all but instead be a passive skill that levels from using it, open 25 level 0 locks you learn to open level 1 locks, open 50 level 1 locks you learn level 2 locks and after  opening 75 level 2 locks you learn level 3 locks. It would free up perk points and is a long term game so it would be easily doable. Hacking could be the same way but lower numbers as there are less terminals in the game I think so say 10 terminals to unlock level 1, 20 to unlock level 2 and 30 to unlock level 3.
---
Where do I find this $18 Fallout?
---
I did a Google search and only saw digital versions being sold for $30-$50+

Agreed! I wasn't thinking yesterday and unloaded all my alts onto my primary thinking I could just scrip and redeem them all. Imagine how stupid I felt when I went to scrip that 4th three-star weapon and got the message. Couldn't believe I forgot about the limit. Guess I'm walking everywhere overencumbered for the next 3 days.
---
lucky. i got ten regenerating leather pieces and a shishkebab
---
I harvested 4 strangler blooms just now, and with that Double Plants perk on I ended up with 8 Strangler Blooms and 6 Swamp Plants.
---
I've no clue what to do with the Swamp Plants, I just made a stack of Radshields with the Blooms.
---
This - I initially got an instigating vats accuracy assaultron head. After logging in this morning it’s no longer instigating...
---
Most people don’t know where people are spawning, so this may be a bad idea. As you can spawn inside.
---
hmm .. worth persuing. every days a school day.
---
Just lost a star off an Assaultron head. I guess the lesson is make sure you leave at least 40 scrip in the exchange machine so that you can quickly offload any bugged items you roll.
---
And while I"m at it, I hate everyone who's getting good items off the purveyor. I've only gotten junk so far. Pipe revolver w/ weight reduction... thaaaaaaanks.
---
100% agree.
---
so perks and drugs work with her?
---
Quad explosive light weight double barrel. It’s almost automatic. Its more powerful than a combat tse shotgun.
---
How about making legendary enemies drop scrip instead of the legendary itself? I know I'm already super overencumbered after an SBQ fight and it would be awesome to get weightless scrip instead.
---
I was gonna say the same thing
---
Wow you jinxed us now, next update going to revert us back to November when mysteriously everything gets unpatched and we will know who to blame. Enough of joking around and yea totally agree with you the whole camp system needs fixing, also one of the best ways to fix item is intersecting/floating is to exit out of build mode then reenter, just a disclaimer doesn't always work and recent update made it so you cant place a floor above start of stairs like you could be before and gives I believe that message.
---
Personally I think the perk card system need to be improved. Makes no sense that I have to stop and open up my pip-boy and switch cards to open a lock box or etc. same thing with the card hard bargain, travel agent and a few others I feel like would work good as a passive card perk. Just my opinion...
---
It's completely ridiculous but still looks so much better than the giant empty boxes most people build.
---
"if I don't like a game I cheat at it"
---
Upvoted for visibility
---
Thank you :) I started the day with 10k caps when I found him I had to grind soo hard to get the 15! Sold all my three star legendaries in my machine for like half off lol
---
Like im not against it but it could easily be op it depends on the legendary effects
---
I think 3 explosives, a couple bloodied items that aren't probably worth using.  Lots of mediocre to crap stuff.
---
11 weapons, I think there's 2 that I'll try to use.  A few more I can probably sell for a bit.  Nothing life changing (even though my luck has been crap up to this point).
---
I *wanted* an upgrade to my instigating 1-star sniper, or a queen-quality .50 cal heavy (or something similar), but I didn't get anything approaching that.
---
I got a couple decent handmades and level actions that I may be able to work with, but my game life hasn't been changed much.  But I'll save up scrip until I get 1000 again and give it another go, it is certainly fun.
---
TS Fatman and TSE smg
---
Last time I did Uranium fever no legendaries spawned :(
---
Try blowing in your hands. Maybe they're too cold and the Brahmin don't like that.
---
Well... you get shit like everyone else... congrats... 🎉🎊
---
Since day 1 I really hated that, crazier yet is how all enemies can pass those lazer grids that block us, for example ones in Whitesprings garage mole rats go right through and ones in Fort Defiance ghouls literally chase me to top floor lol.
---
Holy crap.
---
Yeah, and now imagine the two headed, mutated version of that. You could probably build a settlement on it.
---
How much? I'd sell it
---
I agree with this a million percent and would like to add: ACTIVATE THE GD PYLONS!!!  Stop shooting an immune SS and sacrifice a lil so we all can take him down.
---
Did you notice the hole in the floor? There's a ramp and junk down there. Seem she either came up into the station from an underground mine or she lives down there when the shop is 'closed'. Pretty neat detail. The worldbuilders at Bethesda really earn their pay. There is so much detail. Nothing feels thrown together in that regards.
---
Funny, I'm up to almost a dozen and that's one of the 3 I gather 🤷‍♂️ In aid, no condition and never spoils....
---
Being only level 31. I don't need anything crazy nor do I have the amount of Legendary items to scrap to roll 3* so 2* is what I'll be doing for a while. Got a decent Furious Walking Cane last night.
---
Can we add this to the campfire tales event? Pick up some goddamn kindling! No not the wet ones the dry ones! 😭😭😭😭😭Great there's 100 more bugs now.
---
I'm pleased as punch with my explosive troubleshooter's double barrel from the SBQ last night. Will make those nuke runs a breeze!
---
Can't you just log out in the middle?
---
It's the first online Fallout, so it's not Rust/Fortnite either. Also legendary effects are in two games out of six, so you can't say they are core to the fallout lore. Also taking them out evens the odds.
---
And for the last time I have to repeat myself. When you take workshop you give PvP consent for the premise of the said shop, not the whole map, where you are visible.
---
I can agree for bankruptcy change, as well as making the camp destructible when the player is not Pacifist. Also this should not be defaulted to off.
---
Fallout is built on player choice as you said and the majority of people in adventure want to not deal with griefers. So why do you whine and moan for their choice versus yours?
---
Someone needs to make a subreddit for this, I don't think anything related to this whole situation si goign to get any traction here.
---
Currently have a foundation in the dirt I can’t remove because it’s part of a structure (it’s not; it’s literally a foundation on the ground).  I just returned to this game a few days ago and it seems like it’s running worse than it was a few months ago. Ah well. Back to the backlog.
---
As long as you're in combat that person who isn't a responder can't activate pvp. When you both are out of combat is when the timer starts for the idle check (if the person who requested help goes afk in order not to pay) then can activate pvp only after the timer has ran out. Now if you both are just sitting around sure the timer will expire and the helper can initiate pvp to get their reward. If you're asking for a afk timer for the helper (could have missed that when writing it) that's absolutely needed.
---
It's up to the player who needs help whether or not they pay the helper who isn't a responder, but in the end the helper can get a reward if the player doesn't pay.
---
If you're asking for help you should pay or be attacked by a person who wanted to help you for the caps. Instead they get to "take them" off of your. Old dead corpse. 
---
I'm not sure what else to say if I missed what you are saying.
---
Yeah. I've found radaway is so easy to come by I don't even bother with rad-x. No PA is particularly brilliant at keeping the rads at bay.
---
I want to fishing please please.
---
Too confusing overall. I like the flare gun starting an event, but just have the event pay out some junk or something equivalent to time/damage/revives performed.
---
Never sell that black diamond it's awesome! Are you on PS4? I'd make you some heavy armor.
---
I know, I know, I'm an ungrateful piece of human trash :'(
---
When I see floors/roof not lining up:
---
https://youtu.be/T2DTsS7cmMw
---
That's a good roll. God roll would have reduced weight as well I reckon.
---
Some of you have expressed interest in this. I'm accepting offers...
---
My role is the Bloodied who goes up and whacks her in the face, so I'm relying on others to handle the crippling part, but that doesn't mean I don't want to understand how it works.
---
Obviously, the trick is to keep her wings crippled, but I would agree that in practice, I've never managed to do it reliably, even with Enforcer and a Quad Combat Shotgun.  I have to shoot in the general area of where that joint is, because I don't have enough AP for Concentrated Fire to see it reliably, and I feel I make virtually no impact.  But then, neither is anyone else.  I don't see the HP on her wings magically go to zero because someone fired a Gauss Rifle, which I would expect from the crippling perks.  Everyone is just plinking away at her.
---
And when she does come down, sometimes I'll take a peek with Concentrated Fire and see that her wings apparently aren't crippled, or she has a sliver of HP on each one.  So, the feedback is really poor.  I'd imagine once she's grounded, it's a lot easier to keep her grounded, but clipping her wings in the first place feels like a crapshoot.  Clearly, some players have it figured out, but I'm not one of them.
---
Berserkers it’s such a whack prefix.
---
Good for low level players tough
---
One account.  
---
4 characters above L50 (plus a mule who's overencumbered but I just can't bear to delete everything)  
---
Been farming/saving for a while heh
---
The mistress of mystery questline gets you a cool sword too
---
If they let us fish I demand to catch the mutlieyed fish from simpsons or I will rage quit this game! But yea would like fishing and maybe a dlc later where we can finally meet the ghoul whale from Fallout 4.
---
RP as a grave digger.
---
Some say paranoid, I say prepared.
---
Who runs SBQ for legendaries? Dude I get 3 in 20 minutes at whitesprings.  I do SBQ for the flux and the plans.  If your'e doing SBQ for the 3 stars you're doing it wrong.
---
When I first boot the game up, this always happens.
---
I always log-out at my C.A.M.P. so I usually just alt+tab out for a second and then tab back in. I have my ingame sounds going so if in the odd event an enemy spawns, I'll tab back and kill it. 
---
After the initial load-in, this doesn't occur again (until I close the game completely).
---
I got a usable 2* item on my Level 32 character last night.
---
My own "dead" loot after spending 45 minutes real time looking for it.
---
You must not understand the complete devastation you can unleash with VATS crits.
---
Untrue I got level 35 from it I’m level 217
---
Are you subbed to r/mildlyinfuriating?
---
heck yeah i do!  the most ive made form a "joke" item is 10000 caps...so.... dare to dream!
---
you just have to be in the right spot at the right time and find the right customer
---
If you get an unsolicited invite from me, its probably because I'm trying to fast travel to what ever location you are at and pressed a to fast. Or I was trying to creep your profile. If I want help I'll send a message or if we meet up at an event then ask.
---
Try filthy casuals
---
Best comment ever

#EATT
---
It wasn't meant for traction, I was holding off on buying rage 2 because of a post already on this sub so I wanted to clarify. Idc about the bans or any of that. I cared about not being able to play other games.
---
TBH I don't care. Claiming a bounty means claiming your bag. If you got that bounty by accident, stop what you're doing, get to a stash.
---
I got 2 things
---
One was a 3* Quad Tesla Rifle with 15% faster reload and +33% VATS accuracy. Not bad at all.
---
The other was a 3* Mutant's Radium Rifle with +25% faster fire rate and +250 damage resist while reloading. I dunno how to feel about this one considering I use my 3* Furious Pipe Revolver and Sole Survivor more, and they both use the same ammo as the Radium Rifle
---
I'll give you 20k caps for it
---
I get random attempts to add me as a friend and team up and I always ignore them.
---
Discover Grafton dam I’ve done this over 10 times with different characters always broken
---
It is the only place I have heard of it dropping.  Perhaps the new dungeon will drop it too?
---
Yeah, it wasn't a huge deal. Just kind of a nuisance to backtrack.
---
But it was late at night irl, my room was dim, the game had been very quiet and was night - running face-first into a mothman legit scared the crap out of me, haha.
---
all right ,what did you do , how did you manage to kill mamma, out with it, what did you do ?
---
actually - I lost her from the mutfruit nursery, 2 settlers from one of the farms and rosie. yes I lost rosie, Eventual found her in the hostpital with the mutants......... dead. ON 'MY' WATCH.!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
gutted, honestly , gutted.
---
Ok thanx !
---
Right? I live in an actual camp with tents and shit but i have lights and decon shower and people NEVER turn them off. Some even open my nuka-cola vending machine. The hell do they expect to happen when they open that lid? 0\_o
---
Add the fletchet mod and you have yourself one big nasty explosive shotgun
---
can't wait to see what they do around the holidays
---
I really like the idea of it at least sending a notification. I've used it a couple times now with no response. Found the tourist with camera and fired one off to hopefully pull people in (also sent Xbox messages to everyone on the server, sadly only got a couple responses). The second time was a couple days ago in the Mire. There was a req drop with some really nice stuff, but nothing I needed, and there were a ton of players in the area doing the bug collecting quest. Fired a flare and shot off a few rounds with my handmade, hoping to draw someone's attention. Nothing :T
---
I like to think that I should indicate what moves I appreciate with my actions. I appreciated two of recent patches, survival introduction and the following adjustments, hence I paid for atoms on these two occasions. I didn't like AS repair kits, so I never once used even the improved ones.
---
Do you smell burnt toast?
---
The daily scout leader quest to hunt bugs in the mire spawns about 3 legendary creatures too.
---
Good nobody plays this crap to fight another player I know I don’t.
---
Nor to see what I get from legendary rolls , I’m just here for a good time not a long time
---
I mean I guess dude do whatever you want to
---
Kinda hoping you mean the band
---
Yes but so was having someone meta hunt you down after having a freind take over a workshop and scours the overworld map to find you. That doesn't sound like a raider that sounds like someone wants to just grief someone beyond the intentions of the game.
---
Nah they don’t. I go inside with high hopes and 38 luck. Still get wood armor and hunter’s black powder rifle
---
Short Nightvision Scope... I have so many questions...
---
Yeah, but 90% of the guns value is in the first 2 effects. Weapon weight is just a cherry on top. Most heavy weapon characters already have weight reduction perks.
---
Seconded
---
Can I ask how the hell they placed the Bobbles, is that enabled yet in CAMP?
---
Hmmmm I’m not sure about that, I had a friend that this happen to on the Xbox but ok...
---
is there any guaranteed spawn locations for it?
---
Lol came here to comment this
---
If they can’t inspect your items then you merely need to go to your camp.
---
I would like to see her options tweaked a little bit.  I would like to choose a sub category of weapon or armor from her when I pick what I'm buying i.e. I would like to say I want a rifle to have a better chance of getting something useful.
---
True and untrue .
---
I got 2 assaultron heads , 2 medics weapons and all of this within 600 script I got garbage rolled 6 times
---
im kinda shocked the auto mod didnt delete this post, i swear they have word filters that block each time i try to even post "a n o t h e r  s e t t l e m e n t" it gets blocked
---
Not sure.
---
Very close to release I saw a video of someone doing that haha :)
---
oh oh oh. I think I know what this is about. There's this thing in japan where they deck out trucks with so many lights that it puts the most neurotic christmas fanatic's home to shame.
---
*I just don't know what it's called...*
---
Yep, a settlement that slowly moves around the map. That's brilliant.
---
Yeah I hear ya. That is why accurate communication is so important.
---
got a level 45 golf club but the club might have a cap because everything else was 50
---
Not necessarily, if you fast travel to a “shop” and the person has manipulated the spawn point you can spawn in the trap the moment you load in. Granted you can always stimpack and fast travel/quit, most people panic and try to find away out, thus dying and having loot taken.
---
Yeah the reentering build mode used to work for me. Now it's just constant messages. I cant even get into a decent build without getting messages for literally trying to connect two floor pieces or a wall to the floor. You know, the things they're supposed to connect to.
---
Executioner's explosive SMG and an instigating explosive hunting rifle. Rest was script scrap.
---
U/valseek
---
I got this happening to me ,twice with two asultron heads, we get script back ?
---
Plus can’t scrap since “vendor” is out of script
---
Holy shit I want to be friends with this guy!!!
---
If they are that powerful they have that much too loose. I know I wouldn't play on my best toons.
---
Oh yeah, I forgot about exterminator perk and weapons! Thanks!
---
Yes, the vast majority of them are small corner stores. It absolutely is not Walmart. The largest one that we have seen (in fallout 3) still is barely the size of an average grocery store.
---
whats the deal with orb strikes can it hurt the player or their camp outside pvp?
---
Wearing full Possum lol
---
Love this idea but afraid Bethesda might not have the horsepower to change cap/scrip amounts every hour. But this would defintely make it so I keep playing on weekends.
---
Surely the orbital strikes would do literally nothing now that camps are indestructible to players and they killed you outside of combat?
---
I'm usually patient and wait.  If I get bored, I smack my teammate with my camera.  Camera fights are too much fun.
---
Turtle Town!
---
I will say that, for ranged weapons, it works pretty well. I've bought 12 (I think?) 3* ranged weapons and at least 4 of them are very, very good/ borderline god roll.
---
-Furious +10% dmg +15 reload handmade
---
-Bloodied +10% dmg +movement speed auto grenade launcher
---
-Instigating missile launcher (can't remember 2 and 3 modifiers)
---
-TSE + vats (I think?) double barrel shotgun (would have been absolutely god roll pre-patch, still fun to use)
---
There were a couple "bad" drops that I got from her, but most everything was at least decently usable end-game.
---
The real problem is that there are a LOT of GARBAGE melee and armor variants in this game, and until that's corrected, I'm not wasting a single scrip on either one of those categories. It's too high risk, and most of the disappointment posts I see related to the Purveyor are from people who invested into one or both of those categories. Guns are pretty well balanced in this game, but melee and armor is kind of a hot mess.
---
I've seen your CAMP and let me tell you right now that's a settlement that could use a LOT of help.
---
Even miles need stuff, in fact that's pretty much all they have...
---
You are doing a public service.
---
Building has definitely reverted. It really brings back memories of how infuriating trying to build used to be. I cant even get passed the shell of a camp without constant errors. I've essentially given up and have barely played because I cant even get a decent camp set up.
---
What do you think the best combos are for each group?
---
I remember asking about/suggesting this kind of implementation a few months ago. Glad to see I'm not the only one who wants it! Giving an actual use for the flare gun would be wonderful, I'm honestly a little surprised it hasn't happened yet. Seems like the perfect opportunity to get players to interact more frequently.
---
I put on the happy go lucky and drank some brew and got 3 good rolls dod it again when they refreshed and got another explosive weapon i but idk
---
Damn autocorrect ruining my jake
---
I’m in the tier of killing 111000 of each I stopped trying
---
I wish the script exchange was a weekly cap instead of a daily one.
---
Sounds about white
---
that came to mind. but since im not sure how they do it i decided to leave it out of the post.
---
Watoga is a no man's land.  Literally.
---
Shit, I cant even connect a wall to the floor half the time. I guess walls and floors cant touch.
---
I have like 5 of them. One is bloodied, that's my favorite. And I have an instigating. All one star though.
---
That is weak teaming to have pvp and build access. They don't even need a friend to do it, they can build a flamer right next to your decontam shower and blow it up then make a run for the generator. It's not a good idea any way you play it. Junk is one thing, but flux is another, and maybe crystals- been running low on those since the camera!
---
To me vats just means you have little to no shooting skills. As an avid real life shooter I consider it's usage lame. I see those who cannot hit the target voted me down.
---
I got a 3 star executioners axe and I couldn't be happier, pretty much anything goes past half health it dies now.
---
&gt; I am an Eagle scout and the new Pioneer scout quest line is awesome for me, just like old times except I didnt need to kill 50 robots with a flamer for a badge lol!
---
Did you get the "launch a nuke" badge during your time in the scouts.
---
I would tell you about the fun we had in the [Woodcraft Folk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Woodcraft_Folk), but if I did the party would make me kill you.
---
1 - pacify and tame are separate. Theres a separate button press for tame that will appear on screen
---
2. You don't need both, but when hunting best to have them both equipped to save messing about, as they tame different types
---
3. Similar to 1, taming will give you a 'send back to camp' message to show if its a success, and yes one only.
---
4. Soon as its tamed, take them off
---
5. I think it disappears and respawns next time you log in. Personally I just went about my business for a few hours waiting for it and checking each time I went to my camp
---
6. It will leg it to the camp ASAP
---
I think the main issue is that your pacifying and not taming the creature. You need to do this in random encounter spots only and only if there is one creature there. There is a random map location around for you to do this.
---
Believe me, ive posted on many posts about this looking for my pet that's ended up being a cuddly pink bear :)
---
I got that harpoon gun too! I was all "This would be amazing if I needed caps or used heavy weapons!"
---
...and back in the grinder it went.
---
This needs a flaming bag mod so it can be dropped on doorsteps!  I love it!
---
Ah thats one way to try, I'll look into the perks
---
I've been having issues with my mic or else I'd be having a much better time. Discord picks it up, but no other games do
---
Usually Harper's Ferry tradebot.
---
No because you do have a limit of the end of the day of a 1000 and given you swap weapons in a certain way to achieve 150 you need to be exact , you don’t use it you loose it ,it’s stupid it’s like one of those mobile games that you need to wait for time to do stuff , I already paid for this game let me do as much as I can and possibly want given my playing style
---
When you're building from scratch, sure.  It's when you're renovating that it becomes annoying.
---
Nothing against one stars.  Better than no stars!
---
Up vote only for title. No added pvp or cap payment. Would be happy to help just help sake, no payment needed.
---
I managed to do it with two of them, so it can't be that hard. 😋
---
It's a pretty fun quest to do solo, like your own personal Fasnacht parade.  Only when the enemies actually show up, though.  You're supposed to have a hoard of Wolves and Bloodbugs, but in practice, sometimes you get just one of each, and that's kind of lame.
---
&gt; I also created the method to turn 1* legendary mobs into 3* legendary mobs.
---
Go on...
---
Weren't we supposed to be able to trade them with other players?
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
It’s definitely needed in order to balance the game better. I’ve always been in PA, just lately decided to give normal armors a try, since I farmed a bunch of good pieces and they just sit there for memories. So I put together a full set of sentinel armor, modded them with deep pockets, and put on under armor, lo and behold I now carry as much as x01 with dual shocks. Even better, some armor pieces reduced all weapon weight and food and aid items, so I can literally carry more. Don’t even have the new backpack yet. 
---
Then I went to West Tek to give it a try, most of super mutant’s bullets just wont register when I stood there like an idiot. I don’t do pvp but I can easily tell why nobody uses PA when you have magic armor like this in the game, and on top of that you get -8% damage from players, per piece, from the most duped sent-ass armors. It’s simply absurd, tbh, to stand there to be unkillable, in a shooting game. This definitely needs more balancing in order to give the game some sense of realism. I haven’t tried the cavalier but since it requires you to sprint, it doesn’t need any nerf at all. 
---
This makes power armor only useful for SBQ fights, but only when the nuke is dropped too far north. If a seasoned player barely covers glassed cavern you can fight her outside the nuke zone, no PA even needed.
---
For the love of PA please give them either some performance enhancements or legendary effects. I like what you’ve been doing with the paint schemes, such as the latest horsemen series, can’t wait to get them if you could make PA somewhat comparable to magic armors.
---
In 100+ queen kills across 3 characters I've never had a single 3\* drop. I've had one 2\* that was worth keeping (it's fantastic actually). I only go now for the Improved Repair Kits as I have almost all the ultracite plans.
---
STARCHED GENES
---
PC has always been able to do this.  They can also camp in places consoles cannot like towns where all the detail would melt your gpu.
---
It could be an accident, but only to a certain degree. A level 50 should know what does and doesn’t give them a bounty. You don’t get a bounty for being good. You got a bounty and above 50, the caps and junk are free game. Low levels I pass on though, they can get the supply crate quest though and learn the hard way.
---
Thanks ill start server hopping
---
Just a heads up for green footlockers in general, not static
---
I've stopped doing it for this reason. HUUUUUGE Waste of time and resources these days.
---
Mine is always on for those who wants to get rid of rads,its up in the skye tho,so nobody have problems
---
I was about to type that lol.
---
No nuke launching but lots of pyromania
---
I got an ass one seeing me dying and stealing my back and server hoping , what a shame given it’s easy to pick up anything in this game.
---
I block his ass with the wish to never bump in to such scum again
---
You obviously have never crouched behind a giant pig, arm outstretched in anticipation, as a fountain of shit washes over you so that you can make enough fertilizer for all your plants.
---
is there confirmation luck stat boots chance of good legendary? Seems VERY unlikly as there's no way a dev can tell the game "two shot is better than vamperic" I mean they could but that's not really the case.
---
I fully support this idea, along with doorbells for camps!
---
Untrue I can’t spent more then 5 minutes without an idiot trying to kill me in GTA , works differently here
---
ah ok! so im trying to tame the wrong animals, I thought it worked with any out in the wild!
---
and i need to be looking for a prompt that says "tame" not "pacify" 
---
ill try this tonight!
---
I think it's better that some mysteries remain unsolved, right? :O
---
if a gun would fire 2 shots out same barrel....................it would blow up in your face
---
............................................................just a wee thought.I'm a bit of realist.
---
do they use 2 bullets to load ? nope....... so same cartrige then. and we all want to make them go bang as well.
---
I have a 4 shot dragon..........wot....thats it ? 4 barrels ,4 shots ? not much of an increase over the single shot . Just have to live with it I suppose.
---
I AM A POSSUM SCOUT SIR
---
lol I do that.. It gives nice lighting inside the vendor booth
---
I believe most of this,  but how did they take your loot? Are you talking about your scrap?
---
In real world logic, yes. But this is a game, and it horrible unbalanced things. So rather than think of it as a two shot and be upset that it doesn’t do double damage, think of it as a shot and a quarter that does exactly what it should :)
---
I get that!
---
Funny that reporting won’t do shit, you need video proof of the cheat or exploit to do something about it duuuuhhh
---
Oh no! I already put it into the Legendary Grinder at Sunnytop Station! :(
---
On a completely unrelated note, EVERYONE STAY THE _HELL_ AWAY FROM SUNNYTOP STATION... REALLY...
---
Yes.  It is a *punne, or play on words*, specifically "encrypted" *and* cryptid.
---
Hence "encryptid".
---
Death to auto-spelling correction.
---
Let's talk about that fire pokey,  what rolls?
---
So pseudo scientific ideologically driven nonsense then? Lol. 
---
Historically applied genders as a response to obvious biological reality. Do people just non critically agree with this stuff, so they don't appear to be nasty? 
---
I'm genuinely interested...
---
Only way you can get aid from me is if I gift it or you buy it from my vending machine. Won't find me in Bethesda's unbalanced survival mode. When they figure out how to balance it I will show up.
---
Permadeath like diablo 3
---
Crap a 1/3 of the time I'm in danger mode for no reason. I'll be in the enclave bunker "DANGER". Really screws up my sneak build.
---
That's 3 points you could free up. If it was a rifle they don't even have perks and they're just as heavy. Those are some really nice bits of loot you have, no denying, but the god roll ideal is to have the total package is more the point I was making.
---
I understood your Jake, it was a decent Jake too!
---
He wrote &gt;\!spoiler\!&lt; to get &gt;!spoiler!&lt;
---
Well everything you just said makes your opinion completely invalid if you plan on playing the story then leaving and don’t plan on being in the game helping it grow.
---
For the second question no I've checked and you can't loot treasure mutiple time. Once you find it the map will disappear from your inventory.
---
I'm gonna say... no.
---
Compare the difference (IRL) between a guy walking through the woods to get to where he's going without a care in the world, to the sound of a guy attempting to sneak close enough to get a good shot on a deer.
---
That's what "sneaking" means.
---
I am only "sneaking" when I am making a conscious effort to NOT be heard or seen.
---
Give it a good kicking, I find that sorts most of them out.
---
Went looking for good plans and walked away with a 13 000 cap .50cal.
---
umm.... if you haven't n oticed, some weapons and armor scale in the 5's some in the 0's. So L45 is max level for that weapon.
---
A Sidenote: the tamed animal will circle your Camp device, so make it accessible ;)
---
They get reaaaaally annoyed If they can't get to it.
---
I've had issues placing walls around stairs or a roof/floor above them.  Usually end up moving the stairs,  putting up the walls and such,  and then moving the stairs back into place.
---
It’s gambling but perks and luck don’t effect it, it’s All random. And even if luck were to effect it, people use different weapons and like different things soo there would be no way to dictate what is an amazing weapon from one person to the next
---
I may be wrong, but I don't think Bloodied actually kicks in until you're around half-health.  It's not something that applies across your entire health bar, which would make it objectively better at almost *any* health level.
---
As I understand it (again, possibly wrong), AA ends up being arguably more useful in PvP because it allows you to sidestep armor effects.  When other players have things like Sentinel and Cavalier in addition to general DR/ER, you need to be doing a *lot* of raw damage to get past all that.
---
Polarbear Igloo made a YT video about it after I released the method to him to release it to the community.  Here’s a highlight from my Twitch of proof doing it:
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/420857183
---
I speedfarm and donate all items I find to viewers.  Drop by sometime, it’s worth it :c)
---
sneak works for me, full sneak damage until detected. But I do like your indicator.
---
Your a good person to ask this then: are you ONLY 2h Melee or do you have a secondary weapon/perks lvld up???
---
The perk system definitely needs a revamp. Not only on passive stuff such as what you mentioned but how many points a card takes and being able to scale it down when necessary. also loadouts should be a thing.
---
Realistically if a gun fired two bullets from one barrel it would lose a lot of velocity and do much less damage. At least 1 if not both bullets would tumble.... Also it'd probably blow up the barrel in real life that is. There are some fancy electrically fired guns which can do this. But we're talking about a two shot varient of common guns in the game. Which in real life would be a broken and dangerous to use firearm.
---
I'd expect this to happen https://youtu.be/IkXfYMkTNNs  in that vid there was probably a squib in the barrel which is a lodged bullet.
---
However with that said I'm with you on the 100% bonus damage because traditionally in fallout two shots have always doubled damage. 
---
The least they could do is buff the accuracy Anti-Armor has no accuracy nerfs and is far better than two shot damage wise.
---
Caps is probably a bad idea, in terms of the game's economy, but scrip could work.  There's no other way to use it than trading it to Murmrgh, so (temporarily) having a bigger pool really doesn't do much other than slightly increase the overall quality of legendaries in circulation.
---
Same here...placed foundation put stairs on it, did not like the angle...
---
so tried to store, scrap or move and all the same error..
---
Needed to place camp again to remove it...
---
Haha that reminds me, my buddy and I will race to solo a silo. Whomever wins gets to not solo the third one. We get to the end, put in nuke keycards. Then go down the line back to back to back and get the server 3 Queens. So much fun to bring the entire sever together for an hourish.
---
I would probably quit when im forced to use a power armor...  I would like upgraded hazmat suits or power suits or perks.
---
I got nothing for me but I did get good weapon and rolls for melee and heavy gunner
---
I don't really know, truth be told. I know there's a good deal of discussion on the subject but I've always been on the outside looking in, kind of thing.
---
I think it's an interesting subject and one many people feel very strongly about, but I can't really relate so I don't feel like I have much right to say too much about it :)
---
If you have more than 1 of the same map, you can loot until you run out of maps
---
Damn. Well at least there are a good amount of them.
---
They always had the choice to engage me not not all bethesda did was move the line closer to their side and make my playstyle much harder where as all i ask of pacifist players is keep pacifist on dont take a workshop. Or is that too much too ask? Do that and i cant do shit to them
---
you can make more builds with them ie rank one up to lvel 2 and leave one at rank 1. I honestly think its a good idea to give you 6 cards.. except when you open packs and get the lockpick perk card every time.. EVERY FUCKING TIME
---
What it doesn't mention is that the second bullet is made of bubble gum so makes sense that it doesn't do double damage
---
ah ok thank you for that tip!
---
i dont care about not getting what i want, its a gamble system so its pretty much designed to screw the player 9 times out of 10. but i honestly find the vendor to be an ultra boring addition to the game, with vendor bots it kinda makes sense to have them stand there doing nothing. however with this new vendor she just stands there staring at you.... she barely makes a sound. i wasnt expecting fully fledged dialogue but something would have been nice. why doesnt she tinker behind the counter or something. one thing bethesda needs to work on is making the interactions more immersive. so much of this game is just text and menus. it feels hollow to create a new npc that says and does nothing, you just push a button to bring up a text menu. i think if the legendary vendor was more fun to interact with, then the sting of a crappy purchase would be much less.
---
I can’t wait for the 40 minute of notifications of “X player needs help!”
---
Mine weren’t amazing but two of which I put in my vending sold for over 1k caps within an hour! One mans trash lol
---
Did you do anything actively i.e. send Bethesda a ticket, have some one place their camp where your’s was... or did it just start working on it’s own?
---
A treasure map grants you one dig at the location. You can stack your maps and dig multiple times. I always stack every map in a region to 10 and then go for a big treasure hunt.
---
Yep
---
here ya go. [https://discord.gg/fvVmP68](https://discord.gg/fvVmP68)
---
Yeah had 41 luck and received one exploding. It's not all god rolls but out of 12, had 3 good rolls. Sold one in vendor right away.
---
I think it would be cool but unfortunately I think people would abuse it and become to powerful. But again who knows
---
Lol I just posted a vid of this happening in my reply. Yes the gun would blow up.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/6x1vWGS](https://imgur.com/a/6x1vWGS)   
---
THATS A LOTTA DAMAGE  
---
Ty for the tip got it first try
---
actually, you know what... You're tweaking my Idea wheels
---
To many assaultron heads with 3 stars....
---
Already reached scrip limit, so turned off yesterday...
---
And reading today that wood armor and assaultron heads are glitched...
---
Screwed multiple times
---
I cant move my camp to fix it , despite me having enough caps
---
Provided it's not some super good tier thing, this is what I've been doing too. 500 per star. On PC and it seems like it has been okay that way.
---
Indeed, who's the fuckhead....
---
Yes, they're worth something, particularly since they're weightless. No, they're not worth a lot. 
---
Your luck stat has a huge effect on what you get. With high luck, you'll generally get a plan, a weapon (with matching ammo if applicable), an armor, and a junk item. I don't recall getting legendaries. 
---
It's also better if you have multiple of the same map, since you can dig multiple times with multiple maps (once per map).
---
It makes it a fun challenge; can I run it fast enough before they log off, can I get multiple bases at once, will they notice before its too late. A buddy of mine likes to leave his character idle when he goes to bed trying to get more sales or puts his guy in a spin. I might have nuked him before when his base was near 2 others.
---
Besdies people on passive mode in the pve servers are too scared to pvp anymore so I save my orbital strikes for the pvp servers. 
---
Im currently at 9 base kills and added bonus challenge, put my base in their spot so they know.
---
I don't get it... I spawned into WS with a rocket turret tower last night. I took off running and despite being hit multiple times I took zero damage.
---
speaking as a person who didnt have a legendary weapon to use, most major modifications are so good to me that i would be happy to take a worse prefix (30% vs scorched for instance).
---
so i put pen to paper and worked out that i would be happy \~6% of the time with a 2 star, rather than about 3% of the time with a 3 star.
---
i went with 2 star to get more chances and eventually got an instigating handmade with 50% limb damage. good enough for me (after buying plans and crafting and scrapping to get some mods). so now that i have that, im happy to roll for 3 star legendary ranged weapons, for that 3% chance to be happy, or a 2% chance to be very happy, or a 0.5% chance to get the god roll that i want.
---
.... No you can loot the spot as long as you have more maps for it. If you have 10 maps for that spot you can loot it 10 times.
---
1/5 legendaries being a great roll is honestly better than usual rates imo. I rolled 10 times and got a Medics VATs/Vats Submachine Gun, a Quad FFR Handmade with something I forget, and a Quad Weightless Tesla W/ Limb Damage. Other rolls were heavy guns which I don’t use but were solid
---
No I play just to explore , and avoid other players ...
---
Radicool, L38, and go high rads/low life. 50% rads should still be comfortable enough hp. If you can be comfortable playing with 80% rads/20% hp, then get Nerd Rage, L46. I know while these aren't specific perks to PA, they do well with PA because you have a lot of damage resist. PA mods, you'll want emergency protocols PA chest mod for 50% dmg reduction and movespeed bonus. As mentioned, get blocker as well, for even more damage reduction. I like fireproof as well bc it gives % dmg reduction. Since you have a lot of base dmg resistance bc of PA, getting more dmg resistance isn't as effective as getting % dmg reduction. Oh, and don't bother with Serendipity, I've read it doesn't work with PA, I've used it and never had it proc for me.
---
Are you running fireproof as a perk?
---
Perhaps it could enable you Aalto be fast traveled to for free for about 60 seconds
---
I got 6 shitty melees. A pool cue, a shovel, a pitch fork, another shovel, and two assaultron blades.
---
No but now you could find a camera in almost any single red container
---
Can't remember, it was pretty far back
---
A utility item people won...
---
Nevermind I can already hear the pay to win chants
---
Sadly, no.
---
I think you may be referring to Bosozoku?
---
Of course... it's survival. I just assumed it was the spawn immunity that kept me from taking damage and I never fast travel with a weapon out.
---
No it destroys them at least on console...
---
PS4?
---
And now you find out how much of a cheapskate I am Haha. :) I'd probably be willing to pay 1.5k for it just because of how situational it is. 
---
On the other hand, I have a 3-star gatling plasma I'd be willing to trade. It's Executioner, reduced weight and I don't remember the third star off the top of my head (I'm at work right now).
---
I'll be home in about 9 or so hours though so I don't know if you'll still be available then.
---
I have never seen a legendary out of a treasure, but you can get plans, and if what I had read online was correct - it's the one of the few ways to get plans like the Raider Armor pieces.  For me, the plans are the primary draw and make them worth going after. 
---
Each map is basically a consumable, you find the location and dig. It removes the map from your inventory and then gives you the rewards - on average I get:
---
* Some type of plan
---
* a mod of some type (don't always get this one)
---
* A level appropriate weapon with some decent mods on it
---
* ammo for that weapon
---
* some chems
---
The nice thing is, you don't need to server hop and I haven't seen any degradation of loot quality. If you have 5 of the same map, you dig the mound, get your loot, wait a few moments and repeat at the same spot.  
---
I typically stock pile a bunch of them before I go on treasure hunts, and if I see people selling them for 50 caps or less on player vendors i will buy them, since most plans you get can be sold for about 50 caps minimum and the other drops make up the tax loss and then some.
---
Yeah same here. Got one and it changed to a 2\*
---
I'm selling steady at 80caps per full core
---
Unfortunately not.
---
I hopped kelly monument for 4 hours over 3 days. Mixed in phillipi cemetary at the 3 hour mark.
---
The next week i resumed the bullshittery of gating content behind rng and got it on my 3rd hop.
---
I found a flare gun in an area with about 5 players around, had quite a bit of ammo saved up. Shot it about 8 times and I don't believe anyone saw it. Might be too high up.
---
Applying real life to this whole situation is a very strange idea, but okay.
---
If I'm walking around some 100 meters away in a forest, then it isn't very likely that someone who isn't making a conscious effort to see me is going to notice when I stand somewhere and decide to put a .308 through his thick, mutant skull. A twitchy animal like a deer might notice, but if I've been standing somewhere until a deer walks into my sights, then it shouldn't matter whether I am standing up or sitting down.
---
Most people want: Bloodied, Anti armor, Two shot, Furious, Vampire's, Quad, instigating as prefix maybe executioners as well. As a second effect you wanna have explosive or faster fire rate. If your gun has any of these combinations it's probably gonna sell good. But not always. A Vampire's dragon is probably as useless as an instigating minigun. But there's an exception. People love them explosions. So if the gun's explosive then someone will probably buy it no matter what the prefix is (maybe not nocturnal). For melee weapons you wanna go for the same prefixes but definitely you wanna have swing speed. Maybe power attack dmg. Obviously there are more weapons that are decent but these kind of combinations sell very well.
---
100 meters is 109.36 yards
---
Spawn imminity is a thing but I'm on ps4 so load in times can sometimes stretch longer than the immunity period unfortunately. Still. 3 levels of fireproof makes the damage tiny. Though with that many explosions you do get stuck in a stagger lock which I'm assuming is the actual point of these things. Stagger you constantly and pick you off easy.
---
Are you just upset? Sounds like your just angry in general. You need anything for that? My refrigeration mod for my backpack keeps everything pretty cool, I got whatever you need. 
---
Might not have anything that can fix that attitude though. :/
---
I don’t think it has been implemented as of yet.
---
Sad af, this can make me frustrating judging by what you’ve said
---
This would provide QOL in so many ways
---
I always joke about how the vault dwellers are supposed to be these extraordinary people, but forgot how to hack a computer just because they don't have a card equipped. Like, I get it, but come on.
---
Lo and behold.
---
Pedants'r'Us, always on the job.
---
&gt; so I start semding msgs to people in the server for help. Everyone said no. *[...]*. I know I shouldnt have done that
---
Why not?  Seems a reasonable way to behave.
---
Where I've bee all over that spot on several servers and cannot find rabbits
---
Again don't care what you think, I got a dozen of us that runthe same. It's a online game if you want a farming simulator Im sure you can pick up a used copy of one at game stop. The beauty of mmos are it allows everyone to have a differnt styles and to make their fun the way they see fit.
---
Could just make you able to walk through objects when you pick them up.
---
I would love to know this as well! I know the chest plan but nothing else except mod plans. It’s weird considering I always learn plans and have been playing steadily since beta.
---
The theory is that it was too good of a deal, so they scrapped it.  nothing official though
---
Yes just got a unyeilding 3*
---
lol What do you mean?
---
Very good deals, sometimes. It’s like a post-apocalyptic thrift store.
---
I think you'd need a new xbox account. On ps4 you can't change that link.
---
I'm of the mindset that nothing would really be lost if it were literally "Find the code pieces -&gt; input the code."  Just skip the word part entirely and have it be something like first digit: position in the code, second digit: the digit you enter.  Stagger their spawns if you wish, like the Nuclear Keycards, so you can't summon the entire code in one session.  A single player could do that.
---
The fact that Nuka-Crypt exists at all is an indictment of how overwrought their scheme is.  Few players do it as intended because the mechanic is too complicated, poorly explained, exists "beyond" the game itself, and has enough trial-and-error involved that no one is going to plausibly risk failing the code input 5+ times to figure out the proper codeword.
---
Are you on PC? I can show you where they spawn. They are dead sometimes. And sometimes there is a mix of bunnies and squirrels. IGN: jchamlin
---
 Rules:  
---
The base will be invincible. Don't worry about blowing stuff up! Explosives are allowed!  
---
There are no locked doors or hidden areas.   
---
3 teams of 4. 1 defending, 2 attacking.   
---
Each team is required to set up a camp for their team as a fast travel / respawn point, each of them needs to be on opposite sides of the castle.   
---
No attacking the other attackers unless you are inside the base. Defenders are not to leave the base. Your goal is to kill the defenders, not fight each other on the field.   
---
No looting. If someone dies, leave their aid bag for them to retrieve later.   
---
No Sentinel armor abuse /  jumping up and down.   
---
Defenders will have a camp for respawn, but it will be located on a side of the base like the other teams.   
---
You ARE NOT allowed to use the 'Respawn Here' with your teammates. You MUST respawn at your base camp.   
---
And most of all, have fun and shoot each other!
---
I got a vampires ultracite gatling with limb damage. Not bad but I wouldn't necessarily say good either...
---
From a drop or the purveyor ? And if I’m XB1 would you be willing to sell ?
---
&gt; Ad surely he took my loot. 
---
Why did you have any loot on you?  Almost the first thing I build at a workbench is a stash box.
---
Love it.
---
if I don't think too hard about the more than  likely death of said butterfly... the butterfly in a jar from Skyrim atleast let the captured creature somewhat fly. and theoretically could be fed. 
---
the poor frog can't do anything but be squished in a jar and wallow in a tortutous death. if we wanted something like that I guess a Firefly is possible and fits with many things in game already but we are capturing them and they will eventually die. even the fish lamp gave the fish a good liveable habitat.
---
Hmmm ......got my attention.
---
level 104, rifle, definatly older, play solo, and doesn't run around at full speed everywhere,have mike and a little company now and again. I recon I could suffer that.
---
usually on at night tho, 22:00 to 24:00
---
ps4 is as above without the 601.......
---
And I cant walk across Boston in 3 minuets or the entire state of West Virginia in like 10 (havnt really tried yet)
---
Everything is condensed from what it would be in the real world
---
From the Ledgendary vendor. PS4 No way!😋
---
I had bad luck tbh. And i was salty at the time.
---
Sometimes ppl post on here when they find him so i read reddit while hopping
---
Fair enough mate, although you always have a right to an opinion, despite how valid it may or not be!
---
I have a Bloodied explosive lever action. As a secondary. It does the work but most of my damage comes from my melee. My lever action does 165 damage without having any perks equipped for it
---
The RNG giveth and the RNG taketh away. Blessed be the RNG.
---
Man your life must be horrible.
---
Is the UK on different servers than the US? Is it a time issue?
---
Good bot.
---
In my opinion (worth whatever you're willing to pay for it), a nice solution would be to introduce a storyline quest that had you make a choice at some point where you did something that would either benefit one side or another.
---
For example - you decide to help the BoS fix some stations or not. The choice suggesting that the BoS will then be able to make trips to those areas (a potential high level mob) and start putting the area under their control...OR...you go against their wishes and thus allow Raiders to start entering the area.
---
The repercussions of your choice aren't immediate, you just make a choice on the quest and move on, BUT, Bethesda gathers that info and tallies it. In the end, whichever way the majority of the players went that's where the game starts to go (representing that you aren't the only person having an effect on the world out there...your fellow vault dwellers may have screwed up your plans).
---
This would be an interesting way to have players begin to have a longer term effect on how the game goes and could easily be done for other future quests. Small choices that you get to make that eventually have consequences depending on how players go overall.
---
Again, just a quick thought.
---
Is armorer work/worth it for PA?
---
That harpoon us worth quite a good amount trust, 10-15k at the least
---
I do wish this wasn't how it worked too.  I wouldn't mind teaming up with folks sometimes when I happen to be in the same area but I have read too many of these kinds of stories to do it.  I tend to collect and scrap a lot while I am running around.  So the thought of loosing my precious junk to some ahole would really piss me off.  It's really too bad because I also see some really positive encounters with random groups that sound like fun.
---
Yeah it works great, spent about 800 scrip on three star stuff and got vampire rocket launcher, medic fat man, instigating plasma pistol, anti armor hook, troubleshooters .44 with added bashing damage,  a hunters hunting rifle and a double minigun.
---
Yes armorer works for PA
---
If you're 100 m away from me in a forest... unless you're actively trying to be unheard and unseen, I 100% guarantee you that I would hear you. Sneaking isn't only about being seen in game... it's about the enemy being skittish, having a "feeling", thinking someone is out there. Then... "danger" is the fact they KNOW you're out there. It could be tweaked, I think... but moreso in an AI fashion than a "everybody is sneaking all the time" thing. Sprinting around in power armour and then suddenly stopping in place is hardly sneaking.
---
I like your indicator idea. Far cleaner and better than it is now.
---
However, if we take your idea that you're "always sneaking"... then the game would just be on easy mode. Sneak crits everywhere.
---
I have yet to find a single serum recipe. :(
---
The stings and tings and toxic cleanup give possums. The tadpole has to be grinded from what I've seen. There's 2 possum under world that are easy to grind too, use the guarantee from pvp.
---
Trust me, I've used a LMG and tried to keep it fed by mining at lucky hole and getting 400-500 lead ore per day. That lead will last you a queen fight or two in that thing lol. It is the highest dps weapon in the game though, so there's that.
---
Dekotora?
---
Yeah, probably. We all suffer because of a few dicks.
---
Yes this above too. The animals seem to have a tendancy to teleport through walls if they cant get close to it
---
Server switching will fix this. Its a double loading glitch. When you load in and another player is nearby or loading in as well it places two maps on top of eachother basically.
---
Youll notice items sitting out will reset but cant pick them up (because the other player hasnt grabbed it yet so it reset only for them.)
---
Youll also notice doors will open then load closed suddenly before letting you through. Again i assume because the other player hasnt opened them. Etc etc.
---
I was JUST thinking about this this morning, but also scout leader Jaggy talks about the two deadliest snakes in Appalachia.  Where are our mutated giant snakes!?
---
Nope. If anything it will bring prices on 2-3* items down to the point where they will show up in vending machines. Right now high end items are reserved for trade only because they are worth more caps than open cap space
---
Did I leave the oven on again?
---
Got a bunch of legendary scout armor.  Only played for about 15 minutes last night so didn't have time to look at it detail, will check it out tonight and start the grind to upgrade it (polymer, deep pockets and so on).
---
Got a Berserkers Explosive minigun
---
I want this to happen just to kill those monstrosities.
---
Lol I just got the pic thanx though and I'm on ps4
---
it alows people to trade in 2.5 crap 3 star legendary weapons that would never sell and eventually be vendored due to stash restrictions, for a chance at a decent weapon. this might not be the weapon that the player requires but that is generally desirable and will sell.
---
at the same time people that keep their stash low might consider selling their shit legendaries at super low prices for players that dont have time to get all the 150 scrip from the vending machine but have caps. there was a post a day or 2 a go, where a person was considering that he would be willing to pay 25 caps per scrip, so he would be willing to pay 1000 caps or less for a 3 star weapon.
---
and if you maxed out your scrip for the day, why not try to sacrifice some stash space for the chance that such a player comes along in those few hours that you are playing, and if not take it with you to the vendor on your next trip.
---
so in a wierd way it might actually encourage player vending. but its still early days and all i have said is conjecture. so take with a grain of salt.
---
I guess I can see that if you login to WS Station but just fast travelling there lets me take off running almost immediately. I'm on XBox so maybe that's the difference? I still agree with the sentiment that bases should be damageable.
---
Whats your level too btw? You need to be double a pets level to tame it. The ones you can tame wont be massively high so don't bank on that. The one I have is only 16 but since the camp is in the forest, that's not an issue. If you camp in the bog for example, it might not last long.
---
Also check this post for the encounters.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5hqce/updated_map_of_random_encounter_locations/
---
This WILL require a lot of server hopping and fast travelling unless your lucky.
---
Bolton Greens Anne is on the Water Fountain out front... been there last 2-3 days for people I’ve told...

Meanwhile on EU server.

I thought that was pretty cool, and the player had lots of affordable serums on sale too.
---
I get it but it says an addition PROJECTILE not and addition ROUND. Feels like intentional wording.
---
You can sell maps for a decent amount if you watch the market. I sold 3,000 caps worth not to long ago. Since the loot pool for them imo isn't worth the time or effort.
---
As a jetpack PA user without any power core reduction perks id maybe pay 20ish caps for one.
---
Honestly taking a power plant for one play session usually gives me enough for several more play sessions before i even have to think about cores, coupled with finding cores off chassis.

Time difference.
---
I play melee. Iv had my machete and arm in there many times.
---
I thought I had placed mine in a safe place until a friend told me it spawned him right into it(he runs a bloodied build) so I moved it.
---
I'll add you in when i am home. In about an hour.
---
I need to revive someone too
---
They're not bobbleheads, they're the vault boy lawn gnome from the atom shop.
---
Lvl 3 action boy is pretty much a perment card in my build.
---
&gt; Just remember, as with any RNG game, it's all about hitting the button over and over. You WILL find good stuff eventually
---
Or then again, maybe you won't.
---
General Lee steakhouse has a decent chance to spawn 2. I dont get them every time though. The AWOL quest nearby usually spawns atleast 2x 2-3* every time Ive done it.
---
And the more people who are 'farming' areas, the fewer people can actually just play those areas as they encounter them.
---
If you have a dozen high level players in separate areas who are just farming them over and over...that's an area that newer players who maybe haven't been able to explore the area yet can't really experience those areas as they're constantly being farmed making the world seem a lot more empty.
---
Just a thought.
---
Xbox, sorry :(
---
Otherwise it would be yours!
---
Platform?
---
I got a furious explosive reduced weight with 1/10 that luck. It really is just rng.
---
Hey just testing the waters here but i just got a 1/7 good to bad roll on 3 star legendary melee weapons last night this morning tried twice more both nothing to my favor than i had enough for a 2 star melee roll... Deathclaw 40% faster swing ignores 50% armor 😕 is it possible there is a greed system that effects the good to bad rolls 
---
Ex.
---
3 stars have a 70% bust item
---
2 stars have a 40% bust item 
---
ect.
---
....just a thought 😓 happy hunting ✊
---
You can increase the condition of weapons with certain stocks. I do it with my laser rifles because they break quickly. Gunsmith 5 helps if you wanna use 5 intelligence points on it
---
They do not. The game has no way to perceive what someone is hoping to get. But I still swear RNGeesus has it out for me.
---
They're wanted.  Go pick up the bounty, pardner.
---
I’d casual play with you. My friend and I work nights so we’re on odd hours for the US. I guess I’m not sure what times you’d like to play. I’m US central time zone :)
---
We’re chill, low 100’s
---
The idea isn't "always sneaking".
---
The idea is "enemies who don't know your position should suffer sneak attacks if you attack them."
---
if I stand up on some rooftop after sneaking my way there, an enemy shouldn't suddenly *not* suffer sneak attack damage simply because my legs aren't bent enough.
---
The bar.  Has been.  Raised.
---
Bethesda said it would be on personal servers from the beginning.
---
Same started filling my mules with flux and ultracite ammo so I can still grind for caps...
---
Of course it is. When you want to be able to see who is where and can ambush them even if they are afk. And the challenges push the workshops these days to all. Also if you contest and they defend, doesn't that make it a consented pvp? I guess you want it only on your terms. Sorry Bethesda and the majority of the player base, who are nice to people, doesn't seem to agree with you.
---
they should not. and there is no reason, as far as im aware, that anyone should conclude that they do.
---
until a large enough sample can be obtained and analysed properly any "evidence" is anecdotal.
---
anyone stating otherwise does not understand probability and chance properly.
---
While server hopping is an option, it isn't the only option.  Perhaps spend that time running around the map and checking locations.  The cost of a half dozen fast-travels is easily offset with the ease of obtaining caps these days.  And its a lot more fun.
---
For players that haven't started this quest yet, I would NOT server hop a single location.   Server hopping can work, but the odds are against you.  Running around the map isn't a guarantee either, but its more fun.  It is my understanding each server has two bodies (a male and a female) ... you just need to find one of them.
---
ah ok! thank you for this needed info! i appreciate it!
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76
---
why would they?  
---
What one would consider a lucky roll would be unlucky to another.  They game can't read your mind and say "ahhh, he wants a TSE gatling...he has high enough luck...let's give it to him"
---
Pretty dumb
---
Three star AA bolt action pipe with vats crit and another vats buff. Great for a vats sneak sniper that does the ol’ double dip on perks. Not a good drop for either of my characters though.
---
Lmao love the daily rage posts
---
It used to. The nice thing is it procs twice with exploding. It was way op though when at +100% damage. No one cared about anything else and some were making horrible builds around it because it was so op. It was a mindless win button.
---
please post a link where this is happening to scout armor.
---
I've never levelled a camp just for the sake of it. I will however track you to your camp when you have attacked me, and I will orbital strike it to death. That's only fair isn't it? 
---
Yes you can still use artillery and orbital strikes for this purpose, you're welcome!
---
Nice idea
---
With the limited amount of scrip you have I would say go with 2\*.  Gives you an extra chance of somehting good and usually the 3rd effect isn't anything major for ranged weapons.  I did 6 2\* ranged weapons yesterday and got some good stuff.  Only one combination I acutally needed but most of the others are good to trade/sell to other players.
---
not a bug.
---
This is beautiful.
---
You want me to link you many more? I just linked the first couple I found when googling star wars prequels.
---
That's a known bug.  What the OP is saying isn't.
---
I got a few things.  Mostly stuff I didn't want to keep, but I'm keeping the *** Executioner's Super Sledge.  I've been playing with the *** Furious Minigun, but I think that's going back to the Purveyor.
---
A couple other items I happened to get screenshots of:
---
This [Grenade Launcher](https://screenshotscontent-d3002.xboxlive.com/xuid-2535439614426281-private/0346b10a-1467-4845-a273-91353a453911.PNG?sv=2015-12-11&amp;sr=b&amp;si=DefaultAccess&amp;sig=zthswnrcYLIUpv%2B%2F2J65nbJcGzp1qDoXeDE24%2B6aXfE%3D)
---
This explosive [Combat Rifle](https://screenshotscontent-d5002.xboxlive.com/xuid-2535439614426281-private/c2711aa0-a343-4f76-a137-be0706338601.PNG?sv=2015-12-11&amp;sr=b&amp;si=DefaultAccess&amp;sig=sIEUKC5A%2F7rX5reld8zaYndP1O%2BKHBJYlsZu8geOE9Q%3D), which will probably go back to the Purveyor too (unless anyone wants it!).
---
Ive been saying it for months good to see people agree
---
Same thing happened to me, same place too just one tho, it killed the wendigo that was trying to kill me so that was nice...until it started chasing me instead
---
Yes yes yes. I'm also hoping to see new areas in the near future. Expand the boundaries or just add new zones maybe
---
I have scout armor and I don’t want to mess it up if this is the issue, that’s why I’m asking... I have a full set and was about to attach some mods to it and heard this. 
---
There was a few posts yesterday mentioning this and I want to make sure if it’s a known issue or not.
---
wouldn't that cause over heating issues on your xbox?
---
Oh ok
---
this is some saw shit right here.
---
Ok but why would the United States military make an effort to make unscrambling their nuclear codes more NNE-speaker-friendly? I mean I COMPLETELY understand the frustration as a player, makes perfect sense. I'm torn between it being immersive and it being a pain. At the end of the day you're asking for the hacking of nuclear codes to be a bit simpler and I'm leaning more towards it being fine the way it is.
---
I know it sucks I searched for 3 days for the tourist to get a camera, all while my friends I was playing with found them all the time since when you complete the mission they show up in containers after that... I was very upsetting they'd have like 10 in their inventory and I could even get one.
---
&gt; This game *[IS]* a Fallout game, it is an ARPG in the Fallout Universe, it is *NOT* a Fallout single player RPG game.
---
Bruh
---
I want the combat rifle. How much?
---
Ah, so it's strangler plants that i need to check? Thanks, this really helps.
---
Funny story about this. LOL (PVE)
---
I was in whitesprings selling and crafting minding my own business. I guess this guy was annoyed at how long I was taking with one vendor and slapped me. My mutation activated and the vendor and guards got hit and went APE SHIT over me until I killed them. Dude and I laughed and then went on our way as the vendor was dead.
---
&gt; The person who fails at reading comprehension is you. And once again you show you ignorance of computers- did I say software? No I didn't think so
---
ROFL, so now you show your ingorance of computers. A computer game IS software. Like what do you think computer games aren't also programmed in c# or c++?
---
&gt;Don't like the game? cool, don't play and glad that even if I do, I won't see your ignorant obstinate existence in the wastes- 
---
Nah, I'll instead give my feedback like bethesda asks for on the game to try to make the game enjoyable for the majority of the people. Instead of just enjoyable by people who don't care about major bugs, etc.
---
Wow this is beautiful
---
Yeah an election type of situation/mechanic would be a great way to bring world building decisions to F76, I agree.
---
Damn nice drop! Congrats!
---
If you don't have a disease it isn't active. Stack up on cures or use the whitesprings fountain! Cheers
---
so no evidence showing scout armor loses a star.  do some more research....there are 2 types of legendaries that have been proven to lose a star.
---
I like checking out the camps but it’s a major disappointment when you look at what they’re selling and it’s regular stuff you can find pretty much anywhere.
---
Over a long enough period, RNG chances become a near certainty. Diablo 3 and PoE taught me this, and the best streamers I've watched on those games have said over and over - just keep going, you'll get it eventually. It may seem like you never will, but it will happen, you just can't give up.
---
Bruh. Starched Gene's. Max it out, and equip it. Ez
---
Does that count for the camera you need? Like can you actually fix it and use it without finding the tourist?
---
If you're looking for Super Mutants to kill, try Grafton. I went there a lot early game to help level up. There's also the Parade event to do there, in which you get to kill a Grafton Monster.
---
Yes after I submitted a ticket to bethesda and it worked after
---
What if it just sets a marker or waypoint for the people that are on your team. But I do like the idea, I just think that the whole ‘paying someone caps for helping you’ is a bit much.
---
Some people claim Charisma affects drops from mobs, and they have supporting proof, but I still think it's just a coincidence.
---
I don't think anyone ever posted any proof on any system of someone actually stealing items from their inventory. It's always been something that happened to a buddy or a friend of a friend or something. The fact that nobodies ever been able repeat it, or even just capture it when it happens is pretty telling. Especially when you can hit a button and capture video after the fact (at least on PS4).
---
LOL, try standing there in melee.  No one ever said the life of a melee character was sexy.
---
In all honesty, though, once I added Suppressor to my suite of damage reduction and got my rad resist high enough to keep Dodgy from depleting my AP, I became able to go face-to-face with the SBQ, which really cuts down on the time wasted trying to position myself where I won't get hurt.  Now, I can be anywhere and as long as I keep hitting her, I don't have to worry about dying.
---
How do you get it so high? Even with unyielding and adrenalin the highest i got it to was 115 last night after clearing a mob.
---
yep.  apparently there's a fix where if you go to a stash box in the shop, and then back to the vendor, it should work.  I haven't tried this though.
---
That's been my approach. Got two bits of 3* Urban Scout Armor and a 3* Bloodied/Reload/+DR Shotgun and I don't plan on using any of it. So I sold off the Scout Armor and if the shotgun doesn't sell I'm just gonna scrap it for 40% of what it cost and I'm fine with that.
---
I would say the 2 pipe r
---
Pistols now modded to rifles.
---
1 - Instigating w/+50% crit shot &amp; something else.
---
2 - Vampire w/dual vats.
---
Also got a trappers AutoStim chest w/Powered/Sentinel lol. Great except the AutoStim bit.
---
Oh and a Zealots Gatling Laser w/CRITSHOT and faster reload.
---
That is entirely possible since I don't remember the name of it. xD
---
I don’t even look for them  anyone I just carry them around
---
Also whitesprings club house, and horde events, particularly leader of the pack because you usually get 4 from it. 
---
SBQ was just a fun fight. It's kind of sad no one is running it as much as they used to.
---
You really want more budget remove all turrets,food,and giant powered items like wv sign. I just bought it on sale and cant place it cause it takes so much budget. Its a choice to make weather you want those things or a bigger more decorated camp
---
Either cheap ammo or plans
---
I currently have it in my vending machine for 1500 caps IIRC.  If that sounds good and you're on XBox, just let me know.
---
Did you read my question at all???? That’s literally what I am trying to find out... where would you look to “research” this as you pointed out???
---
You even mention this has been proven... no shit... and I’m trying to find out if scout armor has the same issue...
---
Since it’s been one day not much “research” is out there and why I’m asking here.
---
Yes you do. When the event becomes available a message pops up saying "Sons of Dane automated alert signal found."
---
Oh I agree.
---
I’m on PC. Dang it.
---
I like this post OP and here is my opinion about it.  Aside from a couple of issues with Assaultron heads, wood armor and the Purveyor's mystery pick, this is exactly what everyone has been wanting.  This is the 3\* Legendary enemy you don't have to fight  that actually drops a 3\* Legendary every time.  This is the quest you don't have to spend hours on that guarantees a 3\* Legendary every time and delivers. It's even better because you can actually request what general type of drop it will be and you get it.  Now here's the reality.  It is RNG.  Not everyone will get a TSE shotgun or Gauss rifle or whatever meta build armor they want from ANY enemy or quest that drops items.  I know that alot of people actually got exactly what they wanted yesterday, alot more will get theirs today, even more will get theirs tomorrow.  I got a few really decent things myself and was genuinely surprised.  I usually only get rocks in my bag.  Positive posts are fantastic and provide hope for people.  Keep 'em coming.  It's okay to drive around in your brand new car. What is inevitably going to happen is disappointed people are going to start complaining because they didn't get what Lucky Joe random player got. " Bethesda Please Fix This" posts will be popping up from now on. This will happen no matter what because people are just that way.  The only sure way to get exactly what you want in this game is find someone who has it and pay for it somehow.  I"ll take my chances with the Vendor, thank you very much.   
---
 So, like someone said just recently; "Bethesda, Legendary vendor is fine.  Please leave as is"
---
I had 18 goes from my main and mule characters at the 100 Scrip ranged weapons and got rubbish items. I even got 3 insultron heads two the same (not a typo). Dropped half as had nowhere to put them and scrapped some for new Scrip.
---
Apart from perhaps the heavy energy guns explosive perks on weapons is king in my view. I’m sure others will differ on there view on this. If you look at all the trades here that are most popular for ranged they have an explosive attribute. 
---
Gutted so far but will keep grinding to see if I get a decent drop from  her. We have more chance to get our weapon we want now but it’s still heavily loaded you will get junk. But have to be happy with the extra chances even if it’s a grind to get the scrip each day.
---
Wonder what others think but getting 200 Scrip a day would make it much more worthwhile 150 a day seems low to me
---
Glad though you got something worthwhile. Good luck on your next visit to her.
---
This is awesome, thank you!
---
I felt daunted with all the challenges and didn’t know where to start. I was going so slowly, but your guides will help me get my backpack soon!
---
You mean a work around not a fix. 
---
Just tried this and not working.
---
Suppressors’ radium, junkie’s 10mm pistol, two hunter’s garbage I forgot what, climaxed with a nocturnal flamer
---
There has never been any indication ever in fallout lore that they are Walmart. The franchise itself (super duper mart) even predates the essential takeover and proliferation of walmart ebnamasse in the United States. 
---
While I agree that the maps are condensed the dev teams of the various games have done a good job at showing us appropriate scale of important locations. Super duper mart has always leaned more towards a standard sized grocery store or a convienance store size. 
---
We have not once seen anything resembling the megastores that we know today in any game, and quite frankly they go against the 50's era aesthetic of the franchise.
---
Ceci n’est pas un shit.
---
Seeing as PA users got shafted on the backpacks (I'm talking about functionality such as the fridge, not the carry weight portion) I'm finding it really harder and harder to see why PA shouldn't be allowed to have legendary perks.
---
Perhaps limit PA to 1* but give them a more diverse pool of effects.
---
No it wouldn't. If two bullets were launched in unison two bullets would fire. It would explode if there was a bullet lodged in the barrel and another fired behind it.
---
It still makes them hostile for some reason. I've had the mutation forever, brahmin and animals like the dog on that cliff run away. The dog jumped off the cliff :|
---
&gt; You don't feel like it's your world which you are an important part of.
---
Because it isn't your world.  How could it be?
---
People were disappointed because they didn't listen and don't think.
---
Cant inspect if camps owner isnt near for some odd reason
---
Drat.
---
Would make the flare gun not usesless and what everyone says make it a temporary fast travel. And make it burn longer or at least linger on the ground buring stuff
---
yeah, a game we have to spend months playing in order to acquire good gear. I'd say it ranks relatively high in the importance scale for those of us who subject themselves to it, even though "it's just a game"
---
there's no excuse for that to happen.
---
damn that is a really good idea
---
I will admit, i partake in one form of camp shenanigans. Balloon bombing. Balloons on your shelf, on your bed, on all your stations, in all your doorways, hidden on rooftop, i think i got one on the vault boy statute heads. Owner cones hone and goes "what.. the... fuck"
---
 i just hope they do more with the actual npc. give her something to do behind the counter besides stand like a robot. make the interaction with her more meaningful so that the bad purchases arent as big of a hit. i was very underwhelmed by her, when i first saw her she didnt even make a sound. im hopeful though, they were very lazy with the initial implementation of the extra vendors at whitesprings (eventually moving them behind counters) so maybe eventually she wont seem like a mole miner skinned bot. thats about my only gripe. the actual gamble system is as expected. and at the very least now we have a chance to get at least one 3 star per day, i used to go a week sometimes without one.
---
It could work. Just not right now. They'd have to overhaul the servers and their engine first so highly doubt we'd ever get it. Still an awesome idea regardless. Just one we wont get.
---
The assaultron head will also drop from 3 stars down to 2 stars when you server hop or log back in! I read about it in a prior post on the forums for Bethesda that people think it has to do with the game checking your inventory stats each time you log in. Wood armor was only supposed to have 1 star and the heads a max of 2 stars. So the vendor is giving this new loot that does not match up to this list that it supposedly checks each time you log in, and that's why your stats will change or simply disappear each time you server hop. Again this is the theory going around now, but it seems to be picking up some credibility with people.
---
Plans. But, good plans. I’m not going to buy your Cushioned Raider Left Arm plan.
---
yyyyyyup      . thats wot happens. that guys lucky to have both his hands.
---
there is pretty much NOTHING realistic in fallout. it just is what it is.
---
"please bethesda , weigh a bobby pin".... for christ sake shut up. do you have any idea how much a 308 round actually weighs.....3/4 of an ounce if must you know......each....
---
having a little senior moment here...........cheers.
---
If I am not wrong, Scrip and Cap limits reset based on when you either first access them, or when you clear them out. Not a static timer. So it is relatively easy to manage when they reset, just wait 20 hours from when you vendored stuff. I do think they should up the limit to 160, so we can turn in 3 stars and get a round number of scrip.
---
Op's problem can be cured with Starched Genes (which you should have if you are Mutated at all), but you make a good point with Bloodied/Unyielding.
---
Until I got the backpack, everything would go horribly wrong if I lost my rads.  Losing Strength, means I lose carry weight, which means I'm massively over-encumbered and can't fast travel.  All the other stats (except END) take a nosedive as well.  And now I have to go chill in a toxic pond or next to some radioactive barrels for a minute.
---
I really have no clue at this point. I'm selling the latest rng or hard to get event reward plans for 200 , explosive guns and quite good armor and managed to sell a grand total of zero.  It could be nobody buys anything.
---
I could really profit more if i were to place a launch trap where buyers stand, and throw 'em off the cliff.
---
If I trigger the event, I linger for a few minutes waiting for people to come becuase you always have that one Brahmin that turns right at the fork.
---
This is amazing. Well done.
---
WHAT about the reports that "I got a 3 \* legendary yesterday but when I logged back on it is now a 2 star or a 1 star"?  I don't think that's OK.
---
So is Bethesda going to acknowledge that?
---
What would orbital strikes do? Camps are immune to pvp damage now. Just like all the care bears wanted. Now you get to deal with murder boxes set up on spawn points to kill people fast traveling in. LOL
---
PS4 😊
---
At least for bos, we aren’t soldiers so we literally had to commit federal fraud to register, and even still we’re not sanctioned. Id want to reestablish a bos satellite link and then introduce guilds. We are literally doing what you said until then. 
---
Wastelanders is supposed to introduce new stuff so theres still hope.
---
I don't recall seeing any dailies for scout badges. Where agould I be looking? In our challenges menu? Are they an event? I feel like I'm missing out here.
---
Flare gun schematics were one of the first I bought! I still use it, it's always on me. It's cool to fire off a flare to signal danger, or loot. Separately-coloured flares would be nice, that way you can color-code. I find most of my flares go ignored, a lot of people seem to think they're a warning or threat/declaration of war. I like to signal ore deposits, too.
---
Because gender and sex aren’t the same thing. Gender is a social thing and sex is a biological thing.
---
This is not pseudoscience nor is it ideological. It’s also not nonsense. It’s trivially easy to see it in action.
---
That is the funniest shit ever!
---
https://i.imgflip.com/317pzc.jpg
---
I kind of just toss em all in at default value. I sold a TSE for under 100 caps. Followed the guy to his base and he put it up for 4k caps.
---
Whatever is left is just junk and gets turned into scrip at the next day.
---
I've spent about 60k caps in the past 2 days thanks to the legendary scrip machine and vendor.
---
Many comments saying it's a good solution but could not do it based on "Old code.." 
---
I'm sorry I say this could be implemented to even the most antique code base where even the code was in a completely un-compatible code base.
---
Even if they could not get access to say the world meta data until you joined, they could still write/update an entry in something like tblCampQuadantsPlacements record when a CAMP is placed. Instead of an immediate join of some random world they could first get a list of worlds that are NOT good candidates. If one of these servers respond, just reject it (unless user says stay with my team) and move to next responding world. User just knows that he can certainly place his base.
---
Of course there would have to be an override of this so that the joining user could still join one of the "bad" worlds if he wanted to stay in the team that was currently on a "bad" world for his camp placement. !Anything! can be done with software, it's all a question of "having time", right hardware, and the almighty green to fund it. We went to the moon with an 8k RAM computer!
---
Nope, OP just mad he lost junk and thought they still did something. Camps got all pvp damage removed in patch 9.
---
that's not how rng works. and those rolls are pretty meh
---
I never thought about it until now that different countries have different servers. I'm new to MMO so it makes sense, just never thought about it. Earmuffs Bethesda, but I wonder if I can point PIA to a foreign country and take a look around. It would be cool to join a Japanese server and see what it's all about.
---
La trahison des shit.
---
yes, base is still there today.
---
But then... Shouldn't you like her because you two are so alike?
---
Oh yeah. I've gotten my back pack. But I didn't know that made me a possum. I thought that was just the tadpole quest.
---
YOU are the hero, ev erybody wants what you have, even your Poo.
---
I haven't had issues with walls to floors, but I've had half walls that wouldn't place because they were "floating", even though I was simply trying to place the wall on top of another wall...
---
Nope, dumped my wood right away
---
It will come when everyone has finished using the scrips hoarded last week.
---
I wouldn't, simply because I think the players who have been slogging through the ups and downs since launch appreciate how it is slowly getting better as things are added and fixed.  Still has a ways to go to match my intiial expectations for the game last year but it's nice to see they are still working to get there.
---
XB1 seemed to of had the biggest impact. Stuff like the rare fasnacht masks now becoming common
---
That is awesome, thank you.
---
Ah, I see you’re a man of culture as well
---
Weird I got it on my first SBQ kill, same with jetpack plans for the t60 or t51b can't remember which. Which kind of sucked since I use X01. :(
---
Did someone win?
---
I've material modded (polymer) all my limbs.
---
The two problems are:
---
1. When you buy a "polymer" or "deep pocketed" mod you can't tell whether its chest or limb.
---
2. There exist arm and leg mods (sleek, something else) but you can't apply them because scout armor arms and legs are marked "limb", not "arm" or "leg".
---
Makes sense. Maybe I was not supposed to have that legendary gattling. When it broke, it was like it was never there. At least it served to makes me aim in a build that uses wepons with fusion core as primary ammo, since I been farming fusion cores at easy, and with the power user perk it gets 1000 shots by core
---
I figured as much. :(
---
Oh well, have a good day :)
---
I've had to wipe and reset my mutations before
---
Good thing player characters can't speak then. :P
---
My problem is that we wasted the scrip for these items for them to just disappear or change on us!
---
I'm currently selling plans and random things required for Possum badges. Teddy bears, bunsen burners, etc...
---
Instigating crossbow FFR fast reload..quad laser pistol FFR I forget 3rd..scrapped everything else
---
Ah thank you so much. I have a poly mod that I couldn't apply to one, so you're suggesting that it may be a torso modification that basically has no name difference?
---
I got some stuff goin on in my brain that I never thought of thanks to this post.
---
Oh no that’s definitely not the case, even though the propaganda may say so. Some countries forced equal pay for dentist and doorman, at least that’s what I read, because it will make everyone feel ‘equal’, so in the end everyone just want to be doorman because the extra effort will get you nowhere when your salary is simply capped.
---
I burn up guys sometimes, but don't discriminate- raider, vault dweller, but they have to be over level 50 or an alt wearing good gear. I leave raw rubber and a pilsner bottle on people's beds too when vendor hopping. Yeah I know, those are issues xD
---
I got a Nocturnal Gattling gun, that gives me resistance while reloading and 33% VATS accuracy..
---
But then I got a supresser crossbow, that gives me damage resistance on reload and faster reload. That one actually sounds fun to use, but I'm a heavy weapons build :(
---
So far plans, ammo, aid items and junk have sold for me. for aid I'v just been pricing stimpaks and radaway about 65% of it's projected value: much more than I'd be getting at a vendorbot, but low enough people are willing to pay.  
---
For plans, really any camp item seems to sell because people will just buy anything they're missing. Flamingos, metal boxes, shelves, etc.
---
For the love of god, unless you're specifically targeting lower level players, please don't waste anyone's time just throwing every gun they get off a dead super mutant into your machine. If I'm spending 15 caps to get to your camp, there's nothing worse than finding nothing but 8 non-legendary pipe pistols and 85 faschnacht masks
---
Your right, it is +250 damage resist while reloading.  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/USkmeqv.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/USkmeqv.jpg)  
---
And you can have two shot and anti armor.
---
Its definately not when you clear them out. When you first vendor at full caps puts adds overhead on the servers so i have my doubts about that. 
---
Looking at the patch notes:
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5hrHjCk5RTycypyr3ub4aQ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-april-9-2019
---
It states every 20 hours without stating other triggers.
---
As for the 160 scrip. My solution does that by default, but ugnoring that, yes i would prefer 160 just so that its a lesser pain in the ass.
---
Fishing....Fishing never changes.
---
My one is good purely on the anti armor [https://i.imgur.com/USkmeqv.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/USkmeqv.jpg)
---
Nothing like getting a good scope on the shit in your life.
---
They all do.
---
Honestly the best one i have so far is the one where it only lwts you eat vegetables. For somereaaon it still lets you canned meats and spoiled meats just not cooked/uncooked meat that is fresh
---
Yeah what's with the empty boxes?! My place is literally full to capacity with stuff, the potted plants from the atom store was the best purchase I've ever made!
---
In game terms... functionally... it means "always sneaking". It means "sneaking is the default", even when "not actively sneaking".
---
And didn't you tell me that it was weird to apply "real world" to this? That's exactly what you're doing.
---
I’m in the uk and I play solo week day mornings with no mic. I’m over 30. Psn same as my name on here. If you just want to be on my team as we both do our own things that’s cool with me
---
No more open PvP in adventure, so you can't even kill them to get them to leave the npcs trade window.
---
Happened to me yesterday with 2 pieces of wood armor.
---
I updated the original post to include your correction of 18,000 --&gt;17,500
---
tks.
---
I just think of it as the bullet splinters with the smaller shard hurting less
---
it was doable on all platforms but spread like wildfire on XB1. then PS4, both thanks to the centralized message hub probably. PC players were the last to get on it I think.
---
funnily enough, PS4 players duped mainly masks it seems
---
I don't think that is the answer.  Bind of pickup is so frustrating and bind on equip would be ok if the game started that way.  To do it now would tear the player base apart I think.
---
Honestly the best fix is for Bethesda to do better testing beforehand.  Most of these kinds of bugs and exploits could be fixed before they launch new updates if they did more internal testing or had a test server people could try things out.
---
I have a big pyramid camp with the concrete foundations and stairs as walls still (not possible to make anymore). I am really happy to have a unique camp that no-one is capable building anymore but I screwed it up by building a second floor inside.
---
The floors didn't want to attach at first so I used stairs to attach on the foundations on top and was then able to start building a floor. Great? At first it seemed so... Now everything attached are a support for each other so no structures can be moved or scrapped. I'm running out of budget now because of all the misplaced pieces.
---
Come see the 7th miracle of Appalachia, the Great pyramid of Twin Lakes, before it's too late folks.
---
I found all of them, except dense, VIA treasure maps.  Dense I purchased from another player.
---
Way to give it all away in one message...
---
Oh it is in mine too, but what I'm saying is its nice to have dupes of cards like that so you can make different builds whenever you want with cards readily available. Action boy/girl isnt a good perk for a heavy weapons especially since you dont use VATS so its nice that you can do certain builds on the fly. But for it to be 100% useful they need to change how they assign Special points.
---
Why they are limited to moving 1 point when you level up is fucking stupid. They need to take the MMO approach and have attribute points allocated on the fly and have a level cap with a "prestige" number like WoW and GW2
---
I totally agree with you but the whole ammo/damage thing in the game is messed up.  Take the 50cal machine gun, that thing should be by far the most powerful tradition projectile weapon in the game followed by the MG42 light machine gun.  Here's a comparison of the real life versions of the ammo:
---
50BMG/.50 Round, velocity - 3044-2895 ft/sec, energy **13,310-14895 ft/lbs** (50 Cal Machine Gun)
---
7.62mm/.308 Round, velocity - 3100-2510 ft/sec, energy **2668-2550 ft/lbs** (hunting rifle, MG42 Light Machine Gun)
---
45-70/.45 Round, velocity 1597-2275 ft/sec, energy 1699-3449 ft/lbs (lever action rifle, combat rifle)
---
5.56 Nato/5.56 Round, velocity 3260-2800 ft/sec, energy 1294-1238 ft/lbs (hand made, assault rifle)
---
10mm Auto/10mm Round, velocity 1290-1150 ft/sec, energy 649-676 ft/lbs (10mm pistol, SMG)
---
38 ACP/.38 Round, velocity 1150-1040 ft/sec, energy 338-312 ft/lbs (pipe weapons)
---
(ft/sec = feet per second, ft/lbs = foot pounds)
---
As you can see the damage the .50 round can do is amazing and makes all the other rounds pail in comparison.  The reason MG42 should also be more powerful is the amount of rounds it can belch out per second. The damage per second that rifle should be able to produce should put it pretty close to that of the .50 cal. 
---
I couldn't find much info on the 5mm as it was not a popular for use in the military. The real life mini gun uses 7.62 NATO and the civil war era Gatling gun was chambered in .308.  So both of those weapons in the game don't have a real life comparison however we do have the ammo if Bethesda would like to make them better reflect reality (I'm would not be a fan of that BTW).
---
Being able to walk through walls just by highlighting was a great build feature in 4 for sure. You can do that here with the replace function by selecting a doorway, it just takes a bit more steps.  It's faster just to get out of build mode and manually open the door though.
---
https://i.imgur.com/USkmeqv.jpg 
---
you are right, Two shot, crippling, which is just as good.
---
updated the original post to remove the reference to Chemist level 1
---
Tks for pointing out my error.
---
I just think of it as the bullet splinters with the smaller shard doing less damage and as a reason for it being in accurate
---
What platform are you on? Interested in event rewards, especially if they're Fasnacht related as I missed all of that...
---
Ah I'll keep it. I can make all the serums now, but I like having all the mutations with no negatives (other than brahmin, cats, dogs)
---
They all have negative effects.
---
Whether or not they are truly negative depends on your preference.
---
How is going afk griefing? Nowhere in the ToS does it say anywhere you aren't allowed to go afk. You realize people have lives outside of the game and the game isn't their number 1 priority right?
---
It only happens with wood and assaultron heads, as far as I know.
---
Sentinel and cavaliers armor pieces
---
We need event tracking in general! I want to be able to sign up for certain event notifications so i don't have to keep checking my map every 10 minutes.
---
I've got plenty treasure maps, so I'll do those. Tend to just get raider armour plans with them though, so it may be a while before I land lucky!
---
I just stand up front, whack her in the face, and take my lumps. It don't feel right pounding her butthole with a long-poled melee weapon.
---
Eat shit white supremacist
---
I just don’t understand how they can still be legendary without a prefix,... seems game breaking , Beth needs to refund scrib
---
Damn my dude you did some heavy research. That's another thing that bothers the hell out of me. The .50 Cal hunting rifle should definitely do more damage than the hardened hunting rifle but nope of course not
---
Added this line to the original. :)
---
I'm excited to see where this game will be in a year's time , will we have new locations to explore , will they push into other states 
---
As much as people hate on it (very valid arguements) I love it xD
---
You can find them RNG around one of the 3 armor benches through Top of the world/pleasant valley.
---
I think you can also buy them from the vendor bot at the bottom of Pleasant Valley ski resort
---
If on XB, I have the heavy arms plan
---
I'd like to see it raised to 160 per day, or multiples of that. This way we can get at least two shots at a three star per day. 100 to buy, resell the crappy for 40, returned to total of 100 for a second try.
---
not always, but uk players generally are placed in the uk servers
---
have met a lad from arizona,france, germany, but mainly uk . (don't generally meet anyone actually, but from time to time)
---
Max class freak and it isn't an issue. Think it's only 2 skill points too.
---
Whoops, I'm a dumbass.
---
I'm on 2 weeks paid severance from work, so I'm going to spend most of it playing FO76. Going to finish up the excavator armor quest today, then work on a secret project for my CAMP to help n00bs. I'm on Xbox, friend me if you want: JuicyAngryDad.
---
grab the destroyed cores from the computer you have to fix, they look the same as the mainframe cores you had to destroy just before.
---
There is also a couple of replacement cores laying around iirc but finding them all takes a while. 
---
You wont be able to repair them until you have a broken mainframe core in your inventory.
---
Explosive rounds don't make a difference on my hunting rifle. What does lower the durability is the parts installed on the rifle. The better the parts the lower the durability.
---
Do you know if two shot wears faster?
---
pretty confident they acknowledged it yesterday
---
&gt; this is a real AAA studio
---
What does that even *mean*?
---
I shouldn't tell you this because I hate this but...stealth boys are your answer. They're using vats to Insta kill. Using stealth boys makes it so they can't vats. Do that. Sprint up. Smack. Dead.
---
Right.  So why whenever anyone asks the question about which of the two levers people say Aae?
---
EATT ARE NOT YOUR ENEMY. JOIN US. AND REAP THE BENEFITS !
---
That's your go-to? 🤣 you must get upset when you are called a snowflake
---
This is the wrong subreddit for that. I got temp banned for speaking about pvp to a mod because my crew and i created a petition for Bethesda to fix pvp. When I posted it it was taken down and mod just temp banned
---
NOOOOO I'll give you a bloodied lever for it.
---
I'm not mad, I'm just disturbed
---
Ok changing 1 setting and not taking a workshop is too hard gotcha. You talk like killing them while afk like they are a victim? Why would you go afk at a workshop I’ll kill them afk or not idc personally. The only thing they are a victim of is their own choice to leave their character alone. 
---
Again you strawmanning me i have no problem if they contest i welcome it, im up for having a challenge if they can provide it but having the option to hunt people down and catch them off guard getting some junk is nice when so many players literally log out if they see you coming or just dont bother coming to defend their workshop. Which is mostly the case. Again it also helps you feel like a real raider/ robber because i want their steel and lead for my ammo :D.
---
both of those are pretty much junk anyway. I would say they should go straight to the recycle machine and that way you can at least recoup some of the script back.  Do that before you server hop and then you can still get the higher script value for the multiple stars
---
Epic
---
I wouldn't go that far.... LOL
---
I saw your other post and realized you were talking about a different event.
---
He's in the game. 
---
But he's a scorched, and just says "neeeeveeeer aloooooone".
---
Tse 10mm w/wr or an AAE Black Powder Rifle
---
&gt; dropped some caps 
---
Yeah they worked good till I ran out of them lol.
---
But the risk/reward doesn’t really balance out the cost of stealthboys, 
---
Would be different if u made more than 12 caps per head.
---
That's a whole lot of ammo
---
That is a terrible idea. It is an online game dude, it needs balance.
---
If that is the case, the TS prefix should consume twice the amount of ammo and break guns twice as fast :)
---
Ummmm.. ..
---
What the...
---
Only wood armor and assaultron heada are affected
---
Oh, I wasn’t really trying to do anything like that. Just thought I would discussed the big changes I noticed.
---
War, war never changes.
---
yep i already one shotted a SB with one that wasnt legendary. sneak perks etc. i cant imagine a bloody
---
I think it's related to how the game handles the player's stash info.  The stash data is tied to the player, not the camp, so the information 'floats' around where the player is.  If the player is away from the camp, the game can't read more than basic info about what's in the vending machine, unless the player is close enough to seed the information.
---
Not sure why proximity is needed, but obviously that's the way it is set up.
---
I think it's just bad or inefficient programming, but I think there may be other (or additional) reasons for this behavior that I hesitate to speculate about.
---
A classic XD
---
What a fantastic idea, the cost of flares would need to be significantly increased to avoid spam though, or a lengthy cooldown, once a day?
---
*invoking question emoji*
---
Many animals can learn to open simple locks too.
---
Well if the budget for blueprint was better, might have a better house. I move my camp often and in order to get at least a place-able base, I'\[m stuck with those crummy 1x1 with a set of stairs leading the the sky floor with no walls. YUK. but can't get my platform and crafting collection in a tiny budget.
---
maybe no caps. I dont even know if you can do that. But it was a bag full of goodies. stimpacks and what not.
---
My personal perspective and I spend most of my time in survival:
---
1 - Doesn't concern me as I care about murder and not camp destruction. I suppose indestructible turrets would be annoying but I've never been killed by one. That said, I could support your suggestion.
---
2 - I care more about murder than I do caps or junk as I hardly ever loot. Make finding a fight easier. I have to server hop at times to find someone to kill so more kills would equal more caps.
---
3 - I don't PVP in adventure so my opinion probably shouldn't count.
---
4 - A solid idea for survival.
---
5 - You can still kill people with free aim and everyone dies so fast now that awareness isn't a necessity. I wear weightless armor and run chameleon so you aren't VATsing me until one of us shoots anyway.
---
Ps4
---
I'm sorry that my expressing my enthusiasm and appreciation for the artistic beauty which diverse cultures can produce and celebrating those cultural differences is upsetting to you.
---
On Ps4 but happy hunting!
---
It's under Quest Items.
---
It requires a Damaged Mainframe Core (which you take from the computer that secures the door), Circuitry, and Steel.
---
Note that you can craft them at any Tinker Workbench, to speed up this process the next time.  Generally speaking, there should be enough Mainframe Cores scattered around the room to do the replacement as well, but it can be a very finicky and time-consuming process.  There's something undeniably Bethesda about having the final level include a crafting challenge, huh? 😋
---
Any bloodied or two shot weapons I have put up for sale have sold within a half hour, also marine armor mods seem to sell fast also.
---
Fair. Idk if there is a recipe for it and farming for them just to get a few caps seems super not worth. I only go on survival for the xp nowadays anyways. It was fun being a stealth shotgunner for a while though.
---
RIP framerate if this was on console.
---
nah a fix.  guess it doesn't work anyways.
---
This is going to put a damper on me firing 37 flares in a row just because I noticed I have a lot of flares.
---
The phiomias with stimberries
---
Exactly.
---
It should, something called like broken pro snap whatever, I have like 20 of them sitting in my misc and I can't give them to others XD
---
Glad I'm on pc

Welch train station.
---
Go up the stairs behind it.
---
There's a shack towards the top.
---
Always has a cat out front.
---
This is why i get plans i don't particularly like since i maybe could have use for them in some outside-the-box way.
---
I'd like to see the mutation serum reciepes return to her loot table, by the time I had my build dialed in to farm the queen regularly, they got removed from her loot.

I love the nocturnal flamer i got, i plan to use it to burn her shop down midnight tonight.
---
Agree this is what I’ve seen to has have had the AAE briefly and got rid as was crap. Maybe it’s because it’s good for PVP? But for me the TSE was better but maybe it’s just my build and style
---
Sweet, what's your username?
---
Go to Welch station. There's a set of stairs that leads up the hill, and they'll take you to a shack where murgle the ginger cat lives!
---
I don't know if the pods will give you the extra things.  But when I was near Dyer, there were the flowers blooming so I snagged a handful.  And ended up with the bonus.
---
I'm literally selling 3 stars to the vendor right now.. Bethesda, You give me the ability to sell 1000 scrip but now I'm so overencumbered I can't do anything so I have to sell my (could be scrip) to the vendor to be able to play...i have a feeling I will be playing less with the 150 scrip per day thing. Make it cap so we can only spend 1000 per day but at least let us sell them back! All I got was 3 star berserkers, exterminators and junkies... Straight garbage... I'd rather turn it to scrip but I cant becuase at almost 20lb ea. I still have 8 left =160 lbs of garbage weighing me down
---
I am ps4. I’d be willing to trade anything I have that you might need for some nice armor and/or provide crafting materials for you. Might need to hunt down some more leather first. My PSN is the same as my reddit name. 
---
And I just finished that quest line last night. Maybe I’ll give that a go since I have that amulet thing that’s supposed to boost all the mistress of mystery stuff.
---
A Japanese guy whose house I visited had an INCREDIBLE home that made me scrap parts of mine lol.
---
&gt; Let's be honest, nobody is using script for anything other than Three Stars.
---
Many people recommend going for 2 stars, claiming the 3rd star is mostly worthless.
---
This, I have to spend like ten minutes every time I get to my camp switching from my combat/exploring perk loadout to my crafting loadout, and then put it all back together as I leave.
---
It was probably Hand Banana.
---
Bloodied stealth sniper is super fun in pvp. I gotta say best fun I’ve had was with my stealth sniper.
---
Chameleon has no negative effects.
---
"If they see me I die. If they dont, they die"
---
Yeah, camps should have the old destructable rules in survival mode, I was surprised they implemented it into both modes...
---
They've been adding new weapons, enemies, and locations since March. Give the game time, the road map looks great. Can't wait to see what else they have to add
---
sucks for the doenvotes bud, but i think 15 is the cap. me and buddy where stuck at the same count till we spent them. good luck out there
---
Sounds like a bug (might be old, I'm not surprised I've never heard of it, seems like a pretty...specific...combination of events).
---
I'd give it a bug report on the Bethesda site and keep your fingers crossed.
---
Auto handmade
---
I can confirm that wood armor loses stars and scout armor does not
---
Yea, I agree with that. She's obviously cognitive enough to offer something for trade, rather than grunting and breathing heavily into my ear (kinda hot btw).

This gave me an idea for an OCD inducing camp!
---
would kill my pc as well.

there were tears. but they were of laughter. my wife and I got a kick out of the whole thing.

...Huh. I guess I need to buy Ark.
---
If this was a single player game, I'd totally agree that mods would make atom shop items useless.  But you can't show off all that modded goodness to other players (unless you can coordinate everyone using the same mods).  If you want to show off your build, you'll need to build with things other people can see.
---
Well luckily that word combo wasn't in the title
---
My naming may be wrong. It is the one by the Poseidon Energy plant that produces 8 cores/hr ? I built a generator to power that one cause it takes 100 energy.
---
So fun lol
---
I also tried to optimize my buying power by focusing on 3* armor, and am quite pleased with the results. The drops were good enough to make me a little sad for all the grinding Ive done to get the mediocre gear I have 😭😭
---
Nah. Serverwide notif and a map marker you can ft to.
---
lol My work here is done...wait until you meet Peter Ennis.
---
lol
---
Is this real?
---
Hi, and thanks for the report! This is a known issue and we're currently looking into a fix for a future update. I don't have a timeframe for this just yet but will let you know once I have any new information.
---
The purveyor is a very nice old lady, she knows exactly what I don’t have. Suppressors, Junkies, hunters, nocturnal, you name it, she gave them to me. 
---
Turned around and went back to WS, a glowing ghoul dropped a bloodied ff gatling plasma. Another dropped a 3 star raider’s sentinel armor piece. Boring ghouls as usual.
---
Speed demon may seem bad but honestly I haven't noticed the hunger or thirst added that much.
---
I’m not worried about losing my mutations, I don’t want to lose my rads!
---
YEAH WE FUCKING GET IT, HOW MANY GOD DAMN POST DO WE NEED ABOUT THIS.
---
Logically this is never going to happen, Photos are taken as screenshots and this would allow people to edit such photos and put big black dicks or swastikas everywhere. This is unreasonable, this won't happen. Please stop posting it.
---
It happens a lot actually. If you claim a workshop you are likely to be hunted by someone that enjoys pvp action. I would recommend placing a lot of turrets around as a deterrent. That may not stop them but at least they will have to think about it before they attack you. I usually place all my turrets first just to be ready. And it never hurts to have a teammate or two for added protection.
---
Like the body parts, helm, chest,arms, legs. Are useless drops. There's a terminal in Tagerty's quarters that gives you the plans, you just have to finish the BOS quest line, much like the X01 plans in the Enclave bunker.

It's mentioned in other comments, but I wanted to note that this is currently a known issue with the Purveyor. She's intended to give you items that are as close to your character's current level as possible so that they're immediately usable.

We're planning to address this with a future update, but I don't have date to share for that just yet. Will let you know once I have an update!

Great! Thank you I appreciate your help!
---
There can be 4 stars if u put a mod on that increases damage against scorched
---
So I've been doing this for months, and I had never been raided and robbed of my workshop until last night.  They didn't get any cores made up to that point because I just took them before giving up and running (I'm not even close to being able to take on even the weakest pvp build - just not spec'd or armed for it), but they get the benefit of my work from that point forward.  They get the whole place without spending the mats to build anything like resource collectors, wiring, turrets, etc.
---
Long story short, it's insanely frustrating when it finally happens, but it doesn't seem to be common.
---
I really really want duel wielding , and shields. 
---
Shields would really change up pvp.
---
Does this increase scrip value?
---
That makes sense I think that's what I did. Thank you.
---
That ain’t too shabby.
---
Alright, fine. Survival needs some work.
---
But you're acting like not being able to murder people in Adventure mode is just absolutely ruining the game for you. Like...that mode is not for you. Survival is. Bitch about the problems with Survival, don't act like the game devs hate you. Clearly the majority of players wanted these changes.
---
I mean halfway through that stupid ass wall of text you basically said "There's no point to shooting someone in Survival because they'll shoot back" like...duh? That's the fucking point?
---
And on workshops, you realize you can just waltz in and claim it? Nothing's stopping you. If the current owner isn't there actively defending it, there's no reason why you should feel the need to blow their brains out across the map. If a dude has Grafton Steel, just take it, there's no need to murder him while he's chilling in Watoga or something.
---
And why should CAMPs be destructible in Adventure? I agree that should be an option in Survival, but there's no fucking reason for it in Adventure. And on top of that, you gain *nothing* from destroying camps anyway. You wanna bitch about "oh bounties don't even cover the cost of the ammo I used" like I've been playing since beta and CAMPs have never given you caps. (Source: I used to annihilate Whitespring Golf Club CAMPs and didn't earn shit.)
---
Survival needs work. That's fair. But you're just bitching about not being able to grief people who want nothing to do with PvP. You wanna be the villain so bad. Newsflash, asshole: people don't wanna deal with villains. You have a game mode for that shit, but it sounds like you got your ass handed to you over and over so you just wanna boost your ego harassing random people who just wanna build shit or explore.
---
🤣🤣🤣👍

Im not sure but worth a look

They added the plans to the terminal like patch 3 or 4??

So are are the repair perk cards useless now?
---
I'd be okay with it if they decreased the accuracy even more than it already does. Make it to where at like 20 meters or more you get a low hit box and at high range basically nothing. That way it's still super powerful at close range but people could still counter by keeping a distance
---
I got shite
---
20 meters is 21.87 yards
---
Wow... this is fuckin bull shit. I got a piece of unyielding sentinel wood armor too.
---
There’s a dead cat named Cheswick upstairs at Wixon Farm. That counted for me.
---
A supermutant at spruce knob dropped a combat rifle for me earlier this week. Anti armor explosive reduced weight. 
---
I thought god rolls didn’t exist till now and I’m over 800 hours played.
---
haha
---
I think we should start a new tag for Purveyor Rolls. 
---
Showcase tour purveyor rolls!
---
[ROLL]
---
Then could I perhaps purchase that from you?
---
Totally agree.
---
I'm like so frustrated. Been treading water for a few weeks, just wondering when Ill have enough time to benefit from it. Then finely, first time out - 5-10 minutes in, someone ruins it, I can't build THAT many fusion generators. Only reason why I was able to ruin his fun was because I destroyed my generator. He left after I destroyed it. Fuggin a'hole.
---
Two gamma guns, three 10 mm pistols, two fat mans, black powder pistol, black powder rifle, and a quad gauss. 
---
Fuck me.
---
I know. But I don’t always have it equipped. Only when I need to lose some rads.
---
It doesnt take that long to fix, you just get out of the build menu then go back in and its fixed instantly lol
---
Now this is a u n i q u e
---
You're just parroting what you've been told to think is right. Gender is the social application of recognised biological reality. 
---
Saying that you can switch between, be none of or as many 'genders' as you want IS pseudoscience. It has no basis in objective reality. 
---
Why are we pandering to mental illness? These people need help, not encouragement, and I mean that in the nicest possible way. You're not addressing an underlying psychological issue by just enabling this lunacy.
---
I heard it does not add an additional * anymore
---
That's what I figure. Having every item  priced ridiculously is absurd of course but who am I but a tempter of fate when I put my perfectly preserved pie up for 3kc.
---
That's honestly the real predicament with it. They need to buff all of the other legendary's. The creature specific's should bottomline do double damage to those creatures. 30% just isn't substantial enough to be worth using. Even 50% would be much more attractive
---
Anyone wishing to find out what the hype is about please feel free to join EATT!

I don’t always have that equipped though, that’s the thing.
---
Catching a frog is a time-honored Pioneer Scout tradition! Though it does seem like frogs have gotten a bit bigger in recent years than they used to be...
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
ok , got you, was REALLY hopeing to get upgades. I have found 0 mods for this armour
---
thank you.
---
They had to nerf it because of the dupers. The game wasn’t designed to have everyone’s grandma walking around with a TSE one shotting everyone and everything. Dumbass dupers ruined the game’s balance so Bethesda had no choice.
---
Your fault.
---
SOLUTION: Farm a nuke zone for flora with perk cards on. Get all the stable flux you can and make your own cores while you have scientist and super duper on and make your own! 
---
1-2 trips should net you at least enough materials to build a few. Do it a few times or weekly with friends and you’ll have enough flux to make a ton of them plus more!
---
My ps4 name is useraffel
---
1. Harpers Ferry. The building with the hole in the wall in front of you when you spawn in has display cases that spawn plans. One on each floor.
---
2. Camp Venture. The central part where the scorched are. Each building has a plan spawn. Look on the rusty metal shelves.
---
This is an issue with all combat armor. My weightless piece are 2.7 and the chest is like 6.3lbs still. Unmodded weightless, but before they were lighter something like under a pound. I remember them being that way in my stash. At some point that changed to the normal weight and the weightless part isn't applied it seems.
---
???? You are literally the first person I have heard of who runs with mutations but doesn't always have starched genes equipped. You're literally risking losing a mutation when you fast travel to another player's camp by not having it equipped. That's not their fault
---
Wow well done
---
Because the detailed item info is tied to that location.
---
Think of it this way - you carry around all your stuff (even if it's in the stash, just go with it).  All the detailed bits and bytes are in your pocket, so to see what is there, someone has to be standing next to you to sett them.
---
You can list items for sale in the vendor, just like on craigslist, but you can only list the item's name.
---
If you want to 'kick the tires' so to speak, you have to have the items in the same room as you.  You can't test drive a car that's in another state after all.
---
The vendors have the items there with them, so you can inspect them.  If the player is standing near the vending machine, he's there to 'show you' all the details.  If he's across the state, you can't actually inspect the item.
---
The hard part to answer is 'why is it like that?'.  I can't tell you that, just know that this is the way it is for now.  I'm sure they're aware of the problem, but coming up with a solution that doesn't cause a lot of other problems might take some work.
---
Chameleon doesnt
---
Thank you so much for this info! The problem has been nightmarish waiting for some type of patch haha.   
---
Cya on the field soldier!
---
I got zippo
---
I got a 3* suppressor’s shovel!  It’s hilarious and does 247 damage.
---
My sniper is a glass cannon. Although I have some of the best rifles money can buy, I still find it difficult to one shot people in pvp.
---
Usually two or 3 non crits to get someone down, which isn’t hard, u can hit them twice before they know wtf is going on. 
---
I’m thinking maybe instigating instead of bloodied tho, what u think?
---
Thanks, I'll try it. Ive only really been in a nuke zone once so I don't really know other methods.
---
Plus...free scrip exchange items! :P  Though really, if a particularly good low-level items drops, it could be worth a fair bit of coin to the right buyer.
---
Given the state of AAA studios?  Not a whole lot.
---
Doesn't it limit the types of armor you can wear?
---
Atlas has the same poo.
---
No lol
---
 I one shot quite a few muties with My Instigating Lever Action. I've even nerfed it a bit to play with an Auto Handmade. I'm pretty sure it tops both of them.
---
 So its in the 120 range now and 240 will kill lots of things. Some Stealth and many things go down in one shot.
---
3 star instigating lever action.
---
A real gun firing a duplex (two bullet) round has roughly the same muzzle energy combined between the two as a single projectile round (because of chamber pressure constraints) but it's split between the two projectiles. The damage increase of a duplex round comes from having two wound channels, but since the kinetic energy of each bullet is half (or less because of their inferior ballistic coefficient compared to a single longer projectile) the size of each wound cavity would be smaller. So in the real world damage would not be double. It would be about the same from an impact energy standpoint, but with two wound channels there would be more blood loss. If they wanted to make two-shot more realistic it would apply zero damage increase but a "target bleeds for 100% damage over 10 seconds" effect and it would also reduce armor penetration by 50% because two lighter projectiles are half as good at armor penetration.
---
That's irrelevant though because realism isn't why they changed it. It was changed for balance reasons, so the best argument would be to compare it to other legendary combos and argue if it doesn't have equal effect on target.
---
Although I like my bleeding effect idea because there's not enough of that kind of effect in the game and with the reduced armor pen and the existence of auto stim armor it would balance pretty well I think.
---
Lol worst part is I can't edit the title 😅
---
Or push X on PS4 (not sure on Xbox or PC), that usually works for me.
---
Instigating is super hard to use for PvP. Hardly anyone ever runs with max health due to rads alone on top of everything else. Bloodied with max stealth perks should do it. I think I saw someone get like a 6.5x or so damage boost from all them while in sneak. If anything pop some psycho before
---
 Get the perks for repairing to 200%. Any exploder will wear out fast.
---
They fucked up releasing this game the way they did, they apologized and handled everything as professionally as possible.. versus a company like Bioware who has handled most things unprofessionally.
---
Yeah, they made the effects non-legendary, but I think it still leaves 4* if you had one pre-patch.
---
How many goes did you take?
---
Mole rats at fort defiance have done that to me too
---
Have a big friends list? That causes the game to hitch a bit, but also have any really memory intrusive applications running in the background?
---
I really wish this was an actual item
---
I have only six luck. Three for bloody mess, and three for better criticals. I only use starch genes to get rid of extra rads every once in a while.
---
Those do drop from the SBQ and the regular SB's
---
I have some .50 cal souvenirs sitting on my shelf, they really make 308 look like high schoolers and 10mm are babies.
---
This shouldn't happen to often.   Do you even have to claim the workshop?  Can't you just power up the fusion core generator and then keep coming back every once and awhile
---
Plague walker doesn't have a direct negative. It just requires you to have a disease for it to work. I have most of the serums at my shop for 300 c each, But won't be on until later tonight. Psn: mike_4570 if you're interested
---
If its like most cats, you don't actively join it.  It just shows up and claims you.
---
(not OP)
---
The interface is clunky at best.  Some of us use sneak builds, and the PA doesn't go well with that.  And personally I hate the THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP of running around in the stuff.
---
I *have* every (basic) power armor at max level.  I use *one* for SBQ and occasional nuke zone stuff.  But I can't play in the stuff normally, it's just too...noisy.
---
I wish there was an item that could summon a swarm of bloat flies
---
Some good tips in the comments. Just want to add I sell a lot of “rare” craftable weapons at low prices because they don’t take much to make once you have the plans. Such as level 50 Fixer, sheepsquatch staffs and clubs with all mods, and now 3* legendaries the purveyor. 
---
Same with “rare” plans. They sell like hot cakes. Look up the tnt dome key quests on YouTube and spend the time to get these keys once. Once you have them, learn where the 3 available ones are and make them a pit stop every day. You can sell them for a decent amount each and they go fast. 
---
Also, this is kinda shitty, but go to grafton station and server hop multiple times, each time buying the BoS combat armor plans. They’re under 100c for each the arms, legs, and chest. But I swear players will buy them for 500-1k each. It’s not super common knowledge that they’re buyable now for cheap so that’s something to take advantage of.
---
How do you drop caps?
---
I did as well many moons ago. Possibly even last year.
---
Oh thats a good question. Possible to power it up after completing the power plant event?? Then you dont need to claim?
---
I've been there 5 times now and never found him.
---
For the people comparing it to other modifiers like anti ghoul/robots/whatever. Sure it's similar, but those don't have a huge accuracy penalty.
---
I say increase the damage some, or increase the accuracy some. That would be more balanced. I have a few shotguns with two shot that are absolutely useless because of the accuracy penalty. Even with exploding, they're awful. I'd trade all of my two shot gear for stuff that didn't have accuracy penalties.
---
I got a vamp, 50% limb damage, 50 damage resist while aiming gatling gun. And a quad, explosive combat rifle.
---
Nice! I just had a ghoul drop a beserkers bashing extra aim dragon. God roll if you're a naked riflebash build.
---
I had a pre-patched 4* Machete, it was reduced back down to 3*.
---
huh?
---
There are two more tiers of legendary item modifications listed in the files, but they aren't implemented at all yet.
---
Faster reload is even better for the poon.
---
Orbital strike beacons don't need pvp to damage someone's camp. ;)
---
10, i also got a bunch of other intresting stuflike a quad single Revolver and a quad lever so im to disappointed
---
i like this. im one of those "plays alot" players, today i ran out of cap and scrip allowance within my first hour and there isnt even any point to me grinding more legendary gear because i already have my scrip allowance for when the reset comes. ive grinded all the possum badges to the point where all thats left is bugged ones, i was really hoping with the vendor id be able to grind with more purpose. however the limitations at the moment make this addition of content rather lackluster as an endgame player. though i will say that i enjoy it. i had terrible luck with melee 3 stars before she came along. so while im greatful im also an addict and need my scrip fix, even it just trickles in slowly every hour.
---
Go play call of duty then you don't have to worry about spending any time farming
---
No. Craftable fusion generators are just generators. The 3 powerplants a have fusion core "generators" that can produce 8 cores an hour, but require 100 power.
---
It's easier to just craft a fusion generator and attach it to the core "generator", than to run through the powering up events for the power plants.
---
Okay, but it's literally your own fault for not running starched genes and losing mutation(s). Any person with a brain runs starched genes permanently when they have mutations they don't want to lose. Don't come here bitching about losing a mutation when it was literally your own fault 🤦🏻‍♀️
---
No perk cards allow you Too repair farther than kits tbh kits are kinda useless you get them from queen fights but it's way better to repair it myself than too use a kit
---
I will buy any unknown CAMP plans that are 150c or less. And any recipes that are like 30c or less.
---
Problem is most people only sell the stuff I already know. :(
---
im not sure if different servers have ppl from different places, im from brazil and I've seen maybe 4 people total from brazil, i meet  mostly ppl from the usa, met some from sweden, uk, germany.
---
would be interesting to know how they find servers for us to play in
---
On my main I sell legendaries, rare clothing, stims, plans, chems, mods, and ammo.
---
On my mule it's all legendaries.
---
I remember a guy dirty talking bloated glowing ones. When he heard me laugh he told me it’s been lonely since he left the vault and these ghouls are looking thicc af. I gotta say I don’t disagree with him
---
What files? Link?
---
Twelve days ago you made this comment:
---
Non binary gender fluid demi trans unicorn mutant. Don't you dare assume xe's gender, bigots. #cortez2020
---
You knew exactly what it meant, so why act like you didn't know 12  days later? And that comment was straight off the top bigotry. Is that what you are? Why bring any of that into a sub about a video game?
---
I like your idea! I'd argue it's less effective than its counterparts because of the insane accuracy penalty. It needs one, but not to the point that a shotgun will miss even if the barrel is right against a mirelurk queen.
---
I gave up taking workshops, I can farm twice as much if not more in the same hour a workshop is producing. 
---
Best place is White Springs! Roll out with one or two friends and have at it! 
---
Tips: 
---
High radiation fluids and hardened mass don’t expire. HOWEVER hardened mass goes into your junk so DON’T press Y to “scrap all”!!! 
---
This is all farmed fighting ghouls, scorch and other things in nuke zone. Don’t overlook any enemy, all you need is one or two shots in before it dies and you’re good! 
---
I’d suggest getting a ton of this first before getting the flora which expires, besides getting flora is pretty much the easiest thing to get in nuke zones. 
---
Cobalt (blue) is somewhat rare and harder to farm. 
---
Once you get all the flora you can craft stable flux at chem bench then make cores!
---
Ok, I'll need explanation then. Isn't there legendary armor that has, as one of the attributes, something that talks about not counting against the chameleon mutation? I thought that would make that armor null and void if you were running that mutation?
---
I hate how small the jars are
---
According to what data miners said, the vendors don't account for anything above 3 stars (there's no part of the code that recognizes 4+ stars when it comes to scrapping).
---
Also it’s 250 DR while reloading
---
lol use the shishkebab to cook the leathers and you have a nice pile of snacks
---
Don't do it at Poseidon, it's a magnet for pvp'ers .. use one of the other two. I farm at thunder mountain, I probably would go hours without anyone showing up, no one seems to like the area. It does happen, I had some douche show up and take it, but that's ok, I have blueprinted a basic setup, generator, turrets, harvesters, water pumps, if someone shows up, I just switch worlds.
---
Just have a. simple workshop, blueprint it. I can reset up in under 5 mins, no sweat. Don;'t worry about it, just lock the fusion generation. I also sit on top of the fusion generation with my alt lower character, so I grab the cores as soon as they produced and if they kill me they get fewer caps
---
With 4 pieces of unyielding, my bloodied meat hook does about 2700. With a chameleon 5th piece and sneaking it does 8000
---
I use the kits from the Queen to repair my weapon when I'm doing a silo run. Outside of that I repair everything to 200%.
---
You can put on whatever armor. The mutation only works if you use weightless armor or are naked. But its not restrictive therefore theres 0 negative
---
Yeah.  I find that you also need to use the same process for the “nothing is selected” error and sometimes when you get a object intersection error.  
---
Exit out of build and go back in has become my go to fix when building.  
---
Though, OP has a point that the bugs should be fixed.   The fact that there is a simple workaround probably pushes these bugs to the bottom of the pile.  
---
Personally, I want them to fix the bugs causing crashes first.   I have been selling serums at my shop and was low on hardened mass and was there was a Nuke event.  I crashed after taking out just a few of the glowing ones.  Whats worse is crashing just after spending about an hour launching a Nuke...    had that happen too... 
---
So while I agree that the build glitches need to get fixed.  I’m guessing that they won’t be for a while until they can make everything more stable.
---
Could just kill the big robots at white springs and take those cores also good experience.
---
Or at least make it faction-specific like the vendor currency cap is. What *is* the refresh time btw? I used up the 500 yesterday morning and it was still used up this morning. Not quite 24 hours since I used it up, but I would've assumed a nightly reset of some sort.
---
It pisses me off when people say stuff with two primary prefixes. It just irks me.
---
It’s like you know they’re lying
---
I did 18  x 100 ranged. But good to know it can drop some good kit so will try another 4 goes across characters again today
---
I couldn't figure out how to repair it myself. It only gave me the option of repair kits. Unless I was doing something wrong.
---
He’s on the 2nd floor of the house, lying next to corpse.
---
My friend list is really small, around 20 maybe...and for aplicattions, i don't think so...maybe some programs (like nzxt cam, icue and rgb fusion)
---
You need a full set of weightless legendary armour to offset it, or a single piece of chameleon armour.
---
Ahhh, ok. Many thanks.
---
Over repairing no longer grants a damage bonus (apparently that was a bug).  It does allow you to use the item longer before it breaks, which can be very helpful on long fights like the SBQ.  But as of right now, that's the only benefit.
---
Yeh maybe I will revisit my perks and see if there’s anything I can tweak.
---
I put a post out to this effect last night..I did 1150 scrip on 3 star armour only and out of all I got..I got 7 top quality pieces, a mixture of forest sentinel, Cavalier bolstering, urban and Sentinel unyielding. I was very very happy as I have my end game weapons in both melee and heavy..it's just a case of reassembling my build and getting stackable forest or scout armor with stackable rad resistance
---
Okay. I must have been doing something wrong. I was at my camp and when I tried to repair a gun, it kept going to the repair kits.
---
I keep a quad tesla with an automatic mod for clearing out trash mobs In a pinch. I would love a quad + anything else tbh.
---
Don't take poseidon, it seems to get the most traffic.
---
I usually take thunder mountain, it seems to draw less attention. Don't build elaborate structures, just a generator and a few turrets to protect it.
---
Don't leave crouch during defense events for any reason. Lots of asshats try to take advantage of that.
---
Keep an eye on the server, if someone else has held a workshop for a while, odds are you're safe to take one.
---
PS it’s a dam long walk at lvl 2 to Berkeley - lol
---
Can't fast travel when talking health damage
---
I mean, if you're the same guy.. do you remember skins on the original Xbox?
---
I have one of those as well, haha. Pretty much all my duplicate recipes go in there, clothes, and I recently started putting duplicate teddy bears.
---
And ammo.
---
Can even get people to take .38 or 10mm ammo for free. :(
---
try selling some scrap steel....
---
If you are looking for good items, look for people selling large amounts of weapons and armor and a decent ratio of both. However, prices will be market value. I have roughly 60 legendary items on my vender character.
---
If you want a steal of a deal look to smaller sellers. Typically they have not been on the Reddit trading subs and don't have an idea of current market value. I have found some very nice pieces for resale this way. However, stock is smaller so you jump around a lot, wasting caps, and maybe not finding a thing.
---
You can only sell items that can’t be bulked like titanium, nuclear waste, ballistic fiber, gold, circuits and more. Otherwise it has to be bulked...
---
I’m pretty sure this is the case, could be wrong...
---
Yeah exactly. Which isn’t always convenient. I’m sure this will be fixed at some point
---
That's motorcycles.
---
They fixed it. Lowest .50 = hardened .308 now I believe. It was in the patch notes
---
I'm ready
---
I just call her the moleminers daughter and it makes me giggle.
---
I gathered a ton of them at Camden Park.
---
Go to camp. Slot in chemist, science, ammosmith, super duper. Maybe weapon artisan or power smith.
---
Go kill things. Forget to change back. Wonder why things aren't dying as fast.
---
Just south of Top of the World along the highway (east side of the road) there's a large bill board.  There's always a clowder of cats there (and some junk and other things to pick up). If you make it to 98 NAR Regional you've gone too far.
---
That's a good idea with the alt, I may start doing that.
---
I know it isn't, but it could be as it's more than that, in fallouts you effect the world around you and it doesn't just reset when you log off and log back in, in 76 you don't, people are disappointed because they expected a fallout game and it isn't, for example, like I said you don't effect the world around you. That's something that was naturally expected from a fallout game, not consciously until realising it was a feature that's there.
---
People were disappointed because they expected a different game. Which is on players for automatically expecting it to be, which yes, isn't thinking but it's more that people didn't know they'd have to, it's called fallout and watching trailers etc never emphasized that it was to be an entirely different type of game. So on that part it's Bethesda a little. Most of all though it's just one of those things that people shouldn't still be upset about
---
From what I've seen Urban Scout Armor and maybe Pipe Revolvers?
---
Stuck with it. You can change your character's appearance at any time, even gender, so they probably dont see it as a big deal :/ but they should have made it clear somewhere only one gender can use it
---
that has nothing to do with any of what I just said
---
"go play CoD" is not a suitable response to "hey, you know that gun you spent months farming because our rng is on par with Korean mmos? well, it's gone now because we can't code proper servers, nor can we restore it. oopsies!"
---
They've discovered the true purpose of Fallout 76.
---
Ending the Scorched threat? Nah man, gotta build the best house.
---
You have to press a few buttons to get to the point to repair as before. It’s kinda awkward. Not on right now but from memory I think you inspect it at the work bench then you press x? It says the options on the bottom
---
Yeah but if we apply real world damage to everything we'd also have to apply real word weight for it to balance, and people would lose their shit if their .50 cal MG weighed 85 pounds and had horrible accuracy and spread unless it was emplaced (we don't have prone so not sure how they'd do that) or used in power armor (they'd have to make it drain AP/fusion core while firing to provide "steady" effect though, with AP depletion resulting in a huge spread increase), even if it were 10 times as powerful as a handmade rifle.
---
I think it would be a cool if they did it that way though because it would give heavy guns a whole other life and purpose.
---
A 50 round box of .45 is heavy we don't need realism we'd all run out of ammo because we can't carry it. Shit even 25 rounds 12-gauge is heavy in the pouch when you first start shooting skeet.
---
That wouldn't be possible due to this game being online, correct?
---
 nope I've fast traveled into many a situations where I was trapped in close quarters and really would have been quite mad had I been murdered and had my shit stole. that is griefing.
---
That makes sense. I always knew you had to bulk so I never tried. With Player Vending not having to be bulked I thought something may have changed.
---
You're correct. Some items you have to bulk, others you don't. It's always been like this
---
Nice job. Never thought of tent in a building.
---
I’m fine with the 150 cap but I wish I could oversell items to get the last 1 scrip. If I want to sell a 1 star legendary to get that odd bit of scrip I should be able to. It’s ok purveyor, keep the change.
---
I want this mod so bad. Much better ammo economy, and superior range. Plus, raining heavy incinerator fireballs with screen stagger was almost the pinnacle of what i hoped for heavy weapons.
---
At least for me hardened mass does not scrap with the scrap all function. It must be manually scrapped.
---
Just have it on a timer that limits you to one every so often.
---
You can't bulk black titanium, and you could always sell it.  Same with screws, gold, silver, etc.
---
I think the game should reward people for people who *don't* choose to play straight up murder machines.  I think it's a good thing that they aren't passive.  It gives a gameplay advantage to sneaky thiefy characters that the murder-hobos just don't have.
---
I price my stuff way below market and I’m sure people buy stuff and resell it from me...lol it’s all good though! 
---
I’ve found some great deals around the wasteland for sure and when I do I just buy more to show some appreciation to that player!
---
Shit, you're right.  I'm better than this.  Dammit.
---
You can’t bulk black titanium. Anything that can’t be bulked can be sold as is. Fiber optics, gold, silver, etc.
---
it would default to using a repair kit if you were missing a component to do a workshop repair. Look at the prompts to make sure you are selecting workshop repair also.
---
The Podcast is wonderful. You did such a good job Ken.
---
Canvas bags yet to come out, lawsuit probably went no where and was dropped
---
Well my issue is this:
---
I wanna live in a crappy old warehouse.
---
I can build a teeny tiny little box, and call it a warehouse.
---
or I can build something the size of an actual warehouse.
---
So I build a warehouse sized building... only to find that the budget is so tiny that after walls and doors and stairs... I have little left for decoration.
---
So, we're saying my only option is to build the standard... "1 floor, supported by stairs, crammed full o' crap, 6 purifiers outside" CAMP?
---
Bethesda needs to drop the cost on the decoration stuff... the shelves and boxes and chairs and desks and shit.
---
Yeah and you wouldn't be able to fire it unless you were prone lol.
---
The interface has changed slightly.  Just read ALL of the options when you're on the Repair screen.  "Workbench Repair" should be one of your choices.
---
Canvas bags are still being manufactured, set to be shipped to those who filed the ticket in june or july i think.
---
I dont kniw anything about the lawsuits because honestly i expect nothing to come from them angway.
---
The game has improved a great deal but still has some problems. I personally am having fun with it but some people are never happy.
---
I’m not the one that kicks puppies to get all four inches rock hard.
---
Thank you Scarlett! :)
---
You can make a ticket and ask support, I've seen them do refunds for accidental purchases before.
---
My favorite thing to do at my friends camp is put nipples on all of his vault boy cardboard cutouts by means of the "." steel sign letter.
---
MURGLE!
---
Ultracite gatling lasers too.
---
I'm not knocking the game , just putting out a few basic ideas that I think would make the game a bit better xD
---
More variety in the game just makes it better , everyone can fight their way , I'm just excited for the future of Appalachia
---
Last night I needed to clear some space in my stash so I sold some bulked junk to the Grafton vendor I also had in my inventory raw concrete/leather and rubber  and it didn't appear in the inventory to sell to the vendor.
---
Finally! Finally not a silly hater. I just feel you man! :)
---
Even a robot version haha
---
Can you sell non bulked items say wood or steel at your own camp? Never tried it and also never looked so maybe that’s the difference?
---
**9.5 Patch Notes**
---
*- Removed 50% of Legendary effects from Legendary Vendor as it was performing too well.*
---
*- Increased prices by 300%*
---
*- Reduced scrip gained from selling Legendary weapons by 90%.*
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
yeah, i myself imagined her as being very busy behind the counter. constantly tinkering with the items, as if shes the one that applies the legendary effects. maybe even barely acknowledging the player, simply glancing over to trade and then going back to tinkering and hammering on a power armor helmet or a minigun. her "dialogue" could be incoherrent grunts to the items, as if they are having a conversation, her and the item deciding what effects it wants.
---
Well I guess you could make it possible by removing the transparent object for other players. Making them being able to walk through it once selected as well. 
---
But I ain’t no programmer haha
---
Thanks for confirming.
---
Price of doing business, have to keep the vending area clean and free of radiation.
---
An apt description of my sex life...
---
Am I crazy, or is this a super-duper-obvious bug that even the most casual testing would have immediately revealed?
---
Notice me senpei, notice me
---
Thanks. I didn't play it for over 3 months, so I'm a little rusty.
---
Beards would be Awesome
---
It use to I guess, or players just repeatedly pressed the scrap function...lol
---
First thing I do before scraping anything is dump the stuff I don’t want scraped in my stash or before I might get killed...lol
---
I was able to load non-bulked Junk in the vending machine.
---
Yeah I'm 95% sure I have some of the bulkable unbulked junk in my vending machines. Can't check for sure atm
---
Thanks, that's exactly what I was wanting to know.
---
To each their own. I sell at market for most things. So a useful 1* weapon is typically around 1k caps (less than 30 minutes of game time to earn). Some weapons get a slight premium on value because they are popular bases weapons. For example I have a lvl 50 1* bloodied Grognak's axe listed at 1500 caps.
---
I got some solid ap refresh weapon weight reduction armor and a bloodied Explosive minigun. Course I don’t run a bloodied build on my heavy but it’s still a great drop
---
Read my mind.
---
This is interesting to me as I haven't thought of doing that. My camp is near Poseidon so I usually check the fusion core producer if someone has the workshop claimed to see if they locked it or not, many times its producing and unlocked so I will go chameleon, jump on top of it and just harvest as it produces.
---
Search for "duplex rounds". They work and are safe... but just not very accurate or effective enough to be worth it.
---
“all the detail would melt your gpu”
---
anyone who unironically talks like this... good grief
---
Ok... so I’m guessing players can do it on their own but selling to vendors the majority of junk needs to be bulked. (Unless there was a change?)
---
It's a pity all these "fixes" "tweaks" and "corrections" aren't only applied to the Battle Royale Mode (Dunno why they called it Survival, but you do you, Bethesda)
---
Let Adventure Mode be goofy, overpowered, and fun as Fallout was meant to be.
---
You had me at "Need more beards"
---
I want people to see my camp. I spent a lot of time on it. Just wish they'd close the door.
---
FO76 is not a ARPG, it's a survival game like ark or rust, you gather resources and make weapons, I use to early access games like ark, so I don't mind bugs and love the persistent database, if this game was marketed as a early access ark like game it would have done well.
---
This game fits a niche, but when people promise 16 times the detail and a amazing game and fall short, reviewers are right to point that out
---
This sounds like a good idea now until a giant ass plesioth pops out and hip checks everyone into oblivion.
---
I opted for 3* ranged and melee weapons last night and all the stars were there when I logged on this morning so it might just be the wood armour and assaultron heads
---
there is always this two point view whenever something new comes out, it either absolutely sucks or people love it but the reality is for this we're in the middle. While it's nice we have something to do with the legendary we don't want for a chance to get legendary we doc they should possibly limit some of the affix's or break it down smaller. Perhaps you can do a Heavy Medium Light category for armors to limit it some more. Same deal with melee, maybe make a one handed melee vs two handed melee category for gambling.
---
If your on pc when you go to inspect to repair it at a station you hit T or R theres one option to use materials and another to use repair bags :)
---
It is a proper response the game is designed to be grindy. Gear was not intended do be duplicated.
---
I guess I’m way below market...lol is there any good references to go by? 
---
Like is 1, 2, 3, star armor... then the same for weapons? 
---
I know certain types hold more value just didn’t know what good starting points are. 
---
Black titanium scrap doesn't bulk. 
---
You can also sell asbestos scrap that isn't bulked. And silver and gold.
---
I know because I have a good amount of hardened mass stored and usually when i return from a nuke zone I'll scrap all and have to go over to the hardened mass to scrap it after if I want ultracite scrap.
---
I think with the friends list is that at a certain point where you have to scroll it hitches, since the game will reload the entire ting to check if any are online. Hmm and I'm guessing those programs don't take much memory at all, well idk, my game has the occasional fps drop, but it's not as bad as others since I have one friend on my list, but hmm I dunno. I don't have beasty specks like yours, but maybe the game is just having some stability issues, since there seems to be a very re-occuring thing to be fixed every update, but I think the it can also be because the game is just chugging at loading in areas that are pretty hefty in detail.
---
Do hope your fps stop dropping soon tho, I mean if its normally at 70fps, you must be pretty solid XD
---
Would an incel have even been allowed in Vault 76? Chad barely did anything annoying in that story.
---
Is this real??
---
Hi Little Rusty, I'm Dad.
---
If you on XB1, I can show you my setup and what I do and how I spin it up in minutes .. but either thunder mountain or the other one just wast of it monagah or whatever is called is probably better. I think people don't like it because sometimes scorch beasts show up (npc griefers), I also just leave and find a new server.
---
I think that’s what I did early on before I started making stable flux and shows due to having a lot of ultracite...haha!
---
And I thought I had it bad losing my workshops. That sucks!!
---
Hold on, don't use the scope on it.. it'll give you pink eye
---
Almost every card is passive though. Reddit needs to stop suggesting this. Just take the L on a level 1/2 safe. It's barely ever worth it.
---
You got 3 star legendaries, not drills
---
Thank you, ill give it a go :)
---
Losing your worships definitely sucks too!! But yeah I’m pretty heartbroken atm. I didn’t think I’d be able to even pull it off.
---
If you're tweaking your build sometimes you want those other level options.
---
Never noticed legendary bugs on this quest
---
If you are having trouble with the through wall connector, I found a work around. Apparently the through wall connector only easily accepts connections aimed at the "inside" part. The outside part is a 1:100 chance of working. So I knock out a wall in my generator shed, and easy to select, still connects to the outside.
---
I almost never have them taken from me my recommendation is don't spend the time on workshops. simply connect the power add the collectors then lock them and move on about your buisness. People love to come and take them when there's lots built because it means less work for them or they know itll irritate someone. Don't fight back either If they initiate a takeover just leave normally they'll just leave it be or move on as they want you too fight back.
---
Bone clubs and spades as well.
---
Kinda weird they would do that since dresses can be worn by any character, didn’t think anything was gender specific?
---
Unyielding armor + Nerd Rage Perk
---
Im pretty sure he means IRL he has some .50 cal bullets/casings sitting next to some .308 bullets/casings and they pale in comparison
---
I got a level 5 pump action from it on my level 7 char. They were not always max level for me.
---
I have enjoyed the game since the beta. 
---
The main thing I hated what pvp idiots who would bully low level characters or demolish camps just for the fun of it. The camp problem has been addressed. The griefing hasn't been eliminated, but has diminished since the pvp servers were created.
---
My idiot full health build is over 300 with the tse lever.  A good bit less with Aae.
---
Does the GP suck ass though? Breaks fast?
---
No idea.
---
Yup, you have a point.  I was using the real world info to back up what I see is a lack of damage the .50 machine gun does.  There's a lot of things in the game that have to be adjusted to make the game playable.  But the .50 damage is no where near what it should be when you compare it to the other ammo in the game. I have a Furious combat rifle that does 50 damage and a two shot 50 cal that does 56 damage. Those two weapons shouldn't even be in the same league when it comes to damage. Game play being considered that 50 cal should till be double or even triple the damage of the combat rifle. Even looking at fire rate and doing the math to figure out damage per second its still too close. 
---
*Furious Combat Rifle @ 50 damage and 75 fire rate comes out to 62.5 damage per second*
---
*Two Shot 50 cal @ 56 damage and 91 fire rate 84.9 damage per second.*  
---
*(damage X fire rate / 60)*
---
And that comparison is with a two shot 50 cal. I'm not sure what it would be with a non- two shot but it would be even closer.
---
Done it the past few days and have gotten at least 2. Only one stars but it's an easy one. It's usually the flies or stingwigs
---
I think people vehemently defending one or the other probably dont have both to compare their actual performance.
---
Didn't they fix the 50 caliber rounds during the last patch?
---
Hunting Rifle: Increased the damage bonuses provided by the Prime and .50 Caliber Receiver mods. These mods now respectively grant the highest and second-highest damage increases of any Hunting Rifle receiver mods.
---
Repair kits only repair to 100%. They are for instances such as battling the scorch queen when your weapon or armor breaks. 
---
You can still repair past 100% using a workbench.
---
\&gt; If you create a murder box don’t steal people’s junk. It’s just not funny.   
---
Isnt that kind of the point of a survival PVP game tho?
---
I've got weapon artisan for repair and gunsmith when I am playing.
---
So you think exploding ammo wears faster? Messes with my logic but I kind if assumed, it wears way more than 2x faster than my old handmade. 
---
I'm trying to figure out what the cause is, if it's the twoshot I'm going to look for a VE or AAE
---
What they should do, from business point of view, is to lift the 150 scrip cap, maybe to 300, maybe no limit, so that people will grind hard. At the same time they limit the drop rate of good rolls, this will also keep players grinding. More grinding = more time invested = more likelihood to buy items from atom store, when players have more emotional attachment to their gears and virtual Camp. 
---
What they are doing now, instead, is limiting the scrip to the equivalent of two WS runs. I tested this in the past couple of days, took me definitely less than an hour to loot the legendaries worth more than 150 scrip. Then I’m done for the day. Less play time = less attachment to the game environment = less likelihood to buy anything. Many things they do simply don’t make sense business wise.
---
So you say your wife was there the whole time and it was her idea for you to lay on the guys bed.  Oh Ok!!
---
Did you go solo? If you say ‘yes,’ I will be way more heartbroken for you. But you did launch it, right? That’s good at least.
---
They can't PvP you now unless you're actually in the vicinity of the workshop, so it's fairly safe as long as you build the essentials fast and spend as little time there as possible.
---
Unfortunately this encourages boring single-extractor workshops with no decoration.
---
Well you’ve nothing to lose by knocking back some iguana soup or a mothman omelette with daytripper or x-cell to up the stat a bit before purchasing. I don’t know if luck is tied to rarity in any way but I can say I was “lucky” enough not to get any pistols, spades, etc and got some nice bits but prob not god roll rarity after scoffing luck boosting food chems and a luck bobblehead.
---
Sounds about right.
---
It does now, they buffed the .50 cal receivers for hunting rifles
---
he gets none of the credit and none of the rewards...that sucks
---
Same thing happened to us yesterday, but this happened first:   [https://i.imgur.com/LrV1RUF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/LrV1RUF.jpg)
---
I hate to bring it up because they are still worthless, but since patch 9 explosive heavy weapon two-shot does double damage. As in, grenade launcher, middle launcher, and fat man. These are still so bad though it doesn’t matter.
---
This got changed, you can't do this anymore, my 4\* bloodied Machete went down to 3\* to prevent people from scrip farming that way
---
Same. Patch removed my 4th star
---
I've injured many pet Brahmin while shopping.
---
we're going in circles now. I've already said Bethesda cannot afford to ignore the majority of the playerbase which clearly wants better rng.
---
this thread is about Bethesda and their inability to code proper servers. loot disappearing at random in a looter-shooter is unacceptable.
---
Yes and no, mostly no.  
---
I have only had a few occasions when I’ve been attacked after taking over a power plant. 
---
I take it over, build a fusion generator to power up the core generator, do the first defend event, and then ignore other attacks until the reclaim event pops up and tells me what took over the area.  Sometimes I will also do the power up event. 
---
However, I tend to sneak into the area, grab the cores, then leave.  I never camp at the power plant and anyone trying to take me out would have to have a lot of patience to wait for me to enter the area. 
---
I also place the travel mat in a hard to reach, well defended area where I can snipe from if I stumble into a contest event.    I had that happen a couple of days ago.  I was actually able to snipe the first guy, but he was on a team and I died when his buddy found me.  I tried taking it back, but 2 on 1 wasn’t close to even odds.  So I just left them to it.  They abandoned it shortly after and I took it back after they left the server...
---
I think that it depends on the Power Plant and the server you are on.   First thing is to check for any Wanted in the map.  If there are, then they are likely part of a Raider team.  Leave the world and find another one.  Periodically check the map for new wanted players. 
---
Finally, don’t camp at any workshop unless you want to PvP.   Take it over, set up your resource extractors, then leave and do other things.  Periodically come back to empty everything.  Build a stash and immediately dump your junk.  They will make a few caps if they kill you but nothing else.   
---
Oh, and, if you must lock your extractors, at least build water purifiers and leave them unlocked.   It’s the least that you can do for your fellow wastelanders...
---
I’m a lady 😊
---
You have opened a Rabbit Hole for me I'll be reading into these instead of working. 
---
So far from what I've read they seem cool but ineffective and the U.S. Military was having these developed and tested in 1959 that's crazy.
---
If you're on PC I will give you anything you want for that B25 Gatling Plasma lol.
---
I DID go solo! I was so proud of myself! Haha. 😩
---
I think it's less about what you're selling but to whom are you wanting to sell to. As the commenter said above, a lot of it you can find yourself, but if a newbie doesn't want to wait until they come across the chemistry table plan (the most common plan I see). Or if you're targeting higher levels, you'll need to sell more valuable items for sure. I made sure to make a sign saying "newbies shop here" so higher levels keep their expectations low. Lol
---
I didn't do armor because I kept hearing that it was bugging out and turning into 1 star gear. Did you have any issues with that?
---
I constantly forget what my backup weapon is supposed to be good against because the extra damage isn’t noticeable.
---
Class freak goes to 3. Starched genes is only 2.
---
Ill have to check when I get home from work.
---
Squeaky wheel gets the grease the more they do it the sooner Bethesda fix it so you don’t get pulled into group pvp just by being in the group.
---
It's just annoying at worst.  It's prolly pretty low on their list of "Honey Do's".
---
I had that problem a while back
---

Say 'floating object' again. Say 'floating object' again, I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker, say floating object one more Goddamn time!
---
You had me at "I was on the toilet."
---
True. But the return on script is worth more plus selling to other players also works out more
---
Adventure mode served the purpose of me robbing people for their junk sometimes I want the workshop sometimes I don't. It serves as a place for me to farm materials of players as you only really get aid off players in survival. So yea making these changes in advenure hindered my playstyle and from what I can tell players want to remove pvp from adventure altogether which for the reasons I have explain I am against and speaking up now.
---
Ah i believe you are referring to to section where I was talking about being a villain and saying how can't be a villian  in survival because its expected you shoot someone there, that's taking me out of context I have no problem with people shooting at me. I was referring to how its a CHOICE In adventure therefore the choice makes you a villain. In survival its more a necessity and more about self preservation than simply being the bad guy? Why do I keep talking about being a villain? BECAUSE like i said a million times it should be an option because its a fallout game. And these games are about player choice. 
---
In reguards to the camp thing I don't really destroy camps either as there isn't much incentive although sometimes you can bait somone into fighting you if you attack their home. Like you I just liked destroying camps that are at whitesprings and other morons that put camps down to draw enemies away from thier spawn at any location cos fuck those guys. But you can't do that anymore. Not only that but I still believe the option should be here , you be able to CHOOSE. Not be forced into either one.
---
Dude this has nothing to do with having my ass handed to me yea its happened but I also have plenty of successes in survival I have a screen shot of me getting 100 kills without dying in that mode if you'd like to see. It has everything to do about me fighting this anti pvp anti raider anti anything that isn't be nice to players play style. Not so say im against that I've help low levels but I've also killed them. But again you should be able to choose.
---
Thanks bro PS4 here lol
---
"I'm not really proud of this, but I can pick your puff'n'stuff out of a lineup" - Turk
---
Considering that's how the game is designed to work, it's highly likely. With the changes they made to survival mode alot of the pvp players have come back to adventure just to contest the workshops. I don't use the workshops, it's much easier just to go after Flux and make my own. With a high intelligence your cores come out overcharged anyway.
---
Also, in order for the processor to produce you do have to claim the workshop.
---
If you wanted to wreck his camp just drop a orbital strike beacon on it. Adios.
---
It's a step-up from my Assassin's Tesla (which has the exact same perks but obviously Assassin instead of Quad)
---
I want them to tweak it so he retains his glow and can be used as a light source.
---
It just kind of does this, unfortunately.
---
Quite a few posts pertaining to it, the full gamut of specifications, everyone seems to get it to an extent.
---
Did you trying connecting joining game to last person met. I usually do this to get back to the server unless it's the whole sever that went down
---
This story has nothing to do with incels, but these two have a backstory that goes back a long way. Stay with it...you'll see where it goes. I only found out about the whole incel/Chad thing after writing the first few stories.
---
&gt; or a single piece of chameleon armour.
---
So when it says "Unarmored" I can still benefit if I'm wearing normal armor but have one piece with the chameleon trait??
---
I didn't grab that serum yesterday because I can't survive unarmored, lol
---
Agreed, the rolls are independent of each other, that is - the last roll has no impact on the next roll - same randomness. Flipping a coin twice does not increase the chance of striking heads. 
---
"RNG Chances become a near certainty" is blatantly false to anyone who has studied probability.
---
If something has a value of 0 you can't vendor it to the bots
---
I have a sneaky suspicion that 4* &amp; 5* legendary items will come with the legendary players in the nuclear winter DLC.  
---
If you don't know what this is basically Bethesda said that they will add prestiges to the game. After you reach a certain level you will have the option to reset to level 1 with harder enemies but a higher loot reward or something like that; For other players these prestiges would be in the form of legendary stars, the icon for this part of the DLC was a vault boy with 5 stars below him making me think we can get 4* &amp; 5* legendary loot from killing the 4* &amp; 5* legendary players.
---
I think anti armor because I remember seeing they might have some resistance to explosive but just my opinion
---
I did it solo too. If it’s any consolation, it took me so long to do it because I kept dying, after I launched the nuke I was too exhausted to show up for my own Scorched earth event. :)
---
The furious plasma you have is better imho, I probably died too many times lately when playing bloodied lol. With the firing rate the Furious is more practical.
---
what are they trying to stop us from doing? right? I get the limit so that I can't build those stacked concrete impenetrable bases like I had... but out side of that... really?
---
Completely agree with you, plus the 2nd bullet almost always misses.
---
Yeah there is a fusion core harvester at the workshop, if you leave it unlocked or they contest the workshop, they can take what is inside, only makes 8 an hour, so they not going to be able to take to many, in fact, it might only have 3 or 4 in at a time max .. might  be wrong, never seen more than 3 in at a time.
---
I would like to see big beards, especially Viking-like beards like from that TABS game.  Imagine a guy in Power Armor charging in at enemies with a big Viking beard and a Sheepsquatch staff.  Total badass!
---
The Santa Beard is also a good example of a big beard but it is only white and counts as apparel unfortunately.
---
AAE lever is frequently traded as a high end item for other high end items... If Bloodied ever gets nerfed below 50%, Junkies and Furious will be next in line as well. They aren't a B25 handmade, but there are a million of those dupes around that you can buy for 25K anyway.
---
I would say the AA one, explosive doesn't too much against the queen. I have an AA handmade that is prime and it puts down some good damage on her.
---
I did that, at least 10 times, still didn't work.
---
No, but I sure will next time. Thank you for the tip!
---
That explains why my idiot toad was always blocking my doorway.
---
That doesn't count because the only person any of those effect is you, no one else can see or know you have them installed (except Bethesda maybe)
---
Awe man, I stepped in neck beard.  Never going to get that smell out.
---
Yes do have roughly 600 friends. And to answer the other comment. It's a brand new ps4 just bought it and set it up yesterday. But seems be like this for several hours then will allow me back in.
---
I got 1100 scrip worth of 10-20 pound garbage weapons, but that's because RNJesus doesn't love me. 
---
I could wish for just a little more specificity, like rifles instead of just guns. I'd pay more scrip per roll if I could narrow it down more. Still, just a way to get a guaranteed three star is great.
---
I can’t tell, is it bigger than a banana??
---
Dang. All I got was God roll game change wood armor.
---
Out of \~15 attempts across 2 characters, I got one usable 3-star that is a sort-of upgrade to my current gear. That's disappointing, but I knew going in it's a slot machine, and hopefully I'll have better luck next time.
---
Nice, if QDB is for sale on PC then you got yourself a buyer
---
Yeah, you pick the damaged cores from the slots in the mainframe and then you repair them.  
---
You can also find new cores but it’s a bit of a scavenger hunt.   But, if you pick them up, you can use them for the next run, saving a bit of time.
---
I was hoping to be able to choose the base item type, but that might be a little OP - everyone would get GG gear very quickly then. If it was just a category though, as you've suggested, that might be OK. Like you can pick from "Rifles" or "Heavy Weapons" or "Shotguns" or "1H Melee" etc.
---
Bout a half banana
---
I can hear it now.. Some developer in the back of the office.. "Well it works on my machine!...."
---
Please no, that whole notification system needs an opt out toggle.
---
Same here, tens of thousands 5mm and shotgun rounds, used to carry lots of explosives too with Ordinance Express perk.
---
Bupkis 😕
---
This is just an Atomic Shop item, from the Christmas offers. They didn't build it themselves, although it is pretty cool.
---
I'd run at 19% hp anyway (always do for adrenal reaction), rarely ever die with my build using emergency protocols on my power armor. Helps a ton. It agree though Furious is almost as good for SBQ. Now they just need to make Stabilized armor piercing affect energy resist.
---
what the fuck
---
I wasn't even sure if this was fallout for a while
---
Looks like Fortnite.
---
I thought you were asking me about breakfast for a second LOL! Nah man it's fine. Even a TSE with the shotgun attachement gatling Plasma will last through queen, If it's not explosive and no shotgun attachement, it lasts a long time. I have 80+ improved repair kits from queen now as well, so repairing won't be an issue.
---
Hey.. I've seen your base.. it was behind the railway cars behind Watoga right?
---
Even with ordinance express explosives are still too heavy for me to want to keep. I'd rather have another perk than lighter mini nukes.
---
Also they should have two barrels and weight quite a bit more, and accuracy should be in the toilet. And your shoulder should hurt for days after you fire it.
---
So you finished collecting all the post-nuclear korok seeds?
---
Until you leave the server, I believe.
---
I disagree. A perfect example of this is my TSE Lever Action and Bloodied Lever Action, both have hardened receivers and are level [45.My](https://45.My) Bloodied peaks at somewhere around 350 damage when you could breath on me and I'd die. My TSE does 296 consistently at full health. I also had two combat shotguns in this same situation. Point is TSE does like 85% of the damage of a Bloodied when someone is nearly dead WITH adrenal reaction. 
---
It would make all other variants of that weapon useless. The only negative to having a TSE is shooting enemies at close range. You have to sacrifice a ton with Bloodied. Honestly I think if anything they should boost the other legendries a little.
---
I started up the encryptid event that thing two shots most players and there’s a decent sized puddle
---
People are in a hurry to get a hit in on the legendary before somebody gets to it with their 3000 damage super sledge. I usually try to get a tag in, and then pay attention to the critters attacking the cows or the swarms of bots.
---
I can hear that voice now.. wasn't that a piece that is laying on the cutting floor from Pulp Fiction!
---
Yeah there's two mohawks for women and then the warhawk is for men and the rad rage is for men only apparently too so :/ kind of odd really.
---
Two things come to mind:
---
1)pretty sure this is related to user error
---
or
---
2) you already did it without knowing it.
---
 This if what I thought but I've read it's actually 3 to 4 hrs. I don't know which is true
---
it only works if the person you are reviving can have their weapon drawn when in the water, standing in it. not actually swimming. if you die in the water while swimming you just drown
---
Jump off the summersville dam near charleston. Jump off that rickety bridge straight below.
---
Wow that really sucks to read, we have 2 modes for a reason and u nrestricted pvp is one of them and to me this includes camps and turrets.. I do think camps should offer more protection tho as it takes no effort to blast thru any wall you can build.
---
Most of the reviews were unfair because a lot of the bigger YouTubers rushed to be the first ones out of the gate. They dumped maybe 20 hours at most in it and made a 30 rant video where they spent ten minutes complaining about a couple of broke animations and twenty minutes screaming about a canvas bag. They didn't even scratch the surface on gameplay, the community of players had not yet developed into the awesome community it is right now, and nobody even bothered to mention that Bethesda made a commitment to consistent improvements and content updates. Hell, some of the reviewers didn't even actually play the game and literally just carbon copied other people's rants. Some content creators trashed the game simply because they're jealous that Bethesda hasn't shown their channel any love and don't get invited to Bethesda events. Look at Oxhorns channel, he's always had a small group of trolls trying to knock him down, but I can't be the only one that noticed the large concentrated effort that took place right after Laying Lowe was released. Some sever butthurt from people putting their nose out of joint that Bethesda gave him a shout-out. 
---
For those of us that put hundreds of hours in grinding and trading our way up to Unyielding Sentinel godhood going back and watching a six month old review is comical. Footage of a level 15 struggling to hit Liberators with their machetes, equipping Good With Salt and Thru-hiker while wearing broken leather pieces while an angry voice claims to understand the first thing about this game.
---
Nah man, TSE weapons downside are short-combat situations You take area damage like a bitch and I've killed myself so many times.
---
There are also cats at a shack down the road from the southern belle motel
---
Yea actually the first few days it did take different amounts of time for me. Also the same for the new daily quests it took a day and a half or so a few days in a row. Just remember it has a max of a thousand scrip but it will let you keep cashing them in!
---
Yep I used to run around just below 20, now more like between 30-40 (no more nerd rage). I had to adjust a little when I started doing the imposter sheepsquatch events, I could barely stay alive unless I spam stimpaks every ten seconds lol
---
Let’s go with the first one what am I doing wrong?
---
Not trying to be a d*** but don't you guys test stuff?
---
How did you get them? All from Possum world badges? Or is it true daily's have a chance at giving them.

"Tonight. You."

Grinding campfire tales

PvP is fair and balanced, but you just have to learn the builds and the counters. If a terrible build was appropriate competition for a perfect build, it wouldn't be balanced. Right now good build and a synergising set of 1* items is enough to be good on survival, but you have to play cautiously. Anyway, playing survival you should always play cautiously and those who don't do that shouldn't complain it doesn't work. It shouldn't work.

Ha!! That's greatness.

I did it like this for 2 people.
---
One of the main metas is essentially chameleon vats crit rifleman. Maybe with an AA rifle. I have a basic 1 star AA handmade and with the stealth, vats locked on the head, and critical meter I am able to easily down some pretty tanky builds. 
---
Use those stealth boys because if you can be targeted in vats is game over.
---
DO EET
---
That could be issue the guy dying hasn’t had gun drawn....
---
The unrestricted pvp is not the main issue here, it is the fact that you cant take out the turrets that kill you in the blink of an eye
---
Looks like a truffle!
---
Did you not see the part where I said I'm not a bloodied player?
---
Ok, really? Who wants to buy a 3\* legendary Fishing pole? only 25k caps!
---
&lt;nothing but crickets is heard&gt;
---
Did you have your gun drawn while jumping
---
My suggestion is: 
---
1. Go to gulper lagoon with your "partner". 
---
2. Your partner should kill every-gulper except one. 
---
3. Your partner should let the last gulper down them in the water. 
---
4. You should stand in the water and revive your partner. 
---
I don't think team or no team maters. You do have to get to the downed-state and not insta-death.
---
Does Bono want the bitty?
---
What level do you need to be to craft them? I learned up the plans but don't see them in the workbench at level 20
---
Yea the explosive weapons don’t perform well in this game. Sometimes the projectiles just vanished without a boom, sometimes I kill myself with no reason, so I just gave up on them altogether.

You keep bitching about choice, but it all just sounds like "I want the choice to be an asshole outside of the dedicated PvP mode and other people should not have the choice to ignore my bullshit."
---
Survival *is* an option. It's really not necessary to murder everyone in sight. You can be a villain in Survival. Or you can go in and, y'know, not kill random people.
---
You want your playstyle to be the end-all-be-all and everyone else should have to cater to your desire and just expect death everywhere they go. This isn't an actual apocalypse. It's a *game*. Bethesda is obviously gonna make changes to appease the majority of the people who play the game, because, y'know, they want people to *enjoy the game*. Either you can discuss the real issues with the dedicated PvP game mode, or you can just stop playing the fucking game.
---
But you're clearly uninterested in actual PvP, you just wanna maul people for scrap you can't be bothered to find yourself.
---
lmao 😂😂😂
---
Are those good while not using a Bloodied build? I thought that was the build that used those
---
Yes, longer beards please.
---
I completely agree. 
---
Players that are not Power Armor builds have more advantages.  They can do stealth builds for tons of damage, use Unarmed Weapons [I still think the Mole Miner Gauntlet should be usable in Power Armor], and use Backpacks.  They can carry more than a fully Calibrated set of T-51 by over 100 lbs.
---
The effects I would like to see with Power Armor are maybe more Carry Weight, weight reductions to chems, ammo, and food, better Fusion Core efficiency, and I guess the Tesla Coils from Fallout 4 that increase energy weapon damage.  Regardless of the Power Armor set, it would add those electrical bits.
---
Damage reduction effects should not be added to Power Armor for balancing reasons.
---
Are you a raider? r/76raiders
---
They're just that f%$&amp;ing persistent.
---
Yes survival mode is gettin strange, I noticed the cap bug which is sucks. It was said to be equal to your your level and a max of 50 caps. The weapon balance is unreal as o can kill almost an th player in  2 seconds or less
---
You’re not wrong. This was supposed to be endgame material... people weren’t supposed to be able to launch a nuke every hour but nuka-crypt kinda wrecked that (not that I’m complaining... it IS a pain). I think all things considered, they should rework the nuke system.
---
I make alllll my caps vending plans and clothes!
---
That’s all that needs to be said. You need to find a Mothman and take a picture of a player wearing a cultist outfit and the Mothman.
---
Bullets and damage have been shocking bad since fallout 3. 
---
Bethesda had the hunting rifle and the terrible tiny revolver use the same ammo... (.32). Fallout 4 had th .50 bmg do almost no more damage than. 308 (which carried over into fo76).
---
What kind of group you looking for?
---
Maybe because we're not sociopaths?
---
I soloed it a lvl 37, with 2 SS spawning at lvl 80, some Yao Guai and some Anglers. Just be sure that you use the terrain and are fully decked in power armor. I had no trouble killing them both and be rewarded with that sweet, sweet legendary wooden leg.
---
The ghouls floating on the ground horizontally is a bigger problem.
---
I just want my life back.
---
It does not disappear when you log off, I've transferred stuff to my alt this way
---
A wise man/woman once said, "Hope for the best, but plan for the worst"  
---
My problem is I'm more like, "Expect the worst, be pleasantly surprised by the best!"
---
I believe you have to craft regular combat armor, and then BoS is a mod you put on the armor. I haven’t actually crafted any myself yet.
---
I had to wipe my mutations because I hated this sooo much
---
I just want to mess about in survival mode for a bit. Maybe launch a nuke or something.
---
pretty self explanatory.
---
I don't use it cause I don't like it.
---
Absolutely.  that extra 5% difference between 2shot and the creature specific stuff is useless.
---
in my perfect world, 2shot would be +33%, the specifics would be +66%, and the special anti-scorched (not zealots) would be atleast +100%
---
That could work. I hit the vendor cap limit every day that I play, and I would like to be able to offload some crap during play so I'm not encumbered.
---
Alternatively, the vendors could just give you a countdown to when they're going to reset. I can't keep track.
---
Passive perk card **slot** =/= passive card
---
Keep an eye out for that quest by the light house... path of enlightenment?  Only way anyone is going to get these two things at the same time
---
This is the kind of shit-post I don't feel bad upvoting.
---
See, see, Bethesda has the largeset QA department of any software group ever!.... It's called YOU! and it's run on the Production servers.
---
Specially for female characters!  Cause mutations and such!
---
Ah I see. I dont know many people who play survival
---
OK. Fair enough. Pity the doors can't have a close timer, say 5 seconds.
---
No. I had underarmor and 1 arm armor on. The water will be about waist high. Deep enough for challenge. I had some issues dying for this as well as id take too much damage from enemies. Went here got it pretty quick.
---
Me neither
---
"iTs oNLy FaIr"
---
I found Anne at Bolton Greens out front on the fountain last 2-3 days for friends. Haven't seen them at any other location.
---
I had a TSE Pump lvl 45 as my main weapon and had a full shotgun build. After the latest nerf, I shelved the pump and converted to an auto-rifle build. It went from a good weapon (imo it wasn't over powered, I don't PVP either) to useless. I had to be on top of an enemy (high level) to kill it and you can't be up close with an exploding gun. 
---
The cripple effect of the shotgun build is pretty awesome though. I could cripple a level 91 Deathclaw, holster my weapon, take a selfie with it and then beat it to death with my melee.
---
I'm in a pretty large discord group tho. Depending on what system your on there may be some people you can team with if your interested or want more info feel free to DM me
---
Use vanguard, +35 DR/ER at 100% health.
---
1-2☆ is pretty easy to find, and cheap. If you can find/afford even a few 3☆ pieces with cavalier or sentinal, the mitigation can really make a difference.
---
#1. Plans
---
Make at least one Vending Machine dedicated to plans. You can sell recipes but best practice is to not mix the two.  This assumes that you have a bunch of plans.   Personally, I only visit camps if I see more than 30 plans because anything under that tends to be 90% recipes.  
---
Anything else is at your discretion and you’ll need to find what works for you.
---
I’m selling serums.   I have Marsupial, Speed Daemon, and Chameleon recipes so far [PS4].  I’m also selling stable flux  but I need to restock it as a player cleaned out my extra flux.  Time for another Nuke run.  
---
I have a few other items that I’m stocking each login but I’m not going to give away all of my merchandising secrets...   grin...
---
Oh, and label your Vending Machines if you have more than one...
---
If you're on ps4 I would love to show off my recent creation c:
---
Oh, I thought the ragstag was one of those new things from Lowe questline, and that someoen had invented to add those lights to it.
---
I got a Instigating Shovel which I'm pretty excited about.. I need more shovels man...
---
Ok I see what you're saying. That really sucks
---
I also placed a welcome mat on the edge of my CAMP zone, unsure if it makes any difference, I did read somewhere it influences where other players spawn, maybe.
---
mine is purely functional... i will improve it given time, however
---
You on Xbox?
---
Looks like someone got shadowbanned... Showing a comments but I'm not seeing it in here...
---
I agree with OP, when you have cards that are swappable and unnecessary in combat situations, I feel like you should just be able to keep those on all the time. I would say add those cards to make a different place called SPECIAL abilities or skills. Reduce cost of crafting cards, chemist, super-duper, ammunitioner, etc.
---
Bethesda what would be the negatives of this? We are able to use all of our crafting cards as is we just swap them between each bench at our camp. Could we please stop suggesting this and just get it already? The simplest solution is make these cards not cost special points. We have the ability to make a skill permanent even, instead of picking a new card or moving a point. **Guys, can we pleaseeee blow this up until they change this? No more sitting around waiting for it to happen.**
---
Please upvote OPs post and bring it to Bethesdas attention
---
Since FO4 I stared really enjoying putting dedicated time into builds. Some people just go for the biggest emptiest base they can. To each their own but it breaks ‘muh mersion’ really bad. Cool to see the differences.
---
im pretty sure that the thing that was the clincher for them to change it was people complaining about the Queen going down so fast that people were missing it, even if they nuked it themselves.   and just nerfing all the legendary effects was probably easier coding than making her immune to the effects or something.
---
I’ve seen some really impressive camps. And I’ve seen some where it’s just like “ok, man, you’re not even trying.” Lol
---
I'm a little late to the party but: Last week I was on a server where they launched 3 nukes within 30 minutes (all to the same spot for the SQ). This week when someone did launch a nuke I'd get a message that the server stopped responding. This happened to me at least twice on two different days.
---
got the same question i own it on pc and ps4 but my friends don't really want to play it so i am looking for group
---
usually I join one of my friends servers so if they are still on I just rejoin
---
I would just make crafting enhancement cards and such not require special points so they can be on at all times.
---
If you work construction, manufacturing, or in maintenance, you here it every day.
---
  
---
Course you know you play to much when you reach for your pipe wrench and start sneaking around looking for it to kill it.
---
I can toss the broken ones in my trade machine. Once you fix them you can't seem to trade them.
---
I'm just wondering if you have to find the tourist first before you can actually fix the camera. Because you have a quest to actually fix it.
---
If you would like to know about the group I'm apart of feel free to DM me
---
They are for sale in the white springs bunker...
---
The BoS vendor in Watoga
---
Oh no! to kill Col OCD, you have to shoot him at only right angles!
---
Man screw that event. Not worth it lol. I have to put on med-x and the dodgy perk to do it.
---
while i agree with you because they steal my rads.... starched genes.....
---
//insert "But why?" Ryan Reynolds gif.
---
That i don't know sorry.
---
She IS the purveyor.
---
Are radium rifles not gag items?
---
I agree the AAE lever is good but the weapon itself sucks. I know it's popular because everyone wants to be a cowboy but it's just a bad rifle.
---
I don't see junkie's ever replacing something, even a nerfed bloodied, because SPECIAL actually matters in Fo76. and the withdrawal effects can be brutal.
---
furious is good but limb damage is worthless. so it's essentially a 1\*. bloodied/vats crit is a great combination on anything that's not a DB, so also worthless.
---
I can see the BE pistol being good for gunslingers but they'd need multiple.
---
Dude you spelled EATT wrong.
---
Didn't see when you sent the friend request, but it's already accepted, thanks, waiting for you.
---
Contact Bethesda tech support from their web site. And submit a ticket
---
Yeah, a fun part of the vending is checking out peoples camps
---
That’s a great idea, I’ll definitely keep it in mind next time.
---
That's the truth. It hurts to see my baby pump in the gutter right now.
---
It makes absolutely no sense that a bullet comes of the **same gun** and it's the **same type of ammo** and it does *less damage*...
---
Man that one hell of a wall of text to scroll through just to down vote!...
---
Do the numbers on the armor mean as much compared to the modifiers?
---
Bethesda,
---
When you have cards that are swappable and unnecessary in combat situations, I feel like you should just be able to keep those on all the time. I’m talking cards like reduce cost of crafting cards, chemist, super-duper, ammunitioner, etc.
---
Bethesda what would be the negatives of this? We are able to use all of our crafting cards as is we just swap them between each bench at our camp. Could we please stop suggesting this and just get it already? The simplest solution is make these cards not cost special points. 
---
How about this: We have the ability to make a skill permanent even, instead of picking a new card or moving a point. It’s just an unnecessary burden at this point.
---
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
---
Shes a robot
---
Logically sure but the TWO shot is powerful enough as is.
---
That would explain **a lot** of the disappearing PA/armor complaints, if so...
---
Me too lol.
---
I have around 200 rad resist and I do alright in white springs. But if I get swarmed from glowing ghouls I do take a fair bit of rad damage but if I take a diluted radx I don't take much at all.
---
./gasp
---
You mean I saw wrong information on the internet?! I have been hornswaggled! Lol 
---
Cheers for the reply though. Dunno if it got patched already, or if the info was incorrect that I saw before. :)
---
AA most definitely
---
Or whitesprings
---
I fot mine at wavy Willard but had to hop there maybe 5 times. I have an extra I got from a safe and fixed but I dont kbow if it will start your quest.
---
What they all said!
---
I’ll give it a shot, thanks man!
---
The silver lining lol
---
And I thought my mutant slayer lead pipe was bad!!
---
Last time I heard a holotape from her she was in a bad shape. But we never found a body so who really knows.
---
I understand the need for a limit to generating new legendaries, but I wish the limit was flipped: no limit on weapon turn in for scrip, but a limit on buying from Purveyor. Let me get rid of all this excess weight asap.
---
Take off any perk cards that stop weapons from degrading.
---
Alternatively, go to this site, scroll down to locations, grab these and repair them:

---
Does diluted rad-x affect mutations?
---
My one and only purchase so far was a 3\* Exterminator's Harpoon Gun....... :(
---
Yes make sure it says deluxe
---
you have - exit building and open them. I mean people here dont mind doing westtek 40 times a day and then you are lazy to exit build mode.
---
I visited a player vendor in the mire last night and it was a massive metal box that was completely empty on the inside. Like what’s the point?
---
It is something I notice also.
---
I've done the event over 100 times now. Sometimes no dry kindling spawns . The only way to get some is to clear the wet so dry can spawn . I'm so glad I'm done grinding it. Many times I've seen all three trees with nothing but wet at first , luckily it seems once wet is picked up, only dry respawns.
---
I AGREE 100%.. SBQ should be a guaranteed 3\*\*\*.   As much time as it takes to even drop the dam nuke.  and the resources, Ammo, weapon and armor repair..  
---
Her drops are not worth the replacement cost and time to get a fucking 1 star wood armor piece of shit.
---
You should just need to use them. I created one then fixed it a few times while working towards the ‘kill 50 things’ part of the badge.
---
Umm what has a max of 1k scrips?? Surely not the vending machines. They only hold 150 scrips a day
---
Thank you
---
lol Thank you.
---
turn off any weapon crafting perks before making it, works like a charm! After 20 or so shots it should be able to be repaired.   
---
Attacking a super mutant at WV Lumber or blocking with it works like a charm... also you'll get at least 20+ kills there as well!
---
Use the crossbows to bash targets you get kill credits and they wear out faster.
---
It lasts a long time, exact interval I have no idea. 
---
I've dropped spoiled meat at my C.A.M.P. and like four hours later it's still there.
---
OP had me at, "Need more."
---
Probably because it's not a battle royale mode
---
Get a decon shower, you filthy animal.
---
They have a high durability. Take off any perk designed to make weapons last longer, and just gun bash mobs. It'll take some time, but you should have it soon  enough.
---
This sounds like a NON pay to win item that can go into the atomic shop.
---
I would seriously pay for a robot that goes around fixing stuff and tending to my scrap collector, gardens and fermenter.
---
Yeah...I've used over 200 bolts through a lvl 15...nothing.
---
Great idea for random events. Walked up on a Sheepsquach and was hoping for some help. Pop a flare and get a couple over!?! Share the loot and move on.
---
did you have your possum outfit on?

Been trying to get them to fix it since B.E.T.A. :(
---
So it's a snack with a scope.
---
Yes, of nothing else its creepy as hell.  I didn't realize I had one dragging along behind me like a dog on a leash
---
Fallout games have a way of getting into your brain. My dad was on a job and sent me a picture of a file cabinet covered with stacked clipboards. I laughed really hard and asked him if they were battered. My husband wanted to know what was so funny so I showed him and he looked at me like I was insane.
---
OMG! I didn't even consider this! Best fan theory so far
---
I agree with this, it’s not necessary but adds the element of real life in the wasteland.
---
I want to incorporate as many “real life” things in game as possible, add in some buffs and stat boosts and we’re good. Have a plumbing system, with a water filtration process, it would be amazing
---
It also seems that some items are not counted towards the components. E.g. I have wood, but the component view isn't showing Wood as a component.
---
Possibly
---
For me, it's the super wonky single staircase leading up to just a large, mostly empty cube.
---
I understand the functionality of it, but, like, you're not gunna try and at least make it look cute?
---
Or maybe I just roleplay a little too hard when playing, and those kinda camps really are immersion breaking for me.
---
Calling it now, her story picks back up in Wastelanders.
---
I need to know more! Worst cliffhanger ever
---
I may actually not have created the one that I’ve been using, it could have been the one that I found by the archery range. Maybe try going back there and grabbing that one?
---
I agree. Its still a 2 star but with a regular name now. I just would hate for someone to have the same thing happen to them. Thats why I'm confused over the down votes but whatever.
---
You have a max of 1000. So if you collect 150 a day it will add up fast! Just make sure on the last day you keep an eye on your amount because it will let you keep cashing them in.
---
Eww. 😣😥
---
Go to Watoga &amp; bash robots...it'll degrade quickly.

Well, I will sometimes "Quint" Box, but that's not normal...

---
I do hope we get more from her. It would be. A shame to leave it open like it is now.
---
It's so hard not to choose 3* now lol
---
But the main question is, what temp was it on day 45?
---
Thanks for the Feedback, and this is exactly the kind of discussion I'd like the Downvoter's to Add...  
---
If they disagree, just give me a why!
---
Milk, kill, repair, milk, repeat this process at your camp, sometimes you “fail” when milking I believe, stock up on razor grain to do this
---
Support tickets should do the trick. I got a refund (but kept the item) for that rocket that looks like it launches. I got the refund because I thought I could use a computer or switch to launch it which wasn't true.
---
Hey, I resemble that remark. It's not finished, I ran out of budget.
---
Yes do this so I can up my prices and blame inflation like a true capitalist scum
---
I got a Three Star Shovel...  
---
I honestly didn't know those were legit weapons.  Thught it was like binoculars or something that were classed that way so you could hold them.
---
Me, I just keep bonking her in the nose with All Rise.   Yes, the wing attack does damage, but I go in with lots of diluted stimpaks and equip a level 3 Ghoulish perk, radiation heals me...   
---
Being a Tank is hard work.  But you do get first kick at the can when she finally goes down.  
---
I’ve just switched to a heavy gunner for the SBQ run after first getting a 2 star 50 cal explosive machine gun with +10% if mutated and then a few days ago I got drop of a 2 star 50 cal explosive machine gun with +30% damage to scortch.  It just eats scortch for breakfast...
---
As someone who hasnt been using the internet to buy special armor pieces, and has just been using what the game has given me naturally:  I spent my entire 1000 Scrip on 3 star armor pieces, and It was a great decision.  obviously not all amazing or anything, but several of my pieces got replaced, while still keeping my build style.
---
It was Whatever. lol
---
You have a decon shower, and an outhouse, what more can you ask for lol. On a serious note, that would require plumbing, and active water pumps as well as purification plants. Lore wise, no one exactly runs those anymore, so I don't see it happening outside of maybe an oldschool metal wash basin, or a solar shower, but then, I grew up on a farm, so my solution is shit in the outhouse, bath in a pond, then hit the decon shower to remove rads. I don't need a "you pooped" buff.
---
That sounds so cheesy..those players lack skill
---
Hmmm.
---
Wow, they really made it that way or is that big?
---
Take off gunsmith &amp; bash things to death with the crossbow.
---
Toilet paper will finally have a real use! lol Wonder if certain foods will make you use the bathroom more like coffee or gas for fuel eating pork and beans?   
---
What happens if you don't make it to a bathroom?   
---
I know it sounds funny but there has to be just as many benefits as there would be downfalls for doing or not doing them.   
---
Maybe not showering will either scare away animals like real hunters do or maybe it may attract certain ones?
---
I'm doing it every day and maybe saw one
---
The secret is to use BASH with it equipped, it drops in condition very quickly
---
so my question is, how does a bigger back pack reduces your resistances. i get how lead lined and armored reduce the total carry weight but those bags still have a **Net Possessive** affect.  so why is the high capacity have such a harsh negative affect.
---
I just learned about Duplex Bullets. Thier an ineresting piece of firearm history but ineffective probably worse than what a two Shot modifier gives us
---
This sounds like the equivalent of the "I'm rich" app that was being sold in the Apple store years ago.
---
Nope, the Lowe quests only offer mounted heads that go on the wall. The only full-size stuffed Radstag available is this one, with the reindeer noses!
---
Damn I need to revive someone while in the water in order to get the swimmer badge but it seems like you already found someone.
---
Lmao the same happend to me when I did it on the bright side you should still find a new legendary in your inv after my first crash it didn't happen again.
---
WHOLE. OTHER. WAVELENGTH.

Since I found mine I now find them all over! Like in boxes, safes, everywhere. Not sure if you can drop one for someone else who doesn't already have a camera though...
---
The capital Wasteland is extremely close to Appalachia it would be a logical Next Step
---
Player vendors can sell unbulked junk
---
U have to join the brotherhood
---
I'm sitting on 40+ 100% fusion cores because someone left the server so I took them.all over and collected them all for a few hours.
---
I am nowhere near the best at making camps but wtf with some of these camps!
---
Absolutely the worst right now are the terrible flying bases that have their vendors on that don't even kill you when you fall on fast travel.
---
Personally I know no one going to protect them so I literally stay 5 feet away from them at all times and once Sheepsquash spawns in I tag it and run after Brahmin killing the adds that are trying to kill them.
---
.... No.  That's the exact game it ISN'T.  It's an ARPG.  The whole point is to grind through PvE Content to gear up for story based content.  The exact opposite of a survival game.  Seriously wtf?  This is what I mean by people not being able to understand what Fallout 76 is.  They're too caught up in doll housing and cosplaying to actually PLAY THE GAME, and it's because Bethesda keeps letting them do that and yet keep doing the latest content.  The devs intend you to grind legendary gear, but there's no reason to do it cause you can just coast with crap  gear and crouch walking 99% of the time.  Like... death isn't even close to permanent, where di you even begin to  get the idea it's a survival game?  holy.... damn....
---
My body is ready.
---
Nope. Mine's southeast side in Twin Lakes. It was quite common though to build bunkers out of foundations back then. Griefers were not able to destroy them. Pyramid was a popular shape too so I'm sure there's a few more of them left... True legacy camps.
---
wtf HAHA I LOVE IT
---
Add me, we can do it and then I'll still help Thondorin.
---
That sucks. Could be someone just cleared it before you? I was super stoked to get 3 on the one run. So maybe it's not a guaranteed spawn
---
There is literally a mod called the beam focuser
---
Beam Focuser (more accurate), Beam Splitter (sort of like a flamer barrel), Rifled Barrel, Sight Ring
---
Bethesda this is the consumable we would pay for. It is exactly what you did in Fallout Shelter and we would pay for it, you even have metrics to support it.
---
Bonus points if it collects our resources occasionally.
---
Please do this.
---
Not sure if they are always there but northish from white springs is a train yard and a farm to the east. Between the two is a big billboard and under that is a small shack with 3 cats.
---
I've only passed it once so I'm n ot sure a out the spawns.
---
Oh good tip! I had that issue too. I've been trying to grind it for badges but haven't had any luck
---
Maybe you just got lucky
---
They do, but it would be a trade off? 
---
The problem with vanguard is that it's hard to maintain 100% as a melee character. At &lt;60% health, the base DR would be much more important, as vanguard would effectively add 0 DR. But, with sent/cav it doesn't matter if the piece is lvl 10, or lvl 50; 15% mitigation is the same.
---
I thought I saw one but it was for a laser I'll have to keep my eyes out thanks.
---
I only run marsupial speed demon and adrenal..I have a couple pieces of armor which adds perception..there are other mutations I could add but I'm not in love with their negative effects
---
I won't be able to be on for another 4 hours
---
Ah thank you so much.
---
Shovel's.   *sigh*
---
One and a quarter shot doesn't sound nearly as good.
---
Try these:
---
1. out front of the Teacup place by power plant out from on picnic table
---
2. first car in parking lot at wavvy park
---
3. out front of WS on red car on hood
---
4. Mothman statue
---
5. lighthouse at top
---
6. Miners monument
---
7. Cemetary
---
8. Pickets Fort
---
I say we need to get 1 free recall card week, or at least be able to earn it by doing a weekly quest. Just can't see myself wasting caps for it when at best I get 100caps upon completion and a chance to get plans Im missing and Im set on white fedoras.
---
Well yeah that's part of everything with how this game works lol
---
Clearly you didn’t try hard enough
---
Is that an ultracite Gatling laser?
---
Yawn. Another story made up for karma
---
I didn't have to have any weapons drawn.  I was at the lake where you do the swimming test, took off all of my armor, let the Miurlek (sp) Queen hit me until I was down, in the water,  and my teammate revived me.
---
Best thing I've seen so far, that gold medal was well deserved!
---
Actually... limb damage is quite good on SBQ, and that's the only thing I'd ever use a gatling plasma for. I'd just sit on her wing when she lands and pummel it with that thing. 
---
I agree, AAE lever, or any lever really, is crap. So is handmade unless you're doing pvp. Really, anything but a B25 .50 cal is garbage in comparison if you're talking dps. But people don't know that and they will pay for it with other good items. Like you said, they want to be a cowboy.
---
I don't disagree completely for Heavy Weapons, but I know enough people running around in Standard Armor with heavy weapons, wrecking face it seems to work "alright"    
---
Emergency Protocols is freaking Awesome, I don't disagree, but Cav/Sent did "own it" before the "Rebalance" this past week even with the movement limitations, you didn't see many PA users taking Zero DMG from "Maxed out" PvP'ers.    
---
Never take Bear Arms myself, too many other good perks!  
---
45%?   
---
Where can I find that?     
---
What I see is this:  
---
EnchPowerArmor_ReducePADamageMult [ENCH:00204A52]  
---
Has a modifier of 0.070000 and leads to..  
---
ReducePADamageMultEffect "Reduce PA Damage Mult Effect" [MGEF:00204A56]...
---
I know there is DMG Reduction is there, but it doesn't always seem to kick in, or there is a way to bypass it. (One minute Ghouls do almost zero DMG and the next they are eating me alive).
---
Wow you been doing it for days then, spend entire day grinding that mission server hopping and got about 3 from that day.
---
I'm not even sure how long I was maxed if that is the cap.
---
guess im lucky got the plans on the first one I scrapped lol
---
This. All of this. This is what causes studios and developers to go down the shitter. It may take months or years, but eventually they all go down the shitter unless they are an A list developer and manage to save it in time.
---
"Pieces of shit irl with mental issues that use justifications to try and cover up their crazy."
---
Soooo.... Raiders...
---
There's definitely people who try to kill the sheepsquatch ASAP - not because they only want the legendary, but because the event completes as soon as the 1 or 2 sheepsquatch are dead so there's not enough time for the brahmin to die to ads. I've seen it work effectively both ways as long as the team can put out enough damage. If theres a couple dudes with heavy guns unloading on the squatches, chances are they're there for that specific reason and it's the other players who should get their 1 shot on the squatch and go kill mobs, leaving the squatch killing to those guys.
---
One would think they would at least remove items that are effected by this issue so they don't get a hundred+ ticked off players....
---
100% agree. They literally have an entire server dedicated to fucking eachother up, yet, they physically choose not to. 
---
The same people who claim to be gods, are the same people who cry rivers when their rattle is taken from them. It's the epitome of pathetic. 
---
Makes for a good laugh when they start spitting their dummies though.
---
I got trapped in a rad dungeon by a level 320 when I was level 17. He gave me my stuff back and like 7 rad aways but it was scary.
---
I ran through one in my excavator PA - ran out of radaway and stimpacks (and drained the only fusion core I had, lol - I never use PA).
---
Went back in just a protoype hazmat suit and basically took 0 rads.
---
I was only level 47, so the lack of armor made little difference - I was getting wrecked even with full armor. Just the hazmat suit at least saved me the mats for repairs, haha.
---
Not sure what the highest rad resist is, but the prototype suit gives 1000.
---
I have been laid out with a broken back for a few weeks. I'd pretty much forgotten to spend them.
---
Do you have marsupial mutation?
---
Yes it is.
---
Try not using but 1 foundation, leaving a dirt floor.
---
trade for scrip before you log out and you will get full value
---
Ah ok. I've always kinda been just using whatever armor I find and I'm just now getting to the point where I'd like a serious armor setup
---
I bet you’re right
---
How do we find this haven in the wastes?
---
you do not not have to have it drawn, but you must be reachable in the water. its easier to do if you are standing in the water (able to have your weapon drawn)
---
One workaround I've noticed is to change the order of wire attachment if you keep jumping. Like, if going from generator to connector won't work, it often works for me to go from connector to generator instead.
---
Yes, I had mine painted with the camo paints and everytime a part breaks it disappears. I made the switch over to BoS paint until it is fixed in 6 months.
---
I love the game, but this seems like such a preventable mistake.
---
wait what?? I can't toss mine into my vending machine!
---
And I think you need to find the tourist to get the camera first, just because you need to listen to the holotape to start "bucket list" quest
---
What’s your PSN?
---
Thanks, AA it is.
---
Not sure, just know you can only milk that one Brahmin  once and must wait for it to reset which takes a while, this bypasses it by having a “new” Brahmin spawn every time you destroy the pen after milking one
---
This has been happening to me too
---
Thanks, AA it is then.
---
I lost a calibrated leg painted in the desert camo
---
Wow. Griefers still finding ways to screw with other people... Sad, just sad.
---
Right?! I won’t buy armor until it’s fixed, even though that’s what I really want lol
---
I don't think so... not yet anyways.
---
Add me on PSN, man! It's eaaaasy! PSN Flooping_pig. Won't be on until this evening. Seeeee you sooooon
---
I guess what I'm saying is, since I already have A B25 15% reload .50 cal, which is the highest dps weapon in the game by a long shot, only possibly surpassed by an AA25 .50 cal (only a rumor I've heard, and only on SBQ) or maybe a full glass cannon bloodied unyielding meat hook build (even then I'm not convinced that it's more dps), I only care about the value of an item, and I can certainly see that those items are worth holding onto depending on nerfs to existing gear or might have some trade value. 
---
I also disagree that special stats matter that much in Fallout 76. At least for my heavy weapons / power armor build, what do special stats do for me?
---
AA4tw, thanks.
---
Have to buy them in enclave store. Have just bought four mods.  Haven’t seen any plans yet.
---
They have zero administration support tools for this game. It baffles me completely.
---
This isn't always the case
---
Not at all surprised at this. I was unlucky enough to get 3* wood armor. Read about it reverting on here. Sure enough when I logged back it was one star. At least it's pretty easy to get more.
---
Ouch, well add me and check anyway later.
---
Flooping_pig but won't be on until this evening
---
Regular has been dropped a few times also available at the bunker but I just got a bunch at the purveyor yesterday which is nice!
---
This is not just a good idea. It's the GREATEST IDEA.
---
I like to imagine actually being in the wastes with limited resources, so I've basically built some sheds with my workbenches inside and camp fire outside, one or two ornaments and a generator to power water purifiers. That's enough more me and I'm lazy.
---
But I really enjoy finding some of these incredible constructions that clearly have a designer/architect's mind behind them, always spend time in them, if the owner is actually there I like to leave a bag of goodies to say 'Well Done!'
---
It's far more complicated than the star count, although there's now a base price due to the legendary vendor, which I'd place at about 10 caps per point of scrip.
---
Generally you're looking for combinations of popular weapons and popular stars, so you need to know what those are. 1-3k caps for a good weapon with a good first star, 5-15k for two good stars. For armor the third star is much more important.
---
Wow amazing that the purveyor was ready so soon and full of bugs!!
---
I scrapped some scout armor and didn't get anything at all. Not even scrap. So I don't think there are any plans.
---
I'm glad this hasn't happened to me yet. I pretty much accept most invites to share the inspirational perk card.
---
Hazmats are a no go for me since i play a melee build, and i take like a lot of damage all the time
---
Asian languages and some others are all broken. Switched from Chinese to English for the legendary rolls
---
Not to distract from your point that it's an absolutely amazing improvement over the current method of legendary acquisition...
---
But what haters?
---
I have yet to see a post complaining that it's bad. Maybe a couple posts complaining about their ill luck or asking for a daily or overall scrip cap increase.
---
Totally agree on the mad amount of purifiers too, no one is that thirsty they need 30 bottles an hour! I tend to build just single level farmhouse outbuildings but with super luxury interiors. So what if I have a grand piano and a feature brahmin pen, my house my style. I think it'd be great to be able to build camps within some world structures. I definitely dig the warehouse vibe, for doing warehouse stuff in
---
Yes, I logged out as quickly as I could.
---
I finally found mine at the water park after server hopping for 45 minutes. That’s the easiest place imo
---
This man budgets! I agree, more opportunities for a good weapon.
---
Dang, figured they weren’t in the game. Thanks for the reassurance.
---
I got a piece of 3\* wood yesterday but my plan was to just recycle it and get scrip...lol
---
Yeah this was the nightmare scenario that I am concerned about, which is why I posted this thread.
---
This is actually a very plausible reasoning.
---
It will be done to minimise latency. I'm sure they could tie that data to the Vending machine but that would be like having another player on the server per vending machine.
---
If this is the case I'm sure there will be a fix for it but it may end up reducing item capacity if there is not enough play left on the server or we may not get another inventory size increase for our cache in the future.
---
again you are ignoring everything I said. Yes I believe you should have a choice to be evil in a fallout game.
---
Where did I say that no one should be able to avoid my bullshit. I never said that even check my orginial post look that the 5 suggestions (not mine but I agree with most) it gives the player an option as a pacifist to not have thier camps destoyed then all you have to do is not take a workshop.
---
Its not the same in survival, you can't be wanted in the same way. when you were wanted in survival it literally meant you were a wanted man on the map. in survival noone ever does it because there is no point. Even then you get for for doing something that is really expected in that on that mode killing people. Killing in adventure is hated as you clearly display because you become villainised. 
---
Again I'm interested in both being a raider and pvp you miss quoting me a again and just saying oh all you wanna do is rob people... no I wanna rob people in adventure and pvp in survival. For the reasons I said above you can't really do that in survial cos no one carries anything. 
---
And Ill say it again for good luck I'm not saying my playstyle should be the end all, like I said in my suggestions pacifist would protect you from all of it just don't take a workshop... All I'm saying is pacifist should not be the only playstyle.
---
Please tell me what is unreasonable about my requests suggestions 1-5, if gives pacifists a way out and makes my playstyle easier.
---
Also if you are pc player and need mods, I can modify your gatling plasma.
---
Sounds good, I’ll swing by.
---
What did I miss? What's up with wood armour?
---
I had a similar issue with a 3\* Executioner's Salvaged Assaultron Head. After I added it to my vending machine, then logged... it turned into a 2 star and the Executioner's effect was gone... Was really confused when it happened. It now says "Salvaged Assaultron Head" with +10% damage while aiming and +1 agility. lol
---
I’ve had this issue for over a week. Contacted support multiple times as well as a few community managers on Reddit. I’m 90% sure our characters got corrupted causing us to not play on our main accounts. 
---
So I basically wasted hundreds of hours on this game. Hopefully there’s a fix one day but I’m quitting until that happens :/
---
Furious Minigun: +33% VATS hit chance and 25% less VATS Action Point cost.
---
Medic's MG42: Bullets explode for area damage at 20% base effect, can't remember the third bonus.
---
I'm naked as we type
---
The standard beam mod will stop that.
---
The Highschool is a great place to get your kills with a crossbow. All low level scorched and you can rack up on plastic. Do you get XP for finishing more than the required 3 challenges?
---
Someone's jealous and had a bad day.
---
My idea is to have the lockpick and hacker perks active at all times without taking a perk slot as long as you have the necessary skill points in perception and intelligence.
---
Yes, please.
---
Yes. When Fallout 12 comes out, they are in big trouble.
---
Literally just happened to me. Loading back in right now..
---
It's just not fair though, because then you can have weapons almost as powerful as bloodied weapons but without the handicap of very low health.
---
25% I think is a fair boost but I wouldn't complain if it was 50% increase.
---
Absolutely! I’d love a “hunter weapon to kill radstags” or “nocturnal to kill fireflies”, I like where you are going with this.
---
I got legendary war drum.
---
What about it just showing a server wide emote (stop motion flare explosion).
---
I would also like to have mods for the flare gun (lol). Fireworks mod, explosion colors, and the ability for it to explode on impact (I don't care if it does damage)
---
Yes exactly.
---
I came across one last night near Deathclaw Island that was actually a small village, and each little building was built by the road. It even came with a church. I was pleasantly surprised.
---
My camp is a little beginners hub by Vault 76. It's just a little cabin, but it's functional and looks, well, realistic. That's as far as my decorating and building skill goes.
---
I feel this so hard.
---
read the latest patch notes
---
Didn't even think manning collectors and harvesting!  That would be pretty cool.
---
It would be amazing if Bethesda added the ability to play audio streams via the pip boy. That way we could actually communally tune into the best of these while in game.
---
PA users already have nearly the best of all worlds with little drawbacks to it when you get your perk build in order. What legendary effects or carrots on the stick for ppl to hamster wheel should be minor and utility based, nothing stat or combat related. Example being extra carry weight legendary effect, reduce weight on meds or junk effect, fridge spoil timer compensation legendary effect since they don't get backpacks, and things like that.
---
some say yes, some say no.  it's up to you to decide
---
I say it is a bug. Didn't say anything about shooting a gun or using any weapon. Also, whitesprings bots are npcs so pacifist doesn't matter. Nothing you wrote has any bearing on what I posted.
---
Yeah. I'm guessing there's one random item generator and it creates dropped items as well as these items. 
---
The simple solution would be an "if-then" routine that check to see if the 3* is wood and re-rolls it if it is.
---
This would be a nice addition to the upcoming "Legendary" status for players perhaps.
---
Depends, if you plan on keeping it for yourself, then yes. If you plan on selling it, 3* will bring in value
---
they disabled that last patch. it is now decorative and is full of the best imaginary wine around
---
I should have said that I was on the Xbox platform. But thank you for the offer.
---
How many times can I smash that upvote button?
---
Yeah. Still a pain in the ass. I wear power armor every time to avoid death.
---
My apologies but I'm just trying to add some content that may suit the rest of the community instead of just one person. I know what it's like to do my business or clean myself in the field for training. Gone two sets of weeks without a shower in the summer. I'm not trying to start any problems.
---
The key is to find existing structures to build off or around. 
---
They add some unique-ness to your camp and can allow you to extend out your build budget by incorporating it into your build. 
---
There was a guy here who posted his warehouse/industrial compound. It had like 3 smaller out building and a bigger main warehouse/garage-y thing. 
---
He built off the back of some shanty and truck.
---
I wish all events would do this. I mean. It takes 3 seconds to pop up in the corner and disappear. Not hindering much
---
Wow there is no way that's a copy and paste reply...
---
Oh it's okey, and you're welcome then.
---
The best tertiary effect I could ever hope to get is reduced weight. And while that is really good, I don’t think the incredibly slim chance to get it is worth 50.
---
No plans for the mods they only come from the enclave vendor.
---
Yes, that’s the thing to do
---
There is no “PVP” server.  There is Adventure and Survival.  PVP is one aspect of both. 
---
This is a survival video game; there is no bullying.  Dying always had little consequence, anyway.  Don’t take things so personally. 
---
Low level characters can be quite strong with a good build.  Low level characters are often more willing to fight than high level characters.  Low level characters can often be found WITH high level characters.  
---
Bases can be rebuilt with one button press.  It happens to everybody.  Junk is plentiful. 
---
PVP is not synonymous with. griefing.  Many players enjoy PVP.  All players that PVP are not idiots.  Saying that is idiotic in itself.
---
It almost killed it for me. Then I basically just buckled down and got it done. Now that I have it, I’m glad that I do, but wonder if it was really worth the hassle.
---
3 star auto stim wood chest.... my first pull.
---
Wait.. Did you put in a ticket just because the piece of armor you got was wood?
---
Historically, they've been exceptionally slow to clean up lists like these.  It's why "Legendary" Drills and Syringers are still a thing.  Combined with a general lack of due diligence to begin with ("Gee, should this be in the list at all?") and it's a potent mix.
---
There’s a slight difference in mechanics between chameleon armor and the mutation. With the armor, swinging your melee wont break the effect. With the mutation, you become visible for a second.
---
ive had it happen a few times on ps4 as well since the patch berfore the purveyor one
---
It does seem to me that many of the people who are disappointed went for the three star stuff. I only went for two star, because on 99 percent of 3 star items I have, the third star is a useless effect.  By only going for two star, it increased the number or drops I could get because they are so much cheaper. More drops means better odds.  I got a bloodied explosive Gatling gun which I am very pleased with. The rest were shit, but like I said, I expected most to be shit, but increased my odds by going with two star only.  The third star seems to be more or less a vanity thing.
---
Lame.  Are there no other phobias that they felt the need to tip toe around?
---
Not the diluted version which is why I use it so often.
---
Some people just want to see the world borked.
---
It was an honest question.  I apologize you were offended by my question.
---
Shame saw it too late.
---
But congrats! 😊
---
ah man im at work, but a scavenger hunt sounds like fun!
---
We have a runner, but will they find it...?
---
Please post here if you do.
---
Sad people that downvote everything, this sub is lousy with them.
---
In the next edition of Skyrim we will find out what happened....
---
Oh that's normal at Least they didn't explain how to use the vendor like it was your fault something erroneous happened within the game.
---
Mmmmuuuuaaaaahhhhh everyone wants us to be evil but were peace keeping surivors. We only want the world to know we are here to help and sell cheap
---
Did you have it on your player upon death? 
---
If so it's gone unless you can magically rejoin that server and find your loot bag.
---
and I don't bu if you don't you could loose a PvP battle
---
No, lol. I put in a ticket after spending 300 scrip on armor to get five 3* wood armor bits that all reverted to 1* bits after relogging
---
There was a time when I never thought I would be in possession of 7 different 3 star weapons that I found to have little value. Ironically, most were worth 40+ scrip so it will take a few times to recycle them.
---
I will admit the fountain of fire looks stunningly amazing
---
It actually does-- their goal is to phase in functionality and keep the game going years to come.  What better way then to piecemeal scrip and keep players on the legendary teet.
---
If this works out, I'll do another one later. ;)
---
I know Bethesda members read up on ideas here, so I hope it's something they consider for a future update. Maybe they could implement it by the time our Vault raids get added? Would be a nice way to gather a group outside of our existing friends list.
---
If you drink to eat too much liquid based foods or eat foods mostly in junk you could have issues. Diarrhea, constipation, bloating, having a hangover, and so on from having the same item consumed too much. This makes you want to use other aid items.
---
You have some great ideas and this why I enjoy discussing with those who make an attempt to think outside the box.
---
Everyone seems to think that it needs to be very minimalist and not as realistic as possible. Your character is an extension of you in the game and needs to be taken care of.
---
If your game crashes then when you re-log you won’t be on the same server. And if you’re not storing most of your useful valuable junk in your stash box then it’s pretty much your own fault. I mean you knew the risks.
---
Hell, i still use some of my one star weapons. Anti armor alone is fine, IMO with no other effects, at least in certain situations.
---
Since creating this post I've been trying to connect an Aluminum extractor at the Poseidon Energy Plant without success. I're tried everything, even building new connectors but nothing works.
---
I went to see him, but he didn't like getting his picture taken. He went aggro, started spitting and yowling and, I think, even bit me before running away.
---
We're posting Anthem drops now?
---
Whoever downvoted needs to turn their account over to you because incel chode is a complete smashing. There is no stimpak that will bring them back.
---
I got one, I think it is a suppressors, but I cant remember the other 2 effects. I run melee and heavy guns though. I have no use for it. Also got a couple junkies guns.
---
Yes it's lost.
---
I would suggest stashing the important junk next time.
---
I love this, have my upvote.
---
As I stated they are right.  
---
And both are equal in different ways. Crippling is really good at disabling some hostiles.
---
Okay, thanks for the info.
---
Yes,i have it on my player. R.I.P.
---
Thanks for the link man!
---
I think server-wide might be a bit much, but I do like the idea of an area notification.  Make it one of the VeryLargeArea events, and everyone inside it (simulation of visual range I would guess) gets notified that a player has requested assistance.  
---
I don't like the idea of a forced payout though.  Just a notification is enough.  You can use it to flag events, cryptids, or even just plain old "ask for assistance"  
---
TBH though....Maybe just making the flares a lot more visible, increasing their brightness and range...and adding a nice loud pop to it would be enough.  Make flares something that actually get attention drawn to them by the people in visual/audible range.  You might need to use more than 1.  Welcome to real life.
---
This happened to me once. If I remember correctly, I died from rads while entering my power armor. When I respawned, I was not in my power armor and couldn't use my pip-boy. I then attempted to enter an unclaimed power armor frame and this glitch happened to me.
---
Gotcha! I just didn’t see a PSN in the post.
---
If you are looking for some griefy pvp situations on ps4 I got a group for you!!
---
Mine usually turn out to be pretty basic boxes but I pride myself on clean wiring. I miss all the elaborate setups we could build in Fallout 4 but there is still some neat stuff that can be done in this game.
---
I think he means what if the helper comes and doesnt actually help. The person who fired the flare isnt going to pay the helper if they just stood there and didnt do anything, but after the combat is over and the timer runs out pvp will be initiated even though the helper did nothing
---
I've done some game design and coding (very basic level though), and have had enough experience in the field to at least recognize some issues when they drop up.
---
You've got 2 competing issues - data replication, and data portability.  You either have to double the character data (roughly) to fix this, or find a way to move the data on-demand without bogging down the servers.  Both of those will tie into latency.
---
I think the issue here isn't really tied to any of that though - it may be designed that way just by default, without considering remote vending.  We're working with a bit of a Frankenstein's monster here, bits and pieces kludged together to make...something.  I don't think the solution to this would really have a huge effect on the servers, though there's no way to be sure from afar.
---
If that's not the case, I think the issue is...preventing other problems I won't go into.  I think fixing this could potentially open up some doors that we don't want opened, if not handled correctly.
---
F
---
As others as said, if the owner is present, you can view all stats. Still can’t inspect during player to player trades
---
"How about a Mr. Handy for your CAMP..."
---
Really, you can stop right there.  It's great.
---
Sound good
---
Joining in with that campfire tales event on my low level character is a nightmare. I try to hit the legendary creature for that sweet loot and it's already dead before I can even see it.
---
It turns out that they're pretty easy to ignore, if you don't want to deal with them.
---
Right, it’s not a huge deal. I’m more salty than anything else. One piece was unyielding with wwr **sobs**
---
Yeah  exactly.   By paying only 50 scrips per drops, you can get way more drops which increases your odds.
---
Because they came out and people realized how none consequential they are. You can literally farm stacks from SBQ. No one is winning the game buying kits. It was stupid to rage anyways.
---
OMG yasss the plumbing would be awesome. My character can finally have working water.
---
Cause it’s not really pay to win. I understand it’s not good and could lead to bad things but why not let them make money off people who want to pay for them.
---
You sure? I have several legendary .44s painted gold. I've never lost one.
---
It didn’t effect anything so no point beating a dead horse my dude. Just protest it by not buying them.
---
You can get it from the purveyor as a 3*, but it will revert to a 1* after relogging
---
Only if it can be destroyed by enemies.
---
Otherwise, might as well have more items that play the game for you so you don't have to.
---
So, what was up with the rudeness? Everyone's always so quick to be rude on the internet, shit's immature.
---
Move.
---
This is the right way to workaround the problem.
---
Nevertheless, they really should address this problem.  I have no idea what the hang up is, or why this is still a thing half-a-year later.
---
We need some place for utracite mods then, the queen is the only place to get them, and since they removed the serum plans from her pool, that’s Basically the only unique thing she has.
---
Just found out.  My 3 star wood changed when I logged in this morning. Bah.
---
I’ve read about this. Sheesh haha
---
Up voted.  👍
---
*Solved
---
Happened to me too. I logged out before I saw the glitch on here. The worst part is going to be the “wood armor glitched!?!!” Posts for the next two months
---
Very tailored
---
Move your camp. Lol
---
I never understood the crazy reactions. I have gotten like 20 of the better versions from the and never used 1. There's so much material in the game, there's never a problem to repair anyway
---
https://youtu.be/-nHNHIDduH4
---
(Don't take the video the wrong way. It's just a funny video from home alone. This is what made me think of when you said you filthy animal.)
---
Some zip codes in the wasteland are just too dangerous
---
The other danger is some items will disappear if you mod them, happened to me on a rifle but not on a gatling laser, goodbye rifle.
---
It's a pretty valid point, though.
---
True haha
---
No because they already data mines that refrigerators will be in the atomic store now and also I'm level 77 with good armour and weapons and still can't illit with squad
---
If you don't care for that third star I guess you will have a better chance at finding what you are looking for if you do it more times.
---
So thinking the above yes you are better off using the 2*.
---
Once you get that 2* you always wanted you can try your luck on the 3* to get the perfect roll you need.
---
I'm not sure if you are missing my sarcasm, or I'm missing yours. I got a very similar reply.
---
It will take longer to fix it than two months 🙃
---
Not if you're away from your CAMP because they can't see the third additional star under any circumstance. On some guns you can determine the second star because the name will have the first and the description will have the second. I think the two star is the better roll for personal use and selling right now. The only downside is that if you get a roll that won't even sell then you don't recoup as much scrip 30% vs. 40% from the legendary machine.
---
I bought some last night
---
I'm totally just guessing
---
Set a turret out away from your camp and make sure it is facing the wall that gets attacked. I set up turrets to have an overlapping field of coverage paying special care to make sure that they protect each other as well.
---
It's only a game though.
---
The exams weren't hard at all.
---
Yeah i got a few pices myself. Id like to get more tho so im wondering if hunting legendarys like usual will get me any.
---
Btw i have an extra 3* LL...nothing special, but if u got any forest scout pieces youd trade or need a LL, let me know...i dont care how many stars or what the effect is...just trying to get a set
---
I’m being sarcastic, yes. They’ve received a lot of tickets, I’m sure
---
honestly, the only reason people were ever upset by this is because they said the atom shop would be purely cosmetic. and now they added something non cosmetic. 
---
repair kits are nice. people even asked for them when the game first came out. but them being in the atom doesn’t really affect the game, it just breaks a promise. and also sets a kind of dangerous precedent. i don’t personally believe they’ll add anything pay to win to the atom store, but others aren’t that faithful, and i understand why.
---
I play for MANY hours a week and I seldom run across enough Scorched Officers to get any data for a nuke decode.. Thank god for nuka crypt
---
well for a start it's already shown to be affecting future content with data miners finding refrigerators in the atomic shop
---
A few broken turrets and damaged walls in exchange for two legendary drops....uhh... sounds like a fair trade.
---
That has nothing to do with it, if its a good 3* its easy to sell in on the trading sub for fo76, player vending is for the lower tiers
---
I put boiled water, common plans, .38 and other assorted things
---
I FINALLY got into doing nice, clean wiring. Like literally last week, hahaha
---
I can't move my camp, I'll have to start over. I could actually deal with it because they're only destroying the bottom level, but then everybody who comes to my vending machine is going to have to fight them.
---
This is an amazing idea but people will find ways to abuse the system. Things are complicated enough right now so I don’t see this being implemented soon. They can’t even fix duping...
---
Short Night Vision Scope. Lmao
---
Yes please! I want some nice looking wall papers to complement all the floors they keep adding.
---
Can we get plans for them now or just the items themselves?
---
This works for me, every time
---
&gt;I can't move my camp, I'll have to start over
---
This guy doesn't know, does he?
---
Glad I wasn’t the only one that recognized ark poop! I knew immediately LOL
---
I am against it because of that. If it was just you got it from the SBQ i would not mind but the fact there's now data mines info about more stuff coming thats like refrigerators and more
---
I didn't want to say  specifically what I got because I didn't want to hear people saying "actually that weapon sucks."  Because there's always at least one.
---
its dekotora and a freaking amazing idea for a camp
---
Its gonna be in the atomic shop because thats how they give out free things. Like the punchbowl, posters etc. Thats how false rumors fly around
---
You might be right. When I was searching for a way to deal with them I noticed a lot of people asking where to find Yao Guais. I might have hit the jackpot.
---
I did it for a guy by simply having my feet in the water and him fully in the water. Not in a team then i shot at the ground with my two shot explosive weapon handmade. Went into revive mode very easy
---
Well, sort of.  Some clothes have variants tied to gender (lab coat, Grognak/Wildman rags, etc).
---
But I don't know why these restrictions exist on clothes and hair.  Really shouldn't make any difference.
---
Reverse.  Connect the wire from the other point instead
---
Maybe but stuff like radios, and more where just added into the camp menus
---
I got the gatling gun you mentioned last night. Guess I will see if anything happened to it when I log in after work.
---
can any one help me get and explosive short Gatling gun - user: Geiger72
---
So glad I wasn't the only one! My first thought was "I love fishing in my games!"
---
Followed almost immediately by "What ungodly monsters would come out of the water in the wasteland??"
---
I agree and disagree. This could lead to people joining an event doing nothing and at the end scavenging loot that they didn't earn. Now I see what you are saying and it sucks if you do contribute but to get a chance at the legendary. It's a lose lose situation.
---
DETECTING TERMINATED MANAGEMENT PERSONAL. REMOVE THIS INDIVIDUAL FROM THE PREMISES.
---
Radios were in the camp menu during beta so thats why. Thats been the only thing ever directly added.
---
That'd be fantastic.
---
Also, we would need to be able to name our robot butlers.
---
I think the intended idea of perk cards is deciding on a type of build you are going for. There isn’t much else I use intelligence and perception for so I always have level 3 hacking and lock picking hard locked into those slots. The only perks I ever really switch out is the one that gets me more money from vendors, and the one that uses less resources to craft ammo, and a team xp perk whenever I play with my friend. 
---
I think ultimately to reduce frustration, you may just need to make a tradeoff and respec so you can get more slots. For the longest time I had a level 3 mysterious stranger and decided it was not worth the bugginess of his AI so I just put those 3 extra luck points into my strength so I could fully max out the damage of my double barrel shotgun. I like the perk system how it is personally. Its a trade off system that wants you to make a specific type of character, yet they do give you some kind of liberty to change things like of course your SPECIAL points.
---
lol. thats funny, i wasnt sure ether and only wanted the lead lining one so once i saw i had the 15 i was like o im good
---
Great thank you. Sounds a million times better than the challenges.
---
I'm ready friend! We can have great adventures, I have instrument to play at camp and we can chat about our builds and trade gears!
---
Well fingers crossed it is an easy thing to fix as I'm not buying from anybody's stash until I can inspect the item.
---
Yeah that's why I wasn't bothered since I got some cool weapons. I ended up with a bloodied/power swing/end bone club. But ....I legit feel bad for folks that may have gotten multiple 3* wood pieces. That would be frustrating.
---
To be honest, I can’t really complain as at level 132 most of my kit is 2 or 3 star anyway and there isn’t anything in particular I want lol.
---
Yup and they found loot box’s with boosts, but until things are implemented it’s all just guess work could be free like the terminal and player vending. 
---
I completely agree as little money on micro transactions as possible, but they gotta make money somewhere to keep servers and patches and with no paid dlc where is it gonna come from
---
I mean, after finding out how much they rushed it it's not that surprising.
---
Haha I was hoping they had addressed some of the placing the camp issues by now. I'm assuming you're comment means that it's still a pain in the ass.
---
This. A GOD roll has 3 stars always. And the best possible 3.
---
Lucky...Got an AA Missle Launcher
---
That needs fixing as well.
---
ahhh... what?
---
&gt;a B25 15% reload .50 cal, which is the highest dps weapon in the game
---
not only is that incorrect for reasons I'll get to in a bit, the LMG since the buff now has higher dps than a .50 cal, even with the constant reloading.
---
&gt;only possibly surpassed by an AA25 .50 cal
---
it's not. bloodied is always better. in fact, most things are better than aa, even against the queen. furious, for example. someone made a calculator and you can check it out for yourself.
---
&gt;or maybe a full glass cannon bloodied unyielding meat hook build (even then I'm not convinced that it's more dps)
---
if you're doing it properly, namely sneak, then yes, it is. by a huge margin.
---
&gt;the handmade is crap unless you're doing pvp. anything but a B25 .50 cal is garbage in comparison if you're talking dps. 
---
that is... wow. no, a stealth VATS crit commando build sporting- wait for it- a handmade is the highest dps build in the entire game by a long shot.
---
&gt;for my heavy weapons / power armor build, what do special stats do for me?
---
you're kidding me, right? a proper bloodied PA build relies heavily on AP. melee is also entirely reliant on strength.
---
&gt;I only care about the value of an item, and I can certainly see that those items are worth holding onto
---
you do you man, but it's obvious you need some help. personally, I'd just sell most of them for cheap or outright feed them back to the hole.
---
In our Discord we created our own Radio Station with old-timey commercial breaks, news and story in a lore based way. It just runs 24/7. But yeah...when mod support comes eventually we want to make that station and this podcast a downloadable mod.
---
I wish i could jump as far to conclusions as you do.
---
He said he was custom built into a bridge. Does he know what? That there are other bridges just like his?
---
Ahhh...I misunderstood. Your correct about the water. I made sure I was in the shallow end. I know a lot of people have been having issues with this one 😁
---
This isn't griefing or a glitch. People are using the system as intended by Bethesda.
---
Be sure to open a support ticket if you haven't already.
---
Cosmetic items people are asking for such as mainy new floors and walls papers
---
I will die for your swims. 
---
GT:  RhymingFezzik
---
Yup. But complainers gunna complain.
---
You can accept team invites any time, when fast traveling, on loading screens.. anything. Not saying you should have, just saying it'll never have a negative impact on your game.
---
It's the same developer.
---
Appreciate you. 😊
---
Hahaha, thank you! 😊
---
Best bet is to use spotlights, they let turrets target outside your camp circle and increase their accuracy. Ive had luck with heavy laser turrets and 1 missile launcher for each enemy you expect to be attacking.
---
i love you, thanks
---
might want to use a disease cure and antibiotics just to be safe =]
---
I'm a Veteran and this bugs the shit out of me that the .50 isn't the most powerful weapon in the game.
---
Because, I have experience with .50, 7.62, and 5.56 I know it's a game but if your using rl mechanics for other aspects then why wouldn't you use the same with ballistics.
---
I hoped purveyor will allow upgrading items so that I would make full wood armor alien blaster PvP wtf build.
---
That sounded like Shadow Man there at the end.
---
Call it what you want its still a playstyle that should be allowed in a fallout game.
---
I've been told that Supposedly the restrictions were put into place so the c.a.m.p stuff wasn't "lore breaking"
---
I'm almost 100% certain they have failed at that.
---
😈 you sir gave me good advice.. nipples everywhere! Muhahaha!
---
Well plenty of food, two legendaries to either sell or trade in and all the leather you want from the hides... all for a few basic junk to repair it all... it sounds like you’re significantly better off. Particularly if the legendaries are a regular occurrence.
---
The caliber of your post is astounding.  :)
---
Btw. What platform are you on? If PC, then I'd happily help upu research.
---
That's another variable. You're right if you are active on the market then the third star is key. I would guess less than 5% of players are active on the market.
---
Then you'd need another Mr. Handy to fix the first broken one.
---
Haha, yep. I dropped five. Sigh
---
Lmao. I hope I get one
---
True but what’s difference between a floor and buying a fridge one at least serves a purpose
---
Yep, I've noticed this a few times, people use it like a doorbell to say "look, I'm at your camp".
---
I've gotten sales each time I went back too, so it works.
---
You think it's ok to whitesplain like that to me? Don't mock my culture and then patronize me about it. Ya'll sidin with the white appropriator and downvotin the only nigga in this thread lls
---
The sight is intimidating...you got that going for ya.
---
The last holotape we got from her is after we launch the first nuke, so she managed to survive the one where she was injured. We don't know what happened to her or where she is.
---
no it's still waiting on a agent
---
 *All I know is ball and good... and rape!*
---
For a more reasonable price I might... if I can use it like a lance!!
---
The game released half a year ago and this is still not fixed?
---
it's me again. the flamer is 3star +50 dam res while aiming, ignore 50% armor, and 40% bashing damages.
---
same nick on PC. yours for a small loan of millon dollars xd
---
Happens to more than just wood. My Salvaged Assaultron head did this.
---
Irrational hysterionics can only be maintained for so long before exhaustion sets in.
---
Ouch. That's rough. I've played since launch and used to report all the bugs and glitches I ran into. Including the Assualtron head eating my entire stash of almost 2k ammo. But got discouraged after getting mainly the same canned response.
---
Go to Flatwoods, put your weapon away, crouch, and slowly approach to milk. Get all the ones there and then server hop to repeat.
---
The biggest problem for me early on was changing my mindset. This is not a traditional Fallout game, and I went into it with the wrong outlook and looking for the wrong things.
---
As I played the game, I started to appreciate legitimately interesting layer cake of lore they built into the game. Vengeance, mistrust, revenge, blind rage, hope... there's a really interesting story about why West Virginia fell. It wasn't the nuclear bombs that brought about the apocalypse in West Virginia. It was fear.
---
The more I play the game, the more I feel the game is on par with any of Bethesda's other Fallout games, but the story needs to unfold and let itself be discovered in a different method.
---
To me, this game feels more apocalyptic than any of Bethesda's other offerings.
---
You're ignoring what *I* said. You abso-fucking-lutely have the choice to be evil. You just don't like the way that option was presented to you, and you feel like the game should work the way *you* want it to, and everyone else be damned.
---
Survival is a thing. It definitely needs work. I think it was a massive mistake on Bethesda's part to allow pre-existing characters to jump back and forth. And clearly there are other issues. But you don't want that, you want PvP to be the default when clearly no one else does.
---
Your suggestions are unreasonable outside of Survival because *they added Survival for PvP*. That's the point of it. So let's go down the list.
---
1. There is no reason for CAMPs to be destructible outside of a dedicated PvP mode. You don't gain anything from it at all. The only possible reason you could want this is griefing, plain and simple.
---
2. Again, sure, caps increase is fine. In Survival. There's really no point in Adventure. If you want PvP, play PvP.
---
3. Once again, perfectly reasonable in Survival. But most people taking workshops in Adventure either want resources or a space to build stuff without dismantling their CAMP. You *can* still take the workshop without killing the current owner, and there's no reason you should be able to kill a dude down in the Whitesprings shops just because he wanted lead from the Steel Yard. And if they come back to defend it? There you go, legitimate PvP.
---
4. There's really no point to this at all. Why should someone have to suffer stat-wise just because you wanna kill them 'til they have nothing left? That's some unbalanced bullshit right there. "Oh yeah I killed you a dozen times and took all your money so now you also do less damage back to me and I can just maim you even more easily now".
---
5. This one really just cements the fact that you just want PvP to be an unbalanced shitshow where you can just harass people ad nauseam. If Awareness doesn't work in Survival, then that needs a fix. But everything you're saying just implies you want to kill random, unsuspecting players weaker than you. People play Adventure mode to, y'know, *go on an adventure*. Not look over their shoulders every .5 seconds because shitheads like you want to slaughter everyone. Pacifist mode shouldn't even need to exist when there is a game mode *dedicated to PvP*.
---
Also "misquoting"? You've said "I want to rob people" *twice* now. You literally just said that you want to rob people in the non-PvP mode.
---
A friend and I did it by jumping off the big water pipes behind Grafton Steel. Aim for the shallow area near shore below.
---
That doesn't mean it isn't easier for them to send an invite to get your attention, a "come back to camp".. on PS4 I don't think we have a way to message them, and it's kinda a pain in the ass to pull it up on my phone and type in whatever weird name they have.
---
I get it may apply less to you on Xbox, but I could still imagine people sending team invites as a quick way to get your attention.
---
Its a weird stat to begin with, because they arent doing ballistic damage, which is what anti-armor negates. So are you saying you simply want them to instead negate 50% of the targets energy resistance?
---
No worries ha the campfire event only ever gave me 2 but I bought my backpack mod
---
You, sir, are apparently full of s***.... knowledge
---
Thank you muchly :)
---
.. kind of like walking up to two people playing chess in the park, and proceeding to knock all of the pieces off the board.
---
"WHY YOU MAD BR0?!  IZZ ONLEEEY A GAME!@#"
---
Has it been proven they're "refrigerators", or just refrigerator skins?
---
No idea....i picked up a few mods , but i havent seen any plans yet
---
Going afk while accessing a unique vendor and blasting music over area chat is griefing.
---
Treating people like shit in real life or in a game, is still treating people like shit.  Don't be a sociopath.
---
I think the chronological order there is iffy though because that holotape triggers whenever you launch your first nuke and seems more fluid in when it is in the timeline.
---
It's certainly an impressive log, no argument :)
---
*You feel lighter*
---
Yep, I wondered when someone was going to recognize that.. it does check out.
---
It happens to me all the time whit anything from aid :/ Sooooo annoying!
---
YOU are too kind ^_^
---
Exactly internet rage lasts about a week tops unless the natonal media fuels it. Otherwise everyones tired and bored and on to the next thing like how underwhelming the burrows was.
---
You can't do that without a safety word.  Was there a safety word?
---
Wow, an exploding lever action? I'd love one of those. Lol
---
But I cant complain, yesterday RNG granted me an Explosive, 90% reduced weight, 10% damage when mutated Handmade rifle. It's my baby and it destroys everything. 
---
Grats on the RNG! Hope it slaughters a many!
---
 the event where you defend/ guide the Brahmin after you can milk those Brahmin and everytime they’ve given me milk
---
The Flaming Pitchfork mods were broken at the time so we couldn't equip them. By the time they fixed the mods we had all forgot the outrage.
---
Is this true of the Gamma Gun as well?  I assume an Anti-Armor Gamma Gun is something of a misnomer?
---
If you have one man army equipped sheer amount of hits makes limb damage pointless.
---
That's a very in-sight-ful comment ;D
---
Worked fine for me on Xbox. If in doubt, kill the cat and photograph it’s corpse a few times.
---
That's a good weapon!
---
Here's the thing, I already a have a TSE Lever that has 86 more damage than these 2 levers I got so I'm gonna be trading them.
---
What system? I could craft you some tonight if you're on PS4
---
If the light is green, the snap is clean!
---
In theory, at least... in practice, I can't get barn half walls to reliably stack
---
Ah got em mixed up ha! Still definitely worth the points!
---
No need for thanks, it was an enormous weight off my shoulders to share. And my colon.
---
I've had this issue also, managing to get to over 2k holotapes unintentionally. I hope this is fixed with the 9.5 patch as its really annoying
---
It’s lost...  store all junk in you stash.   Store important junk often. 
---
I keep about 50 of everything except for the most used items like screws, gears, Springs, adhesive, and aluminum which I keep about 100.  
---
Don’t store a lot of steel, its heavy and it’s easy to find and even easier to farm with the Scrapper perk.  Turn all lead into ammo as soon as you get it.
---
Yeah. I didn’t really expect anything out of all this. This post was made out of frustration more than anything else
---
Sorry to hear about this... I got one piece yesterday and I had read about it on here before so I immediately turned it in for scrip. I figured it was better to get the 24 back versus a lower amount for the 1 star.
---
The gamma gun has ballistic damage as well
---
It's a real videogame poo, if that's good enough? :)
---
Omg!! 🤯
---
The wiring is the hardest part of making any building in both 4 and 76.  I can never get the conduits to work like I want, so my home looks like its covered in black strings everywhere instead.  At least in 76 I'm finding it easier to hide wires and connectors inside of walls.
---
I’ve heard this happening with wood armor and while I can’t confirm I’m pretty sure I lost a star on my assaultron head I acquired because it doesn’t have a prefix legendary affect anymore
---
Is this the small western town in the toxic valley?
---
Honestly, getting stuck in the basement is more likely because players didn't realize that where you place your camp initially determines where you fast travel.. or perhaps they just haven't wanted to move their base since the update.
---
In any case, assuming that everyone is probably an asshole rather than considering the many reasons this may happen.. idk. Try to stay positive, there's less assholes than you think.
---
Folks can still join events, do nothing, and get the rewards for being at the event anyway, so I honestly don't care if someone stands around and gets to loot a legendary they didn't help kill. None of the events are hard except to maybe lower levels. 
---
Hell, I don't know how many times I ran into a horde event, had no interest in doing it, continued on my way and a few minutes later get rewarded for someone else completing the quest, lol. 
---
Now I definitely think my suggestion should never apply to SBQ and Imposter Sheepsquatch.
---
even thought your camera says it has film , try hitting the reload button that usually made the pictures work for me
---
I have about 50.  They actually have weight, and because they can't be sold or dropped, I'd be crazy not to use them.
---
Yup. Apparently assaultron heads and wood armor lose a star. Best to scrap them before logging off.
---
But perception its not intellect
---
Reduced weight is pretty much pointless as no matter how much it weighs, once on a PA frame it no longer matters.
---
But legendary effects that make them more durable, have higher ratings for DR or energy resistance, or disease or poison resistance would be appreciated.
---
Sweet thank you, I'll try that!
---
Both the Assaultron Head and Wood Armor are doing it for some reason.
---
Best bet is to immediately scrip them before the star is lost.
---
Like this suggestion a lot and we could possibly upgrade Mr Handy with a Buzz blade or two and power him up with Mr Handy fuel.
---
Raiders, base destroyers, and pet killers will be contributing directly to Bethesda's coffers by forcing infinite Mr. Handy purchases.
---
Everybody wins.
---
Yes wood armor assaultron heads lose stars scrap immediately for scrip.
---
Tbh I'm just saying that if you roll an anti-armor energy weapon, it should actually do something rather than nothing. How Bethesda would fix that, I'm not sure, I'm not a number cruncher, though I've read a few threads on this from months ago, and there have been some potential solutions floated. 
---
But it's just kind of outrageous that energy weapons don't get some equivalent benefit from the same legendary effect.
---
I 100% feel ya. I enjoy the shit out of this game but these little things are so frustrating. I've seen it several times on here but I think they really need test servers to catch this.
---
Nah, it's the small flop town in Savage Divide. We have five buildings fit in the camp space so far, but one is just generator storage
---
Yeah, that’s the thing to do
---
You shouldn't be putting in game mechanics to punish freeloaders at the expense of contributors. Will people abuse it and sit around for free loot? I'm sure of it, as they already do it in any capacity already available to them. But that frankly doesn't affect me whatsoever so I don't care. Not being able to loot mobs that I assisted in killed but didn't get a hit on does negatively affect me.
---
That would be awesome! Maybe they could reduce accuracy for enemies? :D
---
w(°ｏ°)w
---
_Sounds dreamy - Can I get an invite?_
---
A couple months ago there was a bug that happened when you were to deal like too much damage in a short period of time and after that u could'nt deal any damage but with melee weapons
---
Glad to see others experiencing this oddity. I'm still confused when I'm taking damage and not seeing something, only to look down and see a sleeping ghoul hitting me.
---
Very good advice ;)
---
I personally would rather they find their own fix rather than just copy what other games have done.. that's what makes this game feel like Fallout, and not some random shooter.
---
People are always going to try to game the system. Pacifist mode should just always keep you passive, that much I agree with.. the rest, not so much.
---
I saw a guy with a harpoon gun point it downward and then rapidly crouch and stand in such a way that it made it look like he had a giant dick and was fucking something with it..I was crying laughing on area chat
---
It still would take years to get exactly what the player wants for one character. I put a comment on this post with the math for it. It changes it from "this is never gonna happen" to "if I spend enough time it should". Plus some people use multiple build options that use different legendaries. I don't get why every one keeps assuming by making this change it's instant win. It's NOT. It would still take YEARS to get what you want. Players NEED to have a feasible goal or they won't work towards it
---
You don't happen to want a massive lump of turd to smear on that wood armour, do you? :/
---
You could have reduced weights for weapons, ammo, and everything else.
---
You're intended to launch a nuke in the endgame though. Launching a nuke is the last part of the vanilla story you get to do. So chronologically it is the last tape you get from her.
---
It's risk vs. reward. You can use it to your advantage in some cases, and it makes ws a little less boring.
---
Those too
---
Personally, they should remove AA from the table on energy weapons like they did explosives. If you want to add an "Overcharged" legendary effect that does the same thing but for energy resistance, that's fine. I agree though, it cant simply remain as a wasted legendary roll like it is now.
---
Well put!
---
&gt; not only is that incorrect for reasons I'll get to in a bit, the LMG since the buff now has higher dps than a .50 cal, even with the constant reloading. 
---
That's true, I always put the LMG out of mind because keeping it supplied with ammo is so stupidly hard. And I'm saying that as someone who uses ultracite ammo in my b25 .50 cal exclusively and farms hundreds of thousands of it per month.
---
&gt; it's not. bloodied is always better. in fact, most things are better than aa, even against the queen. furious, for example. someone made a calculator and you can check it out for yourself. 
---
The rumor i heard was that the queen gains armor per person, so with enough people there, AA can outscale bloodied, but for only a few people, yes, bloodied is always better. I haven't had an opportunity to test it yet though, so it's just a rumor.
---
&gt; that is... wow. no, a stealth VATS crit commando build sporting- wait for it- a handmade is the highest dps build in the game by a long shot. 
---
I have a character like this with a BE handmade, full unyielding AP regen armor. I sat there shooting queen for a long ass time (4-5 minutes) in stealth while she was on the ground, getting sneak attacks and lots of crits. I still wasn't doing shit for damage compared to my B25 .50 cal. Maybe I was doing something wrong, but I had all the relevant crit boosting / vats perks.
---
&gt; you're kidding me, right? a proper bloodied PA build relies heavily on AP. melee is also entirely reliant on strength. 
---
Why would a bloodied heavy weapons build require AP? I have no need of it. I run at 19% HP with no issues, even getting hit by the queen. True, I don't want to sit there eating her damage all day, but a few hits is fine.
---
I'm not here to get in a defensive argument with you. I respect what you're saying and I know that even after 600+ hours there are things I don't know, and I don't trust random people on the internet, I like to check things for myself, so you'll have to forgive me if I don't take your word as gospel. 
---
Here is a recent queen kill: [https://youtu.be/buqpQNy7WCE?t=1580](https://youtu.be/buqpQNy7WCE?t=1580) 
---
Fight took 2 mins 40 seconds, with a lot of randoms not helping much at all. 2-3 mins is my average when solo. I did have one friend there (Appa) using cryo on her. I also screwed up and forgot to use syringer until halfway through the fight. Other people in group / at fight were randoms and not really contributing much as far as I can tell.
---
In theory a meathook could be better dps, but only with sneak attacks. And that damage calculator you reference has a ton of bad information in it. It doesn't calculate many of the multipliers correctly (there's a huge discrepancy between what it says I should be doing and in game character sheet damage) among other things. It's a good reference but the values are not data mined and subject to human error.
---
Rolling
---
Lol this thread reminds me of Leviosaa
---
You could sell that for a substantial sum on the marketplace subs or discord. It’s one of the best leveling weapons there is.
---
Because I don't care.  I want a camp that has the necessities.  I threw down a deathclaw carpet and a few lamps, fuck it.
---
I get people who love to craft camps, spend hours customizing, but .. that's not me.  Not even close lol.
---
Don't let this frighten you, the majority of players are still good people. Just look out for what the player said, that they were making some bullshit excuse that they couldn't see their vendor- we all know that's bullshit.
---
Besides, any sign of fuckery and you can just leave world, no harm done. These trolls are like terrorists, if they change the way we play, they win.
---
*jumps slightly higher*
---
I'd like it to be a quest and we could get parts from other Mr. Handy's to rebuild one and then use the Tinkers Bench or a Terminal to set what it can do. Then it would say "Welcome Back sir." when I return to my Camp too.
---
I’m sitting on a 3* unyielding scout leg and 3* bolstering scout leg. They look awesome and hopefully they’ll have a better system for modifying down the line. Would love to complete a bloodied build with the set.
---
If you have a working toilet players will just drink out of it.
---
Thanks guys, I've responded to the UK players. The US time difference always makes things a little awkward.
---
I'm on PC.
---
Limb damage is worthless in pvp . In pve it's very useful, large enemies, including the queen can be much easier to deal with . I don't pvp at all so I prefer limb damage to other options. My second favorite is ffr.
---
Yes, but now my Stash is full of goddamn plant fibre :/
---
I’m curious about something.  We can rename items now.  If I rename an item and put it up for sale in the Vending Machine, it keeps the custom name when I look at it.  The question is whether a buyer sees the same name or if they just see the original name?
---
Something to test. If it works, we might be able to add the effects to the custom name. 
---
There is also room for abuse because the buyer won’t be able to confirm the effects but at least they can try contacting the owner to have them return to their base. 
---
Something to check out next time I’m online.
---
Does not make it right though. I actually am trying to complete a wood set, need a couple more unyielding pieces, just for the fun of it and would love to see the 3* stick so it's a little more viable. Plus you spent the scrip for essentially a 1* item in imposter 3* sheepsquatch clothing.
---
I never really cared in the first place.
---
Surprised that you chose to quote me though.
---
What’s wrong with his power armor, barring the obvious glitch
---
You are right, and now I'm a little nauseous! XD
---
Bummer, I'd have been your friend.
---
I don't like power armor either...but I've come to learn that it's a necessity until you can fully defend yourself with godlike armor.  The first time I stepped foot in power armor is when I launched my first nuke a week ago...and it helped A TON.  I still run a non PA build most of the time, but still carry it around with me in case things get hairy.
---
Can't say for sure but i think at least one drops from her.
---
Apologies on focusing on the body but there's been more mentions of passive cards being always on on Reddit and you barely mention "slots". It's only in the title.
---
Definitely not true of at least the lever action rifle gold paint Atom shop skin.  I've had mine break multiple times after heavy use and was able to repair it every time.
---
I mean it is a _literal_ shit-post, so you shouldn't feel bad about it at all! :)
---
Whoo. Your TSE must be a diamond of a weapon. I would love to find like a TSE Gatling Gun. Or a Two shot or Explosive. Gatling Gun is probably one of my favorites. And Resolute Veteran is amazing on it's own. 
---
Hopefully someone buys your guns. 👍🏼
---
i think i'm tired but i couldn't stop fucking laughing that you put a spoiler tag on that.
---
Hahahaha, no yours is worse, no contest. Unlucky! ;D
---
Defensive walls won't keep them out forever, but they will give them something to focus on while your turrets whittle away at them.  You just have to be careful with placement; enemies will obviously try to get around them or, worse, spawn inside them.
---
Also, don't forget to think vertically.  I don't know how you place your turrets, but I've found that putting them on roofs or elevated platforms keeps them out of reach of some attackers.
---
The mod plans are fine. The base crafting plans are a waste.
---
Tyvm ;D
---
I really enjoy this game too, and I’ve been looking forward to the purveyor for a long time. I don’t pretend to know the ins and outs, but it seems like this would be an avoidable mistake. Tbh, I wouldn’t even mind getting 3* wood armor, if I could keep it
---
Ooohhhhh, spicy burn :)
---
I'm camped next to a stream and have a cooking fire available - bums can boil their own water, haha.
---
You get the plan only once and from the first queen you killed!
---
Why is his PA breaking so often?  He should use Perks and make sure they're being crafted by a high Intelligence build, or buff INT before building them.  I can't recall the last time my Excavator primary PA had anything break, and only just recently had to repair the legs.  Before that I can't recall the last time I had to repair them.
---
Thing is, it wastes a lot of time to reinvent the wheel. There are things that took literally decades of slow, iterative process to really streamline. Once the wheel is invented, there's no point in trying to reinvent it, especially if the team doing it isn't particularly good. Because instead of a round wheel, then end up with a rhombus. And the users end up with sore bottoms from all the bouncing when they ride a cart (the game) with rhomboid wheels.
---
You have to make a level 15 cross bow. You can shoot it 5 times and it will accept repair again.
---
Well we can be friends here :)
---
pretty sure his response is just a reflection of the questioners point results. Not an assertion of dickishness.
---
This would cause lots of baiting and trolling
---
Got 5 level 1 guns on a level 3 mule.
---
I have a bar in my camp and I sell Drink so if you did hang around you could entertain yourself easily.
---
The cracks in the code shouldn't be there in the first place but we both know that's an impossibility the problem is that some people feel obliged to exploit them.
---
You can make formaldehyde with bleach dogwood, turpentine, and three cartons of cigarettes.
---
Right. That’s the frustrating part. I would be very happy with 3* wood armor!
---
However, there's still a 50 percent chance to strike heads. Even if the rng chance is small, if you roll it enough times, CHANCES are you'll get it.
---
It’s not a glitch, but it is griefing.
---
I had the exact opposite experience. I started with a level 50 and it would not degrade. I killed 50 or so enemies and could not repair. I switched to a level 15 and was able to accomplish all three repairs in less than 10 minutes.
---
That quad exploding lever action one is nice, I'm annoyed there's no mod to increase armor capacity of mine.
---
You can when you get to 998. It tells you eg. it's worth 5 but you'll only get 2
---
Here are the mods, rifled barrels, beam focuser, and reflex sight. Also I even have the prime receiver but I am not making ultracite plasma cores. Gatling Plasma shreds everything!!!!! Muhahaha
---
3* wood also immediately registered as 1* after being gifted to me from a friend. 
---
I’m probably one of the very few that actually wanted 3* wood pieces. It’s been mostly cosmetic so far for my character, but tacking some more effects on might’ve made them a BIT more practical. 😪
---
YES. The greatest idea of all! 
---
Seriously, I constantly just travel around the map to collect junk, so knowing I had a Mr Handy fixing my stuff would be comforting as I tread across the wastelands.
---
I’ve rolled 4 times for 3* ranged weapons and haven’t gotten anything super duper amazing yet. I’m willing to keep farming, rolling until I get what fits my character. 
---
I would AGREE - keep the purveyor the way it is for now. Give it time.
---
Look on your roof
---
 Fireproof is a useful Endurance perk. Depending on daylight might not be the best way.
---
 Adrenaline is strong. AP is nice but you can take care of your own health quite well.
---
 Makeshift is useful but consider that there are situations where you want your weapons to degrade as fast as possible. I only use it to make stuff. ;)
---
 You are stuck with 2 hand, is that really what you want?
---
depending on the rolls I would buy one for 6K
---
Should is a strong word. Let me reach a compromise idea, what if insted of having to find loopholes for pvp in adventure you could do like a daily quest from rose that would mark you as a raider on the map and would let you hunt people to your content BUT once you die the quest is over and you gain a raider currency depending on how many players you killed  or workshops you ransacked. 
---
I do enjoy raiders ( some of my funniest times playing was going back and forth with a raider over my workshops) and I think that there should be a way to have a happy medium were players dont feel like they are being griefed but raiders have the thrill of the chase.
---
Hahaha. A man must have his secrets, don't you think?
---
eh, it's still a good effect as it is.  
---
Other primary effects with more % damage are situational.  Making 2 shot always double damage it's just the flat out god tier best option 100% of the time, and imo despite "realism" good game design doesn't funnel all players to the same items.
---
Definitely plausible based on the guns I've gotten at max and not-max level so far.
---
What are you talking about
---
Log out log in. Camp restored.
---
Right.. I don't like it when I see big guys picking on the little guys.. I would have responded to his plea... It's one thing to PVP the little, but another to steal their junk bag. I mean really?...
---
I forget what it is called, but there is a chem weight reduction perk under Strength.   I always carry a ton of chems, especially with level 3 Pharma Farma perk.   
---
Selling chems to the vendors became my way of maxing out my vendor caps for the day. And they are much lighter than collecting guns for sale.  I used those for scrapping and learning mods.
---
maybe down the road?
---
There isn't a bonus for over-repairing melee weapons anymore, so I'm not sure what "situation" exists where you'd want your weapons to degrade quickly.
---
Solomon's pond, but there is a lot of players visiting, but not buying any cores, will have to lower them, thought the price would be ok, but it doesn't seem so :)
---
indeed, but I'm on PC dude, message me your beth id and i'll add you
---
The salvaged Assaultron Head is the bugged gift that keeps on giving bugs.
---
Seriously it’s had so many different problems with it throughout the game’s life. More than anything else I think
---
I'm on the Xbox platform. You?
---
Thanks!  
---
[PC]    
---
Would never mind more data, but I'll warn you, can be a snooze fest ;)
---
Remove this before the devs see this and patch it 😂
---
I never ask for caps when I'm out in the world helping people at random. Just drop some 5.56 and a stimpack, that's all I need. 
---
 if you see some raider looking chick running to you full bore about to revive you with booze, tell her thanks.
---
Yeah, 80 is a very nice price, but to low for me to be worth it, i craft them, i never take any workshops :)

    I used to enjoy C.A.M.P. destruction as a method to force a base defense response by the owner and (hopefully) slaughter the owner and claim their caps and junk. It was obvious that I was a hostile entity that needed to be engaged with violence, and the Wanted system allowed anyone on the map to have an advantage in enacting revenge/ justice upon me because I couldn't really see them coming until the first shots were taken or the Super Sledge was being swung at me.
---
     I accepted the full risk of video game death in order to enjoy the thrill of video game destruction and killing, and in my opinion this made the Wasteland a more interesting place for everyone. You didn't have to do any silly tricks or glitches, you could just be a screaming homicidal maniac with no ulterior motivations other than exacting your deathcraft upon your victims or being killed as a consequence of messing with a stronger player. 
---
   The current system has taken a huge part of the danger of this game away, but I'm not going to invite people to a team randomly in order to destroy stuff. I want to destroy your stuff and kill you openly, without subterfuge or trickery.
---
Just ask [Action Hank](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/754/646/0c3.jpg), it is not the beard on the outside that counts.
---
Where does it state that in the rules? Also, you realize most people don't even realize only 1 person can access a vendor at a time. So for most people they wouldn't even know they were doing something wrong.
---
So how would it work?  Anti-Armor passes through armor and delivers the radiation payload directly?
---
I've used one cause the TSE Mini Gun I got off the first SBQ broke halfway through the second. 
---
At that moment, I really didn't mind them.
---
Have 19 more from SBQ runs. Won't ever buy one cause they *aren't that nice*
---
I had a few ideas.
---
1. Half and quarter size foundations. As well as curved and angled ones.
---
2. Vertical half walls, curved ones as well.
---
3. Non-broken windows.
---
4. Additional fireplaces with chimneys that actually go through floors and roofs.
---
5. The regular power poles
---
6. Additional color options for exterior and interior walls.
---
7. Chairs and couches give a "rested" bonus at half the amount of the "Well Rested" one.
---
8. Ability to use the ham radio to broadcast pre-made messages that other players can access from the radio tab.
---
9. Table and floor "clutter" decor.
---
10. Ability to use pre existing structures for camps with snap points and removing garbage in them. Also make more stuff in the workshops scrap able.
---
11. Add option to camp device and workshops to "scrap all"
---
12. More staircases and staircase railings.
---
13. Move the "ground point" for crops a little so they don't look like their floating.
---
14. Placable ground and dirt so you can level spots out.
---
15. Animations for eating and drinking.
---
16. When the player gets drunk or high make the screen a little fuzzy and wobbly like Fable did.
---
17. Make the Pip Boy accessible when sitting.
---
18. Use the terminals to turn your building Blueprints into plans that you can share or sell.
---
19. A resource generator that makes food from livestock.
---
20. Get buffs from the toilet and bathtub.  Call them "Relieved" and "Feelin' Clean'
---
21. Usable sinks.
---
22. Water purifiers deposit the water directly into your camp stash.
---
23. Dogmeat.
---
24. Tabletop terminals.
---
25. Holotapes that you can put into the TV so it'll actually play something. Maybe a quest or event that would turn on a TV station for players to tune into.
---
Whats the reward ? Iam at lvl 270 and never found a real explain for fight against these bots
---
depends on what you find fun i guess. If SBQ combat and her minions isn't fun, then what is?
---
 Oh Lord when did that happen? Are V Fast weapons useless again?
---
 I was away for a while.
---
All mine are of the various teddy bears doing things in Appalachia... would make for interesting decor
---
I never got it 😫
---
Eh Bethesda had a choice. They could have tracked the dupers and all the weapons they duped and traded, eliminated them all, and been done with it.
---
I vote for tying it to the triangle button.
---
Kiddo?
---
I managed to score a 3-star nice stimpack healing Right Arm from the Purveyor last night with additional luck.  Won't hear me complain.
---
&gt;there are situations where you want your weapons to degrade as fast as possible.
---
I'm not sure I understand this. What situations are those?
---
Also, you sugest me carrying some ranged weapon, or 1h/fist is better than 2h?
---
Thanks for your time.
---
Is it saved in your STORED section of the camp?
---
Super like!
---
I for one don't want realism in fo76, else there's just going to be one gun to rule them all, one build to rule them all.  
---
If the devs strove for realism everyone would be in PA rocking .50 machine guns.  Melee would be trash, all armor except for PA would be trash, all other weapons except .50 hunting rifles and .50 machine gun would be trash.    
---
Would that make for a fun game though?
---
Haha truth
---
I'll have to keep an eye out then!
---
That's just asinine. I see somebody go down during that, I rush over with a stimpack. The longer we can keep the pylons going, the faster the event goes.
---
To our Discord? Sure...are you on PC?
---
Lmao I remember when I was a teen I thought that was the funniest episode. Didn't think I'd ever see a reference for it XD
---
Okay, but my point is that so many of those kind of games share so many features like you describe.. that's what leads to that generic feel. I still would rather they come up with whatever option they think is best. If it's the same as you describe, fine.. but at least it's theirs.
---
The game will always have room for improvement, but I respect them more for doing things their way, rather than doing things there way they're typically done.
---
This game could easily feel like an ark knockoff, or a call of duty wannabe.. any other game. But instead it feels like Fallout, with friends. And that's good, I wouldn't enjoy it as much if it felt more like any other game.
---
just make the long walk.  stop being lazy.  Drop a few pounds, geez.
---
I did all 2\* myself, some of the 3rd star effects aren't make or break. I mean I wouldn't argue with a Grognaks Bloodied/Faster/+1 STR but the first two are going to have more of an effect. 
---
Plus you can get two 2\* for the price of one 3\*, more rolls of the die in the long run.
---
I know it's tough to believe but yes my wife does watch me play every day. I let her build my camp. She was a huge Rift fan and loved the player housing in that game. This is as close as she can get.
---
This is a new and original idea that has definitely not been posted in the last week...
---
Please use the search function. 
---
Also I agree this is never going to happen for a number of reasons. This would involve sending a rasterized image to the server, which others would then have to download. Considering how long CAMPs can take to load in general and how BGS seemingly actively try to manage their server load, this seems like it would be an added stress they wouldn't be too happy about introducing. Using existing game assets but placing them where you like IS NOT the same as displaying something like a screenshot.
---
Plus as someone else said, people will abuse the function with racism, sexism, etc.
---
And the COPY, PASTE and shortened reply from Bethesda is "You are SOL."
---
x39 or x51?
---
Real sheepsquash isn't even that great. 1 star legendaries and the same recipe over and over. I'll do it if I'm bored but other than that it doesn't need a notification. Next thing you know they will be going invisible and blowing up so you cant collect your legendary..
---
You mean recipe haha
---
I sell the plans at my vendor
---
I think it only applies to the ballistic damage. Anti armor works by lowering the armor number on the target, but it only affects physical armor not energy or radiation, which is a shame.
---
Hahhahahaha sl
---
It looks solid enough. I would advise reviewing the endurance tree as a key perk to melee "**Radicool**" isn't there, which could provide up to 5 extra strength. If you need help on what gear please let me know.
---
If you want to deal more damage take off Barbarian and Blocker and put them in the slugger cards to get each to 3. I know you dont want to run power armor but you will be fine without those, especially if you are killing everything in 1-2 hits. 
---
I also dont think you need 12 in endurance. I'd invest more in agility since you are running melee but that's my own opinion. Once you start getting good armor you will notice a huge difference and wont need all that health. Not to mention running healing factor will keep you at full health quite often. 
---
I've never ran a high endurance build, so I dont know the huge benefit. My main is a rifleman/commando with 1 in endurance and my ALT is a bloodied melee/heavy build. Both of them dont benefit from high endurance.
---
Yeah, it's still in the STORED section of the camp menu.
---
Yea need this then custom paints for him
---
Haven't tried mining in my suit yet.  So it gives an increased yield?
---
Congrats!
---
Im sick and tired of seeing explosive lazer rifles.
---
As long as he says my name like in fallout 4.
---
Real talk
---
yes thats what i meant. i'll give you whatever you want for it.
---
I'm a big guns specialist and I'd rather see the back end.. but I seem to get all the love instead.. nothing like a constant stream of 5 mm ultracite to keep her attention. I can't stress enough the power the ultracite has to scorched. Same cards and weapon but upgraded to ultracite is a big difference. I'm taking out lvl 69 scorched in 2 shots with a TS Gatling gun. I had the speedy receiver but once I switched to the Prime receiver I lost the "speed" but I'm doing more damage with the slow than the faster, certainly uses less lead in this configuration. its a good thing because using 1 stable violet flux to make the 180/360(w/super duper) 5 mm ammo hurts.
---
If they're max level you can get 10k each easy. Although I'd recommend trying to trade at least one for a different weapon.
---
I am getting this issue of not consistently registering photos of animals for challenges as well on PS4
---
 I like knives. They hit hard when properly built and they hit very often. 
---
 My Nocturnal 40% Speed Combat Knife, although apparently somewhat nerfed is still able to get into the high 200s with a little Adrenaline and it hits maybe 4 times a sec ... till my mouse breaks. DPS and no space for counter attacks. I am very seldom staggered.
---
that's how I got mine
---
2k ign: eweneric
---
got it done thanks all
---
I like the overall idea although I think a 50 cap fee or something to initiate a support signal would be a better idea than the option to PvP. That would avoid no pay issues and could go directly to whoever responded to cover traveling.
---
That's my Comment lol.
---
Wonder why you quoted me of all people, am I really that apathetic? 
---
I thought I was just stating the repeated arguements that you can earn atoms and better kits in game, and NV wasn't online to have an Atom Shop.
---
The stuff about Reddit and semantics is hyperbole, I'll admit.
---
Right? better to spend that nuke on whitesprings or another ghoul heavy area to get as much trash legendary gear as possible for the purveyor.  
---
Make SBQ/SS great again!
---
Yes, and they half work in their plasma counter parts.  Why are AAE lasers so desirable you ask? Who knows
---
I mean when the purveyor has 1 scrip left for the day, somehow I managed to get 149/150 scrip on 2 characters yesterday...
---
Something to think about.  It would be funny if you also had the terminal entries from Chad's prospective.  Could be another comedic avenue to turn down.
---
I did it earlier today..
---
I definitely like the new vendor and got one good roll, rest were trash, but hey it's better than being stuck with the legendaries I did have. 
---
Though, it would be cool if they eventually add a quest, or series of, for a way to understand her so that she could give more lore to the mole miners. Or the quests involving shedding light on their origins and why their temperament is the way it is.
---
 That and perhaps a weekly quest where the reward is 100 scrip for a free roll of the die.
---
fair then not perceptive. it'll be a perk of the rifleman builds. bc melee benefits so much from a bloodied build with unyeilding armor, it'll balance to make more rifleman.
---
Build THAT
---
His power armor has fungus and glowy eyes
---
and a fire pole for funsies
---
The effect doesn't stack. Each shot will reset the timer. It does however stack with the suppressor's perk card.
---
This was a good thing during the fasnacht event.
---
Like the X-01 mods until the last patch, they're only available as mods from the Enclave vendor(s). I also have never received a single mod from scrapping scout armor, so you can't learn them that way either. Hopefully they'll add that functionality in Patch 9.5 or 10 because while I like the 3\* urban scout chest piece I got from Mama Murmrgh, I won't love it until it's welded, tempered or buttressed with deep pockets like all my other chest armor.
---
We have water purification devices. Just add craftable plumbing pipes, like we have for power wires.
---
Connect your purifier to a pipe connector on your building (one of the through-the-wall ones) and connect that to the toilet/shower.
---
Just the last shot - it doesn't stack.  So if you put 400 rounds into a mob with a mini gun, it would be suppressed for 3 second after the last shot, not for 1200 seconds.
---
But on the real side.. can you use the scope? What's the point of it xD
---
Thanks for the info
---
At the rate people are getting TSE guns from the purvyor, all the dupers did was cause it to happen a bit sooner. The purveyor seems to really like giving them out.
---
It would be nice for stairs to snap more than to just the center, as well. Especially considering how the stairs that are off to the side only snap to the ground floor or directly on top of themselves.
---
Water is cash in the game for me.  I have 8 purifiers so I have something to bring caps in.  I can't live off of bulk oil and copper.  Water is easy to make and easy to sell.
---
I do park my camps next to other resources (like I was stuck with over 100 gold ore and needed acid) so I can farm it easily, but the need for resources far outstrips my desire to decorate in a fun and unique way unfortunately.
---
Players doing something you don't like isn't griefing. You aren't being followed server to server. You aren't being harassed. Even scamming isn't against the rules.
---
PVP is still a feature of Adventure Mode. How people are getting you in to PVP isn't an exploit and is an intended feature of Bethesda. Just because you don't like it doesn't make it griefing. Don't like it? Go play a single player game or an online game without PVP.
---
Plasma I believe does 50% ballistics damage so it half works?
---
That would be cool but that would be something vethesda would have to completely create from scratch. There hasnt been a single fallout or elederscrolls game that has had a ladder that doesnt have a loading screen with it. I would love the have ladders but idk if bethesda would be willing to create the script for it that could cause who knows what kind of glutvhes to happen.
---
It's interesting how many people want things to look clean in a post-apacalyptic game. I had a friend when Fallout 4 came out who hated building because so many of the walls had holes in them.
---
Not judging in any way, everyone has their preferences. We are supposed to be America's best and brightest after all.
---
Sometimes I feel like there are too few of us who go out of our way to make it look janky, built out of scraps, and designed by an amateur though. I don't mean just a half-assed box with workstations thrown about either. For example, I intentionally used three different kinds of walls on my camp (aesthetically positioned, not just random), and two different foundation types to make it look like it was built with salvaged parts from other buildings. I used light-up movie poster signs in place of power connectors in some places. I used a tree behind the building to connect power lines to. I even have a curtain made of bone chines in front of my shop. It all gives me the janky, post-apacalyptic, Megaton, almost raider-like vibe I expect from Fallout.
---
1. You are not countering my arugment I said it should be allowed because free choice should be in a survival game. And I think pvp should be present in adventure not just survival just there should be a way to avoid it and there is I have given that option.
---
2. Ok we agree sorta here. except I think pvp should be in both modes.
---
3. Like I said I want their materials that they are carrying not them NOT JUST the workshop , I'm too lazy to farm my own and not how I want to play. That's why I want to hunt them that and interesting things sometimes happen it creates funny stories and interesting experiences. Utimately the point of this is to fight back against having no pvp in adventure because no one carries materials in surivival or its not consistent enough to fuel my characters needs. That is ruining my raider like playstyle. Why should I not be able to do that?
---
4. ok you clearly don't play survival at all, since release players have been going into survival with 0 caps as they transfer it onto other characters which prevents other players from winning caps of them rightfully for dying to them. If you think that is unbalanced I don't know what to say to you. Having a penalty for that punishes players for playing with nothing to lose.
---
5. I suggested pacifist mode protect you from that... putting words in my mouth. You don't have to look over your shoulder every 5 seconds. Only if you own a workshop... Pretty simple and easy.
---
Yes you can't rob peoples junk in survival because no one carries it or collects it there. That's why I want pvp in adventure its the only reason I'm ever in that mode.
---
I tried that and it didn’t work 😞
---
I am going to try that
---
At the train station near the power station. It should be undiscovered on your compass if you haven't visited her yet.
---
From the fast travel spawn look right you'll see the station sometimes the door is barricaded up wait and it'll fix
---
There fun to hint down lol and about 50 caps each I generally dont spend over that.
---
I got a dick for you that'll fix that fucking mouth of yours fast.
---
Why not let us build underground period?  There's a ton of underground space in the game already, would it have killed them to let us set up a camp in a cave someplace or a tunnel?
---
Yea I use the chem perk in strength and the food and drink perk in agility.
---
Bethesda removed the ability to add things to it for an unspecified reason in the last patch. It’s in the patch notes.
---
My wife somehow has 7 of them
---
Read the patch notes.
---
The best part is, it's scoped.
---
You have the patience of saint...
---
Happened in the last patch.
---
Southeast of Berkley. Look at the map and you will see train tracks. The station is right where the tracks end.
---
Yep, mentioned it before. That and I'm sorry
---
on \[Xbox\] You can open the social tab, and join off of anyone from your old server who doesn't have wacky privacy settings. Social/gamertag/view profile/join part or game/join game. I'm sure that the other platforms have a similar function. It doesn't have to be a friend. It will spawn you where you left.
---
Yes it's fun first 100 times
---
Damn. Must’ve missed that in the notes.
---
I saw it once yesterday and that was the first time in a while I saw it.
---
You need to get better at inventory management. 800 + 300+ is more than enough for anyone to get around. You either need to use weight reduction perks / armor or stop hoarding. Seems like an unnecessary change to implement just to cater to a minority.
---
Ik I went there but it was boarded up
---
Pre-War Money?
---
ELEVATORS!
---
fucking this.  I swear, only like 12% of the base here actually reads the notes properly.
---
Short night vision scope?! 😂
---
Yeah it happened
---
How’d she manage that
---
It's become painfully obvious you're a fuckin' troll and I should have stopped having this conversation hours ago. Have fun bitching about not being able to grief, I'm gonna go enjoy the game now.
---
New Vegas
---
You can get PA plans from em.  
---
Forest ones are a bit worthless.
---
I'm level 195 now.. you know how in-frequently we at the higher levels move to the next level... it's like a level ever 3-4 days.
---
I don't have an answer for you, but I wanted to know if you know if it'll count Whitespring robots for this? That seems like it'd be an easy way to complete this.
---
See, with that mentality you get dangerously close to unique but not very functional. All wheels are generic, and round. Because if the wheel isn't round, your cart it's going to bounce. Oval, rhombus, rectangle, whatever, it may look non-generic, but at the price of being non-functional. And most players prefer functional.
---
Coming up with the version they think is best, obviously, doesn't work. They did that. And we end up with a broken system. That's what I meant when I said it doesn't work if the team doing the work isn't very good. They're, to put it bluntly, too inept to reinvent the wheel. Heck, they are arguably too inept to even put a functioning round wheel on their cart properly.
---
Which is what's happening now. The current system is wide open for abuse, and what was the advice of the very-much-upvoted PSA about it? Don't group. That's the only correct advice right now, with the current system - don't group with other players, and make yourself vulnerable. In a multiplayer game. That's fucked up. 
---
And look, I'm not against experimenting. If they want to reinvent the wheel, and they have time to do it, I'm fine with it. But put a round wheel on the card first. Then you can much around and try to make rhomboid wheels work.
---
In short, uniqueness is good. If the developers have the chops to pull it off. This team does not. They get absolutely rudimentary shit utterly wrong. Case in point, you know how the known recipes are marked with (Known) in front? Well, any sane developer would have prioritized the "(" as below A-Z and 0-9. So that when you open the vendor's list, you don't have to scroll through 5 pages of (Known) before you finally reach the unknowns at the very bottom. This is intensely obvious. It takes a genuinely clueless, unaware team to implement it the way this team did. So having this team try to come up with their own solution to a problem which far better teams worked on, for decades, and solved, is going to be an exercise in futility and frustration for everyone involved.
---
Cost me practically nothing and get xp for making it
---
Oh, you speak Sims?
---
A great majority didn't care. There were some loud complainers spamming the board with posts for a bit.
---
I put one in my vending machine on the first day for 8500 not really sure where I should price it or even if I really wanted to sell it. I puttered around my CAMP for a few minutes and decided that was crazy and would drop it to 4000–it’s still a great gun after all. 
---
But someone was at the machine it was in and as I waited for them to finish, they bought it. It lasted maybe 10 minutes.
---
They are comparable to Level 3 locked safes. Good investment if you can stack them
---
Don't yuck his/her yum.
---
Mission Accomplished.
---
I haven't seen any plans at all even mod plans... mods themselves can be purchased in the bunker. 
---
I applied the shadowed to the chest and nothing happened visually like it does with other armor. It remained forest whereas shadowed combat turns like black.
---
Exactly, exactly that my friend. 
---
Have my +karma
---
Hell if we know, I asked her that same thing
---
Someone spiked the punch bowl.
---
The pvp idiots are the high level players who go around attacking low level players. 
---
This has been well discussed and I will stick with my assertion that a good portion of the pvp crowd are idiots and bullies. Not all, but enough that they were a problem.
---
Im a bloodied melee build so I try to stack as much strength and damage as possible and with chems and bobble heads I do 4k damage with my bloodied super sledge
---
That's fair. The XP is worth it. I should do that to top off the last bit from 49 to level 50.
---
I did earn like a whole level when I scrapped my camp and rebuilt, haha. So much XP for creating stuff.
---
How is utilizing in game mechanics griefing? Like sure if they are following you around and won't leave you alone sure that is griefing, but using the in game items for their purposes isn't griefing.
---
Or last night when a lvl 50 Scorchbeast was destroying my camp. My little turrets we’re doing what they could, and I burned though like 12 Stimpaks. Ended up killing it though, not bad for being low level.
---
It's funny you say that...because I did a few months back...I'm looking for voice talent to bring him to life currently.
---
I missed it when I read them originally
---
My mouth is pretty big lmao might not work out in your favor big guy
---
Poo you’re PC, I’d buy that Quad one
---
Where was the East Bridge key? I know I have it just don't recall where it was... I know the West Bridge key is on the rollor coaster ....
---
Thats weird :/
---
Damn, and all I got was the Gatling laser and a crappy cryolator.
---
You can get plans. I save mine until I have 5 duplicates of any one then dig them up.
---
All robots count even friendly ones, but I wouldn't say any way is easy. I just have a robot challenge weapon ready in quickmenu for any time I meet a robot.
---
I'd say best places are Watoga, Encrypted event and AWOL event (3* Legendary as a cherry on top).
---
Damn you level slow I am a higher level and level up at least twice a day
---
Clearly the purpose of vault 76 was to test how people a fresh society would evolve if everyone was the same height!
---
That explains why when I jumped then shot I did waaay more.
---
I don't give a shit about making it look nice. I need it functional.  I have people visiting my camp on the regular despite it being damn near Vault 51's location.
---
I sell shit cheap and I have a full camp available for you to enjoy with free water.  That said, I spend next to none of my money on decor for the house.  I let my wife do that and she's decorated, but IDGAF.  Enjoy my mediocre decorations and my cheap as shit prices on nice plans and my perfectly preserved pies that everyone seems to keep buying from me...
---
&gt;Just let me pick whatever I want with minimal effort on my part.
---
I believe one of the Overseer's Holotapes kind of hints at this?
---
Yea we def need a sorry one
---
You can also milk then store the object, then place, then milk again. I tried it a dozen or so times and never got it to give me milk. Always kicked me. Someone told me you have to remove the fertilizer first. Did that and then got kicked twice and milk 3 times to complete the quest for me (had already 7 milkings in). So YMMV.
---
I sell corn soup and half busted weapons for a living but hay i got a nice house.
---
This is along the lines of one of my two favorite theories; that we the players are unknowingly playing out the real experiments.
---
Make survival worth playing again and I'll stop killing casuals in adventure but until then... We raiders gotta make caps somewhere
---
Have you ever seen so much splendor?
---
Form v function, that's all it is.  I prefer functional every day.
---
you risk shooting them while trying to get a reward from a glowing one that they are fighting. idk. I agree that it is annoying. there should be a reset timer, so you could go away and come back later. Honestly, you'll probably get dc'd way before that would happen anyway.
---
I thought that was what the throw up emoji was for :D jk jk
---
But yes - the I'm sorry emote too.
---
According to what devs said, only the one that changes the name sees it different.
---
But maybe could have changed with any of the recent patches.
---
Wow I'm so happy you have me a gold award mysterious stranger so much kindness. Unlike in the arena, been having a blast with those that have visited it and taken part so far.
---
Likely shut down when the game took a huge popularity dive after the beta started, or around that time. Sad but true. Most of the other similar things I've tried to join, the people just aren't very engaging, or they expect your undivided attention. Sorry but I'm in 20+ servers, I can't focus on just yours.
---
Looks like a Burning Man art car and I absolutely love it.
---
Indubitably.
---
yeah that's why I added "properly"
---
Okay? Nothing wrong with that. I have the same skin. It’s pretty dope.
---
corn soup, cranberry cobbler and lemon-aid
---
hahaha, i am dying here :D
---
Is no tea no shade a common phrase? 
---
I've never heard it.
---
The bots are arguably the best source of exp in ws.
---
If you have Marsupial just leave a hole in your floor and jump up.
---
Next frame, he is laying on the ground!
---
Oh it’s a skin? What’s it called?
---
it was fun so no patience needed :D
---
Spanish has the same issue.
---
A friend I regular with has 5 or so. Hes never learned/read it. I wonder if that’s got anything to do with it?
---
I didn't notice this change. Thanx!
---
Official servers are torture, it’s great with friends on a private dedi or singleplayer if you’ve got the right settings but it can sure get lonely without friends
---
"AnTi SoCiAl ToXiC BehAvIoR" haha
---
Man we don't even need an excuse PvP is an aspect of the game?!
---
Bummer I have a 1* AA tesla I wanted to try out
---
What a bullshit comment. From OP's post history it's obvious they don't like Nazis and alt-right, so you're trying to make it look like they *are* one? How would that ever even work?
---
My handle is IceFire_DH.  I’ll be online tonight after 6:00pm eastern. 
---
My base is in the Mire.  Most seem to enjoy their visit and spend time checking out the protected garden, my custom boardwalk, exploring my Boston Brownstone with the ground level garage, and the stunning colors of the Mire across the lake.  
---
Of course, we also have a souvenir shop...  grin...
---
&gt;short night vision scope
---
Yea sounds about right
---
That would make it less exciting for when you actually get the item you want. If anything, they should let you roll a legendary item with random stars for like 20-30 scrip each time - Kadala style.
---
Bonus revenue stream.  I'd buy em...
---
In the drag community, yeah. I'm a drag queen!
---
Maybe I did drop it without reading at some point. Before vending I regularly just dropped plans at whitespring.
---
I hope so too - for this reason I try to never log out / spawn in at my camp because that was the only time so far that my pet has spawned in dead. I also moved my camp to BFE in the mire where things don't typically spawn so random mobs don't kill them. 
---
I would really like for them to make pets essential so they can be "knocked out" like in FO4 but not killed :/ would reduce the stress of having a pet because I actually do all my vendor selling on a mule now because I don't want people to spawn at my camp and have the chance of mobs spawning / killing my pets.
---
 I have thousands of hours in all the Fallout 3D games and I'm not sure I've "beaten" any of em'. ;)
---
Have you ever set up camp in The Mire?  I had to bail.  It was too expensive being routinely hammered with Gulpers, Scorched, Bloated Ghouls, Bloodbugs and Super Mutants.  
---
Like you know that 3-5 time gap before the attack that starts on your newly claimed workshop?  That's a camp in the mire literally every time you fast travel back to your base.  
---
I camped there (across from S. Belle Motel) for a junk pile to farm and it cost me so much to repair it, the junk pile was a wash in the end.
---
I only kept up that camp location as long as I did because it was on the other side of the map from my wife's camp and we enjoyed using it for the free fast-travel.  
---
In the end, I found a way less risky junk pile someplace else and I just suck up the cap loss when traveling.
---
Waiting for the green apple splatter mod
---
Im just asking not to get duplicates of cards i already have.
---
It seems this subreddit has a very fucked idea on what griefing is
---
At our shop, when you add a feature and you break something that worked, you put $ in a jar.. when we have enough, you take the crew out for lunch..
---
Wait.. NO, forgot I told you this.. we will never see new features as the entire dev crew would be at lunch!!!!!
---
You weren’t crying about my weight last night? 
---
All you kept saying was “I mean, that butt, is just so big
---
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there”
---
Why you so mean now? 😘
---
This is what I run while in a team [https://imgur.com/a/WmHJkd2](https://imgur.com/a/WmHJkd2) . You also want to use an Endangerol Syringer every 2 minutes on her if you have one. One Gun Army is taking the place of Class Freak. There are a lot of cards that can be swapped out to up DR such as bandolier for the Bullet Shield. Blocker is good if the Queen aggros you a lot. Tenderizer isn't necessary but doesn't hurt. Suppressor is also not a bad choice. Lone Wanderer is good if you aren't in a group. I run enforcer with an explosive shotgun to cripple mobs. Demolition Expert is good if you are running explosive weapons with high damage as it is percentage based. Remember to use any  drinks and chems that boost ballistic damage.
---
What weapon or weapons are you running?
---
 You need nothing. Its not even hard, but you do need to know the way. ;)
---
At the end of the day, most other primary effects are better for laser as mobs tend to have lower ER than their DR
---
Good to know. I found one camp in the mire that was literally just a foundation with two vending machines and a generator. That explains a lot.
---
So you are as weak as a puppy?
---
Bethesda needs to add a “Take Photos of X number of unique player camps” challenge, if they haven’t already done so.
---
The succulents? They're possibly my favourite camp decor. And the fish lamp...
---
 Its not a great pistol, but for the low health crowd it will do the trick.
---
Well, they do break twice as fast.
---
26 Viscosity haha
---
I understand just saying I can see both sides I don't personally care either way because I personally don't ever hurt for loot but I know of situations like what you describe and see low lvls get screwed si I normally will try to team up so we can share the kill loot
---
For sure diff platforms, different challenges. Let's not ignore the real issue which is that the devs need to allow us to inspect the item regardless of owner proximity.
---
Right on. I always like to hear new phrases
---
Plague Rider
---
Perfect for companions.
---
I though this would work but it doesn't. Someone had set up a workshop at Poseidon and then logged out. I came over, took a few cores out of the processor and then waited. 30 min later, it still hadn't made another core. I took the workshop and then it started making cores on schedule again. It was powered the whole time and the little thing on top was moving as well, but no cores if the workshop wasn't claimed.
---
The nukes in those silos can only target the Appalachia, so there may be some truth to it.
---
It might be in the West Bridge room.
---
Yup! In fact it does! The one that occurs when you nuke  anything that isn't a fissure site.
---
Jesus Christ.
---
I just want that quad perk.
---
I'm sure a "Patch" on the tire put another hole in the tire...
---
Kinda like a tire shop fixing tires with razor blades. :P
---
I have these 2 pieces I'm looking to trade for Forest, these are Urban:
---
1. lvl 50 3* Scout Urban Poisoners RIGHT ARM, -15% damage from Super Mutants, +25% poison resistance and grants under water  
---
2. lvl 50 3* Scout Urban Hunters LEFT ARM, -15% damage from animals, Increase AP refresh speed, harder to detect while sneaking
---
Welp, gonna have to test that out tonight. I got a fresh 20 for this weekend's run in the PVP servers, ai can allocate some for science. 
---
Do I atleast get a bounty? I'd feel a tiny bit bad if I didn't
---
I’m free after the 22nd! Will you still be doing one?
---
Add me, PSN: CaptainModrah
---
I will find you. I've built close to 30 gatling plasmas and I've gotten 1 mod, the sights.
---
What's your IGN?
---
xd it was a joke 500caps is fine
---
It'll stop once you have all possible options. For instance, you get 6 Thru-Travellers for availability on all levels. It'll stop someday.
---
But this happens to allow a thru-traveller on all levels. This way you can have swap thru traveller lv3 for a lv2 if you want to tweak for a Adrenaline card. It's a necessary evil.
---
I demand a Wadsworth for my C.A.M.P

If they work out I'll keep doing them.

Oh sure thing, IGN:emreyigit93
---
I'm like you. I love Fallout 76 I play with my fiance every second we can. All of our enjoyment with the game (we are both endgame with our characters) comes from PvP.  It doesn't mean we are fucked in the head or dicks in real life. We enjoy the game just like you do but in different ways. Us engaging in Player vs. Player is for our enjoyment and not to ruin anyone elses game play.
---
I personally wouldn't care if they changed it to the way OP said unless it was constant doing all the work with no help. I've never really ran into people not trying to contribute so I didn't know it was a current issue. Maybe I'm either lucky or clueless or just dumb lol
---
Yeah, as it is now you can only inspect those items if the owner of the camp is nearby. Rather strange requirement.
---
east bridge is in a lunch pale by a dead body on the bridge
---
Well okay, but is it max level?
---
It's a science experiment not a pet.
---
I got a Resolute Veteran last week, it's my primary weapon now and I switched to it with 1000+ 5mm bullets in my inventory so it was just a perfect time to find it.  
---
The only thing I hate about it is that attacks stagger you from firing, making it nearly useless on any hordes of scorched or ghouls that you might run across.
---
Excavator PA + Lucky Hole Mine = Happy Times
---
Man... You gotta PvP in adventure. It is the only place you will make any caps!
---
My ui constantly glitches out and gives me the message "no item selected", I end up having to exit out of build mode and re-enter. That's the only new error/glitch I've seen...
---
in adventure mode playing as a pacifist you aren't necessarily agreeing to pvp yet someone is exploiting in game mechanics to bypass that and murder you
---
There are a lot of ways to benefit from this and I like the ideas however I think some wouldn't be fans so not sure if this is something you could maybe get a perk for IF you did and also had a choice not to use that card.
---
No.
---
you want fast travel? drop some shit.
---
I hear you! I played The Sims for years, but my camp is all utility. I'm not all that fussed with the looks. Throw in the odd plant, and aim for pretty lamps. That's all anyone gets.
---
Plant seeds in the ground and wait for them to sprout
---
Just need acid but you can easily get over 400+ lead scrap per run
---
X51 tis the only one that counts
---
sold a AA/+25% faster fire rate tesla for 2.5k.
---
i was never gonna use it
---
Not sure. I’ve never thought about attacking one, so I don’t know it they’re stronger than me.
---
I'm starting to turn off the beacon if I'm not in, as I've got 4-5 ea of 2-3\* Armor and Weapons. 
---
Quite a bummer to fast travel to a CAMP cause of the listing, seeing what could be a sweet legendary at a good price, but not wanting to take the gamble.
---
\*Taking notes nervously\* Thanks for your advice. Imagining that with "Vampire" on it makes me smile with psychopath wrinkles in my face.
---
If they temp banned you for talking about we need to talk about it more lol. Don't let the food builds win, PvP has a place in this community too
---
it must be exhausting to jump at every tiny trace in data mined  info.
---
I'm coming to steal that bone club!!
---
I mean it's really up to the community and then Bethesda to make the final decision.
---
After 250 hours of playing I just stumbled on Tangara Town 2 days ago for the first time. I have marsupial so I believe I made it to the top but the weird floors gave me the worst feeling of vertigo. I had to leave because I was actually getting nauseous. 
---
Cool place though.
---
There must be a bonus I don’t know about with the excavator pa?
---
Better yet just give us the robot workbench back and we can make our own robots.
---
Wow... though a bloodied build is not for the faint of heart I think.
---
Yep that's what I was thinking!
---
What about a mode with absolutely no legendaries so there is no balance issues even later on?!
---
That sounds like a plan
---

No, I don’t think you understand the meaning of griefing. “a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game, using aspects of the game in unintended ways.” I was being harassed and especially irritated. And the way they did it was not INTENDED by Bethesda. What they did it the definition of griefing.
---
No pink lemonade
---
It would be open PvP and pretty bloodied though if its everything our hearts desire.
---
The arms increase your mining yield.
---
Ok thanks
---
Maybe you just have cold hands mister!
---
I do what the other poster suggested as well. I try to never log out at camp so I'm not loading in there initially. It's also important you have your camp module down somewhere outside in the open, as that's what the pet is drawn to and it works like an anchor. If they can't get to it they can be really buggy.
---
Good to know thanks.
---
I've managed to get a corner of floor on my house outside a decent bit. It's a little tricky cause it wont always allow the walls or roof. if anyone does it this way I'd recommend starting with that corner and making sure it fits in a finished state
---
Stabby stabby FTW.
---
Bot gets an A+ for trying, haha.
---
Your a weird man or female ....I LIKE IT
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
One of my favorite places in the game &lt;3

Want to add that if you fertalize with mirelurk waste and send positve vibes with a banjo there is a low rng chance for double yeild.

I have an instigating, +15% reload speed, vats critical single action and I love it. Have you ever had a quad one before? The reload time is hilarious!
---
You can also find them on Grahm but I would suggest buying from other players as it will generally be cheaper.
---
Who hurt you? Why are you so angry because someone wants to enjoy PvP functions in this game?
---
The lunch pail is actually not there anymore! The body has a few of those obstacle course flags by it now, but no lunch pail in sight.
---
If it helps, having it on wood armor wouldnt have been worth much at all
---
IGN: United1k.  I need 7 more kills to complete the badge.  Would love to know where they reliably spawn.
---
Farming the Can Chimes in Eastern Regional Penitentiary through some server hopping. A cheap and easy way to get steel and lead for ammo crafting.
---
no legendaries. only chainsaws...
---
That seems to be how it's used by the player base.
---
All tea all shade hennyyyyyy
---
How about a Mr. Handsy that makes vistors feel uncomfortable.
---
This is what my build eventually turned out to be. And as much as I hate power armor it's needed for nuke zones most of the time otherwise it's a hazmat suit in there. Outside nuke zones it's just armor and I jump in power armor for hard content that I can't kill in 3 or 4 swings.

Let me explain a bit about it. Traveling Pharmacy is used to carry around a butt load of stimpacks, radaway and diluted radx. Thru-hiker is to carry around large amounts of booze and food. 
---
Power patches and white knight are both there because I need stuff for power armor and non power armor and I'm too lazy to swap stuff around when it's needed.
---
Batteries included is to carry around fusion cores.
---
Glow sights for glowing enemies.
---
And the Rad resist perk is nice for when I'm out of power armor but is probably not needed.
---
The best is when you can really tell that they put real time into it right. but it still looks like crap 
---
poor things. doing their best
---
Alright, I’ll add you when I get back online IGN Molybzen
---
Yes please! I love all these ideas!! I can’t even decide which one is the best. You made me brainstorm even more; how about a square terminal instead of the round one. Or a round stairs instead of straight. Triangle foundations and floors like they have in Conan: Exiles. A dancing emote. A dance emote
---
I secretly hope that we’ll get an animal companion with the new project paradise dungeon as you have to help animals but we probably won’t though
---
From what I understand, that's was only wood armor. And Assaultron heads.
---
LOL. I will sometimes put mine on to jump down, as its quite a way to climb all the way back down.
---
 You need nothing. ;)
---
np!
---
I'm not angry at all. Y'all raider wannabes always seem to be the ones bitching about "oh waaaah I can't be a shitstain because this this and this" Why are y'all so angry that people wanna play this game without killing each other or being killed?
---
start carrying buffout dude
---
Nope, but I can imagine, haha. Isn't that like a 24 second reload? 30 without mutations? Half a minute just standing there reloading, hahah!
---
Id be interested in participating.
---
I get shit.
---
Just let go, man. Or equip some weight reduction perks.
---
Why can’t I put a rad toad in the jar Bethesda..Catching frogs is for Wimps, I want something that if I eat it I’ll have hallucinations brought on by their poison!
---
I get that aswell , but I used to have to do a full game restart,  but that doesnt fix it anymore
---
Gatling plasma does full energy, so it doesn't work at all.
---
that's a legendary chocolate starfish drop
---
Make em pay atoms....
---
Yes. I am a man OR a female. But you'll find that most people are.
---
If you're on PS4 I'll buy one tonight. You won't even lose the 10% fee.
---
I can count max 10 camps that had a minimal design in them...and one is mine.
---
Good luck finding it buried in my stash!
---
I have to admit it's a gnarly looking weapon. Is it supposed to be from a scorchbeast? It's huge and has those little crystal things poking out of it.
---
I was so happy someone was selling Marsupial serum for 250 caps!

I've taken a few things out. Let me know what you think. And tell me if there was anything you couldn't live without.

As a temporary work-around you could rename your weapons to stats they boots/provide.
---
I feel your pain friend.
---
This man knows!
---
If you bought it, you should be able to apply it...
---
I have a quad my first reload i thought he'd load six but nope all 24. Sometimes i take that out just for the reload.
---
I’m with you bud.  I have a BE Heavy Gunner, I have an AAE sneak/crit/unyielding rifle guy and I have a bloody/unyielding melee guy.  When it comes to burst there’s no one better than the bloody melee dude. One hit anything except sheepsquatch and SBQ.  But sustained damage on the Queen? Not outside of a full premade party.  The queens gonna turn on you forcing you to go vampire or drink RA forcing you out of nerd rage.  Sustained SBQ too Damage is gonna be your full Lock and Loaded spec Heavy Gunner with a BE or B25 LMG.
---
Im not angry I just want to kill other players and not be referred to as a griefer every time. All you enclave wannabes do is spend your hours shooting bats out of the sky hoping for a better tomorrow.
---
And drills..?
---
I believe it! I only started playing video games after watching my husband play. He lost patience at Skyrim and started having ME play.
---
Also, your story made me laugh. Why dpes this stuff never happen to me??
---
Cause they're a big fat nothingburger. That's why.
---
I hope they add a method for rerolls, but getting to pick your base item for a 3\* item is worth far more than 125 Scrip!
---
Wow, that might be the best candidate for those guys buying the worst legendary weapons.
---
Radicool and dodgy are some great perks you should try to get them in there
---
I had to rebuild my nuclear generator like every other real-time day when playing.
---
They'd hit the walls, the turrets generally won't completely kill and enemy at that level and eventually would blow up the generator.  It was such a massive waste of time.  
---
I just thought it was me and that location, but I found another place nearby I could build mostly over water (I was wanting to extract a lot of water) in the Mire and it was just constantly being attacked by level 68 Scorched with pipe pistols who just had absolutely perfect aim from a half mile away at their normal spawn locations.  They'd ping my shit long enough when I was away that I'd come back with tons of stuff missing and destroyed.
---
I ended up building my new water camp in the Savage Divide which is utterly devoid of random attacks by humanoids and cryptids.  It was mostly level 10 mole rats, ants and bugs.
---
I’m working on that yet grabbed a ton of items in order to open up the store.  Even without that since we can’t place items like power armor in our homes and must carry them along (which I have numerous sets). If we could just leave stuff in our homes and not be forced to carry it would be great. 
---
I also doubt I would be a minority in this if many others were running 3-5 characters as Mules to swap items back and forth. 
---
I guess my next objective is to either make a mule character which is also a drain on resources or see if B would just allow this change.
---
Even separating Seller stash from Reg stash would fix things for many players.
---
Again just a though.
---
Is that straight from FO4 files? I’ve heard the opposite is why I’m asking.
---
Wellll I already sold it to another player. I did get a two shot pipe revolver but its just a one star
---
neat
---
Ok thanks!
---
I could never bring myself to bomb or blow up a camp like that. That takes more effort then mine and others I have seen. Just getting things snapped to the perfect position while dealing with thirst hunger and environmental enemies. Impressive
---
No less than 15k
---
&gt;Short night vision scope
---
Wtf
---
Shouldn't underestimate wood.
---
It has the best stealth bonus effect available in the game, and having two good pieces would be great for a stealth heavy build.
---
The perk cards for heavy gunner all 3
---
If this happened to my husband, I'd be encouraging it! That's hilarious!
---
i agree bikes would be easier to render and work, just knock the rust off a little
---
They're also valuable because they're weightless. If you have to use up stash weight on them, their value would plunge.
---
Cool! I love the different design sensibilities different cultures have.
---
Furious with Increased Rate of Fire would've been much better. TSE isn't hip anymore. But you can still sell it for 5-10k
---
Out right now, but I glanced at it a few hours ago while playing, and I do believe it’s full energy.
---
Oh man, AA was made for you!
---
Hi, my name is "FarPlace" and I'm a Stimpack junkie...
---
All reply... Hi Farplace...
---
Lol a piece of shit has a nv scope....
---
let me know if that fixes it
---
eh thanks though. that will sell, but i'm looking for that bloodied pipe revolver
---
Well, yeah. But absolute best-case roll scenario it's surprisingly handy, like I said. It needs something to make it not just "the worst pistol". I mentioned a "speed loader" option. At least giving it the fastest pistol reload would make it stand out in a single area. And it badly needs a simple scope option or a suppressor to make it the only revolver pistol to have one and make it more attractive to use because of that. I hate things being simply "the worst in a category". If you are going to do that, it best be a low-level early game gun that goes away later. But since Fallout 76 keeps it around and at high level, to make it worth having it needs to be "different" and provide a few actually useful traits more powerful guns don't have. Hence my ideas about a speed loader or suppressor mods.
---
Genius. Pure Genius
---
Yeah the arms give your 4 ore instead of just 1, and with the number of lead veins in Lucky Hole Mine you can get 400-500 Lead Ore in 1 run. Then with the help of some acid and Super Duper you can get upwards of 1500 lead scrap.
---
Get unyielding armor and go for a bloodied sneak build. It increases your weapon strength, all your stats except endurance and increases your carry weight. Use nerd rage and the perk that gives you a stimpak when below 20% health (can't remember the name of it).
---
I thought I was the only one, it’s always in the distance and I can’t ever get close to it
---
If I get another one I'll let you know!
---
No they'll nerf it so you have to grind even more as they usually do
---
What if it was all a simulated world and these people that we are, we're just trapped like our dad in fallout 3 stuck in simulation...
---
I'm just a stickler for mild realism. Not saying that a purifier couldn't work, just that we live in a world of ShootyMcStabbem mutants, and giant Skyrim ass bats, so I dunno how important a flushing toilet is. As for adding content, I am ALL for that lol, especially if we can get some basics from the older games. I would love more in game power armor paints, or if you like decos, maybe we could raid the local museum for paintings, statues, and the like. Hell, give us a once every 24 real hours satalite gun like New Vegas, that has a long quest line to unlock, or maybe the local deathclaw matriarch goes into heat during a verdant season, so we have to go fight a raid of deathclaws to prevent the map from being overrun. Not trying to, pun mildly intended, shit on your idea, but there are hundreds of things they could add to the game that players would jump on before taking a bath, and a good shit lol.
---
Gatling plasma is the new heavy weapon version of the plasma, and it is a full energy damage weapon like the gatling laser, the normal plasma rifle/ pistol and it's variants are the half and half variety, but the gatling does energy only.
---
Traveling Pharmacist.
---
remember, I have my Stimpak coin.... &lt;gulp&gt;
---
4x the map size and still having to walk through it all makes no sense to me. Especially since in 80% of my trips I encounter literally nothing to interact with for the exception of plants.
---
I think gamers and app users have gone way over board with the easy critiques and flaming over the work of developers. Yeah, some AAA games come out really rough and you can see some con work in places (giant unfounded E3 reveals), but you've gotta hand it to folks like the FO76 team keeping with the product after all their assumed failures. Their vision is paying off.
---
Another great example - off channel subject - is No Man's Sky, where those guys endured through 2-3 years of an shitty uphill crawl to make an awesome game. Folks can complain, "it shouldn't have been released if it wasn't ready", but I like buying into something that a team is dedicated to making better. Gotta give credit where it's due.
---
Do the names show up for other people in your machine?
---
How much would a furious RoF be then?
---
I mean im open to suggestions that allow that sort of playstyle that don't force me to use loopholes in game mechanics that's really what I'm arguing make it more of a legitmate play style like I don't care whether its a loop hope or that just let us loot and pillage 
---
Unfortunately  lots of players don't see eye to eye and think that it should be physicaly impossible to to negatively impacted by players in adventure. But yea I think your idea could use tweaking , problems like having no workshops on the map for instance but its a start.
---
I would say 5-10K because TS is not good anymore
---
Also the gym at the flatwoods motel has weights if someone elae has not snatched them up

There is a ghoul with the launch codes.  Do you work and sleep in the white house?

No more than any other random encounter, but it gives decent XP for the time invested, and AFAIK it occasionally rewards wy
---
 Yeah the Western Revolver speed loads and hits just as hard, takes a reflex sight too.. A much better gun.
---
What I used to do about enemies spawning at my base. (Those massive crab queens)
---
Build them tall cement defence walls. And build a foundation behind it and a staircase going up and over the wall and a floating floor a few meters past it (them half floors) and place a high level turret or two at the end. Make a few of them and it is usually enough to stop anything.
---
I don't know shit about bicycles, but wouldn't the tires rot after 20 years?  Especially if they were left out in the elements.
---
Nobody's saying you can't. That's what Survival is for. But y'all wanna act like not being able to kill poor level 6 Joe Schmoe in Adventure mode because he wanted to check out Billings Homestead means Bethesda personally hates you and wishes a plague upon your families.
---
But you're just gonna start arguing the same shit this other dumbass did so have a nice day! :D
---
Okay, your point of (known) is an opinion, not just something that is objectively a better choice. Player vending makes me happy that known recipes come up first, as those are what I'm *always going to sell*. 
---
So yeah, the inconvenience of having to scroll through known recipes can be annoying for about 1.5 seconds, but they could simply add a filter of unknown if players wanted it bad enough.
---
But here's the thing, they've been talking about player vending since January, so it's highly likely the reasoning known recipes come up first, is because they knew that would be what players want when vending came.
---
I would be much more annoyed at having to scroll through all of my other notes just to get to what I want to sell. Much more annoyed than the very few times I'm actually at vendors looking for plans (which happens once every few weeks at most).
---
So what you call inept, could be a design choice they had planned since they knew they were going to bring player vending. Which all goes back to- they do it their way, it is *their game*, and copying other features the way other games have done it can easily be a mistake.
---
Also, all your wheel analogies are pretty terrible, if you're going to present ideas, don't use analogies- especially that one, because you're trying to argue there's one right way of doing things, and that's simply not true.
---
Yes I believe so because they look similar to the bones you can pick up from the scorchbeasts.
---
Im feeling an automatron update coming on. Might as well have Colonel Gutsys for defending C.A.M.P. as well.
---
I don't know maybe 8-12k caps
---
He har an assassin cavalier, who would use wood for pvp and or a melee build?
---
Imma just leave while I still have my sanity
---
that would be awesome. again i'll give you whatever i can for it. have tons of stuff
---
20% bloatfly attraction stack? Could use it for that pioneer scouts quest to get glands.
---
Ignoring them is easy. But being part of the bandwagon and everyone jumping on the hate for something is shifting. And right now it's bugs with the new vendor.
---
About where are you? I'm overencumbered and can't FT. I need to work my way there. 
---
Also about what time will you be on tonight?
---
I think you posted the original link, looks the same to me.
---
Prolly about the same, 8-15k. Might find a furious ffr cheap if they don’t know what they have
---
Bwahaha...  I cannot decide if it should absolutely be this or absolutely not be this.  I could go either way.

Hi, card carrying evil EATT member here. Come get some, normies.
---
Would prefer riding a radstag or yao guai.
---
Something like that would def be cool.
---
There’s another problem too, which is the imbalance between number of truly good legendary effects that now apply to ballistic against energy weapons (bloodied notwithstanding). 
---
Ballistics potentially get explosive, two-shot, anti-armor, and furious.
---
Energy weapons get only furious and two-shot (the current usefulness of which is disputed).
---
Luckily my furious gatling laser dropped on one of my first SBQ runs, but it would have been nice to be able to swap this out for my new AA 25% fire rate one ;(
---
"Means Bethesda personally hates me" as if they didn't push PvP play the entire build up to the release of this game lol 
---
So are you saying I have to PvP in survival? Why can't I PvP in adventure?
---
I'm mainly interested in heavy weapons and 2h melee. If you want to trade sometime and your on PS4 my PSN is PurpleKingAtlas
---
They do not, so this wouldn't work.
---
there will always be something better
---
I’m not doing it to Make 25K in caps. Nor do I have the time to snag enough garbage to get 1400 caps a day.
---
When I sell stuff it’s dirt cheap in comparison to most others. I do it mostly for helping other players get stuff they want. 
---
I also help folks by making their Serums if they just brought me the supplies. I’ve looked around and found numerous players selling $2k Serums. That’s Ridiculous
---
You willing to do that Blak? Willing to make stuff without charge or are you one of those demanding 2k for each serum?
---
Renaming only shows for the user, as well. It won't show to the other players in the machine or when dropped/traded/sold to the NPCs.
---
Trading cold hard caps for a bag of junk.  Sounds like he played himself. ;D
---
Agreed, which they've replied the other day that they're aware of the issue and looking into it. It's obviously not intended.
---
I have a player that's selling a 3*, but they're in a team so I can't invite them, I tried adding them as a friend which they ignored, and I can't message them because they set their privacy to friends only- so yes, a fix would be much better than me wasting all this effort for nothing.
---
Sorry I'm on mobile. Guess I will redo it when I get home from work. Sorry.
---
Sounds fun
---
Hopefully I can finish tweaking my camp in time lol
---
I had a Quad Lever Action like that.  The reload was ridiculous.
---
It may be in game already but haven't seen it, but I would like some junk walls.  I would be fine with a copy paste from FO4.  Something that says ok you're not a professional within the construction industry but you know how to throw some shelters up using your surroundings.
---
Shotgun...more like shitgun.....am i right? 
---
 I used my tse combat shotgun on my main char for the first time since the nerf lastnight and it broke my heart. I felt the initial nerf was justified,  but this last one leaves the gun feeling lack luster.  At close range with maximum demo perks and 1 point in ea shotgun card, it took me 2 clips to down a major gutsy. Like why even use this gun anymore when it seems like everything else is more effective?
---
It also seemed to do even less damage when sighting the gun?
---
If im doing it wrong after nerf, id appreciate any pointers, or im going to stash this one for a while in hopes of a rebalance at some point.
---
But only after you spend atoms.
---
Thats not so bad. I should have that much by the time i take my lvl 46 to whatever i need to get all the perks i need for my heavy weapon build
---
It spawns at Fred's BBQ, the Southern Belle Motel, and a spot up in the NW corner that I can't remember. IT starts with a dead robot shepherd and 3 "abandonded" brahmin standing next to him. You have to loot a shepherd's crook from him and use it to herd the cows along a road to the nearest farm. 
---
Along the way you get attacked by mobs at 3 or 4 trigger points, and when you get to the farm a legendary sheepsquatch appears. 
---
The rewards include whatever legendary crap you get from the squatch, ~350xp, standard event loot (chems, junk, some ammo), and usually a new sheepsquatch related plan like mutton pie or upgrades for the shepherd's crook.
---
World full.  Trying to join you.  If you are at the spot I can fast travel to meet you.
---
LOL that sounds like an awful trek. Sunnytop Station, up the road from Monoghah to the Mine. Tell me what pieces interested you and I'll pull them
---
It has been discussed many times but not discussed well.
---
My burning question is we can sit are butts down just about anywhere but why not in a darn bus seat or car seats? When ever I get on one of the buses Im like how cool it would be to just sit in the drivers seat and take a pic.
---
Backpack clips with the tank on the BoS Engineer outfit as well. Its almost like they spaced on those two entirely. Unfortunately, I like how the Engineer outfit looks with a backpack, the tank sticks up in such a way to look intentional. Unfortunate as I'm sure they will fix this eventually.
---
I have always wanted to find a Quad Dragon. Sure, it ain't the devastating single-blast-orbital-strike-mega-cannon a Bloodied Dragon is, but being able to fire 4 shots would feel like firing each of the 4 barrels individually, which is actually how quad-barreled muskets actually worked in "ye' olden days".
---
I am not saying it's top tier best in game armor.
---
But those effects are pretty good on any armor, and wood does have some uses of it's own, so it's not like you can't make use of it. 
---
If you want legendary effects with a bare minimum amount of armor weight, and use stealth heavily for pvp in survival mode, and don't want to have to change out armor when running into other humans, then in that very narrow niche it isn't BAD.
---
Thanks for the tip. I was going to sell it to some dude for 3k. I’ll see what I can get on there.
---
Yeah I left out my bycle out for a year and it got rusty and tires were flat and done
---
And, if you go back and look at my original statement, I didn't claim that all pvp players are witless bullies. Only the ones that are witless bullies are. If you take this as a personal attack, then perhaps you have some soul searching to do. 
---
I have no problem with pvp taking place on either server. I was answering a specific question related to problems with the game, and it can't be refuted that a good portion of the player base felt that there has been a griefing problem. 
---
I'm very sorry if my assertion hurt your feelings. Given that this is a form for adults, I assumed that people wit opinions could tolerate my opinions without becoming indignant.
---
I agree with you. As i responded to someone else...its really heart breaking what they did to my once favorite weapon.
---
There aren't many posts about repair kits anymore because the mods said any new posts about repair kits that aren't substantially different will be removed. It doesn't mean that opinions were changed. Read the archives for your pro and con arguments.

&gt; the 500
---
do you mean the 150?
---
Sure, but you know... you craft fucking guns and pieces of fancy armor. Im sure you could craft a piece of rubber too.
---
I know 2 players who have this I have seen them wearing in the game, I don't know how they got it and they won't say
---
You would know if you made it to the top. I assume you did not. ;) Marsupial is not needed. I have a Jet Pack on my X0-1, I don't wear for that climb..
---
I just grab the door, walk through, and hit B. It puts the door right back where it was before...
---
If I really wanted it I would buy it for like 6k caps. I don't really care for the explosive part of it as it would probably get me killed very often.
---
Fantastic work as always.
---
... can I ride a behemoth super mutant :O
---
You are into bestiality also?
---
Good point, but does not solve the problem.
---
Armor imparts both dr and er.  So "anti armor" imo only working for ballistic damage would seem to be an oversight.  If the effect was "anti ballistic armor" then and only then would it make sense to only impact dr, and in that case it would make sense to have an "anti energy armor" prefix.  
---
All that said it would suck to dilute the legendary pool by making a new prefix just for ER so I'd prefer to see AA modified to work vs er and dr the same.
---
\+Karma

I agree, they should be more creative [like mine](https://i.imgur.com/lqAC6St.jpg)
---
I beat the crap out of scorched beasts with my TSE Gatling Plasma. Even with the level 80, the red bar really gets small FAST. But I agree that not much works against the queen. If it does, it's not worth the wasting of the expensive ammo. I think it's plain just x number of hits..
---
There are two possible answers. Either the bikes ran on mini fusion cores and have all degraded. Or they have flat tyres.
---
Nah.
---
Cars should work as beds, just climb in, lock the doors, and take a nap.
---
Just doing it for clicks. Gunna pick a alt account as winner. Nice one
---
That would explain a lot of power armor disappearances.  When you drop an atom painted PA piece it destroys it, so is it just auto deleting it?
---
I always sell stuff very cheaply. Sure, some folks will try to resel, but for those who really need it - be my guest.
---
Worst thing is right now is ammo at 1 cap each cause most of it ain't worth the money.
---
God damnit that means I have to go back.

He shows up at my base sometimes and its pretty awesome hahaha

he went down on his knees faster than a whore for a $2 bill by a scorchedbeast I fought when he was in my proximity.  I saved him, and he didn't even give me any gratitude!
---
Haha! Well played.
---
I agree for the most part and can see both sides. I do feel that I should have a certain set of S.P.E.C.I.A.L. numbers an the cards should fit. I would like to setup more of Role/Mindset then be able to simply click RIFLEMAN, HACKER. THIEF, FARMER, BUILDER and it set the cards I've created. So if I'm not able to fight as much or do as much damage, because I was in a Hacker frame of mind and suddenly get attacked, I'm cool with that. But I don't think all non-combat cards should be active, no matter what, for one it would clearly mess with the overall S.P.E.C.I.A.L. numbers and then allow someone to have more. So that is how I can see it as being overpowered.
---
Holy shit. Maybe the mole miner mutation is contagious via bite or scratch and our nuking of Appalachia spurred it on like it did for the original bombs did for the FEV. 
---
Maybe shes just human enough to carry on helping her vault residents in her own way.
---
pretty sure gatling plasma didn't exist in fo4.
---
Oh yeah and you know what he did to me?
---
This was my first time seeing him and he continues to walk away from me. Then all of a sudden I die of radiation. Little did I know I was walking into a nuke zone.
---
So he basically led me to my death.
---
Why not use stealth boys if they are such a problem?
---
what they did is they make everyone drop their shotgun don't know why but im keeping 1 with me maybe they fix it and make them stronger who know 😔
---
How many hours away is this.
---
If we can craft fusion generators, find charged fusion cores, even MAKE fully charged fusion cores, then we should be able to drive a fuckin car or something. I'd love to drive a car or even a motorcycle around the wasteland, personally
---
How do you recommended they Nerf stealth boys?
---
That was first thing to disturb me! What's he looking at? Some sniper out there going to shoot me while I shop? Vault Boy might be the only warning I get!
---
Sorry, bud.  I can only learn how to make stuff like Decontamination Showers and Jetpacks.  Can't do rubber hoses.
---
7ish
---
Not sure which items I want yet. I could really use something with weapon weight reduction. (Obviously lol) actually I might need several for my other characters.
---
Melee is still grand. But until the next update we still don't have much endgame stuff to do.
---
I'm sorry, friend. I can only upvote you once.
---
Two star Explosive Vampire's LMG. The stupid fast fire rate of the LMG couples nicely with the Vampire effect, and exploding splash damage makes every shot count. Ought to be fun at The White Spring with the Ghoul hordes.
---
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!
---
Hope they never do this.
---
Yeah, that makes sense,  the more I thought about it,  you have to have the workshop to build a fusion generator to power the core generator...I guess you need to expose yourself to pvp.  But the cost of that is really only the materials to make a fusion generator... if you turn on the contractor perk it should be less costly...I  need some fusion cores,  I'll have to do this next time i'm on,  or find a player vendor selling them cheap...
---
Tired of this theory
---
God tier.
---
It’s right up there with auto grenade launcher as far as usefulness now
---
You on PC? I'd take those ultracite 2 mm for a cap a piece.
---
I had my base on that lead deposit there too..
---
have TSE minigun. probably duped. and a boody gatling plasma.
---
Rad ant beer gives you a extra 50 pounds of weight. that plus weight reduction perks and bloodied gear with weight reduction. you shouldn't have a weight problem fatty 👍🌮
---
Ok *bursts out crying*
---
Ha, like I have room for 50 stable flux. Good joke OP.
---
Nukes dont happen much anymore
---
Grahm is invincible like all the other vendors.
---
Hmm... I have had all mutations (except herbi) for pretty much forever, and hardly ever bother to cure diseases, unless I'm burning through food too fast from parasites or something. I don't recall ever accidentally aggroing turrets or NPCs or anything with plague walker.
---
YES Please don't remove any items. I love the fact I can get a legendary shovel from her. PLEASE!
---
My buddy has it. I'm 100% ok with it being apparel. Just release it with the ability to change colors and we're good.
---
same here.. even the vendors only have 1-5 plans I don't already have...
---
do eeeeeeeeet
---
It’s wood armor so it’s good for stealth build characters. Stealth is the meta in PvP.
---
Someone would’ve found a use for it, just because you wouldn’t, doesn’t mean someone else wouldn’t. Gotta think outside the box there jmp1919.
---
I bought it about a week ago. It’s fun, interesting and brutally hard at the start. I’d say give it s go if you like survival games and building. Oh, and if you liked scavenging in fallout 4 this is like that on steroids
---
I wouldn't even be mad if I got that from the Purveyor. It's  a funny loot roll.  Now that I have seen it however, my reaction would be anger.
---
Thank you :)
---
AA would probably make them the best weapons in the game for sustained fights. They already push cheap and sustainable dps. If you are perked into heavies no challenge is too hard.
---
What should be changed - AA removed from energy weapons pool, flamer/cryolator get another round of ammo and weapon buffs.
---
Other energy weapons should have also their issues fixed. While they were buffed, they are still behind ballistic weapons.
---
Id be happy with a skateboard or a tricycle at this point.
---
How does one join, and is it platform specific?
---
This made me laugh.. I cannot come up with a valid argument against this..
---
It's definitely a little annoying to do so at times, but if I'm really serious about an item I can't inspect I'll just send them a quick message. They almost always reply instantly
---
Try the tight rope walk for some extra fun.
---
Blah blah blah crybaby, your camp still looks like everyone elses. Search these nuts off your chin HAHAHAHA
---
Maybe craftable "emergency flares" that are unique to the normal ones. That way we can still notify friends without sending a server wide message.
---
If you know stealth boys give you an advantage and don't use them due to some wrong wiring that makes you a scrub. I doubt any of these words make sense to you from what I see in past comments but "I felt like enlightening you"
---
Not bad actually. Explosive alone makes it worth it.
---
Cool! Just requested my eval! Thanks!
---
Do you listen to sleep with me podcast lol? You sound like dearest scooter :)
---
My assumption would be it would follow the other guidelines in place with plasma weapons from FO4.  Despite it being a new weapon, why would they change how Plasma works on this specific gun.
---
So... same answer I give every day when someone asks this..,,
---
How about reviewing this sub for the answers to this very question that is asked every damned day.
---
You should not be relying on others to tell you it’s worth it. Read the sub, make your own judgement
---
Fair enough!
---
It would just be super cool to have some way of transportation besides walking everywhere. If we could have something as simple as bike, needing to occasionally repair it/fill the tires every now and then, I would never fast travel tbh
---
They only made the sent and cav effect 25% less likely to work
---
Luckily my house is next to one of the locations so I always notice it going on on the map
---
Right now, live Evals are done on Xbox and PS4, with PC being through video submission, though we're hoping to address that set back very soon. To join, just go to @HOAWasteland and Twitter, hit that follow button, and you are now officially HOA material! :)
---
Oh, you have be on twitch? Nevermind. Have fun!
---
I've learned the plans. GT is toxxyn2113, just bring the ingredients.
---
Hey could I possibly get some stuff? My psn is Austin_m115
---
No, wood armor is fine, and fills a niche (best stealth armor). The problem is that it's limited to 1 star. The fix to that problem isn't too remove it from the game, it's to open it up to 2 and 3 stars.
---
I think it would be cool if firing a flare while in an event would notify the server that the event is active (Fertile Soil, Free Range, The Messenger, etc).
---
the beginning is a sludge, but I like that.  Take your time, explore what you can.  With higher levels come better gear
---
I’m disappointed they don’t have .338 Lapua on there.
---
Don't worry. Take your time. Whatever you throw at me, I'm sure it'll help.
---
Those fat mans are the biggest disappointment.  I used to love finding them in the fallout games (still get that quick excitement then realized I’m playing FO76) but now it’s just annoying to have mini nukes. Kinda have to have a explosive focused build to make them even kinda worthwhile.
---
You mean the junk fences. Yeah, those could work as a good defense to keep enemies from attacking. I like it!!
---
Same here. And the model for the bikes is already in the game...
---
What are these super mutant parts for?
---
no thanks.  I don't care for PVP
---
I was worried you’d say that. I don’t get chance to play very often so everything feels so disconnected.
---
Thanks, I’ve never made rad ant beer.  I’ll look into that!
---
Where you going to ride this bike?  Have you seen the roads? Have you seen these hills?
---
Yes but each piece has its own % chance to work, and that’s per bullet. The chances of your entire set working effectively all at the same time is not very likely.
---
what makes this item worth more than a cap?
---
*Nukes your base*
---
Nothing personnel kid
---
That was the one good thing I got and now I don't feel so lucky
---
I don't think we ever said it's mandatory you be on our HOA TV stream to get an eval...
---
... though, if you are a CAMPy award nominee, you'd be on there, so, it's your call to make and we respect your position.
---
Find gyms. The weights are all lead. There's one at the Flatwoods Motel, one at Charleston Fire Department, and one in each of the nuke silos. You can just run in, loot, and leave.
---
If you find any more gyms, I'd love to know about them.
---
For real. I'm so tired of having to use the baby beard. "Survivalist", my cram.
---
Agreed. I think if people didnt dupe all the tse weapons they wouldn't have nerfed two shot or explosive that hard. Oh well
---
My miner would love a 3 star shovel...
---
I'm sorry...an opinion? Think about this logically for a second. A user clicks "Plans" Why? Because he wants to buy some. That's the only reason. It's not good to check out which ones you already know, because only the known ones are going to be the ones the vendor has in stock, which is not all of them. So the only reason is to buy some. Why, then, place the known ones at the top of the list, when worst case scenario is that the user knows all recipes, and will scroll through all the pages to the very bottom, and find he knows them all. Second-worst scenario is he knows all but one, in which case he has to scroll them all down first, until he reaches the last page, and last recipe. As opposed to downranking  all known recipes, so that the worst case scenario, all recipes appear known, and the user knows it on the first page, and moves on. And the second-worst scenario is then the only unknown showing up at the very top of the list, already selected, for an easy purchase.
---
This isn't an opinion. This is a fact. One requires a metric fuckton of scrolling, the other does not. Whether it takes 1.5 seconds or not (it's doesn't) is completely irrelevant. 0.0000001 seconds would still be 0.0000001 seconds too many. It's a design flaw. 
---
Also, who says this behaviour would be uniform? The above example is from the point of view of the buyer. You are visiting an NPC vendor, or another player's machine. This could be reversed if your point of view is that of a seller, meaning you are visiting your own machine, or  going through your inventory and reading the recipes you bought. That is called contextual design. You see what the user is trying to do, based on context, and make it as user-friendly as possible. This game doesn't.
---
If this is was their design choice, it was an inept choice, and all of the things I said earlier still apply. 
---
As far as analogies go, what wheel shape do you prefer on your car? Your bicyle? Your rollerblades? Your fridge? Could it be...round? It's a perfect analogy because there IS the right way of doing things, and the wrong way of doing things. Provably and verifiably right, and provably and verifiably wrong. If you track the user inputs with the current system, and the proper system, the users will have to work considerably less (and this is needless work and waste of time and just general lack of respect for the consumer) with the proper system. It's not debatable. It's not an opinion. It's a fact.
---
THIS GUY RIGHT HERE!!! Do that thing he said - it'll open up a whole new game for ya!
---
[Found this in an old thread.](https://i.imgur.com/f2JRQq6.jpg)
---
The "t" is silent, and invisible...
---
A buddy of mine was checking out that pie.. I asked really what would that be valuable... Now I get it.. because it's not! tee hee..
---
... Have you lived in a city your entire life? :P My best memories of ridding bikes are from pedaling amongst the nature.
---
Nothing personal but there is more than one server...
---
yes this has been reported since yesterday, do a search.
---
Will it be approved? Will it be violation? The suspense is killing us. :)
---
Did you see the HOA member voted "Articles of Approval" on our Twitter? That gives you a good idea of some of the things we look for, or against.
---
Yep this is much needed, instead of seeing beautiful scenery or a stunning rad storm photo I am just presented with the most recent dead critter corpse I’ve taken a photo of for a challenge
---
Literally one of the best 5 guns in the game.
---
Two shot is still good, just not META.
---
Soooo what did u do and if u move then is there a place with flat land
---
You're not so far that you can't go bloody build, you'll never look back if you do.. mutations, pretty much all except empath. 3 points in luck for the perk that reduces negative effects of mutations 75%, 2 more in luck to lock your mutations, 3 more points in luck for serendipity (45% chance to dodge when 30% health or lower I think?), 3 points in agility for dodgy, and 3 points in strength for blocker (reduces all melee damage 45%)
---
Once you've got all that, make sure to get unyielding armor (+3 to all stats except endurance), whatever you can get at first.. aim for heavy armor or sentinels/cavalier which reduce damage when standing still or running. Ap refresh is great too, helps with dodgy. Action boy/girl(in agility) helps with AP refresh for dodgy as well.
---
The damage reduction from perks are so good, you can live where others might die with full health. If you're willing to stay at 20% health you get more damage with a few points in nerd rage.
---
Get yourself a bloody melee (I don't use power armor often so I use a power first, with only 7 base strength and 4 pieces unyielding it does over 1000 damage a punch, 40% more damage with power attacks- imagine what you can get with a full strength build!)
---
If you need me to I'll look up the names of those luck perks, I'm away from my PS4 at the moment.
---
Point out where this kind of scamming is against the rules of FO76. Scamming is not against the rules, and neither is PVP. When you join a group, you accept the risk of PVP.
---
PVP is still permitted on Adventure mode whether you like it or not. It is intended to exist. Party PVP is also intended to exist. Scamming is legal and allowed. Punishment of scammers is up to players unless a glitch is used to rob players of valuables.
---
Just because you don't like PVP and want to avoid PVP doesn't allow you to have a blanket avoidance of PVP when you use features that may result in PVP.
---
And again, at no point were you harassed. At no point were you unable to leave servers without being followed once you put yourself at risk of a situation you didn't want to be in. Adventure mode is not a hugbox.
---
That is how the game was made. Take it up with Bethesda. To call a player a griefer for playing the game by its rule set is cheap and makes you look petty.
---
So aside maybe some decent points, you want to remove QoL fixes?
---
Also do you mean it as survival only?
---
Hey, I have a killer .38 shell!
---
offers?
---
 I misunderstood the image, I thought I had to follow on Twich, but maybe I have to follow on twitter. Which I also don't do, but it's all good.
---
I'll do more giveaways...keep an eye out.
---
&gt; but you'd need superb rad resistance outside of power armor
---
They finally fix running in and out of the nuke zone making you no longer take rads? Pulling her out of the nuke has bigger bug risks imo but with radshield etc and someone sharing Rad Spounge it's possible inside I think.
---
&gt;Obviously I'd need more perks, but I think that would be 100% AP.
---
Eye gives Blade just flat out 100Ap before incisor even it's p good
---
Thank you, just read through it, I am most likely going to give it a shot as most things line up with what I enjoy, have a nice day!
---
see, that perfect pie is burnt!
---
I keep telling myself to hit up more player vendors just to check camps. I've seen some great designs. My personal camp is basic on the outside but detailed and functional inside.
---
thanks for the downvotes on a simple question
---
I feel like a broken record on this sub. Platform? Platform? Platform? pLATFORM?
---
Why are you lying?
---
By [Bethesda's admission](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/12/07/bethesda-responds-to-the-fallout-76-support-glitch-that-exposed-customer-data/) 65 people had their usernames, real names, email, home address, phone numbers and the last 4 digits of their CC leaked.
---
If that isn't considered personal information, what is?
---
Had 2 guys come to my camp and not even look at my vending machines, just one of them trying to team with me. I use lone wanderer 4 so I always say no anyways, but still. I have a pretty decent pvp pve mix going on with my character so I would have just let it happen
---
I'll be honest with you. I'd rather just not waste my time with it much anymore. I'll give it another shot tonight but it the same kind of stuff I used for scrip anyways.
---
I hate how one sided the turrets turrets for my camp is shit but enemies turret or building turrets are fucking amazing
---
Was that supposed to make sense lol? You said a conditional statement, but never mentioned what effect you’re insinuating it has, thus it makes no sense lol.. Maybe next time you respond to my 14 day old comment, at least make sure you proofread what you write.
---
Its likely all due to bad grammar and punctuation. I remember when my writing skill was at a 6th grade level, way back when I was in second grade.
---
I’ve deleted most of those pictures as they are completely useless to me lol
---
I've got a buddy I play with who was the same way. The easiest thing I can think of is to do all of the events you can in the Forest...it's a good way to get some XP and caps without long, drawn out quests. As for the main story, the beginning is a bit of a grind, but once you hit a certain point, you can start to just run through things. It always helps to play with people, too...What system are you on?
---
Yes please I've been dying for a bigger beard to go with my drifter outfit
---
I just delete the ones I don't like
---
VTU x2, in the vault part and in the door up the hill from the nukashine.
---
You can see power armor behind the purveyor. How come she gets to keep all of it?
---
it's because you have the "Free" on it..
---
You can inspect the weapons/armor before you buy them now.
---
What info do you need to provide in the evsl request?
---
Well no, and Bethesda should fix that.  Also, he should use the perk to allow repairing to 200%.
---
I knew I was forgetting the VTU one but I didn't realize there was another so close, thanks!
---
Damn I don't think I've gotten 1 from camp fire tales. But I've also lost the mission a lot more lately when it's the wave of bugs instead of the wendigo.
---
Fk that i want a snallygaster to ride. Paint him green and Call him yoshi
---
Are you still doing this? If so I'm interested GT: Drkbladez22
---
The events have nothing to do with the badges. All of the badges are complex challenges. Open up the challenges menu, scroll to World, and scroll down to Tadpole challenges and Possum challenges. Complete an entire challenge and you gain the badge. The events simply drop some random stuff that can help in some of those badges (like giving the S'mores recipe).
---
Do u run a full set
---
The thing about that is that I like mostly all of the pictures I take, an example of this is a picture I took of a wendigo skull in the WS golf club with the Whitesprings filter. I love that photo so much but I don’t want to see it in my loading screens.
---
That lever is perfect... if it's for sale let me know haha
---
I have a bugged one of a dead glowing gulper that I deleted but it comes up every other loading screen, I might be stuck with that one lol
---
Just follow us on Twitter @HOAWasteland, DM us your system and gamer tag, and we'll set you up an appt. If on PC, Follow and DM, and we'll ask you for a video submission.
---
it IS a grind, with minimal story, but still it has enough charm to somehow hold my attention. Case in point, I'm at work, but somehow on here, still thinking about FO :)
---
But like you, I'm level 70 and still don't have great equipment. I try to not stress about it though, it just means I have to use my brain a little more ;)
---
TBF, they’d to sell it for 2000 atoms in the shop, but you’d also get an even better one that used 50% less materials to do repairs, every time you beat the imposter sheepsquach.
---
And everything in it costs exactly 0 caps!
---
Used to, switched to vanguard or unyeilding
---
Confirmed. YOU see your cool name. I do not.
---
Gotcha
---
I'm level 49 and only just discovered the shopping mall beneath The Whitespring. I'd never gone inside, haha.
---
So many unknown plans available! A lot of them for stupid prices, thoguh. :(
---
I have a pic like that but it’s a wendigo skull. Not bugged but the picture in general
---
Some of y'all never played with legos and it shows.
---
take down the queen
---
Hope he spends ten years trying to keep the floors waxed.
---
What level are you? That is the beautiful struggle I love about the early game. I was the same way and suffered. My advice is to go around and collect resources to craft boards since the materials are common, then scrap them regularly to learn mods. It will be the strongest melee you will have for a while and helps out a lot. I also pick all the flowers I can and have Lead Belly equipped permanently at the beginning. Once you get over that early game struggle, you will find it far easier. Hang in there!
---
I think it'd be better solved by an option from Bethesda to set pre-loaded Perk combinations and load them on the fly.  Maybe only allow them to swap out so often, no sooner than every 2 minutes, or limit it to swapping out in the CAMP.  Or have no cooldown while in CAMP. But there are truly no 'passive' perks, they're all active in one form or another.  If you want to pop that Tier 3 lock, have the Perks loaded.
---
Fallout had a working corvega. I don't see the reason we couldn't get cars.
---
Queen fights, specifically, give you ultracite PA mod plans. I think I've gotten 2-3 prime  receiver plans from normal SB's, no ultracite PA plans.
---
Then why do you comment on a post about PvP?
---
I posted a comment a while back about an easter egg I had found and asked for feedback from the other players on things like that they had found. Recieved FANTASTIC responses - a ton of stuff I didn't know existed, even after playing for God only knows how many hours since, (and including BETA). Check out that thread. Might be some surprises in there for ya!
---
Not excusing this ridiculous bug, but how the hell are you breaking so much power armor? I typically play at least a couple hours per night, and maybe 3-5 on weekends, and it's been probably a month since I had to repair a piece. Even then, it was only the legs, and they were still at like 1/2 durability, I just repaired them since I was in the menu attaching mods.
---
Also, no, I don't use the perk that reduces armor degradation.
---
the raiders ate them
---
Doesn't it spoil?
---
I've been looking for a deal that good but I got impatient and I've payed between 350-500 for serums :(
---
I grew up in the West Virginia hills.  Biking downhill is great, uphill is just awful.
---
...okay this is better. If Ark can do it then SO CAN WE
---
While we're at it, incendiary weapons could make up for their high ammo cost/lower damage (comparatively) with a higher DOT and fear-inducing effect (maybe a passive bonus against insects). 
---
Or imagine if Anti-Armor weapons didn't simply ignore armor, but actually (and visually) damaged the target of the armor. Though this would require an armor system similar to enemies in The Division. 
---
And what if explosive rounds included a slight concussion effect to make up for the now reduced damage that would stack until it caused enemies to stumble or even fall (depending on the amount of damage dealt and what weapon). 
---
Also remove the Vampire legendary effect as it makes literally no sense in any context (this isn't a 'magic' game). Or if you must include some sort of lifesteal  then have it only apply to Cultist weapons. Maybe wood armor to give it some gimmick other than being useless. Or perhaps give the Syringer a 'vampiric' barrel mod that fires special darts that drain the enemy of blood so when you loot them you find more blood packs/sacs.
---
Also just remembered that the top of the monorail elevator has a ton of weight plates and concrete.
---
If they are in an event and shoot off a flare it should do a notification server wide that the event is active. Like how the Encrypted and SBQ quests do. Like say I want to start Free range but no one else is around shoot off a flare and then people know the event is active and can join.
---
Well that wasn't very country roads of them :(
---
Thanks for that good news, I've done this too in my excitement and found a level 30 and was stupidly presuming a 50 :(
---
I think it would make sense to have an anti-energy resistance effect, since there’s already an anti-ballistics one, no? But tbh I would even be fine with this, just something to even it up a bit. I would like some compensation for my AA prefixes though lol 😩
---
I use team invites because I want people on my team so I and they can benefit from team perks, and I can share them a good one as well
---
What drives me crazy is they keep saying that the game wasn't "built" for cars. Fine. It \_was\_ built for horses. They own every bit of code to have ride-able horses in every fallout game they own, because it's all based on fucking elder scrolls code anyway.
---
**BETHESDA PLEASE**
---
I hate the perk system cause of this. Lets us scale the card if we only want to run 1 lvl of it instead of having duplicates that just take up space. Lets us trade in multiple cards for a new pack or something.
---
Two legendary yao gaui every time? Where you at? I want some of that action.
---
Not a gym but there's a lot on top of the monorail elevator along with several concrete bags. Those were previously unpickable but now it is !
---
^^^^ someone get this person a job at BGS
---
Wow, you really don't read more of the lore do you?  I hate that I have to point things like this out.  But here goes.
---
It was revealed in a terminal in Vault 102 that all horses were actually Chinese spies in pantomime horse costumes.  They weren't native to America at all.  This was a very long spy operation to take down America - dating back to before it was colonized.  And we fell for it.
---
Just before the bombs hit, all of the horses mysteriously chartered flights back to China.  This should've been a clue.
---
I also would like my facial hair to not vanish with masks and the eyebot helmet.  :-(
---
This is very much a "make your own fun" type of game. What level are you exactly?
---
Yeah, it is a big dumb joke. You have to farm SBQs or player vendors that have farmed SBQs.
---
The queen is your best bet, but still not a guarantee. I did multiple queen fights in a weekend and got Jetpacks for other suits but no Ultracite plans. She still has the best loot I think.
---
Since when? Couldn’t last night unless the vendor was in their camp at the same time.
---
And here I am just trying to make the game allow me to put stairs in a way that could be accessed without jumping.
---
Yeah I like that. If we have the level 3-5 of something. Give us the option to reduce it to a rank one by clicking right or left when we choose it. 
---
Would make re-specs much easier with cards you already have
---
What item could possibly be worth 20k? I've seen level 50 Bloodied rapid explosive .50 cal machine gun for 10k and thats pretty high up there in terms of rng rolls
---
Everytime I see a motorcycle I shot it or hit it.  I can make a fully functional power armour set, but I can't repair a motorcycle?  My dreams of cruising through Appalachia, wind in my hair, bugs on my teeth will sadly never come true.
---
That's nice. I still want horses

I had a grand vision for a new base the other day. After building the shell I realized I have basically none of the decor blueprints. So it's not always because people are lazy.
---
I edited my comment so maybe it is more legible to you now. 
---
Now since you didn't get the point the first time, you are the scrub.
---
Oh please, please, please!!!
---
Did you see them shoot?  The robot vendor and company will usually expire when someone FTs directly to the train station.  No killing required.
---
Well one of the images on the “roadmap” has a shadowy drawing of a vault boy with a small robot next to him. I have a strong feeling that they are copy pasting Automaton stuff into fo76 and I am HERE for it boi
---
Wouldn’t this make weapons that deal both types of damage OP as fuck? Not opposed to it, just a counter-point. I’m sure they could do something to work around that. I’m so annoyed ;/
---
sure... they do this, But when I try to put something within 5 feet of my staircase the game scolds me for having intersecting parts.
---
We need some cool quips as he's working as well.
---
"Work work work"
---
"If only SOMEONE would help out around here..."
---
"Not broken"  
---
I mean even when I get 3\*s they literally drop junk rolls. I've had maybe 3 rolls off of legendary enemies I've kept longer than selling it (Noting I'm level 172).
---
Just a quick follow-up: Here's some of the things we evaluate on, as voted on and ratified by HOA Members:   https://twitter.com/HoaWasteland/status/1129051055482736640?s=20
---
Perk cards suck all around, my Lone wanderer perk card needs 4 charisma to equip, figure that one out.  I only put 3 points into it.
---
I decided to move. I was actually right next to a big mansion so the scorched spawned constantly. 
---
If you're looking for a new place with flat land, the savage divide has a bit of that. Toxic valley too, but I gave up living there with all the radiation.
---
I was thinking the same thing. Unless they're playing for hours on end and also ignoring the armor condition. It's a shitty bug to experience. But after the first time I wouldn't let it happen again.
---
I have a simpler, better idea: Have the vendors respawn every 24 hours on set schedule, like every other god damned online game that has vendor spend limits or daily specials.
---
I don't want to have to remember when I made my first sale yesterday and calculate when the 20 hours is up so that I can sell stuff today, I just want a consistent vendor refresh every day. Heck, the daily challenges have a global reset every 24 hours, why not have the vendor pools and daily missions (Biv, scouts, etc) reset globally at the same time?
---
That's because you "sir" are just a better man than I am (Salute)
---
Same. Make it like the Mr Handy in Fallout Shelter. Will attack anything that attacks your camp, and will harvest from a single assigned resource. So I can have it pick a single water purifier or a single crop and have it harvest anytime its ready. Would be slow to accumulate, but better than the current system and shouldn't be too balance upsetting.
---
RIP, my colorblind eyes.
---
Any armor with assassin and cavalier is better than any armor without it for pvp.
---
For that price? Yeah you'll get your money's worth, in my opinion.
---
I agree.. I don't have to repair my own PA nearly as often as he does..  and I don't use the perk to make it more durable.   
---
SO now the question is .. WHY is his PA breaking so much..  and just freaking disappears when it breaks.. I don't get it.
---
so Is this a bug?  or what...
---
Sent a ticket to Bethesda on Bethesda support
---
GET  
---
OFF  
---
THE  
---
GODDAMN  
---
BUNKER!!  
---
Seriously. If someone who is doing enough damage to gain aggro cannot be landed on, she won't land.  
---
Get off the fucking bunker, people.
---
I'm sure we all have seen the underground many times from the bugs !!
---
I've already gotten 2 possum badges from the events, and my brother has gotten 6. I haven't completed a single possum world challenge. Not sure about my brother, but I don't think he's completed any, either. If you notice, there aren't enough world challenges to get everything you can buy with badges.
---
Once you buy it, you can repair it if destroyed. You only need to re-buy if you want a second Mr Handy. Just like Fallout Shelter.
---
At least you had the decency to give people a heads up. Jolly good show!
---
You can build 9 stories off the ground in some parts of the map.
---
Go read the inside  the vaults, read the reddit, do your own damn homework.
---
Sale: now for 12500 caps!
---
Sure why not
---
Humor
---
Yep. Watched him shoot and melee.
---
I know it self destructs.
---
We already have a limited time to view it so it should be un-killable by greifers.
---
That statement works both ways lol I never check before I nuke.
---
To bad u cant change the paint color. Now i have to get extra lucky and not only get the pieces i need....but in forest if i want it to match
---
200 caps max
---
No, it wouldn't.
---
I'm laughing at that one!.....
---
You still didn’t word it correctly lol.
---
if you don’t use stealth boys due to some wrong wiring that you are a scrub.
---
Maybe instead try:
---
You don’t use stealth boys because you are wrongly wired as a scrub
---
To which I would reply:
---
I don’t need stealthboys to get kills, you do, who’s the scrub again?
---
Perfectly logical assumption, perfectly logical question.
---
But it is a new weapon in 76 and it deals 100% energy damage nonetheless.
---
*sigh*
---
I was 100% happy with my camp until I saw this.
---
They have value, but what are they actually used for?
---
tires*
---
I'm digging the short night vision scope mod on that!
---
How about a Gutsy?  Or better yet, why not bring in the whole Robot manufacturing mod like we had in FO4?
---
Well, I got mine for 50-100 caps a piece from the player's vending machines.
---
So what?
---
Doesn't show a spoil bar it just sits there, but now I'm double guessing myself and will go in game and check :/
---
My base was a mushroom.. two 1x1's stacked vertically, and then a concrete floor with all my stuff up there.
---
Aite :)
---
Just narrowing to the item. Still multiple primary and secondary effects that can be randomized. You make your laziness cost more to balance it out.  Besides, multiple other games have this mechanic and somehow, some way the world has not ended.
---
Heating issues could be handled by a combo of a desk fan and cryolator.
---
I haven't even SEEN an Xbox anywhere in Appalachia, though.
---
Maybe Valley Galleria has Xboxes?
---
Explore, young grasshopper...
---
If you’re wondering if there is one overall story guiding your every move, the answer is No.  You’ve been released from the Vault, now you need to learn the skills to survive and piece together what happened. 
---
Personally, I played as an explorer, discovering the map by traveling on foot for much of it, picking up quests as I went along, and completing them for experience points. That got me to about level 45 or so.  I know that I was over level 50 before I did any events in the Mire.  
---
However, if you’re a bit impatient and want to level up quickly, then you’re better of joining a group like Discord simply because it’s the easiest way to find escorts into the higher level areas where you can get a lot of XP.  I believe that they organize XP farming runs for lower level players.
---
You don't get back enough to buy another one
---
ahhh
---
Maybe, but for me the whole idea of AA is a can of worms what won't get any better. For ballistic weapons it is the best thing after bloodied, except it has no drawbacks. Now if you add same effect to weapons where you can easily have ammo - heavy weapon energy guns will be top tier outclasing everything.
---
I know Toxic Goo doesn't spoil, maybe digestive does.
---
It's not global, it's 20 hours from the first transaction you make. Example: I log in an 6pm and immediately sell one item to a vendor. Over the course o the night I go back to that vendor until his caps are exhausted at midnight. The next day the caps will refresh at 2pm, even if my last purchase was only 14 hours prior.
---
While this is true in theory (I regularly do this in load screens), the game doesn't always handle it well when in a vendor/terminal/etc and I have had it lock me into a terminal once or twice (and sometimes do other odd things, like never list me as able to fast travel to teammates etc Even when not in danger).  So I wouldn't say it will never have a negative impact, but it at least isn't supposed to (it is worth noting I play on PS4, so it may be more stable in PC/Xbox1).
---
Nope, these Mr. Handys use proprietary screws, bolts, and software. You have to buy the Handy Mr. Handy Repair Handy to repair your Mr. Handy.
---
Not any more OP than a regular ballistic gun is with anti armor. It would actually put the plasma gun on par with most other guns, which would be nice. Most other weapons with split damage have so little energy damage it wouldn't make much of a difference.
---
what? it's literally supported by *real science*. here's an article I found less than ten seconds after googling gender vs sex https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/232363.php
---
Whelp, that's just being a Jerky Mcjerkface.  
---
Head to Lady Janet's Soft Serve.  Go West on the road, shortly past the tipped over bus, and next to the 25 mph speed limit sign.  You can repeat it easier here and it seems to spawn more often.
---
I could totally ride a brahmin
---
Yeah I used to make posts when I found him to get lots of other people the opportunity to view his inventory but due to people just spite killing him I've stopped announcing it :/ Now I just tell my friends and they let me hop in and out so I can pick up a few things and I try to sell them for reasonable prices so people have a chance to get his clothes / plans without the headache.
---
I actually submitted a ticket to Bethesda about this, as Field Scribe Outfit is my main outfit.
---
Nope, it has no Health Bar just stays in Junk and shows 2 Adhesive. Off to the bogs I go :)
---
I frequently use trees to rout wiring if it fits my needs. I just don’t like wires running across lanes of travel or across my workshop. In Fo76 I also try to build in modular units because I find myself needing to change my camp location fairly often. This is why my buildings end up like boxes because they are easier to place in new locations. My current camp has a living unit, a workshop unit, and a power supply unit. Each one is no bigger than a 3x3 and I can just place each one out and wire them fairly quickly.
---
Thanks I'll try that spot.
---
I'm just not going to waste any more time. They make design choices, it's their game, and I'm okay with the choices they've made. Unless you're a new player, you're very rarely going to be looking for plans. A vending machine can only hold 30 things, which means you scroll very quickly. Everything else you've complained about has very little impact on me as a player.
---
I'm okay if they end up "fixing it", but at the same time that's such a tiny qol improvement, I'd much rather they add content. You sound like you're just OCD- out of all the quality of life improvements, I doubt this makes the top 10 for most players.
---
And your wheel analogy still sucks, because there's not a right way and a wrong way, that's completely false. There's ways that people have accepted, that doesn't mean there aren't different ways or even better ways of doing things- that's how things have evolved as you say.
---
But Fallout is Fallout, out of all the things I can possibly complain about, you've chosen what I think is the most petty. It could be part of a general redesign perhaps, because the entire inventory design is flawed on a deeper level, players have constantly commented about this.. but they should fix it all if they're going to waste any effort on it.
---
But, you should possibly look up the definition of opinions, because that's all you've got. And again, I'm not going to waste another reply because you clearly don't understand that. Have a nice day.
---
That's why they call it gambling 🤷‍♂️
---
Honey, this kids is playing too many games...
---
"What do you want to do with your life??" ahhhhhhhh
---
True - so this seems like the best solution. Seems like a really easy fix too.
---
Where do you find mods for guns? I've looked EVERYWHERE but have only found the Ivory grip and some shitty misc stuff from scrapings. It's hard to find enough lever actions with mods you don't have to actually do something with
---
I'm betting it takes 30 minutes to load when someone fast travels there.
---
I favor the more subtle confetti that often goes unnoticed unless you pile it up.
---
fk a horse - lemme ride a deathclaw plZ
---
in all seriousness - i would love to have horses - my friend and i were actually wondering why they don't exist in fallout at all :/
---
from experience.... It's because you have your left speaker on the right!
---
Looking for groups on Xbox is a good way. 👍
---
It seems to be randomly generated 8 character words, so occasionally it comes up with something really esoteric.
---
It doubles the yeld.
---
Ok I'll try this
---
This summarizes it well: https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/probability-events-independent.html
---
you can get rdr2 ... thats alot of horseback riding
---
This is a really great idea.
---
If you *actually* want to find them you can use the terminal in the bunker. Activate the "find a code fragment" quest and it'll give you a side quest showing the general area of a scorched officer.
---
That is some God Tier shit there.
---
*Repair kits received in game repair to 150%. Atomic shop repair kits repair only to 100%.
---
Also don't take their junk bag.  That's a straight up dick on an Adventure server.
---
Ssshhhhh. Those aren't the ideas you're supposed to give.
---
but pls fix the 3 star wood pieces
---
Hmm super mutants drop bones, not sure if that’s what they mean
---
Yes, the perk deck is definitely something that game needs.  It's said often.
---
How do you farm this event? It seems so hard to find since you need someone to start it.
---
Nothing has made me RAGE as much as their bonkers building restrictions.   I’ve ALT+F4ed half a dozen time out of pure uncontainable fury.
---
What are these things for?  I've picked up a few already.
---
Xbox
---
Much appreciated.
---
10K+
---
I am hoping eventually we’ll be able to craft robots for exactly this, like the automatron FO4 dlc. It would be neat to say “this robot is a walking sentry” or “this robot auto deposits/bulks junk from my resources (especially if assigned to an owned workshop) but you should only be able to have a couple or even 1 “mega” robot in your camp. 
---
This would also open itself up to atom shop robot cosmetics. I don’t think these robots should be able to “companion” with you. Just an automated camp/workshop fun thing. 
---
I also wish we had the animal traps AND the remote eyebot pod that would search the common wealth for an assigned resource. Just some supplemental ideas!
---
Ha ha ha... but seriously, it’s really high in fibre!
---
Wish they had a wiring system similar to Rust. You can just wire directly through walls, along ceilings and such. It's so much better than Fallout's system.
---
So you'll fix this but not the broken challenges...
---
TL:DR
---
What about a radstag mount? Imagine pulling up in a cowboy outfit on a glowing radstag. I'd like that
---
I used to farm tons of goo for Overdrive but this never happened. There is a spot that always has 5 or 6 of them right next to each other. Just look for that and remember where it is when you find it (because it's not near any markers), and you'll be set. It's somewhere between Sunset Farm and Watoga.
---
I prefer how I worded my sentence originally so no Thank you. 
---
Just because YOU do not have to use stealth boys to get kills. It does not change the fact that stealth boys are the meta right now for being incredibly useful in PvP. You choosing to not use the stealth boys because "I'm a PvP God why would I need such a thing". Is an excuse or maybe the real reason as to why you don't use them. Maybe it's money? Maybe its pride? Who knows or cares honestly? What matters is you not using something that is known to give you an advantage because of your own personal mindset, morals or beliefs. Makes you a scrub my dear boy
---
Yeah I think there should be a perk for when firing Heavy Guns you get x amount of stagger. Maybe up to 70 stagger resist? That would make them a lot more viable.
---
Ooh I'm a fan
---
No u
---
&gt;the civil war era Gatling gun was chambered in .308
---
.308 didn't come about until after WWII.  The hand-crank Gatling gun in-game would more accurately take .44 or .45-70
---
Super mutants and the gore bags. THey also tend to hand the bone chimes. All should count, how I got mine done (go to West-Tek and Huntersville).
---
What is the next update bringing, and when is it expected?
---
Thanks for all the upvotes.
---
Yeah, I think that was the Dirty Water I have been drinking :/
---
Nice - thanks!
---
Just lucky probably. I know that I get screwed out at least one legendary a session because someone one shots (or kills like three seconds) the legendary enemy before I can even switch to a ranged weapon so I can get a shot in. I actually keep a Tesla rifle on me (I run a unarmed melee build lol) just to get hits on as many enemies as possible before they are slaughtered. I would definitely be in board for OP suggestion even at the risk of rewarding a few lazy folk with free loot.
---
Real question tho - this is a Fallout 76 sub and if you're no longer going to be making Fallout 76 content - why would people from this sub subscribe?
---
Haha Haha Tyvm :)
---
Gather berries, corn, etc you find in the wild. Hold onto them til they expire. Now you have fertilizer. Collect more plants as you explore. Plant a garden at your camp. Now you're never out of food.
---
You should be running into tons of mole rats and mongrels in your exploration - when you loot a raw meat you automatically unlock a basic recipe for it. Kill every animal you find to keep a supply of food.
---
Plenty of player bases that are visible now also have farms, or free food in their vendors, if you're desperate.
---
It shouldn't be too long before you can start crafting better weapons, or modding ones you find. Do that every 5 or so levels to keep up as you grow.
---
If you're low level, pick up EVERY piece of garbage you can. Sticks, dead animals, crap weapons, clipboards, pens. Everything. Go back to camp and scrap it all every time you get close to over-encumbered (you can fast travel to your camp for free).
---
For basic stuff, you'll have enough mats pretty quickly.
---
After that, yeah, just do events. I think I did the Encryptid event the first time at like level 18 or 20? I died a LOT, but aside from dropping junk, there is no penalty for death that I can find (aside from mat costs to repair your armor). I was basically useless, I used my hunting rifle to try and take down the robots and shot at the imposter sheepsquatch, too. I did barely any damage, but it was enough for me to get loot and exp when the high level players downed the boss, haha.
---
You can also go to the Whitespring and hang out near the gates. Wander in a little bit, take a pot shot at a high level ghould, then haul ass back to the gates so the Assaultrons and Protectrons can kill it for you. Easy XP there, too.
---
With player vending, see if you can find cheap weapons/armor, though.
---
PSA: THE DESPAIR MOD ON WORTHLESS GODDAM LUMP OF SHIT IS BUGGED PLZ FIX ASAP!!!!
---
I spent all 1000 scrip on 2* melee weapons.  13 of which wound up being "stalker" including two identical stalker shovels.  I plan to continue trying this weekend but yesterday after getting out of work and having the majority of my drops effectively be 1* weapons I rage quit and played overwatch.
---
stinky meat, squishy meat, old meat, new meat... well new to grahm anyways
---
Much appreciated
---
You can craft a recall key. Vendors have the assaultron recall circuit board. Craft the keys and server hop. Then you can activate the event at the terminal right there.
---
Not me, but Dearest Scooter sounds like someone worth checking out :D
---
One big issue, I have. Let me preface by saying I am in the PVP boat with you all. That being said, your claim that the vocal **minority** is making all the decisions is wrong. We PVP players are the minority. The PVE players are the majority. 
---
We won't be getting PVP back as we want it. Bethesda wants money. It is that simple. They are appeasing the majority so they play longer and have more opportunities to buy useless atomic shop crap. 
---
Personally, to rant about the current state of PVP, it seems clear we are no longer meant to profit off PVP. I feel this makes things worse for the PVE players. There are many reasons people PVP. Mine was for profit. If I won't be profiting no matter what, then there is nothing stopping me from killing everything. I was discerning with my targets. I cared only about the cap rewards. Cap rewards are trash now, it is all about junk rewards. Because of this, I am forced to kill everyone in hopes they have tons of junk on them.
---
Sorry I made an  error, I was hunting Digestive Goo and that one has no health bar, so it at least just stays in Junk.
---
Good thing is these pitcher plants are tied to the server, just found that out, they are all available again on login so shouldn't take long to gather some more.
---
did it grow mushrooms on its back?
---
I used to think like you back when I first started playing, but Team perks are great. 20% speed increase, +25% mutation strength are always on my perk list. Then there's free fast travel to team mates and their workshops, and the potential chance to have someone run after you helping with quests like companions in previous Fallout games.
---
I don't usually interact with my random teammates unless they decide to interact with me or follow me of their own volition, but it's a mutually beneficial situation for both of us. I can share any level perk with an unyielding build, and there's no real downside other than not being able to use the Lone Wanderer perk which isn't that much of a loss, given the upsides
---
You might search thru the datamined stuff and see if there's some things you like! //clutching my atoms for backpack skins
---
Thumbs up for a Real Genius quote.
---
It's 75% off for a reason. You could maybe like it but it's not a mistake the price is as discounted as it is so soon.
---
You're welcome to add me.  I'm still pretty low level, around 17 I think.  
---
GT is my user name here.
---
Oh lmao no way! Those keycards are 1800 caps each!
---
Oh I haven't checked how the backpack looks with Engineer - it's one of my fave outfits but I don't think any of the current backpack colors will really go with it :(
---
I will for sure add. Thanks.
---
Find random people and just ask to play with them or of course you could just send me a message. My gamertag is Ezeke1134.
---
I've filled an entire room with toilets. 
---
Another was I put a wall just inside their front door. Placed a mounted wendigo facing the door. You know the moment they come home 🤣
---
'cause and cause are two different words.  learn the difference.
---
Did it hate Fashnacht?
---
My friend has a lot of caps pretty much all the time so she doesn't mind buying them.
---
 Yup that's how it is. A good hit of rad resistance, an X0-1 for instance, cuts it back a lot. ;)
---
Even easier, go to wendigo cave, bones are everywhere
---
Well im doing 3 more fallout content and I can always make fallout content for my fallout subscribers; a playlist specifically for Fallout or F76. 
---
Love your question its a very good point.
---
Apart from being able to upload more fallout 76 content ill be doing giveaways for real life items.
---
Thanks for your time and Im happy to answer and eventually provide proof of good content. Wether it being fallout or day to day life stuff.
---
Mikhail Kalashnikov disliked this
---
I'd be into this, just to be helpful.  The caps should come out of the event completion, just for being a true Responder.  Maybe a higher payout the further apart the the responder's level is to the player in distress, which would encourage high level players to lend a hand.  Possibly the chance at rare responder outfits.
---
I still dont understand why the enclave doesnt sell an item that resets all your Special points (and perk cards).
---
But I've gotten the level 1 hacker card 4 times, what do i know
---
Must be nice 😂
---
I loved the orbital strikes thanks, I hope you have been enjoying the butt pain
---
Living in a post apocalyptic hell-scape is no excuse to slack off on a healthy diet :D
---
Sunnytop Station has a few bone dudes laying around...
---
I got sick of fighting the build menu for two days trying to build something i liked and finally just said screw it left it as a fenced foundation with my crafting benches, vendor, and a bed thrown in the corner. If i get bored this i may take another crack at it.
---
I used some of my challenge atoms on the black skin, with the shovel and whatnot, its not bad.
---
Wear a Hazmat Suit while collecting.
---
She's my Fallout Sugar Mama 😂
---
I remembered the that in the capital wasteland. Let's not go that path. 🤢
---
Love this idea.
---
Just making LF friends posts here seems to work alright :) and the lfg on xbox is a good place sometimes too
---
Your original sentence made no sense, but ok you go with that lol.
---
In survival you would drop all of your stealthboys for me, trust me. I’ve got the anti stealthboy gun, a 1* Star bloodied Tesla that has killed hundreds of stealthboy bitches. The only one star I carry, and it gets as many kills as my handmade.
---
So you keep crutching on stealthboys, it won’t help you kill someone like me, and it sure as hell won’t allow you to learn better strategies to use and improve yourself instead of relying on one crutch, but alas, you likely won’t understand this logic because you’re a stealthboy kid, the true definition of a scrub pvp’er in fallout.
---
Dam :/ I just got a decent roll on a 3* urban scout armor piece and was wondering about this. Guess I’ll stick with the 2* raider piece for now since I can deep pocket it and i can make it welded.
---
I’m playing ark currently, just pooped while reading this...made my day. Ty.
---
Exercise is nice :3
---
Pop a Rad-x, collect 200 dirty water, boil with wood you accumulate as you slowly creep over-encumbered to a cooking station :)
---
Or, as I do nowadays, equip\[ END perk that removes rads in the daytime. Take the rads but watch them visibly disappear before your eyes :)
---
Yeah right now I am rocking the Black Backpack + Hunters Long Coat and it looks really nice together.
---
Wait, the additional bullet doesn't do 100% damage? How much does it to? Ive never had a TS gun so I always just assumed it was the aame as shooting 2 bullets.
---
Does it use up a second bullet? Or just split one round into 2?
---
They're just environmental storytelling. No in game use.
---
I'm on PC, but godspeed and good luck.
---
Also bribery might help, if you already have 2 sets of the bug parts you need you shouldn't have any problem finding someone.
---
No, it's tyres.
---
Great idea! Take my upvote.
---
I'm not sure what people would think about my base.  It's built at one of those rail posts, partially underneath it.  It has a ridiculous staircase going up to an area on the rail post, where I've planted eyesore vegetables on top of fires (with a couch in case you wanna sit up there and stare at the plants).  The stairs are ridiculous but would make sense as something that's supported by the rail post.  
---
And the house itself, is doorless with an open side and a second floor that is just a spot for turrets and a generator.  
---
it looks kind of like someone started building something and stopped half way through, but I like it because it's like someone built a homely little hovel underneath an old rusting out rail tower.  
---
Also has a junk extractor, which is worth more than any pretty home is.
---
I only have weapons in vendor stock but do have some armors where weapon reduction is the only good effect. Toss me out a price that you think sounds fair per piece. I know weapon weight reduction is worth more than a good bit but because they're level 50s I'll think about any offer
---
How do you change the colour of lights?
---
Yeah, sorry a bit of clarity. I often am playing with my wife. Sometimes in a team sometimes not. I meant specifically I don't answer unsolicited random team invites from players that I have never run across or had interaction with. If I've run across you and we've chatted or traded and what have you; I'm down to run some adventures.  If you're just a rando reaching out because you see me as the highest level guy on the server? Nah.
---
Not surprising
---
Got mine for $20 and it was worth it.
---
Yeah the field scribe outfit is one of favorite outfits had to change it for something else after I noticed the clipping.
---
Do I need the mutation perk in luck to lock those mutations in? I’ve been afflicted with a couple mutations I really liked and then accidentally rad-away-ed them away. 
---
And thanks for the info! I’ve got a handful of luck points I could apply some different perks to in the next few levels. (Definitely started out a little unfocused in my build, like I always seem to do on my first play through)
---
But if they fix that you just know it's going to do something else, like add five hundred pounds of carry weight :)
---
Though I think having it tied to a decision in game that the players aren't actually aware that it will have consequences until later would also be interesting...see how the players ACTUALLY deal with it rather than players attempting to skew the results one way or another, then have to live with the results.
---
If you go to the whitesprings service entrance there are tons of bones in/around the dumpsters.
---
This is incorrect. You just need to be on the right server.
---
2 things:
---
Why can't you just learn the definition of scrub? 
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Same, except of the 'raider-looking chick', it's a Nuka-Cola chugging Owlman with a bomber jacket.
---
Found it yesterday from a vendor for 1k
---
ever fight super mutants?
---
I knocked this out in the wendigo cave which you have to visit for this badge anyway
---
That is a really great idea. Maybe it could even harvest crops and water, kinda like in Fallout Shelter :)
---
The aquaboy perk should really just make you not take rads.
---
I'll second some bigger beards!
---
Yeah I saw my friend with the tank sticking out on that outfit, looked kinda neat. Besides the backpack issue I feel like the field and normal scribe outfits didn't get much attention for polished details. The details on those two outfits are pixelated as hell in comparison to the buckles on the new backpacks themselves.
---
auto-chip wood armor and assaultron heads. Seriously, it's amusing how many people come to reddit specifically to bitch about this who very clearly don't lurk here.
---
Lol I'm level 518 and I have about ten copies of goat legs.  I always seem to open it in packs. 
---
It would be cool to be able to trade them in, even at like two or three to one.
---
I looked it up, it said your username.
---
My characters got leveled items (unfortunately)
---
I understand the confusion. Members of the HOA know that "floating" refers to camps in the sky held up by ladders with no no support poles or logical foundation system. We call those floaters. They are an instant violation.
---
I was able to put one foundation partially outside of the circle if it's the corner and the two adjacent pieces are inside of the circle.
---
Guy talking about him told us, that sloths are dirty animals with fur full of insects and this big one was same, so i belive they could have fungus growing in their fur.
---
Also he told us, that this is only animal that had same ability with tongue like giraffe.
---
Damn it Bethesda. I love their games but jesus
---
Idk he is americano, i can't speak americano :D
---
I knew what was going to happen, hence why I never stated I was surprised or asked if it had happened to anyone else.
---
I lurk this forum more than you and most people trust me pal.
---
Or a Mr. Handy with some faulty programming... at 10 caps a pop.
---
You'd have the most visited CAMP in all the server!
---
What pieces are you looking for? What extra pieces do you have? I got two more pieces today.
---
Or even just put them away at 0 weight so we can get them out of our inventory so we don’t have to flip through them when we re-spec for lockpicking or hacking
---
if you can make a suit of power armor but cant make a tire, something isnt right
---
The dumpsters near the service entrance to WS bunker have bones. 
---
Bone chimes are at Westech research in the trailer as you enter the yard.  
---
Bone chimes as you enter the Freak Show
---
There isn't one directly in game, but it can be done via the console itself instead of a phone (I haven't checked recently enough to recall if there is an option to see the player profile from the game menu, but that would at least remove needing to type the name at the risk of losing the ability to know what is going on in the game).  Xbox tends to make messaging a bit easier in general, but I agree it probably isn't enough so to change people from just tossing invites instead.
---
Though if I don't have anything that should need inspecting, I generally ignore random requests due to early experiences with people bypassing passive etc like the OP expressed (that and I am often not on a mic while doing my own thing and don't like to just leave people hanging if they were thinking I was going to be sticking around etc).
---
Yea so eager to help lol
---
I already did it there, and if you need help I can.
---
No. It has been discussed pretty thoroughly. 
---
People who felt that in this game that they ought to be able to attack anyone of any level at any time and hound them mercilessly until they log off the servers had their say, as did people who hate those people as well as did people with varying positions in between. 
---
My opinion, which I shared, was that the people who enjoy randomly attacking anyone at any time are better off on the survival server, because the game was sold as something that Fallout fans, who enjoy single player games, were concerned about. They were basically told that if they didn't want to engage in pvp, aggressors would be dealt with punitively. 
---
We can all agree that they bounty system was less than ideal. What gets lost for some "no limit' pvp advocates is that the people who don't like pvp are paying customers too, and their opinions also count.
---
That's for sure not true with the armor paints. AT least specifically with the Vault Tec paints, which are the only ones I have
---
I guess I’ll mark that down as a maybe than.
---
If it’s saved in “stored,” then it’s already built. So choose that one and place it.
---
I have currently 103 scrips but can't buy 100 scrip item.
---
Good to know. I didn't know those existed yet!
---
Well, I only need mothman, do you still have him spawned?
---
I keep it mainly for roleplaying as I have all deep pocketed armor and carry so much stuff. Hoping the do fix it soon.
---
Breach and Clear event. Lucky Hole is better for just Lead, but you can also get a bunch of steel and smaller amounts of the other ores from this event.
---
I love that location.  It's pretty unique and I had fun finding the path to climb it without jumping.  Just have to keep rotating your camera, they did a really good job at hiding the path up.
---
Been wondering if its name is a STNG reference from the episode with the Tamarians.
---
There comes a time where game balance becomes more important than realism. If every 2-shot weapon was straight up double damage, none of the other ranged weapon affixes would matter in the slightest.
---
It depends on how two shots work.  If it works like having an extra projectile in the barrel with no extra source of energy for the second projectile, then the energy output wouldn't change.  It's just divided between the 2 bullets so less distance and speed.  Now it'd likely do more damage to a living target as they now have 2 bullet holes and not 1.  25% probably makes sense here.
---
If both the projectiles had an energy source, then you'd probably get one super fast bullet and one melted bullet.  The first bullet would propelle the second one which would also then be propelled by its energy source.  Think of shooting a live bullet with a gun.  That'd do more damage but I don't think it'd produce 2 shots as that first projectile would be slowed greatly or stopped by opposing forces.
---
If a two shot weapons have an additional barrel for the second projectile, you would be doing 100% more damage all thing being equal as essentially you are firing 2 guns.  Think double barrel shotgun.  
---
This is all just brainstorming.  I have no math to back it up.
---
Nope.
---
I love the field scribe outfit as well, looks cool with the fire breath helmet paired with it. I wish when 76 was made the devs could have cleaned up the details on the outfit since most of the straps look "painted on" in comparison to new outfits or backpacks
---
So my 5k offer is good thanks
---
I am a higher level (165) but you can message me if you have any questions. Or if you are looking for stuff I can help you (ammo/aid/mats)
---
The game is OK but the in game community is great so just stick with it.

This is so hilarious thank you for the laugh.
---
I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
---
This Mike guy seems pretty cool.  \^\_\^
---
I'm getting lots of mutations, haha. With Class Freak 3 the downsides aren't that bad.
---
Got Grounded cuz I don't use energy weapons anyways and now robots can eat shit.
---
Marsupial, Healing Factor, and Bird Bones.
---
Electrically Charged for when I do eventually get discovered and a ghoul tries to punch me.
---
Need to get Eagle Eye still.
---
I agree, also would be nice to have them reduce the amount of caps for places in and around vault 76. 
---
It would be nice to be able to go to the mothman museum for 8 caps anywhere on the map instead of having to go to 76 just to get another loading screen when I move again to mothman museum
---
darmok and jalad
---
Or maybe Mother Nature saw the Stingwing and created the Scorpion Fly!
---
Mind blown!!!!
---
What platform do you do this on?
---
I completely disagree with the workshop proposal to return to being able to challenge for the workshop and PvP anywhere on the map and force the owner into PvP.   
---
With the ability to see other players on the map, it’s easy for the challenger, and any teammates, to ambush another player in the wild, even in the middle of a fight, including the SBQ.  At that point, it’s not really a challenge, just caps farming. 
---
It’s not right, and Bethesda did the right thing to restricting it to the immediate workshop area.  It also gives the owner the right to simply walk away. 
---
I believe that the original intent was that players who wanted to role play as Raiders would be wanted, and not be able to find the owner (other player positions become hidden), which would force PvP to the workshop and surrounding area.  In my opinion, they didn’t count on teams with non-wanted scouts. 
---
When you have PvP players being able to stalk and kill the owner while they are in build mode, hacking terminals, picking locks, or at a vendor it just doesn’t work and only irritates the players, their customers.  The last thing that they want is the majority irritated by a few who are just looking for easy caps.  
---
Sorry, but in my opinion, the best two changes that they have made to the game so far is legendary trading and this, outside of new content.
---
Found them, first time doing this today, want to make Fury, what a palaver :/ 
---
Not sure I'm going to get into all this chem crafting, seem terribly complicated, may just keep Pharma Farmer on for a few sessions and search First Aid boxes.
---
That's super helpful. Thank you.
---
"I lOoKeD iT uP, iT sAiD yOuR uSeRnAmE."

Fuck yeah! Well Mr. Stealthboy killer if you wanna run that shit add Primordialpear.

Amazing podcast :) he starts each one with "ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and friends beyond the binary" thats why I wondered :)
---
Im talking about compared to launch
---
until mirelurk babies start coming out from the toilet bowl...
---
Damn well thanks for the information buddy
---
Agreed, immersion is important. This is why I pick up toilet paper whenever I find it.
---
It's not "pretentious". It's just amusement that this is pretty much common knowledge for anyone who hangs out in any fallout internet community...the first posts on this came out what, an hour after the vendor went live, I think. 
---
Then, there are waves of "OH GOD DID YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT THIS THING???" posts...this is...I don't know. Number twenty? Thirty?
---
I’ll be on survival, I’ll be the guy with the 20+ kill streak and #1 on the board, come on by there’s only like 2-3 survival servers.
---
Apparently it’s not that easy, if you look at how they handled it. They ran a script to identify accounts with millions of identical items, but in the process they messed up system’s ability to correctly identify legendary items. As of today when I picked up a ghoul slayers marine armor piece, all my other marine armor pieces will do a slide show on screen. This is how technically capable they are. There’s definitely no unique ID bound to each item, otherwise they could have simply looked up all the identical items and delete them.
---
Heh, i figured it was better than the standard "thanks for the gold" edit.
---
Ooo Wah ah ah ah!
---
Ahhh and there I thought I was being fresh and original! :) There truly is nothing new under the sun, right? xD
---
It’s like going to Target for deodorant and coming out with a new bedding set, shoes, and a Frappuccino instead ;)
---
If I have questions about gear seeing as you can only inspect items in vendors if the person is near by I usually just message them about it. Sometimes it will say the 2nd or 3rd star at the bottom above the stats table of the item. This is how I randomly found an AAE handmade for 10k when the day before my friend payed 30k for one😂
---
This would be amazing, especially if we had a few colors to choose from. And maybe be able to name it.
---
The Japanese are very creative.  Katamari Damacy and [Gou Miyagi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsY3xJSOEVE) immediately come to my mind.
---
TS wears as if you’re shooting two shots.
---
"I knew what was going to happen, but I kept it anyway"...Yeah no.
---
I saw a bog standard Dragon in Whitesprings for sale last night. The vendor who sell the other black powder stuff.
---
Nuke launch codes. You need to collect all of them for the appropriate silo to launch a nuke but the codes change like every week. A very tedious grind and virtually pointless to try yourself since there are online groups out there committed to deciphering the codes for everyone.
---
I dont even want to know how many hours I wasted switching Butchers Bounty to Lockpicking or Power User to Hacking. Bethesda pls.
---
But this post is different, people didn’t know I got a cav assassin wood leg, now they do, see the difference? Of course not, now go back to your troll cave.
---
I want to ride other players.  Piggyback style.  #BUCKBUCKLIKEATRUCK.
---
I tend to get team invites the second I load on to a server and it’s usually from a low level trying to fast travel to new locations or some annoying child screaming for power armor or asking for help killing some SB or something similar I usually just accept it give them the thumbs down and the. Leave the team
---
Japan, Japan never changes
---
Yeah. Currently, they only drop from the SBQ, but you get at least a couple or more at a time.
---
I use the flare gun to indicate I’ve found something of interest or I’m about to die(not often) like the roaming vendor bot or that lives me big green mutie vendor or something like that
---
Well she didn’t give me any love yet. I’ll visit her again tonight and will bring along that nocturnal flamer she gave me, it has bash damage too.
---
If we were to meet and square this up Id prefer it be on adventure. It ensures that no friends are happily waiting to gank someone. Interested or is a fair fight to much to handle?
---
You can leave your team or kick others (if you're the leader) within seconds if you know how. The situation OP gave is pretty rare and wasn't even that bad. I have to constantly rebuild parts of my camp every time I return ever since player vending came out. I regularly come back to dead turrets and various enemies whacking away at my stuff, the camp being attacked by players would be a change but still the same end result
---
Lmao I said this to my husband last week. Would love to sneak up on my teammates and suddenly they stagger cause I jumped on their back 😂
---
being able to have weight reduction and lock pick as passive would be the best thing ever. would rather have that than perk decks
---
In that case we shouldn't get cards in excess of having one of each level per perk. So, a tier 3 perk shouldn't give extras after you've gotten the card six times (3+2+1=6).
---
 I don't disagree. As a Mire dweller I have that slotted all the time.
---
Yeah.  Not enough posts indicate the platform that they are on.  Plus, some of us would also like to have the gamer tag to join in....   
---
I got kicked out of a Nuke event last night after only 10 kills and 3 hardened mass.   I really need to stock up on hardened mass and flux. 
---
If this is on the PS4, I’m willing to help out on the Nuke run...   me and Spike, my furious sledge with +40% swing speed...
---
I spent 1000 caps on one, then immediately found someone else selling for 350.  I bought both, plan on reselling the second one for around 700. If that doesnt sell ill just give it to one of my friends who doesnt have marsupial.  Or maybe ill keep it for myself, ive accidentally cured marsupial 3 times.  The first time was because i didnt have starches genes, the second was because i was trying to get a second mutation but accidentally used an anti-radiation arch without starched genes on, the 3rd time i got marsupial and then almost immediately used a radaway like an idiot.
---
513 Radiation Resistance on the X-01 how?  I've got 453, and I tried taking off the Vault Suit underoos after reading the post about BOS underoos messing up the stats but no joy.  
---
Or is this something that was "fixed" in the last 5 months?
---
Bikes would be ridiculous to ride in this environment. Roads are lopsided and cracked to pieces, the ground is just as bad. It would be way more of a hassle to ride a bike than it is to walk.
---
As an older gamer (not ooolld old). I find a lot of the younger generations are growing up with these microtransactions. When I was in my peak gaming stage. Titles were released finished. There wasn't any microtransactions or p2w or cosmetics. 
---
I just feel most younger gamers are growing up with microtransactions being the norm. So they have no issue with it.
---
There was someone looking for legendary shovels, so even for something like that you could find takers.
---
You have most upvotes so you have response.
---
I was plaing 20minutes. And i did daily limit od scrips. Which is bad, bcos comeon, what i will do with all legendaries i collect playing longer?
---
Then i got wood armor which goes from 3* to 1* after relog. Why do i have to suffer.
---
And daily challenges, just WTF? What are those, i don't have words for that, most anoying thing i ever saw in game. 
---
Still too hard to understand my language?
---
I've made it once in 200 hours.
---
Hahaha I also XDDD I am in my room and WAIT WAIT I HEAR THE GHOUL OFFICER EEEE not it is real life XDDD
---
Realised I scraped them like the idiot I am. oh well, off to get more.
---
Well you can't hide in your camp forever
---
What ?
---
Never say spam bethesda. Thats telling people to harass a company for no reason
---
They are limiting scrips but are giving away good legendaries at high rate, judging by the posts people make here. What happens when you spend a little time and get all the endgame elements? You move on to other hobbies.
---
Groundbreaking news... Bikes can't ride on dirt apparently.
---
Lmao of course you want to do it on adventure, because you’re a scrub pvp’er and are scared of survival, and you’re scared of dropping all of you’re stealthboys to me.
---
It’s funny you talk about having a fair fight when you’re a stealthboy spammer lmao, the hypocrisy is palpable.
---
I've noticed the game also doesn't always load people travelling in the same place too, though I can't be sure what causes it (I just moved mine due to people spawning inside the stairs/entrance foundation of my CAMP in rare occasions, but usually they would spawn in either right in front of them or at the back further back from it just past some trees that couldn't be removed).  I suspect it has to do with how fast the person is loaded in to the environment vs how long the CAMP, since I have been able to see how it happens on my wife and daughter's games...but programming etc aren't really my wheelhouse, so I just hope they sort out something to make people travelling to CAMPs better (as it really seems like a bad choice to essentially set the default spawn to roughly the center of the initially established build area, where it would be most effective for people to definitely be placing parts of a structure to best use their overall build area).
---
You can get a bunch on the altar table by the river in point pleasant.
---
I used a workbench to save weight and scrapped them, just did it again but realised this time, this game must be made for people with a working brain :D
---
So you played for twenty minutes and didn’t get a good roll? Sounds about right? I guess?
---
They can spawn in Harper's ferry in the building with the spinning tower closest to the spawn point. Walk straight from the spawn point and the tracks will fork. Walk to the left a bit, stop and turn right and you will see the spinning tower. Enter that building and check the display cases. You will either find marine or robot armor plans.
---
It’s not that they can’t ride on dirt, but the terrain is such a cluster fuck it just wouldn’t be feasible. The obstacles of that just wouldn’t make it worth it to even have. It’d be a pain in the ass.
---
escalator, elevator, and yes ladders and a hatch door.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks at your level this website would be great for you seeing what you want your final build to be, choose the cards you want, the points you want where.. even tells you what level you need to be to have whatever you choose! It's really easy to move a few points around after level 50, meaning you don't have to start a new character unless you think leveling 50+ times again is easier than leveling however many times to simply move points later (levels come easier at higher levels with better builds, so it's almost always better to stick to one character)
---
Without locking the perk, if you team up with someone else they can use rad sponge to reduce your rads, or every time you get on go to the white spring resort and buy grape nukacola to remove rads.. or best, just dying brings you back to about 40% health/rads.
---
Otherwise get starched genes for 2 points and simply never take it off, class freak for 3 points reduces the negative effects to the point every mutation is worth having except empath.. also recommend bloody mess for 3 points for 15% increase to all damage. 
---
Serendipity and dodgy are pretty much must haves for this build.
---
What "loot" did they take? The junk you dropped upon death? Barely worth mentioning. 
---
This post is just a single anecdote about one event, and the situation shown will probably never happen to the vast majority of players. Team playing with randoms is great for the perks, shared and personal, and is how friends are made you hermits
---
Can you help me find that guy?
---
You can't scrap backpacks. At least, I don't see the option when I try.

Chuckling at how you managed to get the acronym wrong even knowing what it stands for 😂

I'm more mad that people cant attack my camp when I'm on the leaderboards. Was the most fun I've had in the game, now it doesn't happen because they cant destroy it so nobody trys
---
I just pick up every toy and can I come across, and use ammosmith and super duper when crafting.

Bloatfly gland, bloodbug probuscis, added to your inventory after a ride.

Wait. Camps are invincible in survival now? I haven’t touched survival since player vending, and I knew they were in adventure.
---
It should summon Preston Garvey to the player and he tells the mover and over and that another settlement needs their help.
---
I LOVE THIS
---
Fuck man, I can't even sprint for 10 meters without huffing and puffing like a 90 year old twinkie addict.  How you gonna figure ima ride a rusty old tireless bike?
---
Yes unless your already in pvp. So unless they shoot at you first you cannot destroy any part of their base, not even turrets
---
Too*
---
Nothing about stealthboys are unfair. They are in the game and avaliable to everyone...? 
---
I said lets run all this mad shit you have been talking. To do it on adventure would make the most sense. We both just consent to the PvP before either player begins damaging the other one. Oh and no outside members can randomly join into the action. Its the only fair way to have a planned fight like this. 
---
Are you scared of adventure? Are you scared you're friends won't be able to help you? What's the problem? 
---
You were so confident in your abilty to kill a stealth boy user a second ago. Is it only in survival you are good? Is it in adventure that both parties have to consent that's your problem?
---
From one neck beard to another, we need beards! lol
---
My power armor should have rocket powered roller skates. Let's make it happen.
---
I said it happened twice. With two different groups of people. Twice in a week. So it’s apparently common enough. And yes my 400 lead and 300 steel was a big deal to me haha. Don’t be like that man.
---
Aaahh, interesting.  Thanks man.  Yeah I won't bother looting them anymore. 
---
Since I got you on the blower, why launch nukes?  Someone on my server once did it, I was far enough away but I think it looked like people WANTED to be near the impact?  Why?
---
lol that’s pretty smart, chem never came to the mind when I fast travel to events. The fight is fun but the event reward sucked so bad. When the sheepsquatch exploded and went into stealth mode, people literally said ‘no need to look for it, piece of wood junk anyways’ on mic. I’ve played a couple of times after latest patch and was happily surprised by the three star drops. It’s actually rewarding now sometimes.
---
I got god rollz, i just want scrap shit, to have something to do, if you get on max in 20minutes, wtf.

Why aren't you questioning that too, huh?

Let me know what you think sorry I'm not digital.

But it is griefing. I’m not saying it’s against the rules. It isn’t. You’re right. But it is griefing. By definition. Sorry mate.

Many, many more beards!

Absolutely.  Everything beyond the title violates the KISS principle.

Adobe After Effects for the video comp and Adobe Audition for multi track composing.
---
Well if your a responder player id suggest waiting, as a bunch of responder stuff was datamined a while back like excavator armor skin, shotgun skin, flamer skin, and fire axe skin. I can’t remember if there was anymore but still I know it saving for it *looks at blood raider armor* after this that is
---
Yes! Please add longer beards!
---
What you mean?
---
Good job man
---
Yeah you get one free the first time, then to do it again you need to buy those recall boards

Sorry if this gets repetitive but, how do I upgrade a weapon to ultracite.
---
Horses are so damn fragile there is no way that didn't immediately go extinct after the war.
---
They are in the game and available to everyone, but you risk dropping them in survival, and that’s why you’re scared to come to survival.
---
Yes I’m scared of adventure lmao like that even makes sense.
---
Listen kiddo I’ll be on the survival server with all the real PvP’ers, I’m on there all the time so you know where to find me. When you find the guts, come visit me sometime, otherwise you keep being a scrub pvping in adventure like the scared kid you are.
---
Yes sir that’s what I meant, 308 is pretty big but 50 cal is in a different class.
---
If i tell people to kill you, are u dead? LoL and now lets argue about nonsense.
---
I will probably have to wait few days until others people find out they have too many legendaries that they can't scrap without mules.
---
High level dungeon is what I guess it is. Can't remember the date but I'm sure it was this month.

There's also stills in me hills 2!
---
how about firing the flare gun at all turns your dot on the Map blue or purple or whatever, and EVERYONE can fast travel to you for free for like 1-3 minutes (and they receive like 10 caps from you automatically).
---
Heads up notification optional
---
If it is realism we are talking about here, your weapons firing two bullets at once means bad news. the gun is overheated or fucked up in some way and will make your gun explode/kill you. So 33% chance to kill self every time you fire a round would be a nice touch
---
All those dead shark/dolphins on the coast in 4 with the big bite taken out of them must've been killed by something.
---
No really.. we're talking about tires here.
---
Okay but explain the squirrels 🤔
---
It's impossible, the rights to do this were reserved so other video game companies can't do this. Blame the government, not Bethesda. It recently expired but loading times are so low in the industry they don't often add them so we never ended up getting them.

\&gt;inb4 hurr hurr long load times, 30 seconds isn't long enough for a game

That's fair enough. I add everyone on the Social tab where you can't see the levels, I just want the perks and the occasional companion
---
Brilliant!, Thanks for the reply. I’ll have to join Twitter now., I’m only on here for the fallout community lol.
---
Been wondering since 4 was released. Good job OP. Thanks!
---
With enough chems!

It's so simple to make a metal exoskeleton with plenty of air holes but it can still resist loads of rads. But do you know how hard it is to make an airtight rubber tube that can hold oxygen.
---
Radioactive water n.n
---
Oh the few perks console players get. PC doesn't have this option, at all.
---
No, it's fine. Now I understand.
---
So you want daily challenges to be improved, and wood armor to not lose stars. I think that's a perfectly valid complaint - I agree.
---
Well you see, that's just it. That's what I have been doing.  Only it won't let me place it anywhere.  It has just a gray outline, not green or red. I figured the "Built: 1/1" might have offered some clue, but if all stored items count as built, then I suppose that doesn't help.
---
So I just have this stored Fermenting Station that I can't place anywhere. Any other suggestions?

I always use concrete foundation bases for my walls. With half height metal walls on the inside edge.

I leave my doors unlocked. I put a sign that says please shut the door for when I'm not home and someone pays a visit. When I am home I leave my doors open, pain in the rear to open and close them all the time. Last night I was doing some decorating around camp and a perspective customer shows up. First thing he does is shut the door. While I home. 😮
---
Launching nukes is fun! Great spots for farming legendaries or exp (if you know the area you’re hitting). The nuke also mutates the plant life as well so it’s the only way you can harvest and craft stable flux. Stable flux is a rare material you’ll need for crafting  things like stronger armor lining, ultracite ammos, and decontamination arcs.
---
*face palm* 
---
Its fine if you don't want to run it. I've come across you before I'll come across you again. Like you said theres only 2-3 survival servers.

People are suggesting more about "passive" card slots for cards that are for combat and cards not for combat. So for example, let's do a very basic example of having only 3 INT, which would have 3 combat perk slots and 3 non-combat "passive" slots. With the system, your combat perks would use 3 points from say Nerd Rage or 3/5 ranks of Gunsmith for slower weapon degrading, but at the same time you could equip 3 non-combat perks like the 3 hacking perks since you never use those to fight enemies. 
---
Of course there might be a debate about what is considered combat/non-combat perks, for example what is a "weight reduction" perk considered? I personally would say all weight reduction perks are combat perks, because they allow you to carry more weapons in-case another one breaks, along with first aid weight reduction perks allowing you to carry more stimpacks &amp; meds when fighting enemies.
---
Well aware that it’s a video game. Please tell me, when you look at the destroyed bikes in game and then walk around Appalachia, does it seem like you’d actually get around faster using one of those bikes? Because I know I wouldn’t. I’d say it’d be better if they added a power armor mod that vastly increases your “base walking speed” which then also increases your sprinting speed. You wouldn’t get 10 feet on a bike before having to avoid something that would require you to slow down. And then again in another 10 feet. Then you’ll complain that the roads are all fucked up. That the Bog is full of ditches and crevices and why can’t your bike fly so you can fight the SBQ mid-air?
---
you do not need a terminal to set a code, all codes are randomly generated. when placed you get a pop up telling you the code. if you forget it you must scrap/store and place a new one. the switch only keeps the power on briefly. just enough to open the door but it then will turn off a few seconds later
---
Only once, but that’s why there’s more of us.
---
That's fair, any randomer saying they know glitches is gonna get ignored by me
---
Looks a bit like a capybara, no?
---
Brilliant suggestion, I hope they do it! Maybe different voices/paint jobs for them in atom shop! I'd love one that's like a mechanic for my garage I have!
---
Actually that’s could be a good weapon choice for the ISS fight since the Veteran reduces target’s damage output. That sheepsquatch pretty much kills everyone with one or two hit. You’ll be saving lives while mowing her down 👍🏻
---
That happened to me last night.... 6 people drug scorch beasts to the purveyor at about the same time.   they were all cowering in the station while I was out having a super fun time hahaha
---
You absolutely should. Grouping up is the basis of all warfare since the beginning of time. Don't like it? Make some friends. Be careful who you start shit with, they may have friends. That is how the game is supposed to work.
---
Somebody misses Codsworth.
---
^me ^too
---
And by harassed, they aggressively pressure you over and over to invite you to a team. So this would be, by definition, harassment.
---
Didnt work
---
Also agree on this, which is a shame. Nice to see an appropriate opinion, rather than a general moan with no input.
---
Might catch a mirelurk
---
Ah shoot. That's burnt
---
But that's the whole point of despair and frustration.  I don't care what it does, I just want to complain about it online bc it's not working as intended!
---
Came here to say this.
---
This gives me hope for my heavy build character.
---
the easiest way for Beth to avoid Pay-to-win complaints would be to make things super cheap.
---
If they made flairs, and they cost 5 atoms, no one would be able to complain
---
It has to be a bug. I was in survival being attacked in my camp and they destroyed most everything.
---
Lol yup so man up and come see me and stop talking trash on reddit.
---
They need to fix the glitched peices though!
---
Yup! I built my camp near there and would go farm that poor bear several times per session. Now I just let him be
---
Ever caught a gar? That would be great and scary to have giant mutated gar in this game.
---
Pied piper'ed you for Joe-meat
---
Imagine its only for 2 minutes, or its just a pop up once, when they ask, for a few seconds (especially if you could only do it once a day)

---
22 hours same as the daily vendors
---
I hear ya, I spent hours building my camp around the idea  it would be raided or griefed in survival mode
---
It's such an annoying noise, as soon as I can I hear it I go Rambo and have to find and collect it just to make the noise stop
---
Just flag some places to be  "un-rideable". That sounds good too, literally anything. Dont just make the map bigger and make me walk through places where there's nothing to see or do. But hey, if bikes turned out to be a thing, they could just add little bike trails as if we wastelanders did that sort of thing regularly.
---
I'll do a screenshot.  I bought a Regenerating Sentinel arm..in the vending machine..you can inspect it..that's how I found out it had the Sentinel modifier.
---
Isnt the daily vendor 20 hours?
---
Go to harpers for that
---
...Oh man on literally any other non-shit gun...
---
Sure, but after that happened all my dailies came back. Maybe it'll work for OP.
---
true, it is not like we can make a sealed tank of highly flammable fuel or delicately make a portable fusion reactor to power a building.
---
Im all here man meet me on adventure and you got it.
---
Get gud, nah but in all seriousness a high level player prob spawned it in and you just happend to arrive at the wrong time
---
As many a super mutant has yelled, “Run away!!!”
---
Ah ok, that makes more sense now.  I probably can't farm fuck all since I'm a level 20 pleb with shite gear.  But I'm working my way up, baby!
---
Stay in the forest for a while
---
Where are you at? It sounds to me you wandered too far out of the forest region.
---
Small scale internal testing can't compare to wide release testing. You'll find more bugs in 5 minutes of full release than you will in 5 years of internal testing.
---
That said, I hope Bethesda is considering doing Patch testing servers.
---
I'm lvl 107 play a lot of survival, would love a teammate too, gt cl88t
---
If i had to guess, pictures are disabled so this sub doesnt become another game sub that people spam unfunny and then the same unfunny memes a million times. Bethesda actually sees these posts, makes it easier to wade through the trash. Again, just a guess though.
---
I read this and heard it in my mind.  Now I can't unhear it.
---
I think it’s looking good! Makes me wanna doodle our lil Grandma myself!
---
FUUUUUck no
---
Isn’t that what fast travel is for? Unless I have a hankering to explore, I’m fast traveling wherever I need to go, or walking a short distance to where I need to go. I’m not trekking from the forest to the mire or the bog to the toxic valley.
---
Dude I got some addictol of you need
---
It takes a minute or two
---
Like I said, you’re trash at PvP so you hide in adventure cause you’re scared of survival. I live in survival, that’s the difference between you and me. You’re a scared stealthboy spammer that lives in adventure. I never have to use a stealthboy because I don’t need it and I live in survival. Who’s the scrub? Yup you.
---
At least I was the first.
---
Cool. I'll be on later this evening. I'll shoot you a message on xbox
---
Rather, how about Preston Garvey comes running lmao
---
I had a locked door, guy picked it and wanted me to kill him.  I got suspicious and told him he wasn't worth my time.  Then his two buddies showed up out of nowhere.  Glad I listened to my instincts.  I also unlocked everything as a precaution.
---
I like to use the lettering to leave funny messages on walls of randoms on my team, but that's about it.
---
😱😱😱 no no no don't fill my head with creepy things.
---
&gt;FwEKHP It's dumb that images aren't allowed did somebody post something they shouldn't  here?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;5 comments
---
Okay I thought some guy posted a butt and ruined it for everyone lol.
---
Agreed :)
---
Ah, no idea why it worked for me, oh well, good luck looking for a fix.
---
Glad we are thinking on the same subject. 😂
---
Got the same yesterday. Not sure about the 3rd star though.
---
Thanks anyways
---
As long as I don't get another damn Submachine gun. I've been given 6 so far
---
powered doors + pressure plates. best part is they close on their own
---
idk you sounds kinda mad tho
---
I just pick up stuff and scrap them unless its an item to add for decorating purposes.
---
I had an error last night where I stuck a 4x4 concrete foundation in the ground and tried to put a crafting bench on it but couldn’t because “nothing is selected.”
---
... 
---
***.......***
---
The vendor in grafton
---
I got an Instigating Rolling Pin. Lol
---
We don't get excess. Once you have exceed the maximum you can't select that card after leveling up. They'll appear in card packs but won't show up in your pool of cards.
---
You'll want to hover in the East side of the map, more appropriate level spawns.  
---
You *can* get low level spawns in most of the Savage Divide but if anybody higher level shows good chance you'll be surrounded and outgunned. West-Tek is pretty good around level 30 if you can get it to yourself. They must've tweaked something recently as I've been getting a mix of level 5, 10, 42 &amp; 68 Super Mutants there (the 5 &amp; 10s never used to show if the 42/68 were there and vice versa).
---
Plankman33367 must be really disappointed right now
---
I always announce my self with a loud "BY THE POWER OF BOOZE!" then I kill a few enemys while they get their wits about them and I'm off to the next house to loot
---
Not really. It was a gamble for items and we knew that going in. Wish the scrip cap was higher for both player and trading machine but that's about it.
---
Short answer: yes 
---
Long answer: it had bugs. They fixed most of them. It had content. Now they keep adding more every week.   So yes. Still worth $60 honestly. If you get it cheaper more power toyou!
---
Whats the point of making the map bigger if you're gonna fast travel everywhere?
---
I personally only use fast travel if where i need to go is in the opposite side of the map. Not just in fallout.
---
Even with +15% reload it's still snail paced. I like that you can load a round in once you've fired one though. There's just something really satisfying about the single action revolvers.
---
My only question now is, what does the 5 star useless lump of shit do!?
---
Meh, it can't go giving out god rolls every time.  
---
You'll want to scrip those 3\* wood as they're gonna be 2\* when you sign back on
---
This is perfect! Thank you
---
Whenever you scrap a weapon you have a good chance to learn a mod for it :)
---
It takes 3 to five business days to shoot your next shot and an act of fucking Congress to reload it. I'm not a fan.
---
I feel you, I didn't have a lot of scripts, but today I figure might as well just use my last 100 scripts that i got from scraping junk I got yesterday. 
---
But don't lose hope friend, I hope this post will give you faith
---
I just finger guns and then LEAP AWAY WITH THE POWER OF MARSUPIAL.
---
Except the one time I accidentally ressed with a Nuka Dark and I was just like 'FUCK! You weren't worth the Nuka!'
---
I don't know how you managed to screw up an acronym just after writing it out. But you are welcome to join us for dinner all the same!
---
Are you charging your members dues?  How does it enforce "code violations"?
---
Well on the weapons side I'm looking for an assault rifle with a decent prefix. I know it isn't the best but I like the looks and sound. Same with a good old pump shotgun. Looks like anti-armor is out of the mix.obviously not tse. I can't afford that. I'm even avoiding explosive because of the splash damage. I'll take a look but I won't be on to later as well.
---
For this particular mistake it seems nobody under the level of 50 tested out this vendor.
---
I have arms and torso, just legs I need now. Thanks though.
---
Someone might of (and this being reddit, thats highly common lol). I cant say for sure as im not a mod. It just seems like every main sub for a game is just crap memes nowadays. (Dont get me wrong i like memes, but theres a healthy limit) Its why i like this sub so much. Despite the negativity, people make interesting and intelligent suggestions/conversations here.
---
Why would you put all your faith in the Purveyor? The drops are the same as before, random. Im happy that i have a chance to get something different with the crap items i break down. But thats all it is, a chance. There is no guarentee. The Purveyor is great!
---
Word. Scrip limit is only thing I wish was higher.
---
Yes it does. I've seen some people get some pretty good stuff. Either way I'm glad we have something to do with our crap legendaries now.
---
To add new locations to go to. If they just add new things into the map as it is they will have to restrict more of where you can place your CAMP. 
---
Trust me I’d love some other means of travel, bikes cars vertibirds deathclaws with saddles. It’s just the terrain isn’t well suited for the logical ones. I can’t see it making traveling Appalachia any better.
---
I got a 3* bone club!!!
---
What a dummy, I want all the caps so please buy my shi... wares.
---
My thoughts exactly, I usually grab a pylon or two then hunker down on the shack roof and unload on the Gutsys and ISS
---
Yup! I’d love to have a Mr. Handy server for my pseudo-bar!
---
Ok, just got the perk pack. I did not get those cards added into my equipable cards but I did get a few extra equipable cards either from the perk pack (but not shown) or from reaching level 50, I'm gonna guess it was from reaching level 50 though. I have no idea how to pinpoint exactly why and when you get the extras though.
---
You rock.
---
One of my first rolls was a 3* tse, -25% vats cost shotty. I was pretty happy.
---
I'll give those  go. I'm in camp venture a lot so maybe one day. I keep forgetting about the Harpers ferry one though.
---
Preston Garvey paint FTW!
---
I played this game strictly as a first person shooter, with added survival elements. It’s totally fun. I didn’t even do the stories until I was around 100. It’s an open world game, you choose what to do and how to survive.
---
Would like it better with 250 resist while reloading
---
It's MA'AM
---
If you want them to show up on your map then you would need to show up on theirs as well or else you would have an unfair advantage.
---
Shit every time I saw him he was already dead. I just thought he was supposed to be that way
---
Its ok puppy we will still nuke you base to treat you as an equal
---
Wait!  M&amp;Ms and Santa.
---
Then i'd guess you need to work on your imagination :P
---
Is this an actual item on fo76 just curious.
---
At some point you just have to accept video game balance and have a suspension of disbelief in mind.  
---
In real life, a direct hit from a standard FMJ .50BMG is going to kill any creature living on planet earth, and probably most dinosaurs, for that matter.  Even if you hit a target in the leg or arm, the concussive effect of the impact is going to rupture the main artery and the enemy will pass out and bleed to death in a minute or so.
---
The .50BMG round was designed to defeat armor and is most commonly used today to destroy engine blocks.  I can't see even a sentry bot taking more than 2-3 hits without being rendered immobile, blind or experience a massive coolant/oil leak.  
---
Game designers have to take liberties with real-world ballistics and weaponry, otherwise every single player would be stomping around in power armor with a hand held ma-deuce.
---
But I'm talking about them from England, and over here it's Tyres.
---
Level 15? You are supposed to be in toxic Valley or ash heap. Don't go on the divide, even if you have finished the fire squad quest (don't know their name in English sorry). 
---
If I recalled correctly, the level cap for creatures is lower on those 3 area (forest, toxic ans ash). The divide and everything east from it have no level limit. If there are high level in your area, you'll cross the path of high level creatures...
---
Thought it was 20?
---
I am still reloading as I am writing this reply....
---
&gt; Short Night Vision Scope
---
I’m all for mounted deathclaws. Mounted radstags. Just not bikes.
---
Yep exactly how I do it
---
Already traded :)
---
Same thing for me lol
---
The HOA has never taken a single Cap from any of our members that wasn't a donation, usually made after one of our live game shows, talent shows, or other in Game eventss in one of the two giant theaters we have built on Xbox and PS4. 
---
Should the HOA find your camp in violation, we take a photo of it, and branded with a big violated sticker, and post it on our Twitter feed.
---
20 it is
---
He's just really into bondage, don't kinkshame him
---
Fair
---
I would love to name my Mister Handy, please let me do that
---
Also
---
Weapon names
---
I miss naming my rifles
---
Disappointed more like it.  
---
The fact where we get  a 3 star assaultron head (gay), and then have it convert to a 2 star (even gayer)?  
---
THEN Bethesda says they won't do anything about it?
---
Bethesda is not good at ladders, which is why there's never been functioning ladders in any of their Creation Engine games. I don't know what the hurdle is, but they've never overcome it, and I doubt they ever will until they create a new engine.
---
I am perfectly fine with cosmetics only microtransactions.  I'd rather a few whales fund my ongoing experience and DLC than pay for it myself.  Everyone who spent 20 bucks for power armor skins funds me, who will most likely never purchase anything beyond the initial game purchase.  (Strangely enough, I'll buy useless merchandise and decorations, more than what I would spend on DLC.) 
---
I love Fallout, but I have never bought a single DLC, unless I find a game of the year edition.  Still haven't played Broken Steel. I just don't spend money like that.  I love the mtx model provided it is cosmetic only.  I get new content, and people with more disposable income than me get to look flashy in the game.
---
I really don't understand why people hate this model so much.  Is it legit fear (honestly warranted with the way other companies act) or is it a "back in my day" twisted nostalgia for a market and design that will never return?
---
Happy hunting.
---
Get yourself a western revolver friend.
---
Hmm. Trying to figure out a way to open / close my shop. Guess I could just go into build mode and delete the wire to close up and reconnect it to open.
---
Ain't even gonna give me a chance at it damn... what did you trade for it if you don't mind me asking
---
Yep. Bethesda Confirmed 20.
---
Stay out of the west side of the map until you have geared up.
---
It does need a buff. Vats is unsuable with 2 shot. I consider 2 shot to be one of the worst legendary effects on ranged weapons because of that. I think they just nerfed it into the ground because everyone that was in the trading markets had them and they were trading dirt cheap from dupes. I bought a TSE handmade for 300 caps once because it was easier than transferring one from a different account.
---
How is my contentness to leave others alone and you going out of your way to be a prick the same?  All I have to do is server hop when you launch that nuke.
---
The bigger question is why are you picking on people that don't fight back?  My guess is that you're too much of a coward to utilize Survival Mode, or you just suck shit at actually developing skill.
---
Hella yeah I do !!! Who doesnt? That shit ( no pun intended ) is what'll put me over the top.
---
Hahaha you know this is a video game right? I pounded out survival when it was released until the nerfed the amount of caps earned. Now PvP in survival is a waste of supplies when I can't make back what it took to fast travel. Besides that though, you DONT even know if im trash at PvP or not because you aren't willing to try.
---
What happens when you call the responders they jump off their fire trucks with... flamers in hand lol
---
Here is a bit of **tiring** trivia:
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire
---
:)
---
I want fastnacht mr handy. I need him to play shitty trumpet music ony base 24/7
---
This has happened to me as well
---
I can say this early on before the tse nerf I got a 3* drop of a tse Gatling gun and didn’t see any explosives for months then I found a 2* QE double barrel. Couple explosive BP pistols and a mutants explosive combat rifle.
---
Yesterday my luck was ok. I found that I agin got similar drops to what was in my inventory.  The prefix mainly. But the major and minor modifiers were different I got 2 cav pieces one raiders and one forest scout which i thought was cool. And then a hunters explosive harpoon. Other then that out of 1500 script the other pieces weren’t anything to be enthusiastic about but TBH most 3 star drops aren’t that great anyway. It’s the joy of grinding for the weapons or armor you want. I wouldn’t say this is exact math but I think maybe 1/100 3 star drops are good after 600 hours and 2 characters one 200+ and the other lvl 75. But ya know one mans trash is another mans treasure so bring on the trading.
---
That's... beautiful
---
Carry me upwards FO76 army!
---
That would be good with me, it does give you the option to ignore or seek revenge. So if I didn't want to continue the pvp I would choose to ignore
---
Only 2000 atoms !
---
Have you tried the hero ?
---
If I find you in game I'll hop on your back :P
---
Alright Cowboy, show Appalachia what you got!
---
I think they need a quest for tamed animals, it’s a feature that’s underutilized. My newly tamed animal never seems to get to the CAMP.
---
Rofl! That was great
---
Balance before reality. A lot of things about weapons make no sense. Just live with it because reality would have us all carying miniguns.
---
Use a regular switch. Stays on until you turn it off.
---
A late comment too, but thanks for this. I spent way too long trying to find a bloatfly gland in that yellow circle until I read your comment.
---
This is a mole miner! She is the enemy! And you guys are all trading in your legendaries for her scam! They are building an army you fools!
---
That muffled noise you hear when you encounter one is their laughter..it's just a matter of time!
---
Patch notes is a thing
---
"We do what we must because we can."
---
So what exactly happened to it? Only the first star remained and the other two vanished?
---
Also of you appeared on each others map then how could you strategize your position.
---
Well you can take your crap and you can either turn it into crap or turn it into gold. Before all we had was crap, so a chance of gold is nice.
---
We need event tracker to choose events we want to get notifications about
---
maybe you should *fan* the hammer.
---
Yo, I hate to bug you, but I just wanted to make sure you didn't forget about that random encounter map :)
---
When did this happen?!?  
---
I popped him again last week....and now he's gone?
---
To be fair, your analogy is an oversimplification of the point you are making.  Much as I can agree there definitely improvements that can be made for things like how known plans list, you are making the assumption that there aren't other issues or limitations we haven't taken into account (possibly as simple as not having the resources available to dedicate to such changes right now, due to other greater concerns). Even your own analogy shows this same issue, despite the basic shape being the same almost nothing else is when comparing the wheel of a car, a bike, rollerblades, and a fridge.  They aren't interchangeable, and even the wheels for each type can vary greatly from car to car etc based on the goals and limitations involved.  Something as simple as expecting to travel on sand can impact the wheel design significantly, though not always with the same requirements to reach the same result.  So while I see your point, unless you have absolute certainty about why the choices of the design were made insisting it inept decision isn't really a fair assumption (and as an assumption is an opinion, regardless of how well informed of one it might be).  Nor is claiming "lack of respect for the consumer" a fact, as it requires well beyond even inept design/bad decisions to demonstrate willful disregard for consumers).  I have no issue if you are of that opinion, but it needs to not be confused with being a fact.
---
Personally, I hope they are working on overall UI improvements that they intend to rollout later and that much of the current things like this are a result of not wanting to waste resources on doing the same thing multiple times or due to the limitations of the current setup itself.  At the same time, I can live with these minor inconveniences if that is what it takes to create more overall content and broaden the game overall too.
---
So how many caps would you like for this wonderful idea?!
---
I'm more disappointed in you turning down team invite from plankman lmao😂
---
that's a quality of life upgrade I'd love to see
---
is this *blain dramage?*
---
Then you have to hide the switch though.
---
I have one of these pistols that has +10% player damage, 25% faster fire rate and 15% faster reload speed. Is it any good?
---
That dough will never know what hit it.
---
Me too. Still bugged. :(
---
Trap doors. We need trap doors
---
Bro do you speak English?
---
Does the suppression effect actually apply to other players?
---
Where do I find hundreds of lever action rifles
---
I literally work up in the middle of the night last night hearing that noise. I still not sure if I was dreaming...
---
maybe he was lookin for a lost contact lense then?
---
Squirrels aren't nearly as fragile.  A squirrel can survive a leg break that would kill a horse.  They can scamper up trees away from all these new predators.  Their digestive systems aren't as sensitive.  And they have multiple offspring a year whereas a horse can have only one foal a year.
---
The squirrels aren't doing too well either right now though.
---
Well it's you would based off your locations, but it's better than them disappearing because it's almost impossible to seek revenge if they fast travel from where they were when they killed you

Well try number 21 for me and woah! Wait! They’re telling a different story! Oh look the missing camper items are in a different spot! Holy bug swarm! What did he say? Feed the fire?!?! I cordially apologize as you are 1/21 correct. There is an alternate ending that I haven’t been apart of. Ps. Still didn’t fail :).  But thanks for not backing down and having me question my sanity.
---
I don't believe the engine can support a ladder.
---
For this very reason I only put one star items up for sale right now. Don’t want to make others frustrated when I’m not around camp.
---
Yeah, I didn't deal with heavy weapons either, but my basic 1* Bloodied Gatling Gun changed that.  It kicks out a fair bit of damage, sips ammo, and goes for a long time without reloading.
---
Definitely doesn't take hundreds, and I found the lever plans I believe from watoga vendor, craft a bunch at a time and scrap them all for mods
---
That'll one shot most enemies in the game with a decent build.
---
Hmm, gotcha. Still want to ride a horse everywhere though. Or a radstag
---
Have you done the miners challenge?That one has you taking picture of different deposits. You know, the giant holes in the ground with a few sparkly crystals. Those are some pretty pics, let me tell you.
---
The reduced weapon weight armor was the last piece of the puzzle, no I an a walking armory of awesome heavy weapons. At about a pound apiece I carry 15 or so.
---
I’m always in PA so maybe saddles for PA too? Then you can have someone melee in PA with a sniper sitting on your back? I can get behind that
---
People were hitting me up all night / day. Traded for BOS jumpsuit and white powder jumpsuit
---
It was intended to make small jar for mutated big frog
---
If I would have accept his invite, the fate of this weapons existence would be alter, sacrifice must be made in order to achieve greatness
---
RIP Plankman33367
---
You're a god among men, sir
---
is this a new bug or was this since launch??
---
It was needed in order to worship the RNG god, otherwise I would not have got this weapon
---
You're out of your element, Donnie!
---
Holy shit, I gotta get mr some of that. I got a 3* explosive harpoon from the gamble vendor yesterday.
---
The steel letters are useful in other places too! The SheepSquatch ate my brother poster is boring, but with a few small changes you too can own a SheepSquatch ate my butthole poster.
---
Welcome.. Glad it helped..
---
Sounds hilarious, I love it!
---
Yup....lol
---
That's how it has worked since launch as far as I'm aware.
---
I'm definitely one whose camp you would criticize.
---
I'm in the wilderness in a post-apocalyptic future.
---
I've managed to cobble together some parts and scrap and turned that junk into some makeshift workbenches and power generators.
---
In addition, along my travels, I've found a porta-potty, an aluminum lawn chair, and even a piano that I somehow dragged up this damn cliff to try to occasionally take my mind off the fact that I'm on the verge of death every single moment of every single day, whether waking or sleeping.
---
I'm not confident I have a stable future. I'm not confident that I won't need to run away again, like I did the last three times, when alternately a horde of rats, some super mutants, and then that damn Scorchbeast took everything out and I barely escaped.
---
So I don't try to make this a home any more. I'll just become attached and disappointed again when it's time to run. Run for the only thing left of value in this world. My life.
---
I had only been playing the game a few days before I managed to wander into one of the power substations that had Ghouls roughly 20 levels higher than me. I did the "hold S and start spamming pipe pistol" routine but was pretty sure I was shagged beyond all hope. Suddenly I hear out of precisely bumwank nowhere
---
"HEEEEEEEEEEREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT COMMMMMMMMMMMMMMES!!"
---
He barrelled in there and zogged all of the Ghouls in about 15 seconds. I didn't even know there WAS a roving trader, much less a Super Mutie with a pet moo-moo. I was a good half minute's run away because I thought it was some other player attempting to murder me. It was a nice little surprised that unexpectedly endeared me to the game.
---
He did not, sadly, sell any fresh underwear.
---
Because reloading is all what you do with this weapon
---
I know this is off your topic , but does anyone know if two shot works on Tessa rifles. I have a ts and a ghoul slayer. Both max level and same mods. Also same damage. This is different than all other ts I have , as with them the extra damage is represented in the number shown. This gun showing same as a ghoul slayer obviously doesn't. Is this common knowledge I was unaware of or an unknown issue?
---
But the Legendary machines are industrial shredders.
---
I think the Mole Miners think they are disarming us. It takes several weapon grinding to get enough scrip to get one from the Purveyor, so from a numbers perspective the Mole Miners think they are draining us of stored up weapons and armor.
---
Charlestown fire department has both a gym and a place to scrap on the first floor.
---
Noice
---
Stay out of the EAST,not West.
---
Good Evening, sir/ma'am... It appears that another Daily Quest needs your help...
---
Also Berserker's
---
I have what could be consider as the Pinnacle right here: [https://imgur.com/OVrTD5N](https://imgur.com/OVrTD5N)
---
Here's another idea, allow us the mod the gun so it fires fireworks instead. They should already have most of the assets needed from FO4.
---
A pair of 2-star TSE lever action from the purveyor? Apparently we’ve found the mother of all dupers...
---
Aa should reduce all resistance, or shouldn't roll on energy weapons
---
Yeah I think you are forgetting that we had nothing to do with crap drops, and this is only a way to at least TRY to give you something to recycle said crap. So how and why should we be pissed that we can do something with the nothings we don't like in the first place even if you get another nothing you can still rinse and repeat which is still better then not having that and you now get more chances to get crap or better for the grinding you have done already!!!
---
Are we allowed to give cameras to other players? Because I have 3 spares and I don't know what to do with them? Id gladly give one to you if I could?
---
ya that makes better sense.. alright, you can hold the Doomsday sign for a bit..
---
Bring in the Gimp!
---
Bethesda : You wanted a beard, take it &gt;:( *Give gandalf beard*
---
They've spoken on the issue. They can make them, the animation, the mechanics and all of that just fine, but when it comes to AI path finding using the ladders, it just doesn't work. Something about them using it just don't work like doors when it comes to AI looking to get from point A to point B, seems like either they try and go a longer less direct route, or just don't find a way to get there. Not sure if they've tried for recent games like 4 or 76 to implement ladder support, but they largely seem to have just fitted loading screen or ramps into their level design, especially since they still have dungeon based world design, ladders aren't too massively needed, though they would be nice. They've always tried to emphasis anywhere a player can get being somewhere an AI can get to, so ladders have seemingly never been high on their priority list.
---
Green stuff for moo moo..
---
No they aren't camp traps are considered environmental damage not PvP.
---
Beards? Yes.
---
Atom shop? No.
---
I saw bring back the Automatron system so we could create companions and camp workers for gathering farm resources, water resources, and repairs and defends your camp. It goes along with their whole “no humans except fellow vault dwellers” idea and it gives us another reason to scavenge more and grind for those robot schematics and upgrades. If they die, we can salvage their bodies and recreate them or just build another robot. With the whole backpack upgrade update, why not add companions that make sense to the story? We know the overseer is dead. Our goal is to rebuild Appalachia. America before the war used robots to their advantage. No reason we can’t. Of course, add a limitation of 1-2 robots to travel with you so you don’t develop a friggin army to follow you but also have a limit of 3-4 robots per camp so your camp isn’t OP and maintained more than it should be. Any ideas you guys would add or things you’d change about my idea?
---
Now you have some class sir 👍
---
But not deodorant. Just going to have to go back for it!
---
That's an odd thing to love
---
Thank you 😊
---
Honestly, as a marksman main, Instigating feels fine where it is.
---
That's just me though.
---
There have been people encountering 2* and 3* sheepsquatch before they are just very rare
---
Maybe trade one of the dozen people on the front page that got perfect rolls with the tse. They may trade them off.
---
best bet is to pick one spot and server hop.
---
Worth a shot, my gamertag is deadbirdxx, I don't have a mic rn
---
Pretty decent gun, although 10% would not make a big impact in PVP
---
I hope so :)
---
Wait how is this even possible? Quad is tier 1 legendary effect and 50 crit is 2nd. Since you’re saying the tier one effect is dropped, what’s the item’s name currently? It can’t e ‘50 crit assaultron head’ since 2nd effect never appears in the name.
---
I've tried that, but checking multiple locations each server. No luck so far
---
Weapon naming is in the game.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Yeah your camp in Survival should only go that way IF you are vendor powered up (equals white flag)... but I guess that was a too common sense idea...
---
What system you play on?
---
You know who rides bicycles? The communist Chinese!
---
Not seen a screenshot or video evidence yet, so am taking that with a grain of salt!
---
It could use its own container to store everything it collects, so players would have to manually collect from him. There are plenty of efficient ways to AFK in this game and anything more to reward that playstyle will hurt casuals
---
go to the cryptid event and revive people there in the pond
---
Why is a level 15 in an area that spawns level 68s?
---
I mostly found them in Savage Divide and The Mire, I was doing the key fragment quests for Rose, and went on to fix the scorched detectors for Abbie. I think I might have just failed to level up along the way or something, I haven't done any xp farming.
---
You actually can rename your gear.
---
No problem, always a pleasure to help a fellow vault dweller, hope you have fun!
---
yes. welcome to what happens when a lvl 249 dude strolls thru an area before you do. the area levels up to them.
---
and here you come, all bright eyed, full of wonder, and about to die. lol. i make a lot of alts and top of the world has been *ridonkulous* of late. i think because many high level players are putting their camps near there.
---
so. what's a lvl15 to do? 
---
* server hop
---
* hide, run, rinse, repeat
---
* make a high level friend
---
* wait til 3 am to do anything at a crowded area
---
ymmv
---
I'd like to see more enemies that survive long enough for Furious and Executioner's to matter.  The Sheepsquach is a step in that direction, but imagine something more aggressive, like a Deathclaw.  I do think Furious could stand an increase in how quickly it grows, though.
---
Instigating is fine, imo.  In PvE, you don't need to do *that* much damage to drop most enemies.  I roll with an Instigating Boxing Glove, for laughs, but it can drop most enemies in 1-2 hits.
---
West side of the map. Not east.
---
Dam that's a big jobbie :)
---
The Japanese are on another level
---
Oh, and lvl16 is fine for beginning that questline. I'm currently doing them at that exact level
---
lots of run, hide, rinse, repeat...
---
and server hop if i must
---
You must have Ultracite receiver or whatever component that particular weapon uses in your list at the workbench. Or have the mod that will do it. You may need to scrap more weapons to get the plan. So many ways to get plans they may be SBQ Only drops for some plans. I am not sure. Always check Notes and Mods at vendors if you are looking for something.
---
Main quest line.
---
I have used almost all weapons and if you keep your health low, all weapons are viable not just bloodied. Keep your health down to 20% without adrenal reaction/nerd rage and you'll see bloodied weapons are nothing but mediocre considering its penalty. It ain't nothing without adrenal reaction/nerd rage to back it up.
---
I'm just glad I'm getting something for the shit 1\*s, instead of just selling them for a couple caps. Save up Scrip, have the potential to turn all those shitties into something at least 3\*.
---
How about instead of selling everything cool in the damn store actually make an interesting questline inside RobCo where you get to assemble your own? They could sell different paints for him in the store instead.
---
Hell, the whole Mechanist DLC could be ported from Fallout 4 and it would make for a great system.
---
The most disappointing thing is when (in the earlier days of the game) you would join a game, and your CAMP can't load because someone was already there, and all they had placed was their CAMP module and nothing else.
---
The daily's can give them too. But I've only gotten 2 and I've done them everyday so far.
---
I always willing to try lol, I’m in survival now with a 32 kill streak dude, come fucking see me, otherwise stop crying and keep hiding in adventure.
---
P.S You still need caps? I maxed two accounts before they nerfed the cap gain, guess you didn’t come close to that and are still scraping by, how sad.
---
Yeah, I should just sell it. I would keep it if we were able to fan the hammer with revolvers. The fire rate and reload combo would be deadly.
---
Interesting ideas, would be good for Bethesda to have a beta server where the can test changes and updates live with a real player base....then if it is a good change...roll it out to the main game servers.
---
Thanks so much!!!
---
Did you build and scrap to get all the mods? How many did you do?
---
As a Battlefield 4 player once told me: PTFO!!!
---
Yes, exactly as you stated it.
---
Yes: this happened to me too! I had a ★★ Stalker's +bash damage salvaged assaultron and after I logged out it had lost a ★ and just had the +50％ bash
---
Looks like it gives you dysentery and chases your friends away
---
He's still there, just no legendary variants anymore.
---
Really strange. I’ve never seen a three star wood armor drop before, must be new and the system isn’t ready for it yet.
---
I'm guessing you're 36, unmarried, dwelling in your parents' basement after being coddled for decades and unable to handle life's real ways, so you come to gaming subs in your overload of spare time to make up stories for validation as you can't seem to find it in the real world? That's awesome though that in your mind, you have a wife who games with you.
---
I haven't shed a single tear and I won't. Im not going to survival for you.
---
"A tire (American English) or --tyre-- (British English; see spelling differences) is a ring-shaped component that surrounds a wheel's rim to transfer a vehicle's load from the axle through the wheel to the ground and to provide traction on the surface traveled over"
---
Honestly, the changes I proposed to it were more an attempt to balance it nicely with the other effects. If you took the damage of everything I proposed down a bit and left Instigating alone, the same net effect would be achieved, methinks. :)
---
Most of the responses are correct. You're in too high of an area, sounds like the mire. You need to stay to the West side of the savage divide until your a higher level. 
---
You also need to pay attention to the players around you. Although most areas spawns are level locked, many areas are not. WhiteSprings for example, you could be there slaying reasonable level ghouls and then a level 100+ player spawns in bringing with him a new wave of 68 charred.
---
I hate you so much :'(
---
... What if we make them V2 bikes? Can't get more american than that :O
---
You could be more careful with your weaponsfire: try to be certain of what you're shooting, and if something that you've shot by accident or by intent decides to attack you back it's not very brave to ask a higher authority to deny them the ability to defend themselves from you.
---
I miss the cowardly legendaries.
---
Now everyone’s grandma will be sporting a QE lever action 💪
---
I just wish two shot didn't reduce durability as much as it does. All my two shot weapons seem like they break crazy fast, but not fast enough for the slightly increase in damage.
---
You’re scared I get it, scrubs will be scrubs.
---
That’s not how online games work
---
imagine if they could buy atoms
---
Probably never going to happen. Even private servers will be online.
---
It made doing events near impossible. One guy with a TSE shotgun would one shot literally everything.
---
Yeah I got it from the new legendary vendor. They just change to 1* when you mod them or log out.
---
You skipped a lot if quests if you're sidetracked doing roses missions to get upstairs and are working on the scorch detectors those aren't main quest that early. You skipped a massive amount of the story.
---
That really sucks, if you see one again scrip it right away!
---
I follow Grahm sometimes to hear what he has to say lol he's great :)
---
Never stop posting about beards and hairstyles...we need morrrreeeeee
---
Whats your psn
---
Lol, then dont engage pvp.. crybaby
---
Yeah I knew that was the best option and did it with another 3* wood armor I got. But I kept the cav/assassin piece and hoped by some miracle it wouldn’t change, but it did, oh well.
---
Ah yeah, that...pretending to work getting distracted
---
The way I play it, it may aswell be offline mode. I just want to grind my usual spots and explore without constantly worrying that its gonna crash or disconnect. 
---
Has anyone else noticed it's gone worse since the patch? Seriously had at least 8 disconnects tonight.
---
Actually I didn't craft, just scrapped when found. But I don't remember if did I learned any plan about it.
---
Well poop.
---
lmao most of my encounters in f76 https://twitter.com/hoshikz_myname/status/1128650822953209857
---
Nah, one was from the Purveyor, the other I've had for a while but saved just in case I wanted to use rifles.
---
All 10 3* melee weapons I got were basically trash. Scrapped a few of them and gambled on a 3* ranged instead and got a bloodied gauss rifle. I’m a bloodied melee build but have been wanting something like a bloodied gauss for a while
---
But don’t you need to be teammates?  
---
Another player and I met up in a Nuke event and shared kills.  We then talked about this task and became a team.  I went first, letting glowing ones take my health down, and he revived me.  He then did the same and i revived him.   
---
Afterwards I joked that it’s a good thing that I play as a Ranger, I could have turned Raider on him at that moment and let him die and taken his stuff...   grin...
---
Sodom?
---
Get a better internet. Don't think fucking up the game just because someone's got a bad internet is a good idea
---
It's a bash mod if I remember correctly it's not worth putting it on.
---
It wont happen. Like I said, I just want to play without relying on the crappy servers. And if they cant sort that out at least us just explore without having to be online.
---
I always tend to see them in the savage divide but in terms of fixed location the only one I can think off Is the Wise Mothman from The Path Of Enlightenment event but I doubt trying to kill him would work so I think it’s just down to random chance.
---
Yes. Armor protects against both Energy and Ballistic damage (ER and DR). It seems extremely obvious that if energy weapons do the same damage roughly as ballistic weapons and enemies have similar ER and DR (many do, some have higher ER than DR, so the "but there's less ER argument is invalid), they should also benefit from armor penetration.
---
 “The Path to Enlightenment.”
---
What are you waiting for? Go instigate some scorched in the face!
---
there is a japanese dude in f4 that does mods with automatron/cars and shits, he is so funny, i build once a mini tank
---
Better than nothing though right?
---
It would be amazing if we could get an throwing weapon called "Lump of Shit". Come on Bethesda, screw the QOL changes and the bug fixes and improvements, this is all the game needs at this point.
---
"How about a Mr Handy...,"
---
Not gonna lie, I thought they had us in the first half.
---
You can’t kill the mothman that spawns on path to enlightenment just FYI
---
Doesn’t let you get a wing
---
I guess the code is still in there, it’s just being ‘masked’ and can’t be picked up by the system. If that’s the case it’s possible that they can recover this via an update.
---
*short vision night scope*
---
XD
---
They should be skills you acquire through faction related quests.
---
I've done the entire main quest up to that point, you can't exactly skip it.
---
8 disconnects? Game crashes from time to time but never had a disconnect this month
---
Ah, yes. Berserkers. I wasn't sure about that one. It needs a damage buff, IMO. I would say not as strong as Bloodied, since you have the padding of health and popping Stims. I think it needs de-coupled from Armor DR so that the Barbarian perk cards work with it and maybe a damage multiplier of 100%. That would make it viable without breaking it. But I'm not sure.
---
My bad, thanks
---
I found a few along the map edge in the mire and bog.
---
The engine 100% can, the AI script just doesn't work properly with ladders. Or at least that was the explanation given back during Fallout 3's development. As to why they didn't rework the AI scripts to support them (and they have reworked the scripts to be much better in other aspects since then), probably because ladders are very low priority in their world design.
---
Brave, brave Sir Robin...
---
He bravely turned his tail and fled...
---
In a majority of instances, users internet connection won't have jack to do with the server side stability.
---
Wander, wander, wander.
---
launch a nuke once because it's fun and for the story, launch it 10 times cuz it's fun or whatever. at some point you are just grinding for loot. If you have all the loot this game isn't really big on plot or characters or progression or anything. once you have the best gun you can like, maybe work on getting the best melee weapon or the best other type of gun or something but it's a real limited content game and is just pathetic to replay forever.
---
Completely agreed.
---
it's supposed to protect your camp from enemies. pacifict non pvp players are not your enemies. using environmental damage to murder them would be griefing. it's a clever work around to grief. but when someone comes to your camp intending to visit or shop or not cause you harm they should not be attacked. if it's not survival ...it's it agreed upon pvp. so it's exploiting mechanics to grief.
---
You can’t kill the Wise Mothman from the Path To Enlightenment event. I randomly came across a Mothman once, but it was way before the update.
---
I’d rather it take 2 bullets instead of less damage
---
there are plenty of things theyve released broken that would be considered part of the small scale internal testing that they still didnt do. For example the workbench repair bug that happened in patch 7 or 8.
---
The odd tin of paint don’t hurt either
---
How about a sentrybot with a seat on it's back, or a protectron holding a chair?
---
That sounds ridiculous. I want five of each
---
Just place the switch inside behind the garage door. Put a locked door going in to your base. Then just go thru that door to open and close the garage door when you want to.
---
On it's own, yeah. But since people DO specifically run it with those two factors, that's why I opted to keep it as-is.
---
Excellent idea! Don’t shoot there, we need a Mr. Gutsy to for guard duty!
---
She must want me to die quick as I got 3 star wooden armor piece.
---
Bethesda: "Hear you loud and clear!"
---
*makes Mr. Handy exclusively for atom shop, and cost 999,999 atoms*
---
*throws caps at screen*
---
I mean you are trying to add realism to a video game. The gun was broken when both bullets did full dmg
---
Well I never get disconnects. Disconnects is so rare for me that I kinda remember every instance. By any chance you play with someone from another region? Heard that can cause problems due to syncing
---
I'll make sure to organize enemy kiting to wreck as much in game events as possible. 
---
Nobody is safe in the wasteland. Anti-HOA commission gang.
---
Turned in 1100 script n only got 1 item i might use sometimes, furious plack powder rifle +15% reload speed, ran one violent night n got an anti armor the dragon +15% reload speed and lvl 35 bloodied .50 cal machine gun
---
Not really.  For Vampire's to make a difference, it really needs to be on a fast weapon, because it always adds the same, tiny bit of HP per hit.
---
First time I stumbled upon him, he spawned and died. After that he always spawned regular.
---
As fun and original as that would be, wouldn’t you much rather take a picture of a glowing radstag wearing the scream mask inside of a nuke zone while drinking a Nuka Cola?
---
My internet is fine.
---
Spawn locations: 
---
Wavy Willard’s Waterpark
---
Landview Lighthouse
---
Camden Park
---
Giant Teapot
---
Kanawha Nuka Cola Plant Lobby
---
Uncanny Caverns
---
Tyler County Fairgrounds
---
Point Pleasant Mothman Museum
---
Ohio River Adventures Dock
---
Phillipi Graveyard
---
Miner’s Monument
---
Point Pleasant
---
Colonel Kelly Monument
---
Palace of the Winding Path
---
Beckley Workshop
---
I found mine at the Phillipi Graveyard.
---
Sure I’ve got 16 banked
---
where does it say "Revive a teammate"?
---
What a stupid question
---
25% fire rate doesn't work on the single action. Fire rate still shows as 6 when it should be 7 or 8.
---
If you’re still in the same session, then exit workshop mode and try again. I had to do that repeatedly when I was building the other day.  It gets wonky. Otherwise, gray usually means you don’t have the resources to make it, which doesn’t make sense if you have it stored.  So I guess what I’m saying is...I have no idea why you can’t place it 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
i recently made friends with a level 90 which has helped. I think I may just have to hope that no high levels are in my game and try to sprint to anywhere without engaging in combat!
---
Well, that's the problem. If you are using low health build, you just destroy anything with any weapon. You don't necessarily need bloodied weapons. It just got gud since low health build is meta atm. Without the meta, it's nothing. Low health build needs some tweaking. But i don't know about the bloodied prefix
---
Every time
---
There worth a good amount
---
could have been worse...you could have received a 3 star assaultron head, only to have it turn into a 2 star...
---
good read, thanks!
---
Furious explosive is junk..il buy it from you for 1k?
---
Along the line of off-line, it'd be more reasonable to ask for a FO76 app, where you could log into your account and scroll through your STASH. Even if there was no functionality beyond that, I'd love to be able to be at work and gander in my stash box.
---
Take a look at:
---
- Area between National Isolated Radio Array and National Radio Astronomy Research Center
---
- Cliffs at Savage Divide
---
- Charleston station
---
Good luck for hunting!
---
no that's why I vendored mine yesterday--- hope you didn't buy it back I suppose you could have spent those caps on Barry Manalow records....
---
I love how the backpack disappears for the explorer outfit even though you only have a small hood. Still get the carry weight increase but no ugly backpack
---
Inspect whatever you want and there should be a rename option, definitely helped narrow down which PA set was which lol
---
not over 10 grand tho
---
I only have a right arm and a left leg.....so anything other than that.
---
I have an extra LL i can trade, or caps....and other trades probably
---
For anyone who cares i nuked and farmed whitesprings for a while and didnt get another piece.....im really curious if they drop like a regular legendary or not
---
Then maybe there's something you're doing to make those disconnects happen. How large is your friends list? you hoard all your gears in your inventory? You team up with friends from the other side of the earth and attempt to do SBQ runs with them?
---
Honestly having robots do things around your camp is just a fantastic dlc concept for this game.
---
It says ally.   
---
I assumed that this meant a teammate.  All I know is that both of us assumed this, so rather than having to do it twice, we just did the team thing to be sure. 
---
But, try it without joining a team and see if its accepted as meeting the task.
---
I know people complain a lot about the game and some decision, but this one is the biggest disappointment for me
---
Explosive is not worth nearly as much any more after it got nerfed from 100% bullet damage on the explosion to 25%. Furious on the Other hand is still worth something so 5-10k would be a reasonable price range.
---
I always do the 2 star ranged weapons cause the third star isn’t that good and you get way more chances
---
I love this idea
---
you know that rug really does bring the room together
---
FE and EE are decent. I'd say 10k or so. Just gotta find the person with the right build and needs
---
That's gotta be so hard not to reply with..... you're*......right now..... LOL
---
But really you don’t need to. You can always choose another badge to do. Not everything is for everybody?
---
Name it Cripps.
---
I've run into the same issue and it's just how everything is laid out.
---
It's possible to make it quite far into the Savage Divide while skirting around higher level enemy groups, though. I'm level 18 and just finished getting the key fragment from Blackwater Mine. It took a while and some luck, but I faced the mine with almost all level 8-22 enemies. 
---
But I'm way far off course for someone under level 20 and am going to go back to the earlier areas to level up.
---
Or 3
---
Ty lolled so hard
---
I understand the frustration of having him killed in front of you, but why not just have your son purchase what you wanted then just pay him back?
---
all i've got is garbage so far; but that's what i expected from BGS so no bigs
---
Or a facepalm xD
---
I had 2000 scrip over 2 characters and got some awesome rolls.
---
I posted my experience on here yesterday and got accused of lying the weapons were that good.
---
I am a hoarder and max travelling pharmacy, bandolier and thru hiker... but I've done that from the start it has only got so bad since the last patch... apart from the very start when it was constantly crashing, but that def wasnt only me.
---
I was glad I could finally use my guild wars 2 jumping puzzle skills for something else.
---
Explosive, and faster firerate are the only secondary perks you want for ranged weapons.
---
I have heard that the explosion resets the furious count. But, trading just on the modifiers, you could easily get 5K a piece.
---
I have a spare plan if you want to buy it
---
We had one in Fallout 3 in your house in Megaton
---
GONDOR CALLS FOR AID
---
Can we make them powered with Crystal and Gold so people have at least some slim chance of buying my cheap ass mountains of gold and crystal.
---
&gt;Instigating:[..] I think it needs a ~25% damage buff from 200% to ~220%-235%
---
Nope. I truly love instigating weapons but they don't need any buffs. If the only way you can kill super mutants with instigating weapons is by sneak/stealth shots you're doing something seriously wrong. An instigating rifle can easily one-shot super mutants. The main benefit of using an instigating weapon instead of bloodied is that you don't need to be at under 5% hp to take advantage of that +100% damage. 
---
Instigating is fine as it is.
---
------------
---
Furious... Not every effect needs to be great in every scenario. You don't seem to care about balance, you just want to see more damage across the board. 
---
It's also just a 5% increase for up to 50% bonus damage. 50/5=10 so no, you don't need to hit someone 25 times and if you're hitting that someone with a slow gun it's all your fault. It's good for automatic weapons, not for melee or manual rifles. Boosting the % increase to take into account for swing speed is honestly really dumb.
---
To have a fun gameplay you must have different types of gameplay. If you just equalize everything you take away the joy of using different weapons/legendary effects. What's next? Make gatling guns have a 500 damage for the initial shot if it's an instigating Gatling?
---
Furious is good the way it is, it's slightly better than the vs mob type+30% effects, and it has a few drawbacks to compensate for that slight boost+ability to activate on all mob types.
---
-----------
---
Two shot used to be a 100% base damage increase. It deserved the nerf. 
---
&gt;Yes, that's right, it doesn't take damage modifiers into account. 
---
The second shot isn't affected by receiver types but it is affected by perk cards. So it takes damage modifiers into account. People still use it with explosive secondary effect because the explosive 20% base damage gets applied for both bullets.
---
----------
---
Balance the legendary effects to keep them in line with the basic +30% damage mob type weapons. Don't balance them based on the maximum damage a bloodied build can dish out. You're ruining everything if you're doing that. All of your suggestions were only buffs. This will make people only use those 4 weapon types because they will truly become the superior options. You didn't take into account any of the other legendary effects and you didn't take into account standard weapons. You know, Bethesda doesn't want to alienate new players.
---
If your buffs would go through, people will soon start complaining about events/dungeons being too easy. Bethesda will have to buff the difficulty. Do you think this will be fun for a newbie with standard weapons? Or to someone who doesn't have one of the 4 types of weapons you want to buff?
---
You can't make legendary guns be that much more powerful than standard versions of those guns. If they are really strong they need some massive drawbacks. 
---
You can't balance 4 effects while completely ignoring everything else.
---
All depends on if your looking to protect yourself or deal some damage
---
Happy you finally got to use that liberal arts degree, professor?
---
You also get wrecked in one shot by anything if you get spotted. Radiation is also a BITCH. And unless you take out your enemy in one shot during PVP, you lose. It's a bit OP facing just regular stuff you can kill in a single shot in PVE, but damage that high is kind-of really for queen fights and other bosses, given bad teammates and time limits. If you try it out, I can tell you it saves ammo, you hit like a truck, but you die a lot without good Sneak and positioning.
---
I dont team apart from to trade with people on here. Like I said, i may aswell play offline ha

---
Robot Workbench is hinted at via an icon for the Wastelanders DLC. But this just makes me want it now.

For real, if Tomminfinite got all the ladders to work in FNV then Bethesda should be able to do so easily.

Pacifist prevents you from accidently initiating PVP. It doesm't give you free rain to go wherever you want and see another player's stuff just because you want to.
---
The audacity of some of you people, I swear.
---
I get more CTD than disconnects, and it has been very rare as of late. Seemed like in December my controls would freeze and I'd get a disconnect numerous times each session. This has been greatly reduced as of late. My controls did get frozen last night and it didn't come back, just had to leave the server (shame as somebody had just showed up to my CAMP vendors). This was the first time in awhile. 
---
CTD I'm not entirely willing to blame on anything but maybe my system, but I'm very dubious of this as all these other new big budget games play just fine, online or off. 
---
The main reason however I'm pretty sure it doesn't have anything (or much) to do with our connections is that mine is basically on a dedicated line, its the only device using the internet. Put a lot of time into this stupid network of mine, pretty confident in its performance, and again other games seem to love it (frequently the lowest ping in RB6 Siege that kind of thing).
---
I took a long break as you did and came back last week.  honestly, not that much has really changed.  BGS is still the short bus and has the game design skills of mosquito larvae.  They continue to pinch away the fun while dishing up tedium.
---
They never managed to launch anything though so who knows.
---
Getting a very wide range of answers here thanks guys haha I appreciate it
---
Didn't have enough caps and it doesn't show the same inventory for each player. Items vary by person. He didn't get the hunters long coat. Got a clean space suit and fisherman outfit.
---
Yep, just remember to spam X (or whatever collect is for you) so you can harvest each node multiple times.
---
The higher your perception the greater the accuracy
---
Legendary Grahm ⭐⭐⭐
---
Since those usually lower the durability of a gun... No, it's not better than nothing 😉
---
It’s 16 for now. So is it any cap for maximum accuracy?
---
Oh ok, i’ve never even seen him before, thanks.
---
Lore wise, vehicles are fairly widespread at least among militaries. Talon company and the Lyons Brotherhood both had trucks loaded with cargo in certain bases (Adams AFB and the main Talon base), as well as NCR citizens deeper within the territories having cars available like the Highwayman. Shady Sands is basically a modern city by this point after all.
---
Well aids and ammo shouldn't matter. Seems weapons and armor count contribute when it comes to instability. Not just you but someone around you as well. For that reason I try to keep my inventory as light as possible. I just walk around with thru hiker, always manage my friends list, and server hop if I see some lag spikes. and I get no disconnects
---
5mm used on the minigun should be .50 BMG.
---
This looks like the closest thing I can find to the in game Minigun.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAU-19
---
Got this same one except the third effect reduced its weight to .26 pounds.
---
I’ve had this issue as well. Almost impossible to hear other players even with volume turned all the way up
---
Get the best range and accuracy mods. Even if you don't use a scope, mount it on the gun, it'll boost your vats accuracy.
---
Hip fire seems to help too. 
---
Perception is also one of the factors that will boost up your accuracy.
---
My hunting rifles have 111 accuracy and 204 range. + true barrel + true stock.
---
That + 15 points in perception makes it so i'm at 95% most of the time
---
It slightly better than selling 1 * crap to the vendor for caps.
---
Still bugged. Looking at lists where I've discovered everything but still showing as incomplete. Meh. :-/
---
Well that's one way to deal with customers which keep asking for discount.
---
And only Grahm makes it look easy.
---
I think all stats will max out at 30 (unyielding build or boosts like meds etc) for maximum accuracy. Gotta say I don’t have mine maxed out and I get 95% most of the time (still miss a lot btw)
---
Seems odd they have yet to figure it out, but again, this engine is old as fuck and they really just need to make a new one already.
---
I've been going to all those places, I wonder if I'm just looking in the wrong spot in those locations?
---
Same here. I get CTDs but never disconnects
---
Any science experiment that utilizes animals and puts them in harmful, uncomfortable, and inhumane settings is not one that should be done.

People keep coming up to try to talk to me, even people I know, and they think I'm just ignoring them.
---
Hello from the 17th of May. STILL bugged.
---
Where is your base? I always go to the tea pot when I’m activating Campfire Tales &amp; I see him there a lot actually
---
As dumb as it might sound have you tried it with a different headset sometimes headset can cause issues like that. Other than that i cant think of any other way to adjust it.
---
&gt;it's supposed to protect your camp from enemies. pacifict non pvp players are not your enemies. 
---
Maybe for you, doesn't mean I want people in my camp and if I choose to defend it with the in game items that isn't griefing.
---
This post is ridiculous.  Love it.  Appreciate your time and effort good sir!
---
I got an idea for a alarm block sound...
---
Hello from the 17th of May. STILL bugged :-/
---
I want more hairstyles that aren’t 4 different variants of fuckin mohawks😂 I want more like Hornets Nest &amp; Megaton! Megaton has been my go to since the beginning, F3 is my favorite so it’s just too good to let go but if there was some actual good hairstyles I could be swayed..
---
He spawns all over the map, but my base is near the observatory in the northern part of savage divide
---
^This is the best solution- works well. 
---
I also found an alternative depending on the design- I have an empty space as a doorway, and if I want to close it off for some reason temporarily, I just seal off that space with a wall.
---
People would be server hopping Black Water Mine nonstop tor that sweet, sweet fuel. It would finally be a good reason for people to explore that place other than doing Uranium Fever
---
They don't spawn anymore tbh it's easy to get then from pa and power stations anywyas
---
Same here man like we literally have the **first ever friendly mole-miner**, and there is no exposition as to how interesting this is alone. However despite Bethesda being my favourite developer, the past few years their name has become synonymous with the term 'missed opportunity'.
---
Yeah. I literally just got a new headset this week, and it's still too low.
---
The only thing I could imagine is *maybe* it's a soundcard-specific issue. I have a Sound Blaster AE-5. Never had an issue in any game with audio except when it comes to Fallout 76, but... Bethesda games are notorious for strange bugs.
---
lol I completely agree that it is ridiculous, and I only intend to keep running with it
---
Yeah if the issue isn't persisting in other games I'd say it's due fallout itself i agree its probably some weird glitch or bug.
---
Yes, Ultracite PA plans are generally dropped by the queen. The other option is to hit the market and buy them from other players.
---
Form follows function.
---
FOR SCIENCE!!
---
Someone award this person a Pioneer Scout Badge!
---
That hermit crab is tough and is wearing a bus for armor. You need good anti-armor weapons and penetration perks to kill it quickly. Also, toss plasma grenades at it to speed things up. 
---
A level 15 character usually isn't equipped to win that battle.
---
Fuck yes!  +karma
---
I wish I could actually even buy anything from the vendor
---
I’ve also been helping repair items that are broken at peoples camps since I feel awful spawning things in every time
---
Just got it. It lowered the range by 20. F that
---
Hm decent range and nice chance to hit 
---
I’m always aiming for head maybe that’s make difference?
---
They said in the notes he was never intended to be a legendary.
---
Yeah it misses a lot for some reason, I believe some patches ago it worked much better
---
My drops have been decent, but I am real surprised/dissapointed that the fact she's the first and only known friendly mole-miner in existence and this isn't explained, expanded upon or even made relevant. She could literally be one of the vending machines and we wouldn't be missing out on anything.
---
so launch Blah blah blah this games is a dumpster fire insert talking head here...….
---
Im like whats the down side here fallout 5 release date prob 2 years down the road I have had 3 or 4 full play thrus on fallout 4 so pretty much done with that.
---
lets see largest map ever ok,  lots of real people in game , pvp option if you desire camp building,  player vending , skins and dodads, a perk system that isn't locked and changeable.
---
So I now have had prob 300 to 400 plus hours of entertainment for 60 bucks, and new content is coming out weekly.
---
Yeah the launch sucked most multi player launch sucks d3 launch sucked to all the haters hey I like this game have from the start and like it a lot more now that it works better and content has been added and also look forward of whats to come.
---
As I came to understand it after I posted this, the weightless legendary modifier  is only applied to the base weight, which is a problem for technically all armor types (except trapper and marine).
---
The problem is that the game considers light/sturdy/heavy attributes a mod ("size" mod behind the scenes). Light is size 0, aka un modded. Sturdy and heavy are size 1 and 2, each of those "mods" have weight that get added to the base weight, and like other mods, this happens *after* the weightless legendary mod is calculated.
---
There arent different sizes of Trapper and marine, so those dont have this issue. 
---
I dont know if it was intentional on bethedsas part, but it doesnt make sense the way they calculate it.
---
How they do it:
---
W_final= 0.1 (W_base) + W_sizemod + W_matlmod + W_miscmod
---
How it should be:
---
W_final= 0.1 (W_base + W_sizemod + W_matlmod + W_miscmod)
---
Id even settle for :
---
W_final= 0.1 (W_base + W_sizemod) + W_matlmod + W_miscmod
---
Such an easy fix...
---
That give the walking damage from nowhere a whole new meaning
---
"ouch...Damn..tripped over the beard again"
---
people turn power to a shop to sell stuff. that's inviting shopping not murder traps. if you don't want people to come don't invite, don't turn on the vending machine power. and lock your doors. if someone picks the lock they are wanted - fair game to murder away.
---
if exploiting environmental damage to murder pacifist non pvping players in adventure mode of not griefing, what do you call it?
---
Ah thanks I forgot they could spawn with PA as well, that'll make it easier for me to find some
---
I dunno man. I never have that problem. If survivality is an issue, you might want to consider PA with emergency protocol
---
Troy McClure, I thought he was dead!
---
No, I said he sleeps with the fishes.
---
"Its survival, not munchkin land where everyone sings and dances"
---
Or is it
---
Just an added piece for instigating: instigating should gain the effect if the mob or player is at full health regardless of rads. Thus if you run into a player with 60% rads but the other 40% is full hp, then instigating should work. This would make instigating more viable in pvp.
---
Exactly. Mine works fine with other games and I'm the only one using it. Like I said, the last patch has brought bugs... been super choppy during combat, disconnecting and ive noticed its been lagging loads when you're trying to scroll through your inventory during trades. 
---
I just wanna play without the choppyness and disconnecting. You could make it where you have to start a new character and it's entirely locked to offline... hell, I'd even lock my lv 275 to offline if I could for once have a night playing without saying "for f$%ks sake!"
---
this is addressing the specific  issue with fast traveling to a camp with vending turned on and getting stuck in a trap  ....that's griefing. 
---
turn off the vending advert. lock your doors. if someone picks a lock and is wanted it's fair game.
---
I'm starting to think fast travels mess up the spawn too.
---
Issues with AI is something every single developer deals with. Some deal with it by the AI cheating, knowing where you are at all times, teleporting in to be able to reach you, reacting faster then humanly possible, upping health or damage or. It's not an 'engine' or Bethesda issue, it's something all developers deal with, Bethesda's limitation just happens to show up with ladders, which isn't actually game ruining.
---
Just following in the footsteps of Amy Kerry from the Responders, doing the science that must be done!
---
I agree with the need to balance out effects, but not with the ridiculous numbers you threw out. Also, two shot does NOT work the way you described. Both of the projectiles already deal half of the pip boy damage, and only the total is affected by armor if both hit, not each shot individually. It can still outshine anti-armor on certain weapons due to the fact that armor penetration is multiplicative, so any additional perks/mods like incisor or perforating mags will be much weaker on an anti-armor weapon. 
---
Like you said, bloodied is fine as it is. It SHOULD have one of the strongest buffs given that it has one of the highest trade-offs as well. Instigating needs a bit of a buff, but not much. It is already technically the strongest per-shot bonus you can get, and it synchronizes extremely well with sneak attacks. Imo the best way to fix it would be to make it function slightly more inclusively, such as for your first shot on an enemy regardless of its hp. 
---
Furious absolutely can NOT go anywhere near that high. Even 100% would be far too much. The 50% bonus it has now could be fine if they made it slightly easier to get to or had it take longer to reset.
---
Faster fire rate?
---
The fix for berserkers is to make the max benefit work at a reasonably low lvl of DR. No one should have to run a 0DR setup to get berserkers to function at max.
---
You can get them now from the "Shopping Mall" vendor in Whitesprings. HC Arms, Legs, Torso.
---
Well like I said, I hardly ever team. Just seems to have gotten way worse since the patch...
---
don't we have ffr and vats 50% 33%?
---
I would love to! How much are you selling it for?
---
That's ok, but it isnt as useful as explosive imo.
---
Fire rate and vats crit are very good.
---
50% Critical damage
---
Damn, I feel bad for complaining. I think we need to start a new thread of getting worked over by the purveyor. We can Crying  in my Nuka Cola.
---
You can get 10k for them. Most people on this sub don't even use the market communities and have no clue what things are trading for.
---
Or make it tied to not functioning when wearing anything greater than wood armor. Berserkers should honestly allow perks to work with it.
---
They do in fact spawn in generators.
---
At first I hated it. Then I started an NV play through recently and the PA in it just seems weird now.
---
I’ve got a quad western revolver if you’re interested
---
Well I think most info was on that terminal on the top floor next to the power armor station.   Glad I could help if just a little bit.   The eureka moment for me was realizing that I could grab DNA from any scorchbeast.   Mostly because that area they send you to is, quite literally,  a BITCH lol.  Happy Hunting!
---
Anything good you want to trade?
---
They do sometimes. Not nearly as much as they used to. Not enough to travel just for it, but if you're in an area with one it's worth checking.
---
I don't really care much for explosive. I had my fun with it when it was cool and not nerfed.
---
I like the vats hit chance or the limb damage quite a fair bit.
---
How so? You think it resets every time you fast travel?
---
They stack
---
I should really play fo1 and 2 someday. :P
---
That's what worried me was this getting duped around 😑

Shhhh. U're given up my secrets.
---
In all seriousness my favorite low health legendary is vampires. I have a vamp auto handmade and never worry about dying.
---
Your most likely getting killed by duped weapons, not purveyor weapons bro
---
That little boost that you get against whatever cryptid you fought was also something I thought was well thought out and cool.  Ine can hope they see this post as it did get some traction and wasn't overly negative!
---
For some reason when I try mod a combat knife I have two mods at the top which are "no mod" one makes it the default weapon and the other makes the blade invisible.
---
I got a couple really good ones. It's a nice addition to farming. I was just happy to get rid of the weight.
---
How much plasma grenades plans you got from ash heap events? trying to get one.
---
They spawn but they increased how fast you burn through them awhile ago so I think people just farm them more. I've just been taking over one of the nuclear plants when I get on and grabbing 10-15 for my gatling laser.
---
I had it happen but it went away after I completely closed the game out and restarted it.
---
When i'm farming ghouls/mutants i'm aiming for the head too. I don't have any issues with that either. 
---
Shotguns lose a lot of accuracy but if you're using rifles you shouldn't have any issues. Especially if you have clear line of sight.
---
Yeah. You got to keep an eye on the players around you. Unfortunately that also means the players that went through 10-15min earlier. Creeping is the only way to do it if that happens. Even on my higher levels I'll approach WS from the east because many times it's just not worth it. Slogging through dozens of ghouls just to sell something. You know... Before many of the latest patches.
---
And once you get the note you read all about it on the terminal next to the power station.
---
Gesundheit.
---
I’m using Hunting rifle my stats are 198 range and 109 accuracy, but it misses in mid distance in head and shows only 55-65%
---
I totally forgot about waste not!  Oh to be able to do these again
---
your getting stuck on the semantix of "armor". The effect is intended to penetrate resistances.
---
"IS THAT SOMEONE THAT NEEDS ME TO KICK THEIR ASS!?!?" "EVERY DAY IS A GOOD DAY TO DIE!"

Plus missile turrets targeting you? 
---
Yeesh..
---
I think ps4 has the same problem. Sometimes I even have trouble in the party chat outside of the game while we're playing and I have to turn down the in game volume.
---
It also depends on what a person personally views the weapon to be priced at. I personally wouldn't pay over 5k but that's probably because I don't use ranged weapons that much and these ones are not what I'm looking for in a ranged weapon.
---
And
---
You and me both.  Is it my scarred face or the giant axe I swing at literally everything?
---
NOPE just 20% movement speed increase NOTHING more. You know why? Engine cant handle it and multiplayer at the same time.

He's saying "Gatling" plasma. The normal plasma dose deal both ballistic and energy.

it's RNG with a system that is loaded heavily towards crap rolls. Why on earth would you expect THIS aspect to be better? People have been getting some pretty good stuff...I did 5 yesterday, and 4 were trash. One was a quad explosive reduced carry weight 10mm pistol.   
---
I'm pretty happy, all things considered.
---
I put up a switch turned it off and on a few times and that did the trick for me!
---
I really don't agree with this... my 3'd star was 90% reduced weight. That's worthwhile, to my mind.

It's named after the "money" mining companies would pay their employees in so they didn't have to give them real money.  It was only valid at the company store, but they'd also have to pay to rent their tools, helmets, etc. so they could rarely ever accumulate very much ("I owe my soul to the company store")
---
So, you are fine with only 2 sets of legendary prefixes being all anyone wants? You could use my percentage changes and then cut everything down by an equal amount (Say, 25%) of damage and still have 4 viably competitive legendary effects, everything would just do less damage if that's what concerns you. 
---
The thing with Furious: Everything you are shooting at is either a basic enemy with low enough health that it is already dead before the stacking effect kicks in, or a bullet-sponge boss that doesn't care that your minigun is doing an extra 20 points of damage at peak stack. So you could do 2 things: make basic enemies tougher and bosses weaker, or increase the stack damage so that it actually matters in a long fight against a tough enemy. And unless you do one of those things, you burn through so much ammo that high ROF weapons become nonviable. You also need to make it take quite a few hits to achieve the high damage multiplier I suggested or it would break PVP and people would be able to use slower ROF weapons to EASILY out-class all the other legendary weapon effects. Trust me, I thought this through very thoroughly. And reality agrees with me. Nobody uses furious weapon who has an alternative and knows what they are doing.
---
For two-shot, I didn't know about it interacting with perk cards. I will edit my proposal accordingly.
---
As for other effects, they need an overhaul too. They need brought in line, but that doesn't mean make my ideas invalid because the things I didn't discuss are really crappy and need much more extensive work, outright removal with new replacements, etc...But if you are fine with that Troubleshooter's tire iron, ok.
---
I can’t decide if I feel bad or if i wanna stop at your shop today 😂😂
---
You don't, i helped someone the other day by jumping off a roof and going down and they got it.
---
Fire rate is meh on most cases. Vats is only good for certain builds, where explosive is good for every build
---
Only good for certain builds, explosive is good for every build
---
ummm try deleting the wire leading to it then reconnecting.
---
Tried that too 😔
---
Youd think a mole rat was chewing on my router the way it's been performing today...
---
Yes, and they do make for good pics, Crystal wasn’t on the list I don’t think but I grabbed one of those just cause I liked the look of it lol
---
Oh ok didn't see that
---
Don’t tell people where the black cowboy hat is!!! That’s my best seller!!!
---
I’m on PlayStation. I try and wave at people and some have helped out but I’ve found it quite lonely so far.
---
I feel your pain, I kind of feel bad for others who didn't get anything good yet. Keep trying!
---
Its needed, yes. But cooking stove don't see it. Only royal jelly you can use for cooking is on the grave in middle mountain cabins. You need 3 days for bage. Sucks with plasma grenades. Most of ash heap events are boring asf, but we need plan to get chemist bage
---
Purveyor &gt; Killing a 3\* and getting a drill or nothing at all
---
At least you put in the scrip for a 3\*, you'll get a 3\*.
---
Does it have to be in survival? And do I have to make the kill shot?
---
Can you only sell items you acquire since the purveyor was added? I have a stash full of unwanted legendaries and when I go to the purveyor the sell option is greyed out on everything. This is on PS4 multiple server hops doesn’t change anything.
---
This would be great if 76 had a way you could do this in game.
---
Goodjob all they way. Keep on doing what your doing.
---
I’m only level 11 🤣 
---
I’ve not really done any crafting so I’ll look into that. I have lead belly as I couldn’t be bothered to keep boiling water.
---
Being a Burglar is a character archetype as long as there have been RPGs. Nobody logs into Fallout for the first time and says, "I AM GOING TO BE A SHOTGUN SPECIALIST" either.
---
I’m only level 11. I think it’s because by this point in fallout 4 I’d come across some high level weapons and could generally hold my own a bit.
---
Wait, hold on. That workbench is in the icon? That’s awesome. I’ll hold my hype for further information, but thank you
---
I’d go for 8k, and you’ll get some bites. 
---
You can find someone who will spend 10k eventually, but 6-8k is what I’ve seen them go for recently.
---
(PS4) lvl 50 Executioner's flamer 3*. +50% limb damage, +50% more damage when Target is &lt;40% health, +1 perception.
---
Yep. Legendary hazmat would be great. But I hear there is code for legendary pa so we’ll see how that turns out.
---
Wooooooaaaaahhhh slow down if we are going to get a Mr Handy to fix things what about a repurposed assultron lady friend with the destroying us bits removed to ummmm keep us comforted. You know a lil of this a lil of that. Sugar time baby daddys home. Asking a live gal for some can get ya killed in game and the scorched are probably falling apart too much for a good shag!
---
&gt;But that said, why the hell is Pickaxe Pilsner so difficult to make? Never craft it, buy that stuff from vendors… Strangler Bloom is too rare and unpredictable.
---
The recipe changed, I believe it takes Blight now, not Strangler Bloom.
---
Other than that, bravo.  You are doing Atom's work.
---
I got one with 25% faster fire rate so it's only 2 business days which is like a free priority mail upgrade.
---
Yes, but then I can't wear any legendary armor pieces. Six of one, half a dozen of the other, as the saying goes. I have learned to compensate. Sometimes you still get whacked by something and insta-gibbed if you are careless or unlucky and it pisses you off, though. Haha
---
You should see my......maze in a sub station. Hard to build in them but its cool once you get used to the layout.
---
But i seem to have this issue with people jumping in and getting lost and not using the front door and following ALL the arrows.
---
(PS4) lvl 45 3* assassins ultracite gatling laser. +10% dmg to players, VATS crits do +50% damage, 15% faster reload
---
But Congress is still gonna sit on that reload
---
No, I revived a random person at Whitesprings and it counted.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f248bf&amp;d=p02pd2pk2pl2pp2s00ek1c72ic4id0ir1a72a04a32l71lt0lv2lk2l12lr2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=5239cf
---
That's my build.
---
Also using PA; the helmet with Vats matrix overlay gives an extra 10% hit chance.
---
Not a clue what else could cause such a difference in hit chance
---
I picked up the blood raider for the excavator. 
---
I think i'm gonna sit tight and hope for some mole miner attire.
---
I noticed that my machines randomly emptied back into my stash so double check your items are still up for sale. I had to relist everything
---
I had to move my stairs because putting a roof section over the second floor hole for the stairs meant I was putting in a "floating" object. I mean, yeah... if we ignore the walls and the entire remainder of the roof? 
---
Intersecting! with! an! existing!... pebble? What?!
---
CAMP rules need some serious work.
---
Ah, I had heard about that bug then, I just hadn't tried it for myself yet. That's a bummer. Thanks for clarifying tho.
---
I play video games to do things I can't do in real life. Like chuck plasma grenades at a squad of super mutants or shoot 40mm grenades at a swarm of feral ghouls. Why would you ever want Bethesda to spend time making a goddamn fishing simulator in Fallout. There are already a bunch of other fishing games.
---
Like, the depths of stupid it takes to believe this is a good idea is off of the charts they use to measure stupidity. It is an entirely new kind of stupid.
---
oh thank Atom lol
---
Chain rust. You can thank all the people who didn't wax their chain prewar and cheaped out and used WD40.
---
I can jump on and help, meet at the camp? Ryak7786
---
IGN is imprezobus, just as here, and send me your discord stuff/other voips stuff.
---
I know its snoozefest. I'm 400 hours into researching that stuff. My biggest regret is that I have postponed splitter research. Would have hopped onto current temporary meta perfectly.
---
I think this has been needed for a while. Then there would be no real need for my proposed damage increase.
---
Sure let’s do it
---
This is the only quick way to do the kill 16,000 robots challenge that I’ve already done. If you get what you want people who wants to do this in the future will have to spend ten times the time. I mapped out every freaking robot spawn in the game and if youre doing that challenge thats the only place you can kill 100+ robots an hour without having to switch servers/locations or anything. 
---
But hey, I’ve already done it so wouldnt affect me but hey it was challenges that gave 960 atoms and it was hell before I found out you could do it kill 100 robots an hour in Whitesprings.
---
Omit the offensive word and you won’t get downvoted...in case you were wondering.
---
Sooner or later this will happen anyway ;)
---
I really want to come visit
---
Haha i went there at lvl 22.
---
Had to toss a nade then sneak shot with my blackpowder rifle. Still running away hoping for 2 reloads to get 1 baddy. I kept my adhesive,  dumped a bunch of stuff and ran away. Not ready.
---
Another way to play the game in a way it is mechanically intended. 
---
Scamming is legal provided glitches are not used. Scamming being permitted means it is up to you not to get scammed. Don't want go take the risk? Don't use the feature. You not getting your desired outcome isn't griefing.
---
Welcome to online multiplayer games. You aren't the only one playing the game.
---
Do you have pics? This is right up my alley! Also, what system are you playing on? I'd love to visit!
---
Nah. They probably ran. They run first, ask questions later. My horses anyway.
---
Why would you bank them instead of buying plans you don't have?
---
Iirc a black cowboy hat also spawns in white springs on a wheelchair.
---
They also seemed to reduce the max one in a PA Chassis can be, or maybe its stat based now, but every one I've pilfered from the Chassis is at 25%
---
Technically "50%", cause I run the double fusion core perk, but still something I noticed.
---
Where exactly in the water park ?
---
Dont worry I have less than 50 subs :'(
---
Nice. Add another 2k or so to that FE 50 cal.
---
Here I was looking for it in the crafting menu like it used to be in
---
Older generations see how something has changed over time and try to keep change from happening children born into that change thing see it as how it always was and accept it. children born today will never know a world without touch screens and wifi even. In a similar way when I was growing up my family had an N64 and I thought this is technology this is video games. when in truth the N64 was new and 3d graphics were also pretty new on the home market.
---
FFR, VCrit, and even 10% when aiming are best possible rolls for certain weapons.
---
PC. I have made it to Fort Defiance, I should be able to get in there but I don't remember if there's a workbench.  
---
I had to fight some Major Gutsy's and almost got to a workshop but then a mirelurk queen popped out of the lake and I nope'd out of there quick.   
---
Then while heading northwest I ran into a scorchbeast flying around so I avoided that direction.
---
Going to the camp, there’s a tower there that me and my son jumped off that did it lol
---
Because then everyone would be playing heavy weapons like everyone does melee.
---
I just pretend they're using .50 beowulf, myself ;)
---
But i admit, as a former cswi it bugs me too xD
---
Thanks for the tip! White spring has a lot of spawns but I think they're randomized. As far as I know these are guaranteed daily!
---
But vats is better on certain builds than explosive is good for every build
---
Really this is something that I absolutely love about the Sons of Dane event, it makes sense lore wise for the Sons of Dane, I think they could do the same thing with a radio signal maybe have the Mr Handy serve as the boardcast signal?
---
I am so much that person...
---
My camp has all the basic workbenches and 2 vend machines and a water purifier if you need a quick refill. And uh... yeah. It’s pretty sad. But I’m saving up for brick plans. One day soon it will be equally sad with nicer materials.
---
If you PC then I'll take three similar weapons, only one of which will be explosive. I bet you'll dislike the explosive one the least.
---
Can also do the water revive for the swimmer too
---
Oh I was mostly kidding! It almost always there so I grab it and most people don’t notice it so it’s an easy item to sell! Keep up the good work!
---
Yeah I'm a big fan of this alert, but they don't have it for the rest. I think a Radio Signal for each event would be super.
---
Just rolled and I got a Quad Hunting Rifle, bullets explode for area damage, and +50% damage resistance while aiming.
---
So I’d say not to bad, sounds cool to me.
---
Back to grinding to get even more scrip!
---
The game, whilst not amazing, is much better than people give it credit for. At least on par with fallout 4 for me.
---
Did you the camera on one of tourists?
---
oh, ok, so scamming a person with false advertising, tricking them into a death trap is just your way to play the game? I'm pretty sure that actually is considered griefing but cool, enjoy? just because you follow the rules doesn't make it not griefing.
---
this is clearly why survival is not the answer for all people. people that purposefully trick people like this to cause them harm is griefing and these people don't want fair pvp on a level playing field. griefing and bullying make me with these games were not online but alas, I've met far more people that are helpful and nice than I have on the flip side so I'll just let it go and realize it's not my problem but a problem with someone that needs to hurt others for enjoyment. it makes me sad but I'll live.
---
Get Sun Kissed and collect water in day time. You only need one point. You'll hear the rads sizzle but they instantly go away (if the darn perk card is actually working). I run through streams with this card on and the rads disappear before you can even see any red.
---
Try the park place you know the huge alligator or crocodile thinger I server hoped there and found it.
---
We do what we must, because we can.
---
(I know, wrong game, I still love it)
---
Thanks so much bud. Drop a sub to make my day! &lt;3
---
I dont know how it works for all stats, but at least Four Leaf Clover formula gives much different results if you reach 34, than it does lower - i.e. the difference betwern 28 and 33 may be smaller than between 33 and 34.
---
You sell that? There's like 3 spawns I've seen quite often.
---
Because none of the possum plans are a must have for me. I went ahead and got the high capacity plan this morning so my friends can learn it before they fix it.
---
Yes I found it on the guy at Wavy Willard's
---
Thank you! :) I agree.
---
Get 2 of them in the truck...lol
---
This is the perfect idea! Plus they still say your characters names! At least they did when I left the vault
---
I live near spruceknob in a spot where schorchbeasts dont fly over or spawn near and the dreaded protect spruceknob from 3 schorchbeasts could happen at any time and then they descend upon my house
---
Onkt under certain builds, explosive is good for any build
---
M’lady
---
If you got good things every time, everyone would be running around with god weapons.
---
I’m fine with the occasional shit-tier drop if it means I can get some good stuff, and at the end of the day scrip is only made by playing the game, so lootbox yes but microtransation no.
---
Yeah, I was bummed that the new skull mask took my beard away
---
I finally heard somebody the other night and it was whisper quiet. Headset wasn't hooked up and he wanted to buy my Furious 3\* Pump Action (which wasn't gonna happen headset or no). 
---
But I had to crank my speakers up to damned near max just to hear his whisper level. Checked the settings, its at max...confusing as hell. 
---
I think if you just turn it off it'll show a no-microphone type indicator next to your name. May do this cause I can't hear them anyways!
---
Did you go to a tinkers bench and make the camera and film?
---
Agree with you that people are low balling for a reason.
---
However, I would totally buy that gun for 10k if I wanted a nice 50 cal for a heavy build. Just to put it in perspective. 10k is 7 days worth of caps (at 1400 caps a day). If an FE 50cal was the gun you wanted it would take you way more than 7 days to grind one out of the drops or legendary vendor.
---
Drop everything you don't need. Otherwise it's a long walk home. And it's better to lose a little than losing the lot if you die.
---
From what I read recently, the longer the scope, the better the accuracy (thats obvious when looking at the stats) but the shorter the scope less AP points it costs to shoot, with sights not scopes reducing the baseline vats cost.
---
Yep, have it in my inventory right now.
---
Yup! I mean only 50 caps but people always buy it. Never sits for long.
---
No its not great.  If they made 3 star enemies drop 3 stars it would be better
---
He gives me a vibe of "I'm a vegetarian, but you look kinda tasty..."
---
There is some on the 3rd floor, but you'll have to get through those enemies and I don't recall if that location scales or not.
---
Xbox here or i would help. But you should stay out of defiance high lvl enemies in there. But your best bet is to run deeper in. Go straight east until you hit the city of watoga. Then on the southern edge is the safety of the train station. All along he way are tunnels you can hide in and run from enemies with
---
If you’re on Xbox I probably have a spare I can give ya
---
depending on the ammount of the bounty and how much of an ass they are (like if they're obviously greifer) you take whatever they drop even if its 3 steel and a peice of wood
---
Drink a nukashine
---
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
---
My main char (albeit, at mid-70s is half the level of my alt) has a piece of armor that cloaks me when not moving and crouched... I have not yet found a replacement for it due to its -20% Weapon Weight :( Which, given how limited the range is in 76 on weapons compared to previous (particularly FO3), I generally do not use Scopes and so I stick with Reflex. 
---
I ended up having to actually change out the Reflex on my Gauss to a Short Scope (I used Recon) just because I couldn't hit shit when sneaking. 
---
Which, that is my tip to everyone. The amount of zoom the Short Scopes impart is not much different than the Reflex. The Recon in turn also gives you the wide field of view like the Reflex does (not to mention marking targets and a slight benefit in low-light areas), making it the next best thing. So if this doesn't ever get addressed, that's my suggestion to you all. :)
---
My drops have been... ok. Nothing amazing, a couple near great, but nothing that replaces my current stuff.
---
And while I'm really glad to have another NPC, it's a crying shame she had no real story or personality. Bender, uh I mean Biv, set the bar VERY high.
---
Just as I said under other of same answers - the explosive is good for all builds, but for certain builds, certain weapons and certain situations these are better. Much better. Firerate tesla for example is universally better gun than explosive tesla.
---
Do people swap plasma cores for fusion?
---
damn theres an exploit? is that why i already somehow had high capacity known after i purchased the plan??? i thought i was a moron and already bought it and learned it, but 8 badges doesnt come cheap so i was quite certain i didnt . i was planning on selling the plan but if its an exploit i think i will just hang on to the plan.
---
I want to though Lol just when I get killed I don't want them to be able to disappear so I can seeeek revenge!
---
That and you can already find a few (non-functional) Robot Workbenches around the map too, like in the Taxidermy Basement's secret room
---
&gt;you are fine with only 2 sets of legendary prefixes being all anyone wants?
---
Which ones?
---
Mob type +30% is pretty much equal to TSE. AA is also comparable. Furious with its 50% is in the same class too. 
---
Bloodied has a low hp requirement, Executioner's is also really powerful. 
---
Instigating is only good with general gameplay. 
---
That's 12 good effects depending on situation. Not just 2. It's not my fault that people ignore stuff like prime zealot for example. It's a beast vs the SBQ. Troubleshooter, Hunter, these are all great effects for their niches.
---
Then we have the "weaker" ones such as quad/double,  mutant's , junkie's 
---
And the truly shitty one:  Berserker's.
---
You're wrong if you assume that people only care about 2 effects currently (and i don't even get it which 2... i love instigating but i also love bloodied, furious, zealot, quad...)
---
Troubleshooter &gt; Two-shot  vs imposter sheepsquatch.
---
Troubleshooter Explosive &gt; Two-shot Explosive vs imposter sheepsquatch.
---
So yeah, i would be much happier with a troubleshooter explosive rifle.
---
Ave, true to Pacoboy
---
Too late 😜
---
Trapper chest does the same thing
---
If I get the +25 rad res legendary effect on it I swear...
---
For FE .50 my PC offer would be 12k and if its okay for you and you play PC I'll happily pay it
---
I got the same but a combat rifle. I want to like it, but i can't get the damage up very high.
---
*what in tarnation*
---
That is a bad example because for one they done drop anymore and 2 explosive Tesla bugs the gun and it's no longer a Tesla weapon at all.
---
Kind of shitty tbh, but guess it's the way of raider. I'm angry on that player's behalf. Glad you're probably too poor to buy anything at my shop if you have to resell the same junk, because you're banned from Flooptown
---
MSN jingle still haunts me, I swear.
---
Ps4 and no i dont. 
---
Havent gotten around to taking photos of it yet. But you inspired me so i shall post some later tonight.
---
But if you're using a VATS build you probably have very high AP regen. That extra AP points cost is meaningless.
---
I've moved my camp with the update, everyone seems to spawn in the exact same place, but I also had a friend test the spawn location and I built around it, with the foundation low enough there's no chance they get stuck.
---
I agree though, it would be nice if they fixed it, ideally they bring fast travel mats back, I'm sure whatever issue they had with them during the beta.. well, I hope by now they figured it out, or at least are paying attention to player feedback, as this is brought up plenty!
---
My original point was that I think it has less to do with players having some ill intent, and more to do with players not planning their build around vending- which isn't really the players fault at this point.
---
It also prevents you from being hit by other people now (they have changed the slap damage for a while now conceding to allow people who don't want pvp to completely opt out). So yes, finding loopholes is griefing since Bethesda has conceded that people should be allowed to play without worrying about pvp entirely (unless they want to defend a workshop).
---
Which is what makes it better than explosive. But I'm a sneaky sniper that uses auto rifles, heavily imto PvP. I got three bloodied ones, vatscrit, explosive, firerate. My favorite is vatscrit, the most dangerous is firerate, and the one I use for noobs is explosive.
---
I'm on ps4! Add me, I'd love to check out your maze!
---
vye_leviathan
---
The cowboy hat is a guaranteed location. It sits on the handle of the wheelchair in the bottom floor of the whitesprings clubhouse.
---
There's nothing meaningless about any AP reduction :)
---
Got mine last night at White Springs.  Was just starting to look for it.  In front of entrance is a red car and found the tourist on the hood.
---
the tadpole daily at dolly sods has given me firefly stingwing and bloodbug mounts so far, all I know for I haven't done the questline fir lying Lowe yet.
---
Explosive doesn’t do a whole lot for me as I’m a sneak rifle build and don’t use the Demolition Expert perk. I’d trade it for increased VATS accuracy and/or better criticals all day long, even faster fore rate for the times I go to Commando. A poison or burning effect could be pretty great if it had some teeth.
---
Must be a Thursday.  I can never get the hang of Thursdays.
---
Chill, my dude
---
Not in adventure mode. That's why they have a survival mode for people who want the more hardcore survival.
---
Laying Lowe for the animal heads. It starts by reading the poster in any train station. 
---
Stings and things is a daily you get in dolly sods after you start the pioneer scouts quest. You start that quest by reading a poster at a train station
---
You should start the sheepsquatch lying Lowe quest at any train station and you can also pick up a couple side quests there which will reward some taxidermy.
---
Have you repaired the camera
---
From what I’ve found they aren’t all released. Lying Lowe and the tadpole daily are the main ones. There is a quest that starts from reading a note on a table in front of the hotel in the middle of the mire that gives you the wendigo mount. Can’t recall the name of the hotel.
---
Thats fine. The issue is that I could sell the FE 50cal for 10k in a heartbeat. I would have 6 people post about wanting it and they would up bid my ask for the pleasure of being the weapons owner. In the end it would take me maybe an hour to finally sell it and it would probably sell for 15-20k, even though I asked for 10k.
---
When someone asks for a valuation on an item, they are not asking for your personal opinion of what you would pay. They are asking for a value based on what previous similar weapons actually sold for.
---
Yeah, no way to view profile in game, just send a friend request.. and any time I can I idle at my camp when I'm not actively playing. I've sold a absolute ton.
---
My biggest issue is the cap limit, I've given my friend 20k caps, had him help me get 10k to my alt, still over 16k now (that's what I try to stay at, as plenty is priced at 7500+).. unless I find someone actually selling something I want, I can't deal with all these caps.. I'm going to have to close down shop soon it's becoming such a problem.
---
Despite being few and far between the NPCs in this game are very high quality and have lots of flavour, like Biv as you said as well as Rose and Modus. Even Grafton Mayor has a decent VA who seems to have pulled it off well without much to work with. I didn't expect the Purveyor to have actual lines per se, but I expected *something*, whether it was an Overseer's holotape or a Free Staters diary mentioning their dealings with her. 
---
Even the Noname Protectrons have an abundance of memorable lines that fit their respective factions, since 76 they have overtaken Mr Handy's as my favourite robot.
---
There is also a quest for the wendigo mount but can't remember the name offhand. You start it by reading a note on a table outside of the southern belle motel
---
I managed to break heart of the swamp twice by hitting the heart with a bloodied powerfist. I guess it doesnt like taking 1300+ damage in one swing
---
Arcanian88
---
Personally i don't care about AP costs. I can fully regen my ap bar in ~4 seconds. Luckily i don't need the full AP bar to shoot something, just ~25% and hope that grim reaper procs, which it usually does.
---
I regen that 25% in ~1 second. 
---
If Grim reaper didn't proc i just have to wait 1 more second and try again. Not a big deal.
---
I would rather have the better accuracy instead of some slight ap cost reduction.
---
Lying Lowe has four base creatures, then a quest at Toxic Larry's, then the Dolly Sods daily rewards the boogs They are not all released and have actually been trickling out
---
I only call it a maze cause marsupians tend to jump right in and miss the obvious. But you could make it way more maze like. And i sent you a request.
---
Better luck next time, at least you didn’t get wood armour or a rolling pin like other people are getting.
---
I'm on PC, and I'm a similar solo melee player.  JudeAlexander.  Look me up; I'm your huckleberry.
---
Probably because you have already made up your mind and refuse to consider some of the other effects people have already named in this thread.
---
Man, I’d love to play on a Japanese server. Anyone playing in Japan want to shoot me a friend request on Xbox live? Flash2000
---
Brown eye.
---
People love fishing mini games. Hell, they also love driving and sports video games. Imagine that, they can also like games that mimic what they do irl. Amazing!
---
And obviously plenty of people want this cause this is not the first time it came up (I for one also would love this). Hell, there is a mod for it for skyrim at least. Just cause you don't want it doesn't mean others don't. Funny how us humans all like different things.
---
If you can PvP in adventure mode it’s clearly an intended feature and you shouldn’t complain if someone does it there
---
Explosive is still the most popular secondary effect. Explosive still holds plenty of value. In fact an explosive weapon with a horrible suppressors / nocturnal/ whatever shitty effect for primary, is still worth 1-2k caps.
---
They didn't concede that you could play without worrying about PVP entirely. Show us  where Bethedsa said this. At no point have they said you are without risk of PVP period.
---
And again, being anti-PVP doesn't give you the right to invade a player's space without their permission. You run the risk of being blown up by traps, as that is what they are for. 
---
And yet again, scamming is also permitted. You as the player run the risk of being blown up in another players base by the use of traps, which is again what said traps are for. Being lured there isn't griefing no matter how badly you want it to be. This feature is intended. The risk is on you.
---
The very thought of how bad the ai would perform makes me queazy but at least we can look at his lil metal arms
---
It's not called anti-resistance though, it's called anti-armor. I get that it could be open for interpretation, but that fact remains that in practice its already settled.
---
Only if I can select a Protectron instead.
---
I'm getting really conflicting information as to how 2-shot works. One guy says it isn't effected by anything but perk cards, you say it's half Pip-boy damage, someone said it only applies to base damage. It needs de-coupled from this stupid convoluted system and to just do an extra percentage of pip-boy damage, imo.
---
I already explained this once, but furious weapons either kill whatever you are shooting at before the effect matters, or you are in a boss fight where the 50% damage increase is laughed at by the enemy. You need a very small incremental damage increase per hit so that you can't break PVP with it having it's max damage buffed substantially, but you need the high damage to make it competitive with Bloodied, TSE, etc... When full auto weapons do such little damage per bullet, especially considering these boss enemies inevitably have high DR, making a bunch of low-damage shots even worse. It would make full-auto Furious weapons worth taking to a queen fight. They are already useless for PVP, and killing normal enemies who die before you get the benefit of the effect. Without making the damage modifier higher, they will always be unused.
---
There's no shame in running.
---
Cryptid Hunter Monthly, there's a few different ones around.
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Are you on xbox?
---
Murderous. 
---
You should add some pokey nails to that thing. You gotta aerate the pizza dough to prevent those huge bubbles.
---
Other than us flamer addicts that can't get enough fuel.
---
Trade you a suppressors pool cue for it...
---
As long as you're not dead inside.
---
OMG this is so much what I want. I'd like to have a few bots in the future, like having a hard to build protectron at camp, but way later.
---
Hopping back on to check now.
---
And it would be especially awesome if he could also slowly collect resources that are part of the camp (water, crops, etc.) This is an awesome idea! It would be like the Mr Handy on Fallout Shelter.
---
Or maybe even set tasks as you need from a terminal.
---
Choose your mode:
---
1. Resource Collection
---
2. Repair Camp
---
3. Defend Camp
---
I think a better statement is explosive, FFR and Vats Crit are the three clear winners amongst Secondary’s.  For me BE Gatling primed for farming and splash damage is great in Wes Tek.  Bloody FFR 50 on the queen.  Then on my sniper my AA Vats Crit Handmade is way better than explosive as I don’t have the points to commit to demo expert and with 30 luck you Crit every other shot
---
Power armor is different so they would have to make it work completely different but this would be nice.
---
Did you pick up the list the tourist has? That’s what starts it. Not the actual camera.
---
Lol, that’s the secret then I guess, I have yet to be brave enough for a bloodied build
---
Contracting dysentery would be much more immersive with this as well.
---
Sounds like a profit opportunity to me.
---
It's one of my favorite outfits in game and do I really want to get like 50 caps from it?
---
Could you pm me when its up, im looking for the robot too.
---
I feel this thread is going to bring such a fantastic idea into existence!
---
Yes i picked up everything
---
50k
---
Those boards are so much fun. I can't help but giggle when people walk on mine. I even have flamingos craning their necks to inspect the spikes. People don't notice. Bunch of Easter eggs in the middle of a stack of them?People don't notice. 
---
Used to be able to get free progress toward the bounty hunter challenge too when someone attacked the board for some misguided semblance of revenge and became wanted - I don't go out of my way to hunt, but I won't say no if it's on my doorstep!
---
that happened me first time also, when i found and looted him the second time it triggered
---
50 caps is 50 caps though.
---
For real though, I guess people gloss over the armor section and don't see that the outfit is readily available to buy in the enclave bunker.
---
There’s no pay to win items in the store now 🤔
---
Yeah, the idea is to do other things, as well as the main quest. Once it sends you into a region you're too low level to survive, they want you to do other, side quest type things, before continuing the main quest. They didn't intend you to complete the main quest without doing anything else in the meantime.
---
Agreed that is the only good third star... however you can get 3 chances a day with 2 star weapons compared to 1 3 star weapon a day
---
Thanks, i'll try and find him again
---
Contrary to popular belief, not everyone is endgame or even near it. I didn't join the enclave till I was level 55.
---
Also glow sights!
---
I believe this is still correct:
---
AntiArmor Rifle       -   Damage Increase 29%
---
\+ Perforating Mag  -  Damage Increase  56%
---
\+ Tank Killer 3          -  Damage Increase 98%

---
the daily quests are given by the scout leaders, you can acess them from your "my personal terminal" or whatever. then head to the markers and do them. however they dont drop a badge every single time its chance
---
I think 50% reduction is fair.
---
Farm super mutants for xp and caps.
---
Now that's a good thought.
---
I would have bought that from you.
---
Clear out the immediate locations by Vault 76 where there's tons of level one enemies, sell their guns to a vendor. It'll get you a good amount at a low level to keep you going in case of an emergency
---
Insult bot ... for visiting people
---
I’m just really not a fan of power armor honestly
---
Incredible idea but it could be abused and used to annoy people.
---
You could also to put a keypad outside for and a regular switch inside to let it open.
---
Yea I’ve never enjoyed it in any fallout.
---
I made it home finally after like an hour and a half.  
---
I made my way to Fort Defiance and inside were mostly molerats, I made my way to the third floor and got to a workbench. I did what I needed to do and off I went on home.  
---
Then my home was mysteriously beseiged by a large group of scorched which I dealt with, and all is happy. Thanks for the comments everyone.
---
10% down the sites is my choice along with FFR.
---
I'm not going to lie.. I didn't think about that lol
---
I have responded to those people that explosive is better because it works for every build though I have also admitted that some are better on certain builds.
---
You’re out of the loop
---
Shotgun damage was smashed, best bet, pick up a new build
---
"Best" method is just getting your daily 1400 from selling to vendors. An easy way is to server hop Blackwater mine. Kill all mole miners, loot everything, waddle over to the train station, and offload. Repeat as necessary. If you're business savvy you can find a resource you like to grind for, collect buttloads of it, and start your own shop
---
As someone who tries to continually do good by other players, give things, and help where I can... I hate every fiber of your being.
---
Yet... the composition and means of retelling this story, I found quite humorous, and so I kind of want to applaud you for that fact. 
---
Thus why I feel bad for liking your story lol
---
Give a look at an AA weapon. I roll an AA combat knife, and typically melt shit with little trouble.
---
Hell yeeeaaH
---
&gt;If i tell people to kill you, are u dead? LoL and now lets argue about nonsense.
---
This doesn't make a lick of sense. Telling people to harass a company is something that might result in action, and should be criticized. Telling people to kill someone else is far less likely to result in action, but still certainly should be criticized. 
---
This doesn't seem to be just a language barrier. I'm guessing you're also very young?
---
Oh I thought he had a specific route he takes if he spawns
---
You sell the legendaries to the Legendary machines outside of each station. They’ll give you scrip and you use those to purchase from the Purveyor.
---
Ahh. What do you recommend for someone who likes close quarters gunplay and uses power armor? Is it still going to take me 50 levels to reset my perks?
---
Are you trying to give your stuff straight to the purveyor. Or did you already exchange your weapons for scrip? The purveyor only accepts scrip.
---
Welcome to the club.
---
Thanks for the suggestion! I'll look into that! Is that anti armor?
---
[Codsworth liked that]
---
Dude it’s removed! Wtf!? I wanted to read this!!!!
---
&gt;Can one get a hardend reciever for a .44 ?
---
Yes. I got an AAE .44 yesterday and pimped it out to take it for a test drive before selling it. I've scrapped dozens of .44s, but never actually kept one to modify, so I was kind of shocked at the number of mods.
---
Looks ok, you don’t need weapon artisan active when your playing. Just throw it on when you repair the weapons. Since you have a few VATS cards you could try four leaf clover or grim reapers spring. In the end though, it’s what you have fun playing.
---
I’ve seen him all over the map personally so not really sure
---
Haha, nah it will just be a new Bethesdaism where he's running into a wall trying to repair something.
---
Just jumped while using chameleon, got knocked out of stealth.
---
Super mutants, and chems. I hate being addicted, so I sell all booze, and chems with addictive properties. Makes a pretty penny most days, and super mutants drop small amounts of caps, as well as decent ammo types, so it's pretty easy to stat stocked while killing them if you like 5.56 ammo.
---
i started to get jetpacks lately in the SBQ, x01,t45,t51... dunno why.... so sad bc i wasted a good amount of cap months ago to get them and friends also are getting jetpacks so the prices have been devalued between players u.u
---
Truth about what you have fun playing. That's true too about the weapon artisan as well thank you.
---
Berkley
---
How many jumpsuits did you get tho?
---
Hard disagree on that being new. You heard of me messenger? Something must’ve happened to his optic drives 😂
---
Berkley springs. Was an abandoned train station.
---
Well, part of the reason we have this problem is the weight and stash limits. If I could carry a weapon around for every situation, ok. I'll keep that Nocturnal Zealot's Primed weapon for queen fights. For a single encounter. At a certain time of day. IF I have the flux to make the expensive ammo it requires. OR I could have a single TSE or BE or AAE weapon that ALWAYS works well in every situation, uses cheap, plentiful ammo, and frees up huge amounts of stash and carry weight because I don't need to keep a weapon for every enemy type, time of day, whether I have addictions, whether the fight is long or short, whether the enemy has over or under 50% health...It's not feasible, and people (99% of them) realize that and don't do it. With my proposal, the effects better suit the type of weapon than situations, so depending on what you have (A rifle (Bolt action, ability to mount AP receivers or not), a semi-auto, a shotgun, or an automatic..) you have effects that are better suited to certain weapons and mods, not largely arbitrary and unpredictable game conditions. Which promotes weapon, build, and mod diversity as well.
---
ive gotten those plans and some other good ones from the three level 3 safes in the cemetary just north of lewisburg. open all 3 but dont take anything out, if there is nothing good in them you can server hop and try again until you remove something
---
Yes they stack, they stack multiplicatively, so that 36% and 50% is going to help you ignore 68% of their armor
---
THIS!
---
i saw the banner in my camp and there is a squirrel one... wonder if there are more ranks besides tadpole and possum or is the squirrel the rank for noobs?
---
This is my biggest gripe with the damn queen. That &amp; kids on Xbox posting “Queen on me” then you get in &amp; there’s 10 min left &amp; they haven’t even made her mutate yet.. don’t waste my time because you started a queen fight you’re too weak to complete. Shit gets to me, if I join a queen at this point in the games life I 100% expect to beat it unless the game shits itself &amp; it isn’t hard in any form. I honest to god think the imposter squatch fight is way harder lmao. IS will 3 shot you in power armor (me at least) &amp; the hundred eyebots &amp; gutsy’s will get you let me tell you
---
They become destructible when you enter pvp with the person, but only during that time.
---
Distant thunder can also drop T60 plans, and it does not bias towards plans you do not know as my multiple left legs no right will attest.
---
I'll try this, thanks
---
Sell armor and weapons and food items if you don't use them, just pick up hella shit and unload it to the vendor. I'll get like 600+ over encumbered after picking up everything off mole miners, scorched, and super mutants. Just takes a minute walking to the vendor but can easily make 1400 in an hour or so. I've also heard good things about running to all the known caps stash spawns and checking them
---
Call your bank. They might hqve put a hold on it for unfamiliar transaction
---
Happened to me just now
---
I just want the Scorchbeast Queen one :-/
---
Or u could just buy caps.
---
This isn't my playstyle but..  
---
How does it ruin other people's fun? And why are you so worried about what other players are doing during the battle?
---
Make sure you didn't inadvertently hide the quest in your pipboy
---
Not out yet... Waiting for a mothy boy myself
---
Yes!
---
I miss that weapon from new Vegas. That was one of the best items to have in the game against the Legion.
---
Legion leader: The Ceasar has marked you for death. Prepare yourself for battle.
---
Me: Nope *fires my Euclid's C Finder*
---
*Legion group gets vaporized*
---
I'm sorry for posting the idea but I'm trying my best. I just want to give some ideas out to see if we can make the game more fun.
---
Yeah, like I said it isn’t the end of the world man but it gets annoying having to reset your prices &amp; everything. Especially because the game wants me to charge 600 caps for every ultracite plan I have lmao
---
&gt; People were disappointed because they expected a different game
---
Bethesda: Game is like this,
---
Whiny players: I expected this.
---
&gt; never emphasized that it was to be an entirely different type of game.
---
But they did, repeatedly, from day one.
---
As soon as you spawn, straight ahead he should be leaning in the first car in the parking lot
---
OH SHIT, I forgot about Mothman I’d love that one too. How do you know when they’re “out?” I do the daily every day &amp; I’ve gotten bloodbug 3 times in a row lmao
---
I wish all the repeatable stuff was on the terminal.
---
I agree I personally like the idea of launching the nuke at her and taking her down but I wouldn't mind if a bunch of ppl came to tag her and wait.
---
No.  Please tell me what "a real AAA studio" means.
---
Ty
---
I know a few dataminers, kinda spoils the fun but we wouldn't have learned about the Wendigo without them
---
Why would you have a vending machine if you didn’t want people at your camp then!?
---
Like the others here said, Berkley Springs, out in The Mire. There's a new train station map marker on the train tracks there
---
Mistress of mysteries!
---
What the hell lmao

Me too! Reload for daaaaays
---
Kinda reminds of the dmv Mr handys:
---
Processing.... prooooocessing.... 5... 4.... 3
---
.. 2..... 1.... xD
---
Yep. It should be double base dmg but halved accuracy, atm it's only 25% but you lose 50% accuracy. TS as it is now is pretty meh.
---
Awesome write up, a lot of cool insights! 
---
I wanted to note that I'm pretty confident that Honey Beasts cannot drop the aid version of Royal Jelly. For those that don't know, there are 2 different versions of the item "Royal Jelly"; one is a junk item and one is an aid item. The aid version is the one used for cooking recipes, and I believe it can only be found in the world (the ones I know about are at Tanagra Town and Middle Mt. Cabins), while the junk version is the one dropped by Honey Beasts. 
---
This is just what I've personally observed, haven't ever gotten the aid one from Honey Beasts.
---
Tbh I might just dismantle the thing, I make enough just selling serums, if it happens again it's getting turned back into steel
---
Same! I'm also on ps4, zombie field medic build with a penchant for throwables!
---
I'll do you one better: rideable motorcycles
---
The map is huge and most of the roads are clear enough that a motorcycle should be able to drive on them for miles just fine. If we got to drive a car in 2, we should have no problem being able to drive a Lone Wanderer
---
There's no nocturnal+zealot weapon. Both of those are primary effects. 
---
Also you nearly got the point. 
---
TSE is a generalist weapon, decent in every scenario.
---
Troubleshooter E is a niche weapon, better than TSE but only in one very specific scenario.
---
You want to buff TSE. This will make Troubleshooter E completely useless. 
---
That's bad balancing.
---
Buffing a generalist weapon so it's outclassing niche weapons is the opposite of 
---
&gt;Which promotes weapon, build, and mod diversity as well.
---
If you want diversity you need lots of niche effects and those niche effects need to be stronger than the generalist ones.
---
As far as I know no video game studio is rated by S&amp;P, Moodys or Finch.  What do you mean by "AAA"?
---
They have stilts. People are just too lazy to use them.
---
I’m guaranteeing you there’s a way to do it. After a brief pause in the fight I trade with the guy, he had no stealth boys/phantom devices in his inventory when we went into the trade window then immediately proceeded to continue doing it.
---
High RoF weapons and power armor don't really work with VATS. Your power cores drain super fast. You're definitely going to need Batteries Included though.
---
Ooooohhhhh
---
I was offering team invites to 2 people today to build them Fusion reactors, but they logged off!

Faster fire rate isnt something to push off, you under value it, explosive isnt actually good for every playstyle, you over value that, the explosive legendary effect can get you killed sometimes

A shame the taking pictures of anything portion of the challenges is broken.

It's one handed, lightweight and it has a long blade

So therefore, they're not exactly wrong when they say it's a sword
---
If you want to stay camped on a lead node, maybe consider moving to  [this one](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=2195) just west of Dolly Sods. Lots of people will be going there every day for the daily mission, so you should have plenty of traffic.
---
I was gunna suggest swap psychopath for bloody mess but you're doing a lot of cats so I won't comment on anything vats related. I'd swap bear arms since you can get legendary weapons either 90% reduced weight. (I'd chose traveling pharm since stimpacks weigh 1lb each.) And guns reload  fast enough that maybe bandolier would be worth it more. Either way  still a good build!
---
I don't ever use explosive. I like having a gun I can shoot close range that doesn't require a perk card to prevent it from killing me..... I have a nice AA lever action with better vats crit, and 1 agi. It kills enemies just fine, and I don't have to worry about splash damage hitting me.
---
Thank you. Didn't know that so glad to find out before attempting this build.
---
Yes they do. Found 2 in generators just the other day. If none are there it was already looted by someone else.
---
I just got attacked by one on the golf course. Damn thing was hard to kill (since I rely on stealth and he reverse ninja-ed me on that front). Then he full ninja-ed me by vanishing on death! *Shakes fist*
---
It's happened to me once and you're right, it was aggravating.
---
&gt;So many unknown plans available! A lot of them for stupid prices, thoguh. :(
---
Eventually you run out of crap to spend money on, and those things become a great cap sink. I bought every single fancy camp item (including the dumb shit like the Whitesprings busts) from Studio 58 because I was approaching max caps and didn't want to shut down my vending machines.
---
I have different characters that are mostly faction themed, including one I do everything blue and yellow for vault tec.
---
Good topic.    
---
One quick point though, I'm not so sure hunting rifles are worse than levers, when levers have no AP magazine option and .50 receiver just got buffed.  Diminishing returns for AP means perforating is a reasonable substitute for AA.  I'd guess a 2 shot perforating .50 hunting rifle would at least equal but possibly out damage a hardened AA lever.  
---
Anyway, I'd prefer to see other effects outside of what you are talking about looked at first:
---
* Mutants (the one that gives + damage if you are mutated, not the one with bonus damage to supermutants) provide up to 30% if you have multiple mutations.  This would land it somewhere between 2 shot and maxed out furious, slightly better than instigating but only against bosses and players, and well short of bloodied for raw damage but with a similar drawback (as most mutations have some sort of negative effect).  
---
* \+10% while aiming should get buffed to +20% plus additional damage with ranks in the "sniper" perk.  the idea is to make it comparable to explosive making a wider range of worthwhile secondary effects.  Just as investing in demolitions expert is needed to maximize explosive, investing in sniper would max this out though perhaps it would come in at slightly less total damage as demolitions has 5 ranks and sniper only 3.  
---
Furious I agree should go higher than 50% but the whole argument of "why would you use this instead of bloodied" you answered yourself: you don't need to be low health to get the benefit of furious.    
---
So yeah I agree it should have a higher % damage max cap but 200%+is imo a bit much.  Having something that can match the output of bloodied for bosses like SBQ but without the risk of low health means furious would be the ideal boss weapon and imo good game design never has a clear obvious best option like that.
---
Lastly, every single "+30% vs enemy xyz" needs to be massively buffed.  Those guns are outclassed by so many options, making them double damage vs the intended enemy type would imo be fine especially given this would exclusively impact PvE.
---
I would want it just for kicks and costume appeal
---
I found it when fighting a scorch beast. Was looking up and backed into it. Dead. Neat place though.
---
get a serum recipe.  make serums to sell to vendors (400+ each) to get 1400 daily caps.  sell the serums for slightly less at your vending machine.
---
I also scrap EVERYthing, bulk it up and sell to vendors.
---
Enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave enclave

I'd honestly love for them to implement it the same way they did in Fallout Shelter. Pay atoms per Mr Handy and when they die you have to buy more. This really is a genius idea OP, for Bethesda and us.
---
I think it's hilarious. I only get it when I don't let the world properly load and run into golf course.
---
when first entering the game and you press x to sighn in then it takes u back to the PlayStation menu?
---
If its unequipped, it shows its base dmg, when equipped, itll show the correct dmg, based upon your health.
---
Better than the shovel and ear drum 3* I got lol
---
PA user here; heavy weapons compliment PA nicely with the "stabilized" perk that gives me 45% armor penetration and a nice boost to accuracy as long as you're using said PA.
---
This would be a fairly easy conversion in terms of perk cards as they're all strength cards already minus stabilized being an intelligence perk.
---
50 cal MG, minigun, and 5mm gatling gun are probably the most common weapon choices for this class; but with the drawback that the 50 MG and minigun are ammo hungry. But, with that stabilized perk, even a non-legendary variant of this weapons is only doing 5% less armor penetration than an anti-armor legendary version.
---
You clearly have never used a hazmat suit.  It's a giant pain in the ass re equipping all your armor afterwards. Especially if you are carrying around a bunch of armor drops.
---
By yard, you mean around the base of the tower, or the second floor shops?
---
Correction.....
---
Apparently I still have everything.
---
My X-01 armor had it's name swapped with Excavator and the T-60 set was overwritten to its default 'power armor chasis'
---
The only reason I still have it is for shits and giggles so
---
Yes! Those will make using iron sights more fun! And half ring sights as well!
---
Might wanna delete this post then lol before other people start commenting
---
&gt; If you are up in one of the corners of the map, you're going to rarely have a customer due to fast travel costs.
---
This is mostly true, but there are a few places it makes sense. I was on yesterday and there was a guy camped just outside the circle way up in the northeast where the scout robot sends you for bloatfly glands. When the option is FT'ing to Freddie's and hiking for a minute vs spending 1 more cap and lading in that guys house right next to my destination, it's an easy decision. 
---
Not only was his location a smart choice, but his machine was stocked with bloatfly glands, bluoodbug probiscus, and stingwing barbs for 10c each.
---
What kind of shovel / are you on Xbox
---
Fantastic! Thanks for the great suggestion!

Cleaning lake and the bugs? Maybe I'm just not lucky

If i have to hear " serve and protect!" every time i go to my camp....im gonna shoot him
---
Are laser weapons any good yet? I recall them being fairly underpowered.
---
Yes, it crashes from there to the PS4 menu
---
Literally nothing... probably camp decorations??
---
Some clothing and armor items are great to mass produce and sell, though finding the good plans is a bitch. Best way I've found is just to sell everything. Almost everything sells for a cap, just grab stacks of plates and stuff and turn them in. Or you could grow a ridiculous amount of Tato plants, they don't take up much space or camp budget.
---
Are you sure it’s powered properly? I figured out you can turn off and on the power and it’ll turn off and on the camp vendor icon on the map.
---
I know but it will randomly go back to base damage while it's equipped
---
Yeah it's annoying af
---
Lol!!! I will repent all transgressions if it will gain me access to anywhere named Flooptown. *and that was the day he started his Caps For Kids charity*
---
How much do tatos sell for
---
Idk just feels like some weapons break ridiculously fast. A few shots with my IE dragon or my tse laser and it's broken
---
Just let it out. You can explain the situation to your boss. He'll understand.
---
Do the campfire tales event every time it pops up. You can usually get 20+ bloodbug probiscus and 4-6 stingwing barbs every time. Occasionaly bloatflys span as well, but that seems to be rare.
---
Frankly, that event is a godsend for anything insect related. Brewers can stock up on ant meat for red ant lager, chemists can load up on tick blood and blood sacs for making stims, and if you're doing the "take pictures of bugs" part of the entomologist badge you can get photograph almost every single one in the span of 10 minutes.
---
That usually means that they’ve already triggered the event and the extractors have begun, so just enter the mine. Never ever been unable to join the event.
---
Id you're interested I can show you a way to start protest March 100% of the time
---
I traded it for scrip lol it was a bloodied with reduced weight and I can't remember the third thing
---
If that's the case it's not you it's them! Happen to me a bunch for awhile. I just kept signing in and it would eventually let me in. Tho it hasn't happened to me lately but I did experience it for awhile.

I listed a perfect pie for 10k as a joke and someone fucking bought it, so I had to go find another one and relist it for 20k.
---
There needs to be some baddies out there to balance all the good you're doing. Keep up the good fight and I'll keep up the schadenfreude.
---
Many thanks to ya for the tip to find him. If I am ever not overburdened and can fast travel again, I shall begin my search. Lol
---
How do you float on the ground?
---
We are not your enemy, friend.
---
Many of us would gladly help you in your time of need.
---
Our tastes are just...refined.
---
You could always join us... Let the hunger take you.
---
We don't bite... Friends, anyway~
---
Theres a time limit. The more ppl there are the tougher she is. So if people aren't pulling their weight time runs out and you get zero reward and wasted all your ammo.
---
For a rifle/sneak/sniper build give me crit damage or limb damage any day over explosive.
---
Damage or accuracy nerf, but not both. Pick one Bethesda. You nerfed it too hard. It already breaks twice as fast. That's just too many negatives for a 25% damage boost.
---
&gt;I'm selling them at 1/5 the recommended price and people have a "gotta catch em all" attitude with them.
---
I was sitting at 75/76 on the "learn cooking recipes" challenge for MONTHS until I finally found someone selling something I didn't have.
---
I've tried and it didn't trigger
---
Yeah I gotta give you this one. Nice thinking
---
Petition to bring back CODSWORTH
---
Shop til you drop... your junk. Then do it again!
---
I was disappointed that it had no actual use as well. This is a great idea! Gotta give it to ya
---
Yes. Happens. Bounces around for me too. But overall pleased with 600 damage on bloodied shot at 20%, Gatling plasma at 129.
---
I sell every magazine I find for 50c, and maps for 20-40 depending on the region. The shit sells faster than I can restock it.
---
You could like... submit a bug report directly to them... instead of giving them the opportunity to not see this...
---
What stats are you getting?
---
No the inventory is different for you but if u can have someone hold him while u jump out of the server and back in his inventory will change
---
There's a two drink minimum for every customer. When I finish drinking them, maybe I'll let you shop.
---
Was this survival or adventure mode?
---
No, their outfits are instanced to each player so 2 people will see different things for sale.
---
Beth should add this in game so we can legit watch people rage over it. But honestly who knows it could become the most expensive piece of shit in the game. Literally.
---
Enclave
---
Why the messenger events?  What am I missing here?
---
The witch hat, witch costume, skull mask (not the atomic shop type), and the skull costume all spawn at the costume shop in the north near the munitions factory. If you are very lucky, you can even find a space helmet there.
---
Oh okay. 
---
You cleared a lot of frustration hah! Thanks man.
---
Offline modes never gonna happen. Private servers would be pretty sweet though.
---
call me awful but this is funny and i'd laugh if i fell for this. almost as funny as "hey take this bounty off me"
---
Ah, that clarifies the issue a lot. Dang, that’d be worth a fix
---
Thanks for quick response!
---
I will have a little more patience looking then 😆
---
Shame it also has a chance of not even being legendary at all!
---
I just click on the even wherever it shows. Uranium fever has been popping up about 1/5 of the map north of blackwater mine. When I click the even icon itself it takes me right to it.
---
Thanks! I have gunsmith 5. I'll break down a few non-legendary versions for the plans.
---
I’ve always seen it pop shortly after Grafton Day finishes, but I’m interested
---
As long as it's still broken you can. They have to scrap it first any way to unlock the film and whatnot.
---
Second is probably an old screenshot pre patch
---
Love the downvotes. ❤️
---
lol a man of class
---
Interesting. The thread you link mentions the patent expired in 2015 though, so companies should be allowed to do this again?
---
Oof, good to know. Not surprised that the drop-bias mechanic isn’t universal, I’ve really only seen it with the SBQ
---
I’ve done it accidentally a bunch of times and have also reported the bug. It must be pretty well known as I was able to Google a solution to reverse it. It’s an easy exploit and people do abuse it in PvP, Bethesda really needs to fix this one.
---
Good catch. I can't think of any build  or combo of perks that would account for that.
---
The word gay isn't offensive
---
Oh good.  Another idiot asking for nerfs.
---
&gt; a boss fight where the 50% damage increase is laughed at by the enemy
---
Name me a single other legendary effect that gives you a consistent 50% bonus as long as you keep firing on a boss, without any debuffs to your character.
---
Thanks man, helped alot!!
---
I hear ya, I do feel like they started replacing the Ultracite mod plans at a higher rate recently, but alas I haven’t really timestamped my data
---
No, but the way in which it was used is.
---
You can easily sell that for a few thousand caps and put it toward a BE version. Might as well get the best possible loot!
---
Dear Bethesda, please release that Blue Tarp outfit already.
---
The longcoat is very rare, also quite pricey. It's worth picking up some of the other outfits too as people collect and pay reasonable caps for them. Especially any clean ones.
---
I sell bad one stars for about 100-200 and buy in the same range. Don’t know too much about better ones though
---
Uh... what kind of jumpsuit, because I’m pretty sure zero. Outfits seem to be incredibly rare drops, as the 1k events guy found. Forbidden Knowledge is basically the only event/quest I’ve seen drop outfits aside from stuff like Encryptid
---
Time to bone Appalachia
---
Had the same happen on Xbox I turned off my internet and turned it back on and it seemed to work
---
Yeah I bought the red &amp; green skiing outfit for 19 caps and sold it on. Thought as well he carried rare stuff in general
---
I'm on pc, ign is deworley. Should be on Saturday around 1000 east us time. I meant how to get the  protesters to show up after the event starts
---
You don’t get anything for killing it though. He doesn’t drop anything but an aluminum scrap! It’s hard to get him to spawn so it’s definitely better to do it with a team!
---
I got a two shot bonus when aiming weightless combat rifle, which I haven’t decided whether to keep but is pretty good really for a rifle build. And as many people have said it’s a gamble. A throw of the dice. Sorry you came up snake eyes, better luck next time.
---
Alright listen up. Get yourself the excavator power armor. Now change server, because if you join a server while wearing power armor you get 200 increase in carrying capacity instead of 100. Now move that sweet ass of yours to west tek and smash some supermutants. Now collect the modded Assault rifles (each will get you about 40 caps when you have hard bargain) Also what makes this strategy even better is that you can scrap the lasers and rifles to get steel and plastic, you get a lot of 556 ammo and caps and it also happens to be one of the best farming spots for legendary weapons.
---
Haha, you've just named the problems. The Dragon has very low durability and the Laser (assuming it's a rifle) also has very low durability when coupled with the Two Shot effect and the Beam Splitter modification.
---
Love Gatling plasma!!!
---
I showed up late to a fight with the queen and tried to do my best. Emptied my explosive shot gun to empty, then pulled out my .45 combat, emptied that then went through the rest of my guns and ammo...and we dropped her finally..right after the timer and when I went to get my goodies.....EMPTY. Not sure if it's cause I showed up late or what...but such a huge waste if ammo. So...I'll show up again on time the next one I'm sure but that was a kick in the pants.
---
And not everything from her even, I’ve been trying to get utracite mods and I get the same all the time, it’s better then the almost guaranteed explosive vents it used to be.
---
Okay...   as I said, we weren’t sure
---
I buy plans, personally. Unless it is my idea of the perfect three star, I’ll make my own weapons until RNGeezus blesses me with the weapon of my dreams at Murmrgh’s shop. Alternatively I will buy junk that is hard to come by like screws. Can never keep enough of those bastards on hand.
---
Had that happen way too many times. Be like cool a chance at a legendary then see its name pop up and be like yeah nope bye.
---
What mods/effects do you have?
---
There is only bivs and scouts dailies
---
If duping was harmless it wouldn’t cause server issues.
---
Wahh the purveyor doesn't cater to my minmax lust, wahh.
---
Still killed it, quest reward is better than the legendary!
---
Again, I’ve never done it or looked into it so idk what it does
---
Jumpsuits like BOS, the whitesprings jumpsuit, etc - Thought maybe you’d run into one from your extensive testing. They’re all linked to events like uranium fever, and some are linked to zone. Pretty rare but thought throughout your testing you would have found one. O:
---
It’s an issue no matter the reason.
---
Egghead mutation! Bubby! Welcome back into the fold old buddy! How are you? It's been a while. 
---
Sorry about all that stuff back there about you "only being useful for crafting and who needs that anyhow" business. I was hanging with the wrong crowd and they fed lies into my head and said nasty things about you.
---
I'm sorry for all of that. Really am. Let's hang out sometime.
---
Really? Because I've had most of a server fast travel to the station after I sent out messages of the vendor there and it never killed him. What did, however, was a guy discharging his two shot explosive pump action shotgun into the ground which also killed the shooter.
---
Thanks man I'll add that to my next video :-)
---
Oh okay. Haven’t played any other since the patch so i was curious as well
---
Thank you for your reply!
---
Yeah, I now, I know about the two primary effects, I was just illustrating a point, and the point (you can't carry a bunch of niche weapons) still stands.
---
And some of the current niche weapons are SO specific as to be practically useless. I think they need re-worked not to be so specific somehow. I didn't tackle the specifics of that, but just throwing shit at the wall here and seeing what sticks, let's say you re-worked them somewhat like this example: Troubleshooter's weapons do an additional 20% (arbitrary number subject to adjustment) electrical damage to EVERYTHING, as well as the extra damage to robots. That starts to close the viability gap. Or maybe Hunter's weapons doing additional poison damage to living targets as well as bonus damage to animals. Of course you would have to pull back the damage to specific enemies a bit for these weapons, but the increased all-round effectiveness would make up for it. And what happened to Cryo weapons? We only have the Cryolator now. A Cryo prefix that did some extra flat % cryo damage and slowed/froze enemies on a crit would be great! 
---
I'm just saying that you don't have to just make the 4 I mentioned be more on-par with each-other and stop there. The really bad stuff could easily be brought up to par as well, while still promoting weapon diversity.
---
I fuckin want that Blue Tarp Outfit right now
---
Me and my friends are constantly crashing while playing the game, its getting to the point where we are talking about leaving until its fixed.  We enjoy the game alot but its tough to have fun when at any moment the game crashes.
---
it's been 5 months and i'm still crafting, scrapping and using super duper to learn all the mods for the Radium Rifle! I want to rip my hair out! WHAT A PAIN!
---
The thing is you use 1 bullet. So it's more like you shoot 2 bullet tips with the same amount of power. Which makes the damage drop.
---
Now if it used 2 bullets to shoot 2 projectiles then 100% higher damage would make sense. As that would also balance the legendary effect compared to others.
---
Good thing Bethesda gave us the classic collection for free.
---
Holy moly!!!!  That’s one heck of a post. Bethesda should hire you as a consultant!!!!
---
Great job!!!   🤠
---
Yeah I have a few of those. I also have a few spare copies of the clock plans.
---
Speed Demon is your friend for this and lever rifles.
---
flat tire every 10 feet.
---
This!
---
I finally found the doctor mask with the smiley face and was very disappointed to see my beard vanish when I put it on. I was really looking forward to my whiskers sticking out at odd angles from beneath. :(
---
Yeah it kind of pisses me off. The dragon isn't really that great of a weapon, reload speed is just way too slow and now i've heard the reload glitch doesn't work anymore so please increase the durability. Admittedly the tse laser is OP but such low durability is a lame and annoying way to nerf a weapon. Just make it less effective but make it last longer.
---
There used to be a route map people were trying to compile, originally we thought he just wandered an ovalish path around the savage divide, but they had to keep increasing the route’s size.
---
He basically shows up wherever there’s a road, *usually*, had him walk right through the middle of the junkyard workshop in the ash heap once and I’ve seen him wander by flatwoods a few times
---
I've seen three by my camp in the mire in the last couple of weeks.
---
Yup.  Had him and his crew keel over in under a minute when someone FT’ed in.
---
BUTThesda also doesn't like pre-paid cards, from my experience.
---
I feel bad, yet this is hilarious because it didn't happen to me.
---
Found you on google but thanks for posting this. I had exactly the same question we all did
---
I found out quickly with the vendor machines that outfits sold well. So I’ve just been Halloween hunting like crazy hah
---
No Monster Mash? It’s my favorite event. Usually get multiple legendary spawns and it can award legendaries.
---
Yeah have one in my stash, ready for selling or scrapping.
---
The inconsistency of my damage output is unbearable because I'm a sniper build so when my rifle doesn't do 1400 damage to the head it's a little annoying
---
But it's called Damage Resistance in-game so if you're on a technicality of the name, it shouldn't work anywhere.
---
Better than dropping it like I did before lol. If I sell ammo, I do it for 1 cap minus shotgun ammo. I use shotgun ammo so have it posted for 2 caps. either i make a tiny bit of profit, or use them.
---
Cult of the Mothman OR Children of Atom
---
I have played since closed beta.
---
I have not launced a nuke. Not even once. I have not even gone into a silo.
---
I am having a blast.
---
Yowzah. Yeah, that's a good hit!
---
what?
---
Are you 5 years old? I'm suggesting a realistic option. Otherwise it will take, by the numbers, 1,500 years to get a full set of what you want.
---
It would be cool to set them as a camp vendor too.
---
BoS or Enclave.
---
Damn straight.
---
Also 2h melee is viable for strength
---
Still happening as of this evening. I always get this big happen when I have been using my Tesla Rifle on large groups for a while. Did Uranium Fever earlier and about 1/2 way through, my Tesla stopped dealing damage to the enemies, had to switch over to my 2h melee weapon to finish the event. Only relogging seems to "fix" the bug, until next time...
---
Funnily enough the only vendor bot outfit I've never found, the longshore outfit, I found at a vendor.
---
A man can dream...
---
You're a flawless human being!
---
Much as these homes are cool they really look out of place in the world and lore of Fallout tbh
---
Good, good.
---
Great one!!!! Good for you!!!
---
I might as well quit playing now. How much better can this get??
---
Yep. Early on it was luck of the draw how charged they were "in the wild." Now they are always 25 percent.
---
You can also do the same thing with sledgehammers
---
I chose the spot for lowered cap cost for fast travel. Plus I liked the bog. Either way I quit this game. This subreddit community is toxic, the game is in need of a lot of work. I might come back. But for now I'm done. You can look at my fo76 post history to see what I deal with just making some reasonable discussion. It's like talking to a swarm of 5 year olds.
---
Dailies should be on there for sure
---
\^This. This right here! (And I agree Furious needs buffed, but maybe not as much as I proposed originally.). 
---
And I just replied to another post with an idea for the "% vs. enemies" weapons. It was outside the scope of this post, and I even ended my original post with a disclaimer that they needed a big overhaul too, but I wasn't going to go into that, but people kept bringing it up and using them to say my proposals were invalid because buffing and changing the weapons I was talking about would invalidate everything else, but...well...People don't seem to fucking read...so...
---
Anyway:
---
"And some of the current niche weapons are SO specific as to be practically useless. I think they need re-worked not to be so specific somehow.

---
I put stuff i want to give up in random WS
---
WS containers.
---
I was trying to avoid locking anything to prevent hostilities. I think deleting the wire works best for me. Thanks though!
---
.50 certainly has drawbacks in real life. Bullets cost an arm and a leg and you really need three people to carry it. (obvs power armor takes care of this, but it should be something like an 80 lb weight hit). 
---
Point is they could have easily balanced it \*a little more realistically\* than they did. Which was making it super cheap to craft ammo and doing ballpark damage with rounds that are half the physical size. Also hits significantly harder from a standard size rifle than from an actual auto-fire heavy machine gun which makes zero sense.
---
All the complaints boil down to "I blew all my scrip on garbage, ermehgerd". It's obvious gambling with all of gamblings obvious drawbacks.
---
You can only pvp if you are not in pacifist mode. If you are in pacifist mode people can try to shoot you all they would like and nothing will happen.  Therefore pacifist was made a mode for people who don’t want to pvp and it is clearly designed to allow for people not to have to deal with it if they don’t want to. Murder houses are just finding loopholes to that. Just cause it is a loophole does not mean it was intended play.
---
Damn, taking offers? Hah
---
Anyone can feel free to add me my gamertag is Mindset One
---
I’ll add you!
---
I’m heavy weapon too. Love that they fixed the Gatling laser spin up. Wish that they would apply energy resistance penetration when it comes to Anti-Armor. Furious Gatling does well imo. Vampires is super useful for a heavy weapon build during Queen or Encryptid.
---
McRightClick spotted
---
It's sitting in my vending machine priced at 6969 😂
---
I'm never on passive mode when Im in either server. #RaiderLife, also apparently orbital strikes still work regardless in both servers. Gimmie your tag girl I'd love to play
---
Thats my point. Its GAMBLING. Not skill, not hard work. Gambling. This helps to make it a mix of both. You really didn't read anything other than the tldr
---
Protect and serve every 15 seconds lol
---
Oh I like Purveyor's humor style.
---
Same. I laughed my ass off
---
Really? Then why did bethesda change slap damage to no damage if you are in pacifist? Why did they only allow pvp against others and being marked for pvp if you are at the workshop, even changing it so you can only pvp some one in pacifist if they are in the workshop area? Just cause they didn’t outright say it doesn’t mean their actions don’t say it. The fact they changed pacifist to truly allow people to play pve only is them conceding that with the exception of if you want to defend a workshop (which I already mentioned).
---
I’m really confused with what they’re trying to do with the photos.  They give us clunky to use photomode with awesome frames for load screens first.  Now we have easy to use camera but just delete a bunch of shitty photos of dead animals everyday.  And we can’t edit our cool frames onto those easy to take pics?  And the small amount of saved photos on console?   I guess I should’ve had one memory for each of my first fifty levels.  The photos for load screens is one of my favorite things about this game so I’m not hating.   It just doesn’t seem very well thought out, but I guess that can be said about a lot of aspects in FO76.
---
How can that even be a drop? Like really Beth
---
I remember when I was playing WoW back in the day, when an epic mount cost 700g and it took a least a week or solid grinding to get said gold.
---
I was on my way home from work and looked in the back of my car.
---
Spotted a whole bunch of plastic bottles I hadn't recycled yet, and for a second, I thought "heeeey, if I hand these in I might just be able to get that epic mount today!"
---
Seems like a user issue
---
weird we can make infinite gas-powered generators but nobody can manage to get an old motorbike running.
---
Crafting legendaries has never been a part of any Fallout game without player side modification. Im sorry you are unable to cope with the present situation.
---
I spawned into a camp in the bog that was under attack by a legendary sentry bot. It was tearing up this persons camp and I killed it. Went back to the vending machines and checked the stock. Anyhow, me being the nice guy that I am, I proceeded to fix what I could and that's when I noticed his vending machines weren't powered up, yet I was still able to access them. Secondly, his camp did not show up on the map anymore but I was still able to access his vending machines. It makes me wonder if people can access the machines even if they aren't powered up.
---
I think it has to do more with timezones than countries. I'm usually playing with people in adjacent timezones and that's about it.
---
It happened to me today for the first time.
---
I let it time out. That's never been a problem in the past but today when I came back my Xbox was doing a system update.  
---
After the update I logged in again and all my vending machines were empty. :(
---
OP didn’t ask for a single nerf you idiot :)
---
But honestly, can someone come up with a reason as to why we can't have cars? I mean, the mechanics for the power armor should kinda works for that, right?
---
I would fricking love that I would never have to deal with scorched destroying my stuff
---
Last time she had gave me Stalker's Explosive Western Revolver. I'm sure it isn't random one lol.
---
If you can’t find anyone who is willing to sell you one, try the soft served ice cream shop up north in the forest. I got 4 hunter coats within 30 minutes
---
It varies. Plans I do 50 and 100 unless I know it's rare like jetpack or something. Recipes 25. Bulked junk is either 25 or 50. I don't think I've sold one legendary weapon, but my best is at like 2000. I'm probably just gonna deposit them for script because of stash space. Plans are where the caps are.
---
As in sbq?
---
Sneak attack perks do wonders
---
Just an annoyance that needs to be fixed. Not sure if it’s 100% server hopping but never happens when I’m on one server playing all day
---
Yes. I believe every time prime is nuked, the queen emerges.
---
You know there's a perk card?
---
I dunno, I think I did pretty well with this one:
---
https://youtu.be/fa9IEKyI7gA
---
Super duper?
---
It's not as horrible after renaming, but still terrible annoying.
---
Doesn't matter. 50% of shit damage from an automatic is still shit damage that gets armor-soaked. Queen: "Oh, so his minigun that does 30 damage per bullet is doing 60 now??? Cute. That tickles. Hope he can afford to make another 10k ammo for my next lead massage!". You are still either killing all lesser enemies before the damage increase kicks in, or you are doing nothing to a boss. That's why Furious needs a buff. Maybe not as much as I **tentatively** proposed, but it needs at MINIMUM a 100% max stack to make it worth taking to a boss fight, and a bit more to be the equal of the other choices.
---
51k
---
Pretty sure all the perk card does is pacify robots. It doesnt make it so you can send them to your camp.
---
We already do, and I am usually lucky enough to get 2 or 3 stingwing barbs (lots of people bringing teslas now make it harder to actually be sure we manage to kill even one or two stingwings the past couple of days though).  Even with her looting mutliple she just seems to have terrible luck with stingwing barbs (we always end up with more than enough bloodbug proboscis though...usually scap 10-20 a night easy =).  If we can find the bloatflies after they explode we usually get a couple of bloatfly glands too (tick block sacs too, though its easy enough to get those elsewhere if need be too =).  I just feel its her karmic price for getting 2 pristine pies from the vending machines in as many days while having rarely ever even tried and this being her first Fallout game (meanwhile I haven't gotten one through all my hours in all the games despite trying all the time =).
---
i kill it if its the event one if its a random encounter one i dont bother when it has zero stars.
---
I got a quadruple revolver. Oh mannnnnnn was it fun until you had to reload.
---
Figured this out last night, but didn't think to share. Have a thumb.
---
Sometimes I see ridiculous prices for items in a player's vending machine and this is what I wish I had for those moments.
---
Definitely. Let’s hope they acknowledge &amp; fix it soon!
---
Excellent science sir.
---
Might I suggest some events you have missed on your list.
---
Patrol Duty (always seems to give plans)
---
Census Violence
---
Swarm of Suiters
---
Well the cars have enough power to cause a small nuclear explosion, surely they have enough juice to get running again.
---
Lmfao fuck it, that keeps away those kids that keep murdering my Betsy!
---
Also there is a tip for you, if you see circle at left upper corner, it means that it bugged/lagged. So you need to reflesh your map until see the true location.
---
I had one too! It was the most fun weapon to use ever, finally be a movie cowboy with 5000 bullets. But when you ran out, that was that.
---
Well that sucks good luck with that.
---
Yeah, this 👍
---
They removed them from her loot pool, the added challenges that require you to craft a serum
---
I would tend to agree. However, I had not fired a shot at anyone. I was only being attacked cause I was #1 on the leaderboard.
---
I was so frustrated seeing everyone standing around either afk or not shooting, waiting for her to come back even though she's already across the map fighting g some guy in a hazmat who thinks hes Rambo. Smartest  thing I did was disable my mic cause I was raging by the end lol.
---
Hmmm.  You are correct. I owe OP an apology.
---
Yeah, under luck there’s a perk called super duper. Helps with giving a chance to duplicate the weapon(s) you are crafting. That’s how you learn mods for weapons quicker. 😊👍🏽
---
I’m not gonna lie, I hate pvp and have never done a versus event as a result. I legit forget they exist sometimes.
---
Hello there my Friend
---
wow a decent suggestion finally!
---
I just got to that step for I became death quest line and got nuclear keycard earlier, so I will be launching nuke there tonight.
---
Hell of an analysis! Nice work on putting this all together. The community for this game is what will continue to keep this game going and data like this is an awesome tool. Keep up the good work!
---
not bad
---
Holy shit, you just gave me infinite power. Thank you for your knowledge
---
I’d appreciate it more if the mr handy went and collected scrap too repair my camp. Or maybe just repaired it for free but very slowly. Prioritising defences probably so my camp doesn’t get smashed as much.
---
Also I’d like it if my turrets could handle themselves and not need my help too take out crap :/
---
And every one can agree, Bethesda relied on players using custom mods for their games. They aren't perfect. Why does every one assume they are? You obviously aren't even listening or reading data and just saying "you are being a baby, waaah" it's confusing why you are even posting to this if you don't add to the discussion.
---
It is still beat out by the hardened lever action though, which is sad. The trade-off for bolt action should be incredible power.
---
Damn, now I have to redesign mine too.
---
Look at the roadmap promotional pic showing all the DLCs for this year with three icons below each.... Under Wastelanders is the robot Workbench in an icon. I think we can legit get hyped but fuck if we know what it will all do let alone if we can build one ourselves.

Went to white Springs after finishing it and was only one row of buildings in when it went off again. I was the only one participating the second time. Even the mole miners phoned it in as only the legendaries showed the first two "rounds"  then I got two normal glowing before the last manager.
---
On PS4? Are doing the silo run solo?

Ghoul/Scorched Officers have replaced crickets with their chirping song.  Crickets, however, have moved on to sing the song of... MURDER.
---
So true. I’m glad I’m not the only one. There are so many things in this game that aren’t lore friendly or go with the post nuclear destruction theme at all. Perfect looking camp houses and such. The camera lol.

"Welcome back sir or maaaaaaaam."

I followed him once because I randomly decided to act like I was one of the caravan guards in FO4.
---
Could be the majority of the players now are under level 50s so they couldn't use it if they bought it and the other half of the population are high levels with all ready great weapons.  Idno I could be wrong. Just throwing it out there . The games been on special for $9 so seeing a lot more younger players
---
All good, I only commented because I was amazed this isn’t another nerf everything post.
---
Uranium fever was the best farming spot until they nerfed legendary spawns...early game level 40 mole liners could drop level 50 gear...I ran it about twenty times pre-nerf, i'd just gotten to the right level, and it was epic. This (in my mind, idiotic nerf) fucked the event. But it's still worth doing for two reasons, in my mind. Level 35 2-3 stars chip for the same value to the machine, and you get 30+ glowing meat and 400Ish steel per run, scrapping weapons.  I do it every couple days purely for food+steel for bullets.  I was also running a lot of gear I got in that event until level 120ish because I wasn't getting anything better...quite a bit of my early unyielding gear came from that event. Level 40 unyielding still gives you the same stat bonuses.   
---
Pickaxe Pilsner recipe was changed...quite a while ago, honestly. It's glowing mushrooms, not strangler blooms.
---
Wait so if i tame a cat and put the camp module inside the cat will go inside too?
---
They should have just made it the .30 cal m1919, at least that way it would make sense and it basically looked the exact same as the .50
---
Gives you a chance to duplicate **anything** you craft: food, chems, armor, ammo... The only thing it doesn't duplicate is bulking junk. 
---
It's a level 50 perk and it makes things a lot easier.
---
Yeah. I'm starting to think that although I'm not sure how.
---
Well, you can only load so much powder in the casing, or energy in the capacitors.  Even with hot-loaded ammo, the two projectiles wouldn't have the same muzzle velocity as a single projectile.
---
Intelligence +1

Mine would have NukaWorld programming and would say “Howwwdeee Partnerrr”
---
On my main ported only but I haven't done much leveling on the character I was planning on using this build on.
---
I mean every road would need to be reworked to accommodate cars (e.g not have colossal chunks missing.) The servers barely stutter along as it is never mind if everyone had cars too. I'd like to see it in the future but it'll just be another thing for people to complain about.
---
You people are really selling this perk, it’s gonna be the first thing I grind for when I get home
---
CAMP building is my end game at the moment.
---
I spend most my time scouring the wastelands for places Bethesda missed with their building restrictions.
---
Currently building on top of Hornwright HQ:

I just scrap the wire that connects to it whenever I want to close shop. Probably the quickest and safest way to do it.
---
They should have just named it the m1919, and used the .30 caliber, it would make more sense and have almost the exact same stats as it has now
---
Yes PS4. No I got other people I run with. For sure 1 other person is helping tonight. Should be around 9 EST.
---
The finest weapons and armor.
---
Then that sounds broken. Seems much more realistic that a "hacked" robot could be sent to do your bidding compared taming an animal in mere seconds when that actually takes generations.
---
They need to fix that.
---
I've honestly never tried. I don't even have 1* of that card b/c I have no interest in a robot annoying me at my camp. I do however need to go get me a new sloth.
---
Feel free to add me. Jeditrex
---
Sorry for the dumb question but what does min maxing mean?
---
I mean, it would make sense to retrofit them with 4x4, raise them up etc.
---
Toilet buff:  increased carry weight
---
Captainoob did a video of a gamma gun v the WS horde. It’s pretty funny and short.
---
Online now!
---
I don’t think it ruins the fun. I read all the datamined stuff especially to see all the atomic shop items that are in the content updates! I can understand why some people would have their experience ruined by it so thank god the notable dataminers spoiler tag their posts!
---
I saw somewhere that max damage you can deal to another player is 200HP. 
---
I love PvP, but in this game... it just doesn't work.
---
Ok. I don’t have a mic but maybe I can help soften the opposition. Thanks. I’ll send request.
---
I get you, just think it betrays the core of a fallout game (cars not bicycles)
---
Justice aint just gonna dispense itself
---
I accidentally sold my to a vendor bot.  I want it back too..
---
I've been selling the plans for witch costume and skeleton costume they are some of my hottest items
---
I have sold a lot of legendary weapons in my vendor shop. All one *. I do, however, cap my prices on one * legendaries at a hundred. I made some very rare exceptions for some quality items, like an anti-armor handmade I posted for around 200 caps. Otherwise, it's a hundred caps. With few exceptions. With that, I've sold a lot of legendary weapons and some legendary armor, also all one-star, which typically top out at 60 caps. I am on PC BTW. IGN: pokerplayr.
---
Lmfao yeah I need to learn a thing from you I got a little bit toxic on the mic last time that happened just gets tiring if I wanted to help low levels beat the queen I’d make a post saying so. Sometimes I’m just trying to get it done because I’m low on repair kits :-/
---
It's basically just trying to maximize your build for perfection, it's a weird term I know.
---
For some reason my servers seem to be full of players over level 100 so that might be the problem ;) I feel like I have a lot of cool stuff for people between level 40 and 80. Let’s wait and see what will happen!
---
I usually do 1:1 for all ballistic and 1:2 for all energy ammo 1: 3 for explosive but if I have a lot and I mean 1000's I try to do bulk prices on here
---
Still need help?
---
They will simply give an automated response in how they can't do that since it's a third party.
---
There was a post or comment I read recently that said the max damage you can do on a single shot in PvP is 190.
---
And you're correct about the crit damage. The legendary effect and Better Criticals does not stack. If you have both you only get the 50% from the legendary effect. Bethesda confirmed that at some point.
---
I have a level 50 two shot .50 cal. Is that any good or should I sell it?  Just curious.
---
You're a freaking OCD genius! Don't know if it will affect my gameplay, but sure is fascinating.
---
Your not cool unless you dupe, everyone does it.
---
Not really it's horribly broken and creates tiers of players who have a wide range of gear and stats that make it impossible to tune the game mehanics. Which leads to unbalance fights, loot drops and wide array of game mechanisms that just don't work.
---
The reason the game was so horrible in the beginning was because of duping
---
Most major MMOs limit the amount of skills And gear available to control the variables that go into fine tuning all the background algorithms and such. Just look into WoWs raid balancing process.
---
If you really start to min max games you can actually find equations used to calculate various aspects of most games. Now imagine something with infinite variables versus a controlled environment.
---
Yes. It happened to me when I was refilling my vending machine with items. First, I was disconnected. Then, after restarting the game, the game crashed. After I reloaded it again, that's when I discovered that all of the items in my vending machine had been returned for my stash. This was two days ago.
---
Drop a deuce, get 20 carry weight for 24 hours. Only way to use toilet is to have toilet paper.
---
I found the coat one time, out of the many, many, many times I have had him spawn. It was 920 caps without the hard bargain card. 
---
Seems like he always has the 2 clock plans, then a couple of randomized clothing pieces (union uniform, ski outfit, hats, space suit etc.). 
---
For me, he only ever has two clothing items at a time.
---
It's like 85 caps in the commanders armory
---
Thanks for reaching out. Glad I could help.
---
That's very possible, I'll have to check that. I'm glad players can't be one shot but if I hit someone in the head with a Dragon, they should be feeling the pain.
---
That's is how it is intended. They always work but only show on the map when powered. There is no way to "turn off" sales as far I know.
---
Look forward to the day we all agree to retire this meme.
---
Finally a true god roll.
---
I'll defently come visit you when I get to level 40.
---
Enclave.
---
That’s all most ammo could possibly go for. Really it should go for like... 3-10 bullets per cap if you base it on Reddit prices (I was shocked Bethesda didn’t), and then only a few ammo types could go for more than 1, 
---
because you also need to consider the weight factor. 
---
I’ve seen people selling mini nukes for more than 20 caps a piece, it’s not worth it for six lbs weight for a weirdly weapon. Even if it’s that powerful.
---
Being able to essentially kill every robot in the game without firing a broken doesnt sound broken at all to me. Honestly, being able to send creatures to your camp seems more like a niche thing rather than really being useful.
---
Yeah anything marine, combat or robot armor related seems to sell pretty well. All the other stuff Im probably just gonna drop at flatwoods.
---
That's no problem. We usually do use mics anyways.
---
Could be the opposite, maybe the lower prices have players worried that they’re duped items? Honestly I’m still trying to figure out appropriate pricing on legendaries.
