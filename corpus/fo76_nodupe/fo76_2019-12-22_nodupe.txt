It‚Äôs like an acorn glued between your legs

---
---
I get it. I‚Äôm just trying to point out that pvp at any time always gets flake. Instead of turning something you find toxic into more toxicity you could post a PSA to help new players counter it. Closing your santatrons in a building with all walls while you are away keeps anyone from accessing it. Or you could drop extras you have for people or even help defend workshops against them. Me and a buddy went 2v3 last night doing that for 45 minutes, we won and it was very fun üò¨.
---
there is a script injection to get into private worlds on command apparently
---
So the chances are actually higher via Handmade Holiday Gifts?!
---
Okay then yes exactly. People are to lazy to go to a few locations and instead just attack other players‚Äô camps it‚Äôs not right. I hate how the drive do something and a day later everyone‚Äôs using it in the wrong greedy selfish ways.
---
Yep
---
Even if you only do it for a month to generate as much junk as possible to stash in your scrapbox
---
Put them in your vendor for 25k caps. They wont accidentally get scrapped during crafting that way.
---
Good to know! Thank you! Excuse me while I go broke, buying wrapping paper! üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
If you're on PC I gotchu
---
These guys need to be taken to court. Wouldn‚Äôt be the first time a big publisher has done that and it should be an option that is considered seriously.
---
Dang!!!! I use XB1! Thank you so much for the offer, anyway!!! ü§ó
---
Thank god I play on xbox and dont have to depend on Bethesda to keep the hackers at bay
---
I asked for it a while ago and got downvoted to shit for it.
---

---
Though, in this case, I highly doubt it's me that's giving you the dejavu.
---
Yeah. You can play in that laptop, but it will not look pretty. In this video the author speaks about that and he explains how setup the game in order to have a decent fps.
---
https://youtu.be/5KG0tRXpx5Q
---
What's your max hp then? 110 is the damage cap. No one, no matter their level or general damage output, can do more than 110 damage in one shot or hit.
---
You are excused! I‚Äôve spent easily 50k caps on wrapping paper in the last few days. Actually it was nice having something worthwhile to spend caps on.
---
Ohhh. I am on Xbox! What kinda deal are we talking?! ü§î I only have about 3k caps at the moment.
---
Well LOL for the incel statement
---
Obviously in a snow environment that would work, but we don't seem to have that.
---
Imagine thinking there are no female hackers.
---
Losers cut across gender.
---
How do you learn them and drop them back on the ground unless you already had duplicates?
---
[removed]
---
Lmao! I only had 10k+ when they released the wrapping paper... I went broke and have come up to 3k in caps, so far! üòÇ But I agree! I like this event, regardless of my lack of icicle plans and being broke! ü§£ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I look at it like the hackers are the good guys and bethesda are the bad guys. Someone needs to force bethesda to make a good game and I see the hackers are forcing them to redesign and improve.
---
Lucky!! I spent at least 10k on wrapping paper for the large gifts and didn't get anything worthy! üò≠ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
There is no fun in that. But there is fun to break their trying and watch them cry as they get banned.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There is no "evil" system, only kids who think Bethesda owns them something.
---
This is the best current answer. 
---
Although I price them at around 999... if someone wants it that bad, I‚Äôll just go quick farm some more, lol.
---
Hackers  ruin goddamn everything. I love the Battlefield franchise for example but there's always that fucking coward cheating in a lobby in the older games, and no, i don't care about "just play console" that's a goddamn dumb excuse. Some shady people just shouldn't have access to the internet. Hacking in online video games needs to be made illegal.
---
So if you have any flux on you if you die it just disappears? Last I checked if you die you drop but it doesn't disappear completely. Had other deaths where I drop my junk including flux but stable flux not in the bag or inventory after death that has occurred during a recent Queen fight.
---
I found it!thank you!when did they put that feature on?
---
The annoying part of that is they could probably just add whatever item they want to their inventory, the only reason that would be used is to ruin the game for others. There are some very rare items that losing would be a travesty.
---
rare masks.
---
strangler Armor.
---
Vault steel
---
Holiday gifts (I like to build a large supply over a day and open all in one go, imagine losing all of them at once)
---
Rare plans from said gifts
---
Event exclusive (do you know how long I Grinded for that pirate outfit!)
---
Legacy legendarys!
---
If it works in nuclear winter it would be an absolute nightmare, it was difficult enough reporting hacks with a recording of them flying around, what good is a video of a well equipped player killing someone with no guns? Just looks like someone who hid the entire game for exp farming.
---
Nuclear winter is going to be an impossible grind with that‚Äôs no fun
---
Adventure mode public worlds needs to be quarantined, private servers may be the only safe bet.
---
It‚Äôs almost Christmas, the event is still live. they are about to leave for their holiday, if they can‚Äôt fix this problem before it happens. The only safe bet would be to deactivate public servers and force everyone to use private ones
---
Thank you for the help!I did not even think to look there
---
Any traps that you place on the ground and it walks over it. I have a low level deathclaw and it died after walking across the spike boards I had around my camp.
---
I keep pacifist on at all times during public events just for that reason.
---
Oh yeah got you
---
me neither, cursed a lot before I realized it. Its buggy as shit, team only does NOT work at all right now :-(
---
Unfortunately mods are either "plan only" or "scrap to unlock". Not both. The vast majority will need to be unlocked by scrapping lever guns.
---
eVeRY OnlInE mUltIplAYEr gAmE hAs hAckErs
---
But not every game does fuck all to prevent and punish hackers. Fuck Bethesda.
---
How do you team with someone if they are not in your world?do you both have to be in a lobby?
---
This just happened to me on PS4. It seems the problem has to do with the event completing while you are still in the countdown to re-spawn. You‚Äôre supposed to be able to re-spawn into the event, but the event no longer exists for you to be able to. Only option is to restart the game.
---
Bethesda gets a lot of nonsense BS criticism but, if this is all true, this is indeed incompetence. They need to sort it TF out and quickly.
---
Ban them FFS and get a better cheat detection.
---
please dont confuse exploits with hacks. Fortnite and GTA were hacked. IE people wrote code to alter the very nature of the game. 
---
Minecraft is exploited. the client is 100% trusted, so all you are doing is exploiting that trust with no real code, just functions.  (ie things supported by the game engine, not in spite of them). 
---
almost all online games face various levels of exploitation. because the client is trusted with data for the sake of gameplay performance.  These are things like showing enemies on the map, seeing through walls, being able to wall hack, etc. 
---
almost no games have been hacked. hacking involves editing the server side behavior. that did happen to GTA and Fortnite.
---
Imagine being triggered over a reddit comment.
---
Glassed Cavern ALWAYS has at least one for me!
---
Waiting for wastelanders. Haven't even seen a backpack or a camera yet. I tried the new vault dungeon, but failed miserably as I only play solo.
---
Enjoy :-)
---
Those saying lock the files it will never happen. Want to know why, Bethesda relies too much on the modding community to fix their stuff, and give replay-ability to their games. True Story.  
---
Will the hacks and cheats ever stop? No, they will not. Once modding goes live and or someone finishes the Fallout 76 Script Extender. Yes there are some working on it and some who have finished it but wont release it because of the craziness it would cause or use it for their own purposes. The engine is just too open, it was also a hack and slash job to get online just like Ultima Online was very similar, only difference this engine is a lot more open do do whatever you want to it. They are already relying on modders now to cover for many of their short comings. Especially Bethesda Austin a mobile studio gone semi AAA with an engine they do not know much about. They don't have the experience, but then again nor does Bethesda main as they have laid most of their problems at the Modders feet.  
---
Those screaming LOCK THE FILES!! When will you ever learn. It was that mentality that changed the game with the crying to the community manager here on Reddit, weapons and fun being eliminated, a survival game no longer being a survival game,  becoming a walking/drink/eat/minecraft waling simulator, that opened up survival mode that got nerfed because of the same responses, then no one played it because of those crying got Bethesda to change it.   
---
So Bethesda has already been making the modding community pissed so we have those people in that corner, now we have raiders that hate you that are crying with every inch of their existence for screwing up every aspect that was fun in the game, then you got the players that got suspended/banned that didn't even dupe or exploit and the system caught them moving a ton of plans they hoarded. Some lost their characters. So now they are mad at not just Bethesda but you as well. There are now three groups of people annoyed at Bethesda and well those who cry.   
---
Welcome to Actions meet consequences. Banning will do no good they will just use burner accounts, cheap keys"also you contributed to this with Bethesda as the company panics to get people to buy their game", and fake their IP.   
---
Actions meet consequences people, from just those who want to see the world burn, to the modders, players of different types be it the ones who got banned wrongly with many here mocking them  to those who got sick of the changes many crying brought about.  Honestly you have none to blame but yourself same goes for Bethesda. Play stupid games win stupid prizes.  I will just grab my popcorn and enjoy the show.
---
I was trying so hard to find them and then I got three of them in a row.
---
Last patch, team doesn‚Äôt work at all, so even if you team on on main menu and go it will kick your friend unless you change that setting at all friends.
---
Good thing I have the lever gun plan known already. I don‚Äôt mind either way, I just like to have plans known, as many as I can tbh
---
So this is pc only?
---
It literally said ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù.
---
I tried to team with someone in my friend list, invited to team, started a 1st server. After 1 minute my friend was auto kicked and got a message saying that he was no longer friend with the "host", despite being BOTH friends AND on a team at the time.
---
yes, you can invite to team if both players are in the lobby, once the team is made the top Play button is changed to "Play with team" instead, and when one player jumps into a 1st server or regular one everyone in the team auto joins.
---
didn't read any of that, but hey, at least you tried. üòé
---
Yes.
---
This is the reason I stopped playing. I gave it a chance after it went on sell but I couldn't play more than an hour without it blue-screening. Which is a real shame, despite my cautious optimism going in I was actually having fun. That was in August.
---
Well thank god. Wish all those pc players luck.
---
SO lucky!!! I was just now, able to trade for the plans!!!! I still haven't found any, myself though!
---
Thanks so much!!!!
---
There's also about 3-4 Starlight Berries right near Black Mountain Ordinance, on the road closest to it running up the hill.
---
There are at least 6 Starlight Creepers in the area of the block house at the Black Mountain Ordinance.  Maybe 10 more north of gauley mine on either side of tracks all the way up around curve.
---
There are tons of firecracker north around to west of Arktos.
---
I got the free santatron, it brought me a large gift and that‚Äôs how I got my icicle lights
---
Definitely that.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to get them as well with no luck. Also need the Mothman plans on my alt, but could only get them on my main lol.
---
Some are actually pretty decent
---
I bought plans to craft radsuit and iv never been able to find it in the crafting table anyone have this problem?
---
I haven't even found the mothman plans, either! You're not alone!
---
dont confuse exploits, which is use of data already presented to the client to make things run smoothly, with hacking, which is the attack of the secure code running on the server side. 
---
making the minimap show enemies is not a hack. its an exploit. your client is already told where enemies are. the exploit is just to paint the map with them. 
---
a hack would be to take a gun that normally does 1 point of damage, and instead making it cause 1000 points of damage, but only in a game that did not trust the client with item data. FO76 is essentially a single player game client, that they extended to multiplayer, but they are not doing the work server side, so your client is simply trusted to do too much... like tell the server how much damage your weapon does.
---
Nice!!! My santatron has found gifts also, but no luck!
---
The Hazmat suit? It was a bug and was fixed recently. Can you try a workbench again?
---
No problem. I think it can fit in a 1x1 but I had trouble dropping it. Easy counters if your not big in PvP is you can give all your caps to a friend and just kinda ‚ÄúNormandy‚Äù them lol. They will spend waaay more caps on stealth boys, ammo, chems thinking you are seriously fighting then they could ever make off you. Also nuka Grenada or other radiation/energy explosives.
---
aimbots arent hacks, they are exploits. they are only manipulating what the client is trusted with.
---
Anti armor Tesla rifle and Bloodied 50 cal are hest out
---
What platform are you on?
---
We had the issue on Xbox one where I would be force kicked after about a minute with an error claiming that I was t friends with the server host even with me being friends with all players on the private server, I force closed the game and then the private server host invited me back in and then it started working fine.
---
Ban would do nothing. You can buy cd keys for like $3.
---
You can sell individual duped items for much more.
---
They need to remove the mechanism that allows the hack to work in the first place.
---
That may not fix the issue because this happened to me even with the server being set to all friends
---
just allow reforging as one of the modify options. IE if i have a level 5 10mm gun and im able to craft a level 50 10mm gun, allow me the option to modify the item level to 50 (or frankly, to whatever steps the game supports for that item)
---
Lock your santatron ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
The furious gatling is pretty nice as well.
---
I use remote play on my iPad when I travel for work. You can link up a DualShock controller too. As long as you have a good WiFi connection it‚Äôs pretty good.
---
I think that‚Äôs a great idea. And if they did like the community food banks on street corners near churches and libraries would also be a nice addition. The kind that looks like a glass windowed bird house/book shelf thing. 
---
Lots of new players coming into the game, or everyone is started a new build from 0 here lately. 
---
God I love killing Santa scorched. 
---
Merry Christmas!

I felt the same way about the dang plasma grenade, found one for 5k which is probably too much, but caps are not an issue for me.  Went home check collectron   and find a present.  Opened it boom freaking Plasma grenade.
---
I don‚Äôt really care. That‚Äôs the point. It doesn‚Äôt matter how people spend their time and money. You act like you‚Äôre some kind of video game gatekeeper where no ones allowed to like games that you don‚Äôt approve of. 
---
This is what I meant earlier by it‚Äôs weird. You‚Äôre literally spending your free time making fun of people on a subreddit that YOU decided to join! We don‚Äôt need people going around shaming people for having different opinions than them. Move to China ya damn commie!!
---
Didn't think of that, I'll give it a go!
---
I jump on every now an then also playing solo character is only level 39 but pretty close to 40. Im just having a hard time getting all the material for the power armour mission. Lol I'll find it before wastelanders comes out though lol
---
Oof! I'm gonna have to check everything santatron finds!!!! I have to say: I DID get plasma grenade plans just yesterday!
---
they want you to use quality of life cards and to buy basic repair kits. that was my solution to these issues.
---
Lol it is locked he was lock picking  everyone‚Äôs
---
Oof
---
 Can we just abandon ship?
---
High powered laser turrets placed strategically aimed at the santatron loot box, that way once he‚Äôs picked the locked he‚Äôs hit with napalm fury.
---
&gt; PC is very easy to secure
---
No.  It isn't.  Bethesda are bad at it but "very easy" is just not true.
---
There's a bunch of PA stands scattered out in Watoga with different versions, some of the stands are up on roofs. There's one stand in a locked room on the 1st floor of the Municipal Building. 
---
PSA: If you're at the Municipal Building, go up and start the quest "Mayor For A Day" it will greatly diminish the hassle of being murdered by robots in Watoga after you complete it.
---
So....does it mean that they can steal your pipboy and break your character forever?
---
How can this be possible? It is like if this game is client side :|
---
Yea I thought I had it fix thanks to help of others in here but someone just got booted again,I will try to invite them again and see if that helps
---
I know something of this magnitude will get fixed faster, but all I can think about is 1 year and 16 patches to make a fix that breaks things even worse. I‚Äôm genuinely scared for what their fix will do. If any of this has to deal with imbedded code then I can‚Äôt help but expect the gameplay to get fucked up
---
Bloodied weapons are some of the strongest in game, its a high risk high reward build though because you usually want to stay below 20% health. Not the greatest for PVP, but insanely good for PVE.
---
Make sure to tell them to force close their game and then you send them the game invite before they open the game back up.
---
Just did this quest and there were so many enemies at once, I thought there had to be a glitch.
---
I found a better choice, thanks though
---
Quick question, if your source can clarify. What happens after that person leaves the server or reloads? Do they have the pip-boy again or is it gone until Bethesda scrapes together a fix?
---
Can this happen on PS 4?
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
I personally used one rank for 20% extra for a long time.  It bumps the explosive damage on a b/e Fixer from the 80‚Äôs into upper 90‚Äôs on a direct hit.  I recently flipped that one INT point into Luck for a rank of Grim Reapers Sprint.  An extra 12-15 damage is a drop in the bucket when you‚Äôre dealing damage in the upper 100s anyways.  The chance of refilling all AP on a kill is more valuable to me.
---
You are arguing semantics...‚Äùit‚Äôs not stealing if they have given me access (whether unwittingly or not) to it.‚Äù  The fact is using the game other then by what‚Äôs been offered by the author is a hack. If they then chose to allow you to continue to play that‚Äôs their discretion but you also have no rights if you get banned for using something that wasn‚Äôt given open access to. It‚Äôs funny how people use shades of the truth to justify their actions.
---
Thought it was strange me always being thirsty recently.  I haven't noticed the food because I have the Cannibal perk so always spamming it when I kill stuff even if I'm full already, it's pretty much in my rotation lol
---
Funnily, I'm waiting for YongYea and JuiceHead to talk about this, which meant that this hit mainstream news.
---
Don‚Äôt hold your breathe lol
---
You too? This just happened to me too, did the Grinch song play when he was doing it?
---
I leave it unlocked.  Take what you want.  I should leave a big fucking sign?  Sorry, I don't have the budget.
---
All this fake "whatabout the newbs" crap is just more boring outrage seeking.
---
Lol unfortunately only in my mind
---
Gat plasma. Paired with a set of strangler power armor and the right mods and perks, youll be smoking anything that come your way, including those stealthboy tesla punks.
---
Sounds like somebody‚Äôs been reusing passwords.
---
Ooof that‚Äôs a bit much considering I‚Äôm already at my budget :/
---
and what about the honey beast? 
---
and is there any other way for the ants and did you do it solo or with a friend?
---
So your mum has a padlock on the fridge?  Cool.
---
Ah man I can't wait to lose all my stuff cuz someone thought Bethesda should be taught a lesson
---
Budget limits suck, I‚Äôm sitting there as well, but I have 4 mid level turrets and some mounted stuff that I could scrap
---
SFE fixes the Strangler PA?  Can you explain?
---
This is true, when you would equip say the mothman or 3D glasses it would unequip hats and bandanas, it was fixed the following update
---
One of my characters carries a grenade launcher as his main weapon. The other 3 characters collect ammo and dump it into him, because 40mm grenades are scarce. I buy them at 1-5 caps each. 
---
You rule during events. Every perk goes into the build, but it is fun and satisfying.
---
I jumped into a world and opened map to see a high level wanted near the Whitespring station at someones camp. There were some other high levels with them and they went unwanted a few seconds later. I'm pretty close to the station and no other CAMPs were on nearby so I knew he'd be coming for me. I stored my Santatron and waited. 
---
Sure enough, PA with the xmas lights, he appears and gives off some xmas emotes. I wave and keep building (damn these icicle lights are hard to place) besides I know the bot is safe in storage. He didn't look for it though. He checked out my CAMP instead and I noticed he was on AREA chat so I switched over and he compliments my build. Says it's so good he wont be looting my Santatron and I laugh and tell him I spied him moments earlier and stashed it away before he got here. Laughs were had, then he continued on to the next heist.
---
I think mine must have been playing it over his PTT, he trashed my camp after he became wanted. NBD, I just repaired everything. first griefer I ran across in months.
---
Yup just do the same thing Rockstar did with their hackers; both GTAV and 76 hackers are very similar in action and only taking them to court will stop them from ban evading and continuing to develop more tools to damage the game. They need more than a slap on the wrist with losing accounts and characters; teach them a legal lesson and destroy their wallets and bank account balances.
---
It makes me laugh that you think this game will last another five years.
---
ouch
---
Just to correct myself, it's under "Character."
---
You need to invest into the explosives weight reduction perk. I walk around carrying 3000 40mm grenades and 350 missiles, 20 nukes and 6000 rounds of 5mm for my anti-armor explosive Gatling.
---
Yep!! Its definitely happening to me...way more often since the last patch. 10 in past 2 days I would say. All weird stuff...Freeze in silo, crash to home screen at work bench, when drinking water and even a couple times before the game connected  to server. I'm hardwired and speed is through the roof but only this game is doing it
---
All returning players get a flag on the map and are remorselessly hunted down, killed and teabagged with the video evidence posted on teabag.bethesda.net for everyone to laugh at.
---
Apart from that little has changed.
---
I usually just do the Big Bend Tunnel and get a few Santas there. It's rare when I don't see at least one.
---
Christmas.
---
yeah it was news to me too, the latest version of it fixes strangler in the sense that you can mag dump on any mobs and the game won't freeze up/crash(for you). I remember finally getting my strangler heart and shooting just 2 shots of my tse minigun on a robot froze up my game for like 5 seconds, but with tse i tested it myself and no freezes at all. I've been meaning to make a PSA post about it for PC players but keep putting it off lol
---
That explains it
---
From what I can figure, if you have everything bulked in stash it will use other stuff before breaking a bulk. It appears there is an order to follow and bulk is definitely last from my pov. 
---
I have also seen it change the ingredients for the civil war top hat, and add pre war money and 2 cloth, so every once in a while it does something wonky. I think it does that one time before breaking the next cloth bulk. 
---
beats me
---
Free flamer and pride items
---
Oh so its new - I had freezes before and stopped using my Strangler PA, have just be slumming it with the Excavator instead.
---
Just wait until people start stealing your entire inventory just by standing next to you. That script got released publicly today.
---
Yes. From what I understod when digging it was the original purpose of the hack
---
Hey so I found a list here on reddit and would post the link but not sure how, but anyways I have been following this list closely and I have 33 plans left to get in the game and I know at least how to get all of them but two. Do you have any information on the cutting fluid recipe or the T-45 military paint plan? Would be very much appreciated.
---
With the amount of things wrong with this game, Bethesda really needs to pull a Final Fantasy XIV and scrap this game, remake it properly and re-release. It's honestly the worst put together game I've seen since, well since Final Fantasy XIV.
---
I got three plans for it the first day. I think I sold a copy for 50 caps. Same with the plasma grenade. But they might have fixed something because I never got them again. 
---
Range is mysterious.
---
Hey. The T45 military paint and cutting fluid plans are dev room only and never made it into the game. Sounds like our group might be for you. If you are interested, I can DM the link.
---
i got a quantum deathclaw as my pet at my camp
---
Disappear like all the random items in my stash box, leaving me not knowing if I am going mad or just scrapping stuff I need to keep without realising, thus going mad.
---
Hope they stay as I'm collecting the presents too and will not be near the game after Tuesday for a good two weeks.
---
People keep saying you have to run it through first without mining the Ultracite veins though.  Is that right?
---
im not arguing semantics, im arguing computer science. 
---
an exploit and a hack are NOT the same thing. 
---
they are also handled differently in legal situations. especially in states like california with more strict computer laws. you can go to jail over hacks. they are classified as computer crimes because you are using unauthorized access to a system to do it. 
---
exploits do not rely on that. they rely 100% on the client end. 
---
TL;DR, hacking a multiplayer game can land you in jail, exploiting it cant.
---
There's a lot of Starlight Berries along the road and along the railroad tracks North of Slocum's Joe. [This map](https://i.imgur.com/o5ckvuE.jpg) might be helpful.
---
It appears from the footage that you can only get the stuff you're carrying stolen, not your stash?  Not that that matters much, since I doubt anyone has the space to store all their legendary armors, weapons, and important junk/misc stuff, in order to play in skivvies with a pipe wrench for the sake of playing the game.  Plus once your pip-boy is gone, little hard to play.
---
If you invest into those perks which give you DR and ER, like Barbarian, Evasive, etc., You can have some defense and wear that ugly but effective Hazmat suit. 
---
My Berserker build wears hooded rags, which remove armor, and his defense is about 200-280.
---
That along with extra recoil, the fact that the shots split the damage equally, and the second shot isn‚Äôt as accurate as the first, make it so it‚Äôs entirely possible to do less damage than a non legendary variant while still keeping all of TS flaws
---
Same, I‚Äôm hardwired too. I don‚Äôt play many other games but this is the only one that has goofed for me
---
I'm interested, can you please PM me the discord link?
---
One of the players from the free weekend, they will go away after the first rush of excitement and go back to Fortnite.
---
I have tried it both ways. Both way works fine for me.
---
 There is a chance that the mire lurks towards the end will kill off some of the scorched though. I lost a few santas scorched way.  Quickly making your way through the cavern sometimes prevents this. Then you can go back and mine ultracite.
---
with the limit that its level related. a level 50 player can, a level 5 player cannot. additional weight unlocks with level.
---
The C.A.M.P unit, Santatron, maybe a crafting bench and cooking fire then a ring of assorted turrets and flood lights around it all üòé
---
I don‚Äôt have a discord yet but definitely interested in joining you guys, I‚Äôll get to making one here now so would be awesome if you could send that link!
---
I have a lvl 555 main that is only missing Recipe; Healing Mire and a couple Raid plans. I‚Äôm so close...
---
Mine was around 120+ level. Probably not a free weekender.
---
It's not that bethesda doesn't care. it's that it's one studio that never made a game before Fallout 76, alone, working on this game, with several different teams allocated to different tasks.
---

Not trying to scare you, but check the current hot post in this sub. You're potentially at risk of having everything stolen from your inventory on pc if you play in adventure mode.
---
That sounds as bad as when Tim sweeney grouped all PC gamers together as pirates.  
---
People can hack consoles, JTag and RTag used to exist in the 360 days.
---
They have said Modding will come, they just don't know when or how or what, since they have so much already planned.
---
Feel a bit more motivated to go and take down the Mothman for the first time now!
---
Yeah mine was a 205...
---
Can confirm, for what it's worth
---
Go to private that‚Äôs what I do ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
You know what TL:DR means right ? Lol clearly I will agree to disagree but whatever floats your boat either way is a cheat.
---
Did you lose anything?  This is terrible - but I believe it even before you said can confirm.
---
This, or since he used a Tesla rifle it does sound like he might have been using the god mode exploit.
---
Just do it with them? You can glitch it and get infinite spawns
---
Hell if he‚Äôs asked I‚Äôd probably have given him a gift. I make new players stuff all the time, it helps them and creates a new friendly player on the servers. Which in my experience has been most.
---
What is the most rare plan in the game not including event
---
Does the boom come off its the other thing I can think of besides the Mic just being junk.
---
I have an older turtle beach that I have used but I required me to use an included adaptor that had the green and pink headphones/mic jack plus a usb I had plug in all three of them because of the surround sound but it also had a detachable boom Mic or whatever that was kind of a nuisance because it was difficult to snap in place.
---
I claimed this but I still dont seem to have it.
---
Exactly.on console that shit will be caught real fkn quick.
---
Lmao almost instantly.
---
It's a mod. You have to apply it to a Combat armor piece by modifying it.
---
It's not a Craft-from-scratch option, it's a Mod Option for any existing Combat Armors.
---
Craft combat armor and then it‚Äôs a mod
---
Any comments from Bethesda about this? That is a pretty wild breach
---
Good question. This event really changed the plan dynamics. Once the event is over, the market will be saturated with all these plans. My view is that the rarest plans are healing salve (mire), healing salve (bog), the tier 5 ultracite mod plans and the project paradise plans (diffuser, bear arm mods). Before the event, the rarest plans were heavy raider and the plasmas
---
They want to get you to engage them. I went on a public server for the first time in months yesterday, and within 5 minutes I had a level 50 try to bait me into attacking him, thinking I didn't see his higher level friend stealthed in the bushes with a Tesla rifle. /eyeroll
---
Nope! Found it! Did what RaiderTrader suggested and used an online sound matching app and played the video I linked into it and this was the result

---
Right I don‚Äôt mind sharing a d helping there‚Äôs more then enough out there. It‚Äôs like whenever I take a workshop. I build it into a settlement. Multiple houses all ready with bees stash boxes crafting then leave everything unlocked but nooenthenonlynoeooleni ever encounter are the A-holes who wanna Pvp and have apparently no loves because they just demolish me with their stealth boy bloodied builds
---
No, thankfully...  
---
Can confirm from the bug hunting / datamining side, but remaining offline until resolved, and it's why I've not been online in over a week.    
---
Issues like this are usually not made public, because the more people who know, the more people who use the exploits, but since someone outed it..
---
It worked! Thanks for the suggestion. Didn't think it'd work cause part of me was thinking it was just some jingle Bethesda put together.
---
If you're on PS4 you can hop on my private server if I'm on. I promise not to steal your stuff.
---
Hard to do.  There's little to gain by suing individual script kiddies, and even the person creating the hack is barely worth suing (and it would be a bit of a PR fight, though not too bad).
---
IF there was a source that was distributing (or even worse, selling the hacks), then you have a real viable target.  Not from a monetary standpoint, but the law is hard on people like that.  The forums where the code is posted (if that's the distribution) is *somewhat* protected, though not completely.
---
I'm all for it, but it's not too straight forward.
---
He's saying sorry in the way of expressing sympathy for (like "sorry that your grandparent died").
---
The length of time continued development isn't the point. That's just the time it'll take for haters to stop frothing at the mouth and give it a chance.
---
World of Warcraft says hello, albeit the current addon API is severely restricted compared to what was available before since some of the addons made game mechanics irrelevant or plain automated.
---
But 76 is not a game where hardcore guilds race against time to get fake glory, so it could obviously be much more relaxed.
---
Actual hacks were completely separate and banned by warden pretty quickly.
---
Excellent. Hey, at least you've(and the rest of us) got two great new tunes to jam out to now.
---
Best combo, but more secret agent then sniper is:
---
Vault-tec labcoat (clean) and white wolf fedora.
---
For those of you that don‚Äôt recognize who this is, check the post history. If OP didn‚Äôt scare you, then this definitely should.
---
Well, I know what I'm going to be seeing in news articles for the next few days. "LOOK AT HOW FALLOUT 76 HAS FUCKED UP NOW."
---
It's under Resources
---
Resources, then you go through the skin options.
---
It really is! It's like spinning a wheel of fortune, but you only get your true fortune 2% of the time! Lol
---
For sure. How serendipitous that the 10 star legendaries and inventory editing got "released" on the most recent free weekend.
---
  
---
Ugh.
---
Resources.  It will be in the same slot as the regular collectron, you need to scroll right or left to see it.
---
Hate to say it but pretty sure they all left for the holidays. On Wednesday devann and the other one on the stream, sorry can't remember her name, were saying the giveaways will be delayed because everyone's leaving. Said it would probably be new year before they were on the way out. I'm guessing the same would be at least for figuring out how they're hacking this and then preventing it. Banning won't do a thing.
---
Thank you found it
---
Sorry for the late reply, away. So you are relying on logging back into the same sever if you do it fast enough. Just sounds too risky, but I'm going to have to try it with some throw away stuff to see.
---
Ahhhh that‚Äôs a classic one there. I had a good like week there then all these trolls coming out of the woodwork. I‚Äôm hoping my it‚Äôs just the weekend or something. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not though
---
Ah unfortunately I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
I just see no evidence or a way to see this happening, Bethesda publish no metrics on server player numbers or player base, is this guessing or are there some definitive stats I could go look at.
---
You may be right I hope not as I enjoy this game and want it to continue.
---
They're just bored. They really need to bring back a new version of Survival that actually gives these guys a productive outlet. Some of them will always do it this way, but a lot of them just have no way to blow off steam.
---
Yeah I was so happy to see someone pairing it because I bought it entirely for combining it with other hats and stuff
---
It's still a little surreal to me to see all the Mothman stuff.
---
I first heard of him on a flyer in a store window in Charleston in 1993.  I laughed, thinking it was half cool and half ridiculous.  
---
Now all these years later he's in books and movies and at least one video game.  I've been to the Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant twice.  It's one of the few things keeping the city alive since the collapse of industry.
---
Strange times we live in.
---
Well it is PC player who are hacking so. /s
---
Yes they will still be around after the event you can even stock wrapping paper and that will stay around.
---
Yeah I got that but still showing something else
---
It settled down eventually, there seems to be a mob mentality and down-voting anyone who has bought and enjoys. 1st comments always gets the down-vote gang hot under the collar, then maybe it stabilises once they have left. üòâ
---
True. I do miss survival it revived a sense of danger missing from being a high level in adventure mode.
---
I just turned off my vendors and enclosed mine in a doorless room on the top floor until I can get the plans I need.
---
Not that I've been having any luck getting stuff anyway but I'm running a shotty toon so this is my only chance for getting the prime receivers so of course mine would get targeted.
---
If they find a way in ill just build a death trap
---
You don‚Äôt need metrics to see less players in the sergers and the fact an entire game mode was deleted because no one played it and even nuclear winter is taking longer to get filled games so you don‚Äôt need metrics just bloody common sense and comparing to when the game was somewhat doing ok
---
I assume there is a formal wear daily today?
---
I'm sorry, I wasn't gloating man, I just have a drop of spare cash I can throw at the game I'm enjoying, I only bought the monthly and will roll it if or until I've had enough.
---
Maybe someone will buy you a sub for the holidays. Good luck üëç
---
Depends on your background. The principles involved here are pretty basic for anyone who's spent any amount of time either modding Fallout games or programming in general. Most hacks for online games require a lot of server validation spoofing and anti-cheat evasion, but 76's minimal anti-cheat and almost entirely absent server-side validation make it really, *really* easy by comparison.
---
If only there was some way to prevent this.
---
Yes, but to a minuscule degree.
---
[deleted]
---
I can think of one other example: The Division, at least in the early days. People running around with laser accurate 1000 round-per-second one-hit kill weapons that they would shoot you with through walls from the top of an unreachable building 3 blocks away. That was pretty awful, but even that game didn't have such bad security that other people could get into your inventory.
---
&gt; please dont confuse exploits with hacks. 
---
Meh... you say "potato" and I say "Hey!  Where the eff did all my stuff go!"
---
Executioner‚Äôs grognak is pretty sweet
---
Right. Sometimes I go naked just so I run the risk of dying
---
Are you on PC?
---
Yw Autumn
---
If you want the entire game explained to you, whats the fun honestly?
---
Go play, if thats too daunting, then this game isen't for you
---
They need to remove lockpicking in power armor
---
&gt; INSTA ROBOT PERMABANNED!!!!
---
That never happened, what the fuck are you on about?
---
I was capping my frames manually from day 1.
---
Me too, way to hectic to know what I'm aiming at especially with the ads, the queen is OK if she's hovering but then there are those who bunny jump in front of you to get hit! LOL
---
All good on xb1 we still got them
---
A "Presidential" penis as it were ...
---
Lol what? When did I ask for the entire game to be explained to me?
---
I asked about what cool changes have been made and what people recommend I try out.
---
OK, then just someone looking to PVP, why not in NW though? Just the thrill of the kill and the thrill of stealing.
---
Fair enough, just part of the game I guess.
---
Strongest super mutant I am
---
You could create an alt character, teansfer your most important "don't lose this shit!" stuff to it and just play for a while with your regular slumming it with lower level weapons until the crisis on infinite fallout is over.
---
Looks you you need to buy repair kits now! Start buying those sweet, sweet atoms
---
Loved that movie when I was a kid. Creeped me the f%#k out. Always been intrigued by folklore since.
---
I hope this hack doesnt affect the PS4 version.
---
Why? The free stuff is always just a picture frame..... woowee! That's not even worth the time to log in, claim it, and log out.
---
Vampire shiskebab seems ok. On PS4 here.
---
In every group a certain percent are assholes.  Sorry about your experience in general mine has been good, but some nights are better than others.
---
I have a grenader build I just don't buy ammo because everyone overcharges for it.
---
Too many people drop it at train stations for it to cost so much
---
I may be new to this whole internet thing but I believe the correct way to show that a comment is sarcastic is to use the backslash and the first letter of the word. /s
---
(That /s was meant to show my last sentence was sarcasm. See how it works)
---
Why exactly would you need one anyway?
---
Might watch something on the Wendigo next. Seen a few YouTube vid stuff.
---
Yeah it was a great film! Literally discovered it through playing this game and googling the Mothman. Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd have probably never even heard of it otherwise.
---
Nope I just got a plasma pistol from the purveyor.
---
It's an enclave thing
---
You said not rare, the tattered field jacket is rare, and it's white...i think there is a t shirt outfit or underarmor t shirt... you should use the marine wetsuit... it's actually black but seems sniper ish...
---
If you have the stimpaks required I'll let you revive me and get the kills needed but after that I won't be doing this anymore as I've already obtained it and thus won't benefit from it.
---
Whats it to you? Why do you even care? Also played since beta, and think it's great. Also sub to FO1st too and love it. May I suggest you go play something more your speed. Was gonna say forknite but I reckon Candy Crush is more your style.
---
Looking forward it. Thanks
---
Awesome. Thank you!
---
FO76 is the candy crush of Fallout games.
---
I sent the edit as soon as you replied but happy trails dweller
---
Hope you enjoy it, thanks
---
If by chance you are on ps4 send me a friends request and I'll hook you up with some serums,  ammo, under armor,  stimpaks,  radx,  radaway,  and other stuff.  Consider it an early Christmas gift.
---
Yes, Tea Time. Still haven't seen it and I've been on several hours now.
---
I‚Äôm just gonna start playing one of my other games.  I picked up Metro Exodus during Microsoft store Black Friday deals.  I‚Äôll watch reddit for when it‚Äôs safe to return.
---
My tag is cootdog level 396.
---
That wasn't bullshit and it even happened on console happened to one of my friends,that happened in December last year I believe just before the TSE nerf!
---
It has to be crafted at an armor work bench assuming you linked the correct account.
---
Not true. Currently it‚Äôs a santatron robot for your camp. The previous 4 weeks were all free wallpaper for your camp.
---
forgot to mention it will still crash other players who don't have SFE
---
Drops are exactly the same
---
I bought one off a vendor for 500 today. It's the grenades that everyone goes nutso for.
---
There is a thing now that if someone's camp is in your spot, you get a pop up that tells you your camp couldn't be placed, and get to choose between "stay on this world" or "take me to another world" and if you select the second one, it automatically starts searching for a new world. Your camp won't disappear forever anymore!
---
First, grab all the free stuff from the atomic shop. Second, go to a train station and activate the posters that are there (a party poster, scout poster, and a missing person's poster). Third, if you have any caps, open up your map and go check out vendor's camps! Fourth, farm up materials and craft ammo, if you have any guns, also armor, if you don't already have any. If you need stuff like steel, farm places like West Tek, Black Water Mine, General's Steak house, any place with super mutants or moleminers. They drop caps, ammo, and their lovely weapons. Use scrapper under intelligence when scrapping weapons and armor! If you need lead, put on your handy dandy excavator power armor, and head to Lucky Hole Mine. If you need acid to smelt all that lead ore, grab Hemlock Holes. And whatever you do, do not stay at your workshop for too long. If you go to your workshop, stay crouched the whole time. This is only if you don't like to PVP, if you do like to PVP, then ignore everything I just said about hiding at your workshop(s). And if you want to, grab a Fallout 1st membership. It not for everyone, but you gain access to your own private server, toggling it between all of your friends being able to join, or only whoever you're teamed with. Then, you have everything to yourself! You also get 1650 atoms every month, a survival tent (an extra free fast travel point), and the ranger outfit from the atomic shop. Also some funny emotes. If you don't want the membership, then that's obviously fine, too! 
---
Play how YOU want to play. Ultimately you can either pick up where you left off, or start all over. However, if you decide to start all over, check your character's inventory first to make sure you don't have anything valuable!! And most importantly, have fun
---
Right now hacking on PC is the worst I've ever seen. Red dead online, fallout 76, gta online, rainbow six siege, battlefield 5, pubg, fortnite, almost any FPS you can think of has hackers in it. I'd say in the last 2 years hacking has surged in multiplayer PC games. Where it's the worst though are the games that have a huge amount of hate aimed at it, so right now BFV and fo76 are flooded with hackers. The little Alex Jones inside my head thinks there's some neckbeard revolutionaries trying to make these games unplayable to try and kill them because of how much they hate the dev's, but that's just a little conspiracy I've come up with to try and explain why hacking is so fuckong bad right now in these 2 games.
---
If they are in their rooms use power armor frames on doors. Otherwise if their legs get crippled its faster to let them die and resummon. During the walking over maybe sonething aoe or good for mobbing tesla/explosives.
---
If you have a pet, never leave the game while you are at your camp. There is a very good chance that the game will kill your pet when you start the game again and load into your camp. I have lost 2 megasloths before realizing this... What I usually do is log out a location nearby my camp then log out. When I log back in, I walk to my camp.
---
&gt;PC is very easy to secure
---
I wouldnt go that far considering how many popular online pc games still get hackers to this day
---
Im seeing people act like its only bethesda/fallout 76 thats getting hacked to this scale when many others have most likely seen the exact same shit happen in call of duty or GTA online or rdr2 online (tho for pc only in RDO)
---
10 star was proven fake; but the rest of the statement is correct -- free disposable accounts are basically an invitation of "come fuck with our game!"
---
Incompetence isn‚Äôt over the top. Using an archaic engine with a net framework duct taped onto it that is known for being EASY to mod and manipulate IS incompetence. It‚Äôs cheap and easy. It doesn‚Äôt take a scientist to realize that things needed to be changed before releasing the game. They released a patch after 16 updates and 1 year after release to fix a DAY 1 bug that BROKE shit even more than before. There is 100% a level of incompetence at Bethesda but it‚Äôs not necessarily in their ability to code, but their unwillingness to invest time and resources into this game. Bugs like the audio glitches have mods that fix those issues. Bethesda has ‚Äúfixed‚Äù them 5 or so times now and they still remain in the game. I understand people are defensive of this game, but you shouldn‚Äôt be defensive of the way Bethesda has treated it. They‚Äôve shown many times that it‚Äôs about the money, not the quality
---
You hit the nail on the head there, by basically turning Fallout 4 engine into multiplayer game they basically allowed this sort of thing to happen. You know this also means Skyrim Together is going to ultimately share the same fate Fallout 76.
---
Destiny wont allow you to run any other programs or manipulate the code while it's running. Bethesda could implement that as well.
---
Please don‚Äôt throw us baby meat bois in with these scum
---
Meaning the algorithm bans your account if it notices you editing files or anything while the game is running.
---
You cant have your cake and eat it to. Either you allow nodding and accept cheating as normal and not complain about it. Or ban all changes to the game and ban cheaters.
---
He used the jedi mind trick on you.üòÅ
---
What sort of measurement is a ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù?
---
Too bad Bethesda doesn't do anything about it
---
Having a gauntlet to run in order to take a workshop is a fantastic idea. üëç
---
A foundation you place to put your walls and shit on
---
Last one I and several people reported got banned. So, Im gonna do it again.
---
Sorry I meant, so I did it again. Past tense.
---
By hell do I feel ya man, being solo, while at times has its perks, is ultra limiting. I got lucky on that around level 20 I met a guy who ended up playing with me till level 90, hence I stuck around till then too. But after he left, it got a lot harder to play with the lack of endgame content. That said, glad your back, maybe you'll meet someone to play the game with like I did.
---
No like that means you can‚Äôt run any background processes. Like everything you can run inside windows is a program. Heck the Volume Mixer is a program. Your anti-virus is a program. Windows Defender is a program.
---
What you probably mean is that you can‚Äôt have anything else change (or maybe access period) the game‚Äôs allocated RAM while the game is open. Which is doable, but has a lot of overhead and can still be gotten around in certain cases in certain ways. It‚Äôs really only possible for a quality studio willing to invest serious time into the effort, and it locks out a bunch of other possibilities.
---
Their entire group, not just the two who group up together on all the matches.
---
I like how a Mr. Handy will deliver the past-due utility bill to Sugar Grove during one of the Messenger events.
---
Skyrim Together will never see the light of day, the guy that runs it is a complete arsehole who abuses other modders and steals their work/code.  
---
He's the sole reason previous attempts at Skyrim Multiplayer mods died.
---
The fucking instant a player who installs a mod gets banned, the news is going to fucking say they ban people who use mods they don't sanction because they plan to sell their own.
---
He's been hacking all day
---
The "archaic engine" argument is weak and pathetic, and completely ignores how game engines work and are used.  
---
One of the highest praised game engines in the industry is the Unreal Engine, an engine that is just as old as the GameBryo Engine which was torn down and used as the base code for the Creation Engine (what Bethesda has been using since Skyrim), and yet the Unreal Engine reuses code more than Bethesda's does.  
---
Engines are modular code, you pull a piece out and put something new in, we've seen Bethesda do this with each game release, just from FO4 to FO76 they put in new rendering tech and lighting.  
---
For Starfield the Creation Engine is getting a new physics engine that's being coded with help from Elon Musk's SpaceX.  
---
There is not much left of the "archaic engine" at this point, what is currently in the Creation Engine I'd say is around a decade old at most.  
---
The problem comes from Bethesda not taking the time to iron things out, most likely because they aren't given the time to by higher ups at Zenimax telling them to push out new games faster.  
---
And if you want further proof that an "archaic engine" isn't the issue, take a look at Mass Effect Andromeda and Anthem, games using a quite new engine FrostByte, a very powerful engine that is capable of great things, it certainly shows off how good it is for Jedi Fallen Order and Battlefront 2.  
---
Bungie's engine they made for Destiny is new as well, yet requires 9+ hours to load a single map for editing, staff at Bungie have to set things up to load the night before they work on them.
---
&gt;You can also see it as Bethesda are the bad guys because if devs would just fix the game and not find more and more ways to fuck with the consumers then there would be no issues.
---
Yeah I guess. I don‚Äôt spend any real money outside of the initial purchase on games though so I guess I‚Äôm screwed lol ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
So will I be safe on xbox?
---
That would be awesome! Will do when I log in tomorrow! Thanks so much!
---
Everybody complaining about it honestly just sucks at the mode...people with frog legs are just as killable as everybody else
---
Do you blame the company that makes the car breathalyzers when a drunk person bypasses it?
---
Nope. It would have been rewiev bombed because it wasn't fo5 possibly made thing even worse
---
In fact, you have to be a real piece of shit to do this period.
---
u/ladydevann
---
Are the devs gonna get this worked on before it even happens?
---
That's not a complaint at all. Honestly I have no trouble or complaints about frog legs.
---
i miss my masks, i got hacked like 3 months ago and they took everything, i couldn't find yet not even in the marketplace or camps a 50cal instigating explosive weightless like i had before lol
---
How about just balance the game so a build like bloodied isn‚Äôt the only way to play? It‚Äôs really not that difficult. Allow players to play creatively, omg a shocker. Yet another reason the subscription came too soon. QoL items are equally important to validate an actual subscription service. Bugs el oh el.
---
Use it and enjoy the satisfaction.  Plans are not uncommon now.  I have 7.
---
Learn it before somebody hacks it off your inventory :(
---
Archaic does work when the ‚Äúmodular pieces‚Äù that are broken remain in the engine for ten fucking years. The same bugs have existed in 76 since Morrowind. Not all bugs are the same and not all Morrowind bugs exist in 76. But the fact the game released with its engine speed tied to the frame rate shows they‚Äôve left things really outdated. The exact same issue has existed since Morrowind. It took them about 3 weeks to fix it. So some parts are new yes, not nearly enough. So archaic does work because the broken parts of the engine are still intact and struggling along. It‚Äôs also an easy to code for engine which adds to the issues that using it has
---
Yeah I mean who doesn't like to pay for online on top of already paying for the internet
---
I hear you and I don;t  understand why people enjoy being dicks, but they do and always have sadly.  Hope your next time out is a better experience
---
At this point I'm glad hackers are ruining the game because fuck Bethesda.  I quit playing.  This is what Bethesda gets for releasing a game like this without anticheat.
---
Was doing it yesterday as well, but I let it slide, tonight was different. Its not fair to the people who are actually playing NW and arent cheating.
---
Your stuff is worthless in a game that is this broken. Do you think people will play this 2-3 years from now? Beth will probably close the servers by then.
---
They have the same drop chance. They're equally rare. The only difference is the perceived value of the Plasma Grenade Plan due to the Possum Badge requirement
---
Why did I just imagine a Wiley coyote Death trap lol
---
&gt;Your stuff is worthless
---
Damn now if only that were true you would have an actual argument!
---
Physics speed being tied to FPS was a fine and harmless bug UNTIL FO76.
---
It was a bug the gaming community enjoyed and loved using, from regular casual play to speed runs and more.
---
Bethesda never NEEDED to fix that bug until FO76, and it's unlikely to return as the physics engine is being replaced, so the part of the code that caused that will no longer still be present.
---
It takes 2 minutes to upload something to youtube, what is the holdup?
---
My guns broke 6 times today in the amount of time that would normally be 1-2 times. My armor all broke 3 times. This needs fixed.
---
Yeah they can steal your pipboy as it is considered an item(armor asset), albeit not visible within the pipboy itself
---
If you say so! Like I said I‚Äôve had several plasma mine plans drop. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt think they were rare because I‚Äôve had so many of them lol. 
---
But that gift gave me my first ever plasma Grenade plan in 6 months of playing. But then I got 4 more plasma Grenade plans from more gifts so I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre all that rare anymore.
---
You don‚Äôt need to go to all this work. Just open the FO76 exe after you‚Äôve opened it for the launcher and boom, you have two instanced running.
---
&gt; implying this shit show will ever be over
---
Agreed, but it supports my case. The engine is old because they‚Äôve never needed to update much of anything. The analogy I feel towards Bethesda is a kid who grew up very charismatic with great jokes and stories, but wasn‚Äôt very fond of doing hard work. They did the bare minimum to make it through school, but now with 76 they‚Äôve met their first full time job. They can‚Äôt just relax or drag their feet anymore as they now have responsibilities. But it still feels like they‚Äôre doing the absolute minimum. Hence why a day one bug took 16 patches and one year to finally fix only to make the issue worse without proper testing. I love Bethesda *games*, but I don‚Äôt much care for Bethesda anymore
---
Cmon hackers, stick to the cool stuff like the prydwen
---
They worship the drowned god.
---
Agreed.
---
2 or 3 days ago i saw a dude with something like a "Gatling" but he was firing missiles instead of bullets that exploded like mini-nukes and also explosives
---
he just killed the queen before i could even tag her lol, these hacks are out of control
---
Their comment isn't sarcastic. The way it's worded it comes off as sarcastic, and they're lamenting there's no way to indicate they're not being sarcastic (besides saying "this isn't sarcasm").
---
Easy, don't own a camp
---
What‚Äôs dead may never die!
---
Relogging gives back the pip boy.
---
This is why i like playing on console, We dont have hackers.
---
This was working great buy yesterday and today getting hardly anything. Two of us went through two nights ago and I had 54 presents at the end. I‚Äôve tried multiple servers both public and private.
---
*But* what about my vendor?
---
Aqua boy perk. Bush wookie's natural enemy.
---
This is fucking crazy
---
If you play alone, then don‚Äôt choose the scout list that includes reviving someone....
---
What if the hackers were actually Bethesda employees trying to get people to buy the subscription so they don‚Äôt get their shit taken
---
Honestly just really take your time exploring locations. Check out the little things and don't stress the right builds or getting the best gear too much.
---
there are places like vault94 or silos that if you get hit without pa while lockpicking you are dead, and kicked of the place
---
just because thieves exist that doesn't mean a weapon is bad.
---
Much better way of saying what he did lol
---
It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.
---
At least he waved... bye bye
---
There use to be a miscellaneous notification, but I think it was for when a player was attacking it. I would love some kind of notification. Would be nice to know when my pet was still alive too. I have to spend so much time looking for it. It's usually under the floor.
---
This is the best thing I have ever read
---
Relogging gives you back your pip boy. Everything else is gone.
---
If you‚Äôve been through the main missions and have unlocked silos, you‚Äôll still be able to access them and the whitespring bunker even though you don‚Äôt have the keycards for access because that information is stored seperate from what you have in your inventory.
---
I come back now and then, grab the freebies, try to play the game, and upon noticing the lag is worse than the beta release I stop again!
---
I think it's okay to Blackhat if you're showing vulnerable systems. Do it as much as you like, but at this time of the year it is deliberate asshole behaviour.
---
What may or may not happen in 2-3 years is irrelevant. 
---
What matters now is that people are putting free time into a game that for them may or may not be as broken as you say it is.  For one reason or another - maybe they aren‚Äôt experiencing major crashes or bugs.  So they decided to invest some free time instead of whatever else, because it is fun to them.  It‚Äôs not worthless because it has an opportunity cost of whatever else they could have been doing.
---
Any relaxation or endorphins that may have been gained from ‚Äùhaving fun‚Äù are going to to be obliterated by some ass hat who thinks they entitled to be some sort of crusader (or more likely from trolls who think it‚Äôs just fun to mess with other people). There is actual damage done and if you think otherwise I‚Äôd suggest taking a look into psychology.
---
76 has a lot of literal copy paste from 4. I mean literal, literally. The scorchbeast code had mentions of Skyrim dragons on release, because the devs had literally highlighted the text, copied it and then pasted it.
---
Happens to me too.. I think it‚Äôs a rendering issue. I have to wait until the background loads in. Happens mostly in the forest and by my camp. Gotta reload.
---
She said people are trickling out for Christmas on the stream the other day. I'm unsure what she could do, if she's even lurking
---
Yeah. No video proff of it just another scare. Next will he a post or two of "it happened to me" with no real proof posted by someone else
---
Had the exact same thought today. Especially because I am at WS and get a lot of visitors. Some of those visitors don‚Äôt fight any enemies they draw and I come home to a destroyed camp.
---
Well it isn't like this sort of thing is new to PC. MS has had decades to create a sandbox for game apps due to piracy concerns.
---
Not really a good comparison.  Car breathalyzers detect if you're driving drunk, not keep you from driving drunk in the first place.  But then you'd need a cop to look for someone driving drunk to pull over and give a breathalyzer to.  Not really comparable to an anti-cheat.  There would have to be checkpoints on roads with cops all drivers would have to go through for that to be comparable.  Then it'd be on them that a drunk got through.
---
If it's about PVP, neither do I!
---
Use concrete foundation to hide your Santatron. Make sure to cover the top too. When it comes time to collect, remove a foundation piece and collect your loot.
---
If you are able to clear it, wear your excavator armor to the glassed caverns and you can get a lot of ultracite, plus collect some stuff from the scorched in there. Ultracite sells for a pretty pe... cappy. Unless, of course, you need it for ammo or are making ultracite power armor.
---
It‚Äôs a ‚Äúhacker‚Äù sooo? That‚Äôs f76 on pc at the moment.
---
....Ummmm unless you want to maintain very high FPS on all clients by limiting the quality of the textures and render difference on the second+ open client.  
---
It also allows people with "Potatoes" to have multiple clients open with reduced instability.
---
Just PC.
---
just put a bunch of Missile Turrets around your camp, nothing will get through
---
Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
That's why you kill stuff before looting.
---
Waves aren't endless and most indoor areas respawn you inside now.
---
I disagree wholeheartedly.  While some people, including myself, enjoy theory craft and tweaking builds, far more folks I've met just want to enjoy the game without overthinking it.  It's not necessary to min max.  If anything, it's far more important and satisfying to meet other players and establish cooperative bonds.  
---
What makes this game Fallout is the environmental storytelling and lore.  Otherwise you could just be playing some other shooter.  So I say take your time and savor the game.
---
Yeah, GTA is a cesspit.
---
I want to thank these hackers for forcing people to quit playing this shitty excuse of a game.  Even if it's only pc.  They are really doing the gaming world a favor because up till now the shittyness of the game was mild enough for us to all just suffer with it.  Now we won't play out of fear of losing what we have left of the game that is playable.  I hope this destroys the company they call bethesda.  It's not the company it used to be. Fuck em.
---
I said I've never seen a hack in any of the games I've played.
---
What about it?
---
where do they go? the tunnel was seated a few patches ago and the radiation went through the roof... hmm... ( big hint)
---
Fyi I have the mire healing recipe, feel free to DM me an offer üòÄ
---
I suppose if you have a weaker pc. I feel like it should still handle two instances on low quality.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôll give you 20k. Tried to DM you but couldn‚Äôt for sum reason?
---
It's the area rads by the locks/terminals
---
Ah damn, i'm on PC, Should have really stated my platform in the initial message sorry :D Happy Hunting.
---
I'm up but not playing that shit
---
Played some more on PC today, thought i found another dupe vendor but turns out it was just one of the best camps I have seen in 1200 playing.  So many ideas I‚Äôd never seen before.  No more evidence of hax so far..
---
Thank you anyway! I know I always forget to mention that I‚Äôm on Xbox when I post, seems like that Recipe is much harder to find there
---
Because of course you know this means war.
---
If I could set up ridiculous traps everywhere I would guess ill just hide mines around to instaclaim those bounties
---
What system?
---
Ps4
---
I think the ‚Äústeal someone‚Äôs entire inventory‚Äù is slightly more out of hand.
---
There's still the Hazmat suit though
---
I play on Xbox so I don‚Äôt have that issue
---
While I kind of want to see 'breaking down' of ranked cards, part of me realizes that it'd be a bad move for the games health.  
---
Since there's effectively only up as the direction of character progression, it's anticlimactic for characters to go backwards to remedy errors in levelling they've made.  It's far more effective in incentivizing the player to push forward, creating a sense of momentum.
---
I won't lie, I've made some card choices I wish I could take back, but I know that all I have to do is keep moving forward and I can address those choices.
---
There are Poseidon substations and Thunder Mountain substations. If you tell people to search at the Poseidon substations, you could be TECHNICALLY correct for the purposes of your own ego, but people need accurate information. Since no one came here to inflate your ego, stop wasting time.
---
The ants at TM-02 are a static spawn that can be repeatedly respawned.
---
Oh shit mantis didn‚Äôt realize you were the one witnessing all this stuff
---
I don't login super fast. I just leave and then switch characters. There's a 5min safety so you can go back to the same server you were just in. Only way to switch private servers is leaving private going to public and then back to private.
---
I've been through the glasses caverns a couple times. I usually only wear my Excavator PA anyway! The +100 carry weight is my go-to! I've also been selling off all my ultracite and such, too! Fun fact: go to the 'Freak Show' and take the drumsticks from the molerat cage, and they are 8caps per drumstick ü§îüòÇ
---
You lucky man/woman.
---
It would be nice if we could have an Overseer's cache, that we can place in camp.  That's where I put all my overflow stuff.  I agree that the railroad stations are nice, but who knows if anyone ever looks.
---
The glitch for me is that the supply dropbox will follow me wherever I fast travel. Very creepy.
---
another nurse outfit... I can't push play on this.
---
Then why are u here? So you can just spread hate?
---
you need a nurse outfit
---
1 good reason why console is better than pc.
---
Wat
---
nurse outfit
---
more nurse outfits
---
wear nurse outfit- profit
---
As long as it's in the game files
---
If you hate them so much why are you hanging around this reddit; go move on to the millions of other games on the planet and play other things and enjoy them. Hackers are on every single game you come across ranging from bots to account thefts and to the extreme like what 76 and GTAV currently have. Yes they are doing a messy job with implementing patches and adding bugs but I'm still going to stand by the fact that they can still fix the game. (And if not the modding community; not the hacking community will.)
---
hAcKeRs!!1
---
I love this perk but it's near useless on Flatwoods.
---
Great video subscribed
---
I heard that if you collect 5 you get 10 free Atoms.
---
hAcKerS!!1
---
Troubleshooter. The telling part was my not being able to craft plasma cores anymore.
---
Dang what‚Äôs up with my game??
---
First Fallout?
---
this hacking stuff only seems to have shown up after Fallout 1st, so maybe they do have a motive
---
id explosive over tesla, the tesla will damage  the robots (afaik not fixed yet)
---
daytripper +3 luck &amp; charisma grape Mentats + 5 Cha. Cranberry moonshine + 1 Cha, this all I can think of. the rest has been listed. Also your casual under armor boosts charisma too. + 3-4 if it's shielded.  Can't remember how much.
---
Does that mean the prydwyns going to be in the game?
---
Did you click the link?
---
No, it's just because the whole 76 is a giant 4 mod.
---
PS4 and mine are fine
---
Exactly
---
Oh, so all the files are in the game?
---
It's like what they did with 3 and NV, forst they get 3 out and then use the same assets to rush out a game. NV was made by Obsidian and had much better story though.
---
Pretty much
---
Cant wait to see someone spaen in diamond city
---
I wouldn‚Äôt count on it. I spent most of my time thinking people would be crazy to run a grenade launcher. I picked up a TS auto grenade recently and have a blast with it, but mainly for fun. I still think about dropping it with how much grenade takes up inventory.
---
What i'm saying is Skyrim multiplayer mod can never work because Fallouts game engine is the same as Skyrims so any mod that even works will still get plagued by hacks ruining other peoples fun just like in 76
---
same, 1st is when I left and I plan on getting a refund by force once I have the time
---
Been in game since day 1. :)
---
Unless it was removed, you get a text notification in the top left when a player is attacking your camp.  Super easy to miss if youre even remotely doing anything.
---
my armor is doing the exact same thing and has been for a couple weeks. so annoying
---
The market is purely based on what someone is willing to spend.
---
People will list whatever they want doesn't mean anyone is buying it.
---
Loose too much time swapping it off and armor back on. If hazmat was like power armor and didnt unequip my stuff after then cool though after week 2 I never entered the "raids" to much resource dump
---
Tame them using the Wasteland Whisperer perks.  It's a Charisma based option, when you sight/scope in upon an eligible for (1/2 your level) to pacify and tame.
---
Well that's different because you put together a location with different assets. Prydwen can be spawn whole probably because the flying one is a single asset.
---
waves are definently endless if you don't advance, silos will keep spawning robots and animals will keep spawning in vault 94 were also you have limited time to do the task of the area
---
Oh, so you wouldnt be able to go inside because your spawning the model you see from wherever kellog was hiding?
---
I guess so only saw one in videos and pictures.
---
It depends on what the market will bear.  High demand plans are going to cost between 10-20,000 caps.  Low demand ones often can't be given away for free.  Also sometimes people store a junk item inside their vendor for max caps so the game doesn't autoscrap the item.
---
This is the message we need to send to Bethesda. Implement some anti cheat measures or lose majority of the PC player base and continue to hurt your reputation
---
On one hand if real players get hurt by this it's sad , on the other hand for fuck sake the devs should make more bug fixes instead of shop updates every week.
---
LOL, yup. I look through the m*rket to see if anyone wants anything I have available, will occasionally look up if i hear footsteps in case I need to fight
---
Been getting 2 or 3 every time I fast travel to Forward Station Delta.   They're usually the 1st ones to the party, too,  so very little wait-time before the payout.
---
Nintendo has taken people to court over leaser offenses.
---
I just use Sandboxie and give direct access to all the files except the main ini file that holds your configs.  Then I can maintain as many sandbox instances as I like with independent configs. Works great for me and a lot less work.
---
This is exactly how I feel which is so unfortunate. I love jumping into this game every few months because it's so nice to just zone out and grind a little but cheaters have completely taken over the game. It's honestly a little pathetic at this point
---
Thanks very much
---
Any victims already??
---
You're right. They can already add whatever over the top ridiculous thing they want. I assume the point with this sort of thing is to expose this game's poor engineering. It's no fun to play a game with these kinds of security flaws. There's no point in playing when you can just spawn in any item you want or kill the entire NW map all in one shot.
---
You know that the best real money weapon sellers for 76 are on PS right?
---
Not all 3 versions of the game seem to have the same dupe glitches, and PS seems to have one of the easiest and fastest, there are literally people making a real world living out of duping and selling cheated or OP weapons to idiots for real money... No version of 76 is safe because Bethesdas Team is incompetent to deliver a not broken game...
---
tbh i play with riflegaming, talked to him a few times, he tried to put him in the view, always, and brag about hacking all the time. Didn't like him, rifle did too, never realized he was like this
---
Must be fun having a fraction of the highly played games, far less mods, low fps in MP, no real esports in comparison, etc.
---
But hey, at least you'll come across a few less hackers.
---
I'm currently playing NW
---
I was confused by your comment, then i checked his history and oh shit, he is the bug roundup person that finds everything.... if he says its true it 100% is... fuck Bethesda...
---
The high demand/rare plans I understand. Listing prices at face value or and half of the face is the question I am having.
---
Not all devs are this incompetent. I wonder why warframe and path of exile don't have these kinds of problems.
---
In the end transparency is what wins. I know it will suck for many players, but the more people get fucked hard now, the more pressure Bethesda will see and hopefully, finally do something...
---
I lost 99% of my hope that it will ever be decently playable and bug free but that last 1% keeps on holding...
---
A bush wookie's natural enemy is a skilled player.
---
You're asking how to exploit. In public.
---
Most of all Bethesda needs to limit trade. Just make it like many other games did, you can only trade what you found for 2h and only if that person was in the same instance of the world with you. Bam you now killed all outside trade. Ingame trade is also less fucked with how ridiculous prices is.
---
The vendors would have to be accessible global though to ward off some of the negatives for players, but other than that its one of the best solutions atleast to this duping and selling shit.
---
oh fuck
---
Also true!
---
&gt;If you even open the game files in any way, or alter them in any way = INSTA ROBOT PERMABANNED!!!!
---
Honestly that is fucking ridiculous and draconic... there are enough legit reasons to open files of your game that arent cheating...
---
Most common of fall, fixing graphical issues or literally corrupted files that cant be replaced due to a bug.
---
I had both those issues in atleast 4 different online or MMO like game, so maybe if you dont have any idea what you are talking about, dont advocate for more unjust bans?
---
Oh man.. nice name!
---
Then explain why every single AAA  game struggles to combat cheaters on PC
---
Lol
---
I think you misspelled 500$ wrong... because thats the highest prices i have seen and not even that uncommon...
---
I browse the atom shop.
---
following
---
There's nothing you need it for in the silo.
---
You don't even need power armor in there its easy even for a pistol toon in a two person group.
---
You wont get a refund if you played more than an hour or its longer than a month since you bought it... and thats not on Bethesda, thats on you.
---
Hey im doing that right now too.
---
Like a network of helpers...cool! Then Beth being Beth would monetise  it &amp; sell skins for it in the Atom Shop for the various factions, Brotherhood, Free States. And the Raider one would include a trap &amp; it would rob the stuff back as you left their C.A.M.P.
---
*Every* game? No. Want me to name some free games where this isn't possible?
---
&gt; all I'm really getting from you're comment is you're hacking just to "teach them a lesson".
---
I said the opposite. They're just doing it because they can.
---
Yeah I want a Brotherhood one but I'd take anything at this pointt
---
me too, had my wife and laughing so hard, "do you think it followed me? Look!  There it is!"
---
The typical way to do stuff like this with exploits is to notify the company and let them have an appropriate amount of time to fix the issue.  That time being subjective to the people/group doing the reporting.  Outting the issue to the public is a pressure tactic typically used to push non-responsive companies to patch their issues.
---
At this point I have no confidence Bethesda really cares.
---
No change
---
1st my build is optimized for PA with big guns 
---
2nd i go solo
---
Yeah, just thought it would be cool
---
What happened to blaming it all bethesda?
---
To sum it up super shortly: Bethesda's marketing director promised, at launch, that microtransactions would only ever be cosmetics. If Bethesda is unwilling to address the problem then it's basically fraud.
---
I have 1st, disappointed the junk stash doesn't share to all characters
---
Not that much time if you put a # before the name it automatically pulls it to the top of the list.
---
Personally I run rad resistant+lead lined anyway
---
People complain the game is to easy but other games basically use  different gear loadouts for raids anyway could be that balance they want but it would be nicer to have a loadout option for to make it smoother
---
Rocket turrets are your friend here
---
There is no try only do (unfortunately the guns are doing nothing)
---
Looks like Deadpool.
---
I don't have Fallout 1st, &amp; I play solo. So I'll be in hiding till it gets fixed
---
This is what you get for naming your character "Will Robinson"
---
Then what do you need to lockpick for
---
oh my heavens this is brill!
---
I would pump this up and share to reflect what bethesda have done to secure their security...
---
Report it to Bethesda via the forum. 
---
https://bethesda.net/community/category/264/fallout-76-support?language%5B%5D=en
---
Just pick your platform and you should be on your way to reporting the issue.
---
I totally agree with all of that. I wish we had chat
---
Cool. I've never seen Green skinned overweight Deadpool before.
---
I don't understand people doing that it is just selfish
---
Well it's either that or Bethesda loses lots of business because of the ahole hackers and those people lose their jobs.
---
Huh. I wonder why this isn‚Äôt being upvoted more. ü§î
---
It's the only way they can get their jollies off.  The real world has rejected them so trying to make others suffer is all they have left.
---
I did not know that. Thanks for the advice!
---
Same problem, i hardly have to repair power armor but now I‚Äôm consistently repairing it. Also my normal armor. No issues with food and water. But fusion cores are draining quickly as well.
---
No it‚Äôs much easier for PC
---
That would be a nice change to see in wastelanders. I also think there needs to be another pvp mode
---
Thank you!
---
Is there any video of this happening to a real player? That seemed to be one of the NPC's they were spawning at other points in the video. I'd be interested to see video of it happening to a real unsuspecting player.
---
Do you fucking SERIOUSLY think that someone that works on the models and textures for atom shop assets is just slacking off from their actual job of coding the game?  That's not how fucking game development works, you don't have a single group of people that are constantly switching back and forth between doing all the jobs, there are teams that specialize in in each aspect.  You can't just walk up to the guy who is normally working on the models and textures for new weapons and enemies and tell them they have to figure out how to stop the newest dupe hack.
---
happened to me also yesterday. i think they have a switch when they want to break this game
---
Be careful with that kind of logical truth around here.
---
Only praise Bethesda if you don't want to get downvoted to oblivion.  Especially healthy criticism based on facts is a big no-no and to be avoided at all costs. All hail Bethesda.
---
I use a different map texture, but that's about it. I want the in game stuff to look the same no matter who happens to be looking at it, but thats me.
---
It looks like the video proof so far is them stealing inventory from a character they spawned into the world. I haven't seen a video of them stealing from a real player yet.
---
Congrats, you uninstalled for something they removed the next patch after community backlash.  Want a cookie?
---
&gt; PC is very easy to secure 
---
Should we just get the mods to lock down this thread?  Because I don't think we're going to get anything better than this gem.
---
**SO**, how many lost all their stuff while being gangraped by hAcKeRz? There must be a lot of victims as widespread as this seems.
---
You can learn it by scrapping them. I did. Maybe it was a glitch.
---
Looks like no one has any clue about the next drops either.
---
Yes there has, fallout 76s hackers arent the only people able to drain your inventory clean
---
Lol fucking yongyea made a super smug video about the legendary armor effect bug like 2 days after it was hotfixed
---
I agree such a great legendary effect doesn't deserve to be ruined by nerfing it to a quarter of its damage increase.
---
This though in my opinion sfe is crucial.
---
Also PA flashlight mod as I hate how much of a spotlight it is. Much prefer pipboy style omnidirectional light.
---
Do you fucking SERIOUSLY think they can't get more developers to make the game stable instead of bunch shop monkeys coders ?
---
You're probably confusing it with the Pulse Mine plan. Both Plasma Grenade and Plasma Mine plans have a 0.058% (1:1,724) chance to drop from Ash Heap events, with no other source but holiday gifts.
---
I would just follow the story- figure out what kind of weapons you like to use and figure out a build for it and don‚Äôt worry about meta. Find a neat location for your camp.
---
People only used this exploit to apply paints into other peoples weapon inside their inventory but quickly figured out you could just snatch it
---
Thank you so much! I was playing Fallout with my husband and I had trouble finding any! We literally found 2! Tomorrow I will test out this list. Thanks again!!
---
Yeah it doesn‚Äôt consider weight bonus from unyielding armor or radicool either. Any strength bonus really. I bet you get sent back to 76 sometimes too.
---
Your right, hell I'm looking for a 'reel in' hack/mod for ESO right now.
---
On Adventure Mode, you'll get a random server if you disconnect. When using a Private World, you get 5 minutes to log back in to the same server. I've been farming holiday gift boxes all day with 10 workshops and 10 santa collectrons. I've been disconnect twice due to my router.
---
I have to ask since I am new to the game. This hacking is it only on pc or is it on every platform? Like xbox and playstation?
---
Everything Keretus makes, minus no autoscrap.. I consider these must have
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/users/61621841?tab=user+files](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/users/61621841?tab=user+files)
---
Get rid of blocker and barbarian just work on getting a good set of armor
---
Had the same problem thats why i moved my camp
---
I got a decent set of armor rn I got all heavy bos combat armor unyielding but want to get 3 star versions
---
bruh how did you know üò≥ i‚Äôm doing that rn wtf
---
Pay to be less effected by what should have been included when I paid the full price for the game!?
---
only on PC
---
Just sharing info.
---
Sounds like three of your non-PA armor pieces likely have +Strength as a minor. If you‚Äôd like increased Strength whilst in PA, consider modding the Helmet with Motion-Assisted Servos. Hope that helps.
---
oof ya thats gonna be a big yikes
---
Yeah I try to sneak most of the time to avoid taking any damage. Good third perks would probably be cavaliers or sneak. If your bloodied serendipity avoids a lot of dmg.
---
I'm on PS4. Does anyone got me?
---
This really bums me out. I haven't been lucky enough to get the two Holiday plans or all the mounted heads from the Scorched, and now it looks like it's impossible without risking what little useful gear I have.
---
In addition to those, I use Glowing Meat Piles -- makes finding the meat piles much easier.
---
Might aswell give 76 away since the game is such a flop
---
this happens to me too and the government supply drop boxes as well.
---
Are you in it for gifts or scripts? 
---
My camp is by Camden park, lately when I hop on to a public server there‚Äôs camps around me (it used to be rare to see anyone near me), apparently the park is a hot spot for those scorched, with 5 possible spawn locations for them ( usually out front and by the chow line) but also around the bumper cars, protectron vendor, and inside the coaster queue.
---
If you are just interested in gifts just remember you can build 1 Santatron per camp AND workshop. If by chance you have a private server go take over a few workshops and farm gifts.
---
Oh I misread.  You mean the breathalyzer in the car, not the breathalyzer a cop would give you when he pulls you over.  Makes more sense.
---
Instead of downvoting I can point you in the direction of the imgur app to upload photos and you can post links to them here.
---
I'd love to be able to lock certain vending machines to certain levels.  I like to sell useful items for 2-5 caps for low players...but high level players buy them up lol
---
What I do first is jump in the fissure at the end - after stashing any junk. That puts you at the beginning of the cavern ( again ). Then start picking up the ore one by one. Sometimes near the end or halfway they stop spawning so I exit the server ( I do this on a private world ) and go again. You are put back in the same world.
---
Well yes and no. The source code is the [core](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9781855737426500087-f8-01-9781855737426.jpg) of the engine as it timing (like a engines crankshaft) but the rest of the engine are programs (like car engine parts that can be replaced/fixed/upgraded/toredown) built off the source codes timing and general directories like do this initiates that and so on. So do Fallout and The elder scrolls have the same source code #YES but #not exactly the same engine.
---
I sell missiles a cap each, nukes 10, and 40mm nades for 2 and nobody touches it -.-
---
Torso
---
Of course, my mistake. Thank you!
---
I hit scrap all often and it never breaks down things like barbs, glands, or even baseballs or assaultron heads? If it‚Äôs a crafting ingredient it won‚Äôt be broken down you‚Äôd have to scrap it manually.
---
Government supply drops have been following me all day and I haven't been near collision course or a supply drop tower.
---
Try putting it on your pip boy. Some of the games marked off for me by just collecting them and others I had to "play" them to be marked off.
---
I don‚Äôt think you can. At least I‚Äôve never seen a way. The best you can do is just look at the progress bar you get at the end of a match and get a general idea of how far away you are from the next level.
---
...just gonna leave is hanging I guess
---
Yeah that's what I have been doing but as you get higher in level doesn't it take more to level? I'm only 15 now, I'm sure once I get in the 30s it will be hard to judge rather it's 100xp or 1000xp
---
&gt;The fucking instant a player who installs a mod gets banned, the news is going to fucking say they ban people who use mods they don't sanction because they plan to sell their own.
---
It's not like Bethesda wouldn't do that lol.
---
I don‚Äôt think it does. I‚Äôm level 75 and it seems like the bar moves the same based on XP gained per match as it always has.
---
How did you find managing that? 
---
I had 3 workshops last week and it was a PITA, do you ignore defending and just reclaim?
---
I came back two weeks ago and I'm loving it.  Perfect timing with the event as well.
---
This game is pretty incredible for a first year open world survival mmo with building mechanics.  I'd love to see what they can do with experience under their belt and a few years.  Hopefully the click bait hate train doesn't turn them off.
---
How do you determine your prices?
---
Thank you
---
Yes, I ignore defending and heavily guard my Collectron. I don't even reclaim since there is no need. Collectron will keep doing his thing and I can keep looting his box no problem.
---
This really sucks for those of us who want to play.
---
That said, this may be what it takes to make Bethesda actually give a crap about things. So it may be worth it if we can get everyone to stop playing and paying for a while on PC
---
Honestly I'm not very good at that. I almost always underprice stuff because I simply don't know the going rate.  I knew the tesla was a hot item so I asked for a price check here on reddit. I was told 30k and then offered to sell it for 20k.
---
You just described Shrek mate.
---
Logging back in March.
---
Is it glitched or just your neighbor came to say hi
---
No neighbors nearby,  not even relatively nearby lol
---
They have been cycling bundles lately, so probably.
---
false they no longer require budget. i have had 4 max budget builds all with pets.
---
Oh shit it's really TKSmantis loool that's crazy.
---
I have to agree with the others. missile turrets are the best BUT certain enemy‚Äôs with Guns can sit way back and snipe them.
---
Or is it your crashed santa put himself back together lol
---
How much do plans go for?
---
These guys are essentially replicating all the console commands from previous titles. In other words they have gotten access to the dev console and are abusing it. In previous games you could open the inventory of other npcs using commands. No idea if this would apply to players cause you never had anyone to test it on. Spawning stuff could also be done with commands. Making Legendaries I don't know. How Bethesda managed to make an online game without thinking to make the dev console inaccessible by players is beyond me as well.
---
You‚Äôre my hero broüëçüèª

Also, it goes towards Washington and the Capital wasteland area if memory serves me right (ie east).
---
I'll make sure I wear my pastors vestments and live in the swamp.
---
‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù
---
Their official stance is that if you use mods "the game might not work as intended". They can detect mods (this is why you can't use them in NW but is allowed otherwise) and are monitoring which ones are popular to know what QoL improvements to make later on in the game.
---

---
I mean they removed stacking for a while, then they put it back in with new rules. Most people don't understand the new rules and assume stacking isn't possible anymore.
---
Oh ok
---
Hopefully wastelanders will fix these hacks, if not game over on PC
---
I don't think that's true. I've had the plasma mine for ages. (Not the pulse mine) fairly certain only the grenade had those rare drops.
---
If not I've been hitting it a few times (not including the gifts.) And must be the most unlucky player since looking.
---
When? I have never played nor heard of a game where this has happened. You seem so sure, so what game?
---
I dunno about that, a guy I played with was level zero in the first match, we were the last alive... He ended up being on my team next match, he ranked up to level 3... Just one match zero to three.... If it was the same every level, that wouldn't happen.
---
I think this is a pertinent fact.. the Director of the FBI cool too xo keeps his webcam taped over. And the FBI recommends everyone do the same when they are not using it.. 
---
Bottom line is that if hackers have a target and are determined there‚Äôs no stopping them.
---
I'm also afraid :( I try to avoid other players at the moment, I also think albout closing my vending machines so nobody will come to my camp and hack my stash box...
---
And what the fuck does hiring more people haven‚Äôt to do with the anything either of us was talking about about? You're bitching about how they're more focused on atom shop shit as if anyone working on the the atom shop has jack shit to do with the actually fixings the coding aspect of the game. Do you you want to the to fire the whole art team until they fix all their bugs?
---
Every fucking time there's a new bug idiots like you decide its all the fucking atom shops fault because you don't know shit about game development and it is makes an easy target because Bethesda trying to make money off of this game is somehow a war crime.
---
Upvoted for actual facts :)
---
Dude if they pick the locks they become wanted. Grease their asses and log off after you steal the paper bag.
---
You don't need to glitch anymore. I helped a friend build this recently. It just involves understanding the new rules.
---

Unyielding armor is what you want for a bloody build
---
This happened to me a few weeks ago. I know that back then it happened when someone killed a SB and then fast travelled away.
---
Ok Todd
---
Yea I have a full set of heavy bos unyielding combat armor but I get nowhere near 12k damage
---
I've been playing since day one and didn't realise that and that you can quick swap to previous weapon until friday night.
---
I play on Xbox and have had this happen.
---
Plot twist, Todd is the one taking people's stuff and blaming it on hackers to sell more private servers. Lol, Jk. Seriously though id it's real then PC is in trouble.
---
I‚Äôm a Psyker that‚Äôs how. üòè
---
I am also tired of the clean camps. I want more rustic camp items.
---
Did he get more kills than you? Did he kill more creatures? There are ways he could have made it past you in XP.
---
And maybe at first you might gain levels quicker, but I‚Äôm saying that for a long time now the bar has seemed to move at the same rate for me. Maybe after a certain level the rate stays the same, I don‚Äôt know.
---
From what I understand it's player inventory only, as in what's on your character, your stash box is fine.
---
Both the scotch beast and govt supply boxes follow me pretty much every login...figured it was not to be helped, thx Bethesda glitches
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just my character I am on Xbox and I have been trying to figure it out for hours but nothing I do makes it heal my character.
---
Happens fairly often, not a new bug. Hell it's not even new to this game, Skyrim had the same problem with dead dragons and they just seem to have copied the code straight over from there lol
---
Maybe but it won't be by much and even then it's only like 10 extra xp per kill. That still wouldn't level him 3 time if each level is the same amount of xp. We would all be leveling at least once a round if we last till the end even without killing anyone.
---
u/Valseek
---
u/Ladydevann
---
Please do something!
---
Then go home little one, no one cares about your opinion here.
---
If they can get into my inventory so easily, stash box shouldn't be a problem either...
---
Meh
---
We already know that Bethesda Support didnt react to bug and exploit reports and actually banned people that reported them... they fucked themselves when they started to go after the whistleblowers... They dont deserve any quarter.
---
Tons of people are still playing it every day. If it was dead no one would be playing it nor would they be making new content for it. Why are you even here if you don't like it? You just sound like an upset child who was expecting gi Joes for Christmas but got hot wheels instead.
---
Depends on how it's saved in the servers, the action might only be able to tap in to player
---
Ahh ok I didn‚Äôt think of the fact that if they‚Äôre not allowed in NW but are on adventure mode then they must be ok with it. I might as well give some of them a whirl then, thanks.
---
I generally play a game on my phone
---
I would actually just take a break from the game to be honest, people that can do that easily have a telport/locate hack to find your immediate position too, so you arent safe anywhere as long as you are online, so be aware.
---
Armor is a real pain at the moment.
---
You fixed it to 200 at the workbench and after the third encounter the breaking sound comes up.
---
Edit: Pc elitists can downvote me all you want, You cant tell me im wrong
---
Woosh?
---
Dude did you honestly dont get the point?
---
This glitch has existed since skyrim. I had a dragon skeleton fall out of the sky everytime I fast traveled. I liked to think that it respected me so much after I fought that it followed me around after its death to watch my exploits, or at least that's what i told myself to make it feel less like a glitch.  The first time it happened with a scorchbeast I had to check to make sure it wasn't my old friend travelling across consoles.
---
I'd put it up near 79
---
What is this bug? I've searched on here but can't find anything definitive from anyone. So people can clear out your inventory now?! Is this on all platforms?
---
Lol no one just play then
---
PC only
---
Are you on pc? And are there any specific plans you're looking for?   
---
Asking because, I'm more than happy to drop plans I find from the event for you. I've been farming the event in my private world, and if any of the plans I find are any use to others I'm more than happy to share. The hacking happening in the game on PC rn is scary, and hoping it gets seen to so everyone can enjoy the event :(
---
It isn‚Äôt a fantasy power at all. It is a real power.
---
This should be all of them:
---
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Dp08MM8RKVU6FBedtUCU_f6ntsW9RpVb

Now, what are these shenanigans of which you speak?

Has anyone reported being hacked yet?
---
Its an old bug

GG FO76 is dead.
---
U do know the community sort of asked for that however that wasnt exactly what they wanted
---
Interesting watch, only tip I'd give is maybe dumb the dialogue down a bit.
---
For instance the beginning of the video was quite a long portion of what I found very interesting information about how we communicate with submarines.
---
But I think the vast majority of people will just switch off at that point not just physically from the video but mentally too.
---
Obviously this is just one random guys opinion lol and It got a like from me and I subscribed, good work.
---
I‚Äôd love this. Even as just a location. Something I‚Äôve wanted to suggest since BETA. 
---
Overgrown in the Mire... So good.
---
"We sell your private information to shady ad networks and these EU meanies don't want us to"
---
Why are you here then? If you lost all hope then just unsubscribe and move on. You just sound like a whining child.
---
Black hat isn't to show vulnerable system. That's what white hat is for. 
---
Black hat is to take advantage of said system. Which is never "okay". 
---
Also, in this case, since they could take advantage of said system WITHOUT damaging other parts, it's literally "evilness".
---
Now we can discuss about the efficiency of such an attack and imagine if Bethesda will or not react. But it's not "okay"
---
Hang on, I'll forward you to the Clinton Foundation.
---
Wow, it kind of sounds like these are things Bethesda should've implemented themselves. Hell, they could probably make the community really happy by just going through the most popular mods and integrating them.
---
"Was" James....? Hmmmmm....
---
I'd still say ditch the missiles they're too abundant for the weight definitely not worth the stash space
---
Sadly i think the risk is just too high until this is fixed.... I highly doubt players with god rolls or long play duration are going to chance it!
---
Now there's two of them!
---
Yep, I was thinking the same..   
---
Some choice phrases left my lips during this one.   
---
What got me was how the buggering things got through the security grid that I spent a good hour getting an ID (And being killed numerous times).. They all  (at least 12..) managed to get through the grid, squeeze their bloated feral arses into that tiny lift and then rush me in the pool room
---
GGWP Bethesda.
---
it's a hack that allows for opening player inventories from up to 200m\* and going ham on it.
---
Afaik the original finder hasn't made it public *yet*. Hopefully he doesn't do it, specially when everyone at BGS will be on vacation (iirc they've been made aware of the hack, waiting on official word on it tho)
---
\*: unconfirmed distance. may be less, may be more.
---
But yet you  are still on Fallout 76 reddit? GO AWAY and stopfucking up my timeline you spoiled little brat
---
yeah i have same feelings
---
And paying EBay fees to do so?  
---
These are completed auctions and people are admitting to buying these,so no, even though most people think it‚Äôs insane, there‚Äôs idiots who keep this going on both sides.
---
I tried playing yesterday and was kicked after like half an hour :/
---
So easy to make containers, containers and stash boxes, stash boxes.
---
Why tf was this removed? It is happening.
---
After 800 hours I have to say: WHAT?!
---
PC: Hacker issues that constantly occur in NW and occasionally spill over into adventure
---
Console: Griefer issues in every mode 101% of the time.
---
I'll take PC still thanks.
---
Could? It is XD
---
NIGGR
---
When you down yourself there still needs to be someone to revive you.
---
Yeah the ones who do it make sure their teammates are there to revive
---
Well there's always mines.
---
I think you would spend more time reclaiming workshops than faming gifts. I claim Poseidon plant and Charleston junk yard since they are right next to each other then go through big bend tunnel then to glass caverns. In the caverns kill all the scorced, then wait a second or two then pick up a piece of ultra. This will spawn about six scorched. Repeat this til the cavern is picked cleaned then go check your santas. Should have a pretty big haul of gifts after that.
---
Vault stash box is safe.
---
World container items lost? Sort of. Suitcase, dead body, are world containers. Stashing items in there and leaving that world and then never returning to that world or disconnects and the items are lost forever.
---
There is a 0/0 medical bag world container trainstation character to character transfer method for both private and public adventure worlds.
---
Items are client side, since spawning exploit was a thing just a few days ago.
---
Yeah if you like spendig more money on a game you already paid for
---
That would be so cool if there where areas on the map, where PvP is activated. Generally faction based PvP would be awesome
---
We do need more workshops adding. Maybe at least one more for metal resources, Aluminum, black titanium and steel. All at a quarry. 
---
Fusion core at a power plant or underground base as OP suggested.
---
An ammo one but you need the schematics as the OP said, maybe have it split into producing casings, tips and finished bullets. Just to slow production down abit. 
---
We need another processed food one aswell. I‚Äôm tired of having to make runs to stock up. I‚Äôd like a dog food factory.
---
I‚Äôd like one that produces junk items, but processes it aswell. So you can set it to trash what you don‚Äôt want and scrap the stuff into component parts that you do want. Maybe at a recycling centre.
---
They're game journalists, what do you expect them to do? Lie and say that the game is fun? Or do you expect them to just permanently gloss over this game? Content creators need content. And when it comes to journalism, your content is game news. And when your content is gaming news, FO76 is a pretty easy target because...well, this game is a fucking disaster.
---
I'm just taking a break from the game till there's a bulletproof fix for it.
---
few hours
---
This was in game from the very beginning as far as I remember. Some here mention same bug in Skyrim, but I never seen it there, probably was mended by the unofficial patch.
---
For real. If I cap more than two I get dc,Ed within twenty minutes.
---
So are enemies client side too?
---
Well i guess you dont even have to reclaim them. The santa doesn't shut down when overrun. Maybe just build up a platform for the santa to sit on then build a bunch of small generators to hold the attention of the enemies. Typically though the enemies are just huddle in one area  and not really damaging anything.
---
Decided to make it part of my trades to try and get a Vamp FFR vats Fixer so if you come across one in your travels, you're welcome to the bat and whatever else if interest off my list.... üòâ
---
I don't expect anything from them as they are self proclaimed jornalists just like any other gaming youtuber with a fandom.. I just expect people watching them not to just "take thier word on it" most of them are jus rehashing reddit posts with no to little research.. 
---
In the end of you are a fan of a game just realize that they don't care whether the game fails or succeed unlike you they most likely not gonna even turn on the game.. Most of those "journalists" just reinforce echo-champers and cause more harm then good by strngthining steryotypes that X game is bad no matter how hard the developers work to fix that..
---
The game is ridiculous at this point
---
To be fair they already destroyed there game.
---
None of this makes any sense btw
---
Then stop supporting them?
---
When you're in crafting mode click the left stick in and see if it appears and is just grayed out. If you're missing materials for it and have it set to show only craftable items it won't be listed
---
Idk but dont scortched have an inherent resistence to fire?
---
Radshield stacks..  :) + friends with radsponge lvl 1 so it procs more often. Higher levels of rad sponge require your rads to get to a certain point before it kicks in.
---
u/Yabvone
---
And if these "game journalists" (with no formal journalistic training) use clickbait or misleading images to get "normies" (in this case, average folks who don't even play FO76) to watch their videos, then that's OK?
---
XB1 I hope it is limited to only pc. I guess I am dismantling my camp and no person yo person trades just in case.
---
&gt;25 washing machines
---
Can never unsee
---
Mayhaps a system against cheating, an "anti cheat".
---
Get the fuck out of my office with this magic nonsense.
---
Try it with vats, especially against flying enemies or while in a high place compared to your target. The grenades will curve around and follow enemies with suprising accuracy!
---
I just bought fallout first one month and deleted anyone I don't actually know in my friends list. Private server, all the santa scorched are mine without a worry.
---
Don't need to delete your friends, just set the private server to Team Only and join it solo.
---
Private servers. If you get kicked out of the server upon logging back in you will go to the exact same server.
---
Oh, interesting... Well they are gone anyways. I never talked to them, I just added random people  to help me glitch the glasses cavern
---
I had a spate of the game raining empty supply drops at me.
---
Eventually it went away but I'm non the wiser what I did to be free from my falling boxes.
---
Yes I have a character dedicated to heavy weapons and have 5+ auto launchers. Ordnance Express reduced the weight of the ammo. 
---
During the raid this makes my squad untouchable, and the GECK "boss" part very simple. Sounds weird but get one with less vats cost. Being able to hit stuff with pin point precision using a grenade launcher is beyond words satisfying and effective.
---
Skyrim multiplayer might have that problem but it won't matter cause its not an mmo, when most of the people you play with are friends theres no need to be worried about hackers.
---
This works good, I took about 12 workshops yesterday and just built a platform of foundations with a couple turrets and the collection. Got a ton of all 3 size gifts and didn't reclaim any of them. Blueprint the platform and you can take workshops really quick and just drop it down and forget about it for a while
---
WHA?!   No way!   I can start using my perks again then?  I thought I was SOL...  I am going to try again!
---
Yikes! Maybe I'll wait a bit then.  Thanks for the heads up!
---
This is a solution for some, but I'm at a point that only activity left for me is trading and vending. 
---
Also, this will be an unpopular opinion, but after buying 3 accounts, I will not give BGS another cent until the game is fixed to an acceptable level. It's not a matter of money, but of principle.
---
Why did you buy 3 accounts?
---
The Jim Sterling stuff I've begun to find weird, veering onto the creepy side of things. A couple of weeks ago he posted a video explaining he doesn't want to talk about Fallout 76 anymore, that "we don't need Bethesda". Then this past week alone he has posted two videos about the game, one of them was about the damage resist bug that launched with Patch 16, but that video came out the day the hot fix was applied. Not that I expect a follow up by him. 
---
Jim has become a lazy journalist as of late and it's a shame because I used to really love his stuff.
---
One example i used was gta online
---
I had all my guns removed from my inventory as if i had never owned them and had to rebuy everything
---
This wasnt an isolated incident either
---
Every PC game gets hacked, I consider Fortnite pretty tight and people hack that game Easily.   I know people like LegacyKillah say it's Bethesda sucking at online, but it really is that PC players can be Assholes about Online anything.    
---
I don't take Fallout76 seriously enough for a lost inventory to effect me, but I got 76 F2P.
---
I can let you into my private world when I‚Äôm on I‚Äôm down for running around for scorched
---
Caps mules, man. I'm hovering at around 400k  at the moment.
---
I wonder if theres any issues on xbox with this.
---
I‚Äôll give you that they have made poor choices but destroyed is a bit far....
---
But this way I wouldn't be able to collect other resources?
---
Or do the extractors keep on collecting too?
---
We have 1 people protecting each robot and two who find all items fast then help protect.
---
Also a great trick, if your fire power is not great,is to put a power armor frame in the door to block insects.
---
I mean, would you rather have them not talk about it at all? I'd love to see fallout 76 improve, but since it's quite obvious by now that won't happen, I at least expect its corpse to get dragged around all of the internet as a cautionary tale to other mmo/fallout fans.
---
Jim, yong and joe aren't wrong of noticizing bethesda's fuckups, and if they seem like a broken record by now it's probably zenimax/bethesda's fault for making such a shitshow of a game and managing it in such a poor manner.
---
I hardly ever claim poseidon anymore, the defence events are way too lengthy with the enemies spawning in at odd locations.
---
Yeah I haven't logged in since this BS became apparent.
---
Honestly though I feel like the people who were doing eBay sales probably all knew how to do this from the start, they just didn't because they were making thousands of dollars selling items.
---
Now that there's the purveyor and dupes items are rampant and everywhere their income streams have dried up and they are angry, so they don't care and are publicly trying to ruin the game.
---
That's just my tinfoil hat 2c though.
---
Oohhhh yeah I'm still working on buying all the serums. My caps get spent, especially with the holiday event going right now and the wrapping paper.
---
Marine tactical helmet plan.  Make 1400 caps everyday.  Plus whatever you sell in your vending machines
---
This bundle ends the 28 of january,so there won't be anything before then.
---
Do workshops and events
---
Ahh yes I think I remember this. Something like that with a clear sound notification would be good. Sounds annoying about the pet thing too, I want to tame a mega sloth for a pet but it takes some doing and I‚Äôm not sure how.
---
Hardware banning people would work, but that's way beyond what Bethesda will ever do.
---
Put them behind a building with locked doors on all sides except closest to the machine, behind the doors put concrete barricades to stop them entering, turn on pacifist watch them fail.
---
Yeah me too! I‚Äôm at Whitespring Station with my vending machines at the mo, and like you say when you get a lot of people travelling through your camp it spawns the enemies. I like to try and protect people‚Äôs camps when I visit if I trigger enemies but that‚Äôs just me. Feel your pain my fellow vault dweller
---
Walk everywhere
---
I'm almost hate to tell you how many caps I have lol. My current cap amount is 132k. But I'm a weapons and ammo dealer in game. I sold a weapon last night for 30k caps. It's not hard to accumulate caps especially if you are selling weapons,  armor  or ammo.
---
Focus on one type of weapon for damage perks (ie Commando for auto rifles, Heavy Gunner for heavy guns) and max them out. 
---
Start trading on r/ m  √¢ r  K ƒì t 76. Even selling mediocre weapons, scrap and rare outfits will get you caps. Learn how to craft a serum, farm flux and craft them to get that 1400 daily from vendors. Use Excavator PA and farm Lucky Hole Mine for lead ore so you don‚Äôt need to spend caps on ammo.
---
Hope this helps mate!
---
Careful dropping ammo - there is a anti duping mechanism that looses ammo if you drop too much üëç
---
See I already have an *insane* amount of level 2 turrets at my camp and this sucks the life out of my budget. When I previously used missile launcher turrets, personally I found the protection a bit slow. But for sure I will check that out. Thank you.
---
How do I get that? And how does it make you 1400 a day?
---
Seems to be the popular opinion! Thanks dude.
---
Since ur green can we call you cabbagepool?
---
That would be hard my weapons struggle to get me through the game as it is
---
They were able to spawn the Prydwen because the airship is in the game files. Same for a LOT of stuff from Fallout 4, because the game is essentially a total conversion mod for FO4. The laser musket is in the game files too and actually works.
---
And yes, it's that easy to hack FO76.
---
Maybe not changing anything security related in an engine that's been broken open for more than a decade wasn't a good idea
---
nor have i, seen lots of issue on pc. honestly ive been kinda hoping to come across one of those containers though that have all the plans in it hahaha.
---
Because hacking the fed is a terrible idea and will get you put in prison.
---
I‚Äôm at Whitespring Station, and those pesky mole miners love to do just that. Or they like to come and trash my camp with there own Missile Launchers. I will mix it up between level 2 turrets and missile turrets and see how I get along for a little bit. If not I will just have to move. Thanks for your input!
---
I'm on ps4 if you are look me up my tag is cootdog.  I can sell you a very good weapon. I take caps or 5.56 as payment.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll give it a try
---
It has little to do with weapon damage.  You can get caps in several different ways
---
- kill creatures that have weapons and sell the weapons to robot vendors.  I don‚Äôt do this myself, but some people seem to swear by it.  Grafton Steel is great for this, but even a low level place with Scorched will get. you sellable items.
---
- have a cap stash route.  I don‚Äôt do this myself but many people swear by it.  The advantage is that it doesn‚Äôt take away from your daily limit.
---
- collect all the junk you see and scrap it.  Some can be sold directly and others need to be bulked at a tinker station first.  Bulking requires plastic, that‚Äôs one of the reasons people keep talking about where to get plastic (the other is making shotgun shells).
---
- Produce lots of Chems.  You‚Äôll need the chemist perk and at least the Mentats recipe.  It‚Äôs possible to gather most of the ingredients for Mentats in the Forest area.  The best place for brain fungus is in the Cranberry bog, but there are places in low level areas that have brain fungus (even flatwoods).  There are other Mentat formulas that you can use to increase your investment.
---
- Maximize the purified water that you can collect at your camp.  It really adds up.
---
- Vending can produce an irregular cap flow in addition to robot vending.
---
I‚Äôm sure that other people have their own cap raising methods.  I‚Äôm mostly a vendor.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox is 76 crossplay don‚Äôt think it is
---
Trust me man, I was about level 55 and was struggling to keep over 1000 caps. Then I realised my stash was full of shit, and I put it in my player vendors. Plans, weapons, stims, water. A fuckton of shit. I‚Äôm now level 70 and i‚Äôm at 11000 caps. It feels great.
---
I should add that the point from level 30 - 50 is arguably the hardest, especially if you‚Äôre fighting level 68 super mutants and you don‚Äôt have any meta weapons or armour.
---
I have a lot of turrets. Going to try and take advice from this post and use Missile Turrets too. Definitely a case of trial and error and what works best for you. I am fussy with my building so like it to all look like it fits in the game, big defence walls on entry just isn‚Äôt my thing but I have seen people do some cool stuff. GG‚Äôs
---
So say I put a load outside my camp and an enemy triggers them, would that blow up my camp too?
---
Lol they havent done this yet? I quitted around level 100 like a month after release. People was telling me game is "kinda early access" and I shouldnt complain and accept it. Other tips was to come back after they fixed the game. So hope this is a lesson learned to all those fanboys who completely for free, are defending one of the biggest legal scams in history.
---
Sterling doesn't run ads on his channel and is in fact, funded by his Patreons.  He's not doing it for views, he's doing it because it's triple A bullshit, something he's been very vocal about for a long while now. You may not like him, but he's one of the most pro-consumer voices out there in the gaming industry.  If you're angry at the state of the game this long after release, then stop letting these huge triple A companies get a pass.
---
No! Your right! I have a lot of defences atm but going to upgrade to some missile turrets too. I like being able to decorate my camps too but with the turrets they talk up a lot of room. I just have to suck it up if I want a camp in a prime location ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
It‚Äôs called Private Servers. Not in any way ideal, but it‚Äôs all we got.
---
Quite the post history you've got there bud.
---
Me too. I like walking around in the wasteland and if I come across other camps I do have to study them for a while. Take points on how I could make my camp even better for me and the effectiveness of farming the stuff I need.
---
Right the only systems with out you fucked up hackers.
---
It‚Äôs been patched but the items/NPCs spawned stay because the game thinks their camp items.
---
Ok zoomer
---
Oh look and gone.
---
They should just say fuck pc.
---
I was kinda shocked when i first found out theres people baiting animals to follow them and then hide in other players bases. But i guess its kinda clever and just part of the game.
---
Hanging around whitesprings used to be popular, tagging ghouls, but people just one shot them so is not great way) also seems a bit boring to me.. I‚Äôd find a higher level player to team up with, then go do some wandering and exploring to higher level locations and events, tag enemies and your teammate will kill them off.
---
I did this and found it more fun than glasses cavern ore spawning.  Took the shops in the bog, mire, and divide and only retook, and never had any issues with the santatron or retaking.  I did not bother with extractors myself personally.
---
Was also nice the few times it was a scorched assault.  Wasn‚Äôt often though and believe me it kept me busy.  If I do it again I won‚Äôt bother with the southern divide.  That I think was where it became too much as I didn‚Äôt even have time to hit the good events on the map.  It does seem you need to deal with retake fast as the mobs will mess with your santatron. May be worth it to up defense a tad.  Also don‚Äôt forget your camp!
---
I get that. From a practical level it doesn‚Äôt have much value is all.
---
Once you get a little higher level and can sell legendaries in your camp caps roll in. Also don‚Äôt fast travel so much and just don‚Äôt spend caps for awhile.
---
Last thing I want ot my armor and hazmat suit at the top of a list when I enter a vendor or scrap bench.
---
Events in my opinion.
---
But don't be in a rush. Once you are done with your build you wont appreciate the levels anymore. Having a hard time spending my points at level 90, since most of the cards feels useless. Considering a total rebuild for a completely different build to keep it interesting.
---
White springs after being nuked.  The gouls are level 68. Of course if you are a lower level you would have to go in with friends that are high enough level to kill the gouls. All you have to do is get one bullet hit on every goul and you get the xp. I've taken level 20 and up in the blast zone and after one 3 hour run they have gone up 6 or 7 levels.  We do this on a private server so we can get all of the kills.
---
I haven't tried it with extractors, I hardly ever build them. That's a good question
---
Let‚Äôs not go this far üòÑ
---
How do you lock it? I did not see any option like on the water purifiers.
---
They kept showing up at my survival tent. Was almost starting to worry it was some new Fallout 1st feature lmao
---
Its perfect script.
---
I am camped in the Mire at a pond that constantly spawns radtoads which give eggs, legs and glowing meat. All sell well at station vendors and I can get the daily 1400 caps just from that with hard bargain maxxed out plus a little purified water which is in easy supply from the pond.
---
Also I have started buying serums when I see them at 250 caps or less ... They sell for 500 to stations vendors so if I'm not on long enough to farm the toads then I sell one or two of those and top up.
---
If on a private server no problem.  If on a public server you will fight to keep them.
---
Because your armor has legendary buffs on it for strength....
---
Did you buy it or find it?
---
Thanks
---
Yes private servers are the way to go. I dont regret purchasing the year subscription at all.
---
Well ... If you accept that pencils give lead for bullets then all bets are off! Lol
---
Sell to robot vendors.  They are at nearly every railway station.  There is one at Flatwoods in the church.
---
There is a 1400 cap limit that refreshes every 20 hours.  This is a limit for how much you can sell to vendors.  When people that about 1400 caps a day, that‚Äôs what they are talking about.
---
Take all the garbage that you can‚Äôt use and sell it to the robot vendors.  There are things that you can‚Äôt sell such as ammo and plans.  You can use vending machines to sell them to other players.  Visit a bunch of other player camps to see what other people charge.  Drop mini nukes and missiles because no one will pay for them.  Even common plans will be purchased, just don‚Äôt overcharge for them.
---
To make it clear, you can make money in the Forest area.  Get to level 50 and then start working on your build.
---
I got them supply drops in my backyard two days ago. At least I think they could have some good content inside.
---
If it weren‚Äôt for reddit being a bush Wookiee would be unbearable, though I browse more than just this sub.
---
Soooo you are still a child. Got it lol
---
Not sure about items, but movement is definitely client side. I recall from an old 2018 thread that inventory is server side, but even if that was true, it would not by itself make the game immune to hacking. For example, if the interface presented to the client by the server includes a function that lets the player take any item X from container Y, without real access control, then item stealing becomes possible as soon as the hackers figure out the ID of your player character entity and associated inventory container (I guess that is why the hacker needs to be within a certain distance, so the other player is fully loaded into their world). Similarly, if there is any special "developer room" type container from which everything can be looted by base ID, that can essentially be used to spawn new items.
---
Of course, one can only speculate without real in depth knowledge about the network protocol used by the game.
---
lol i‚Äôm glad you quit your absolutely  toxic. pls don‚Äôt come back
---
Jesus christ.
---
Thats a trader right here xd got  a medicine for every problem... for the right price
---
Wake up man, this game is as shitty today as the day it launched and bethesda has zero intention of fixing any of it. If you want to be a fan of this game that's your choice, just don't expect gaming jorunalists and other gamers to have such low standards.
---
Just hit level 25 earlier today and I'm sitting on about 5000 caps. Pick up everything, scrap everything that is worthless, sell legendaries if you don't care for scrip, craft and sell ammo and aid, sell duplicate plans, ???, PROFIT!
---
Its Bethesda, they cant do anything. But I like the idea
---
Since atom shop painted items can‚Äôt be traded - are they safe from getting stolen ?
---
Great, thanks for the info, will give this a try.
---
Now we have terrorists in FO76. Can"t even risk playing on private worlds.
---
Message me if you need some help on Xbox. I‚Äôm on most evenings in the Uk. 
---
I‚Äôve been struggling with making caps too, but managed to buy about 6 lots of wrapping paper from the vendors. I‚Äôve got a run i do to scrape together some ammo, Chems and food. Not lots at a time, but over time it adds up. 
---
I‚Äôll be happy to craft you a better weapon or add mods to your existing ones. 
---
I personally use a separate set of weapons while in the forest which use a different ammo set, so I can keep hold of the ammo for my good weapons for when I need them.
---
Your ideas fall on deaf ears.
---
You had someone steal your entire inventory in Xbox?
---
It's also perfect for burning through all the worthless 10mm.  The scorched drop more 10mm so they die for free.
---
No idea, they might. They still die in one shot from it.
---
Foley thanks man!
---
They should use this [bug] into a [feature] by making legendary corpses we have missed fall out of the sky when we fast travel. I wouldn‚Äôt complain
---
Then one could argue, without needing any journalistic merit, that the game should have been fixed before selling it to consumers.  You wouldn't buy a new car that turns out to be broken in countless ways and yell at people for being hard on the manufacturer's that sold it to you, would you?  Why should this be any different?
---
Plasma grenades don‚Äôt have much value. You would only learn it for that damn possum badge.
---
I have prime,  what do I do to get the rewards?
---
Make a twitch a count and link it to fallout and amazon?
---
That‚Äôs the scary part: it‚Äôs not grayed out, just *gone*.
---
Thanks .. that helped.. off to try it out!
---
Ok thanks mate
---
I don't see here anything saying it's okay to black hat.
---
The prydwen case is white hat for me. It's the equivalent of sending an internal mail with "you've been pwned".
---
Attacking other players is precisely black hat and it's bad.
---
Toxic? Maybe yes. But I am still right. I am not wrong. Toxic or not, I'm just telling the truth.
---
Basically and the claim reward in twitch prime
---
I disagree, I think you were hyperbolic
---
You can't trade you Pip-Boy either but that gets taken. So I would say anything you have on you is fair game until this gets fixed. Adventure mode, PC version of course.
---
The T-45 Military Paint increases Strength +1 with all pieces painted. Goes with Ultracite as well.
---
Meet up with other low level players and explore together.
---
I don‚Äôt get it, who are they?
---
I think that, since cheaters can spawn NPCs and items, clients have some authority in entities creation. So even if it is server side, they can manipulate it how they want just spawning items and looting them.
---
I mean the handy thing about those types of videos and YouTubers is that you can see their clickbaity intent from the thumbnail/title, and proceed like i do to instead click the "not interested in this channel"
---
For death claw hides... why are you storing them? Isn‚Äôt scrapping them the requirement for the badge?
---
Okay I understand what you mean and I'm changing my mind about it. You're right. Actually I'd like that the game grows up with the comunity.
---
Anyway I'm one of the people that send lot of tickets with issues and possible ways to fix and I see that lot of issues I ticketed now are fixed. I'm happy to do this and see the game better step by step.This matter I think. Thank you for clarifying.
---
Vendor bots and cap stashes are a good easy source of caps, pick up everything and sell it, some outfits are worth more than others but pick up golf outfits, straight jackets space suits and ranger outfits if you see them, bulk junk to sell and off load excess chems to them, the perk pharma pharma will mean you can search medical containers for more to sell. Kill graffton monsters they drop 15-20 caps, I kill the one by Poseidon while I‚Äôm in the area doing the energy plants cap stash run, then head into Charleston where there‚Äôs 2 cap stashes on the fire breathers exam run, keep following the river past the Charleston building and another graffton will pop up, you can then clear enemies from Wade airport for 20 caps reward and they are super mutants so they drop caps on their bodies too, then you can go over the bridge to do the riverside cap stash run and kill the supermutants at Summerville for their caps, from there head to whitesprings there‚Äôs cap stashes and the ghouls drop caps, if your lucky you‚Äôll find a few odd caps in the washing machines in the laundry building,  from there you can go to black water mine as there‚Äôs 2 cap stashes there. You can look up all the cap stash runs online and make your own route taking in a vendor along the way to offload things like assault rifles, combat rifles etc (around 30 caps each) and also any workshops, you don‚Äôt need to claim the workshops just clear the enemies from them for the 20 cap reward if your passing them on your route. Formula P, charisma bobble heads, sweet roll, and grape mentats and hard bargain will get you better vendor prices. With charisma buffing aid items and hard bargain 3 I can sell mutation serums to vendor bots for 500 caps each so if I see serums selling in player vending machines for 100-250 caps il pick them up and sell them off to the vendor bot for 500. Mothman egg omelettes are worth making too, I collect 28 eggs from mount pleasant and with the super duper perk turn them into enough omelettes to usually net me 372 caps or thereabouts, again with hard bargain and charisma buffs. The chef vendor at whitesprings sells the sweet roll recipe if you don‚Äôt have it and the Enclave medical wing should have the grape mentats recipe.
---
Welp I'm glad I didn't get online today...jeez...I guess it's time to stick to solo play on my private server and dabble in NW for the Christmas stuff.
---
Actually, the fallout universe is meant to advance but keep a 1950's style fashion, at that point pencils were lead and not graphite so they would be lead however minute the amount but I understand the confusion around that
---
If you have the chance for a whitespring nuke it's easier to focus on those.
---
How?
---
As an example for farming resources that doesn't depend on being sat on a particular spot ... Free fast travel to Vault 76, run down to the Moonshiners Shack via the carpark where you can shoot some liberators and get steel and some fusion cells (just a bonus). Shoot the 4 ticks before they munch on you and gorge (whereby they explode) and with Butchers Bounty maxxed you get 80% chance to get extra Tck Blood. Run down to the Gilmore Logging (sp?) And shoot the 4 ticks there. Jump to Point Pleasant (mothman town) and you either get ticks or stingwings (or is it bloodbgs). You want the ticks obviously. Harvest the 27 batches of Mothman eggs and then round the corner to the church. Couple more ticks in the graveyard then clean out the church where you find IV bags and bloodpacks plus other charms and junk. Oh and along the way there are charms to be had especially if you equip Pharma Farmer perk which finds extra in med containers. Then maybe trip to Flatwoods for soot flowers, bloodleaf, snaptails, glowing fungus and a run up to Slocom Joe's for the Firecap fungus opposite side of the road. Then back to camp to craft healing remedies including glowing blood packs and stimpacks making sure you equip Chemist and Super Duper. Sell the excess and you also have means to earn the atoms because they frequently have craft healing remedies as a daily challenge. I do that regularly and can get 60 or so stimpacks and other chems from it.
---
You are at a pretty tough part of the game. the other posters gave you sound advice. I will add a couple more tips. 
---
Pharma Farmer + vault 76 - moonshine shack - hotel - flatwood- agriculture center = a lot of chems to sell for profit plus meds and anti biotics. 
---
Green thumb = disease cures and heal salve you can make alot between the vault and flatwoods. also silca homestead has about 350 caps worth of crops you can easily pick and make profit. 
---
the white spring  golf club is a great place for your level - the gazebo has free disease cures in the fountain - you will get mid level legendaries that will help you push through your current barriers.
---
last but not least a mic is the most powerfull tool in your inventory. I am level 380 something. Like 99% of the other high levels if a lowbie shows up and actualy has a mic and is nice they will get hooked the fuck up. if you are like me and dont like being carried with free stuff knowledge is just as readily given. I like teaching people how to fish much more than just giving away free fish. knowledge is always better in the long run. as generous as I am to mic users I am just as stingy with people who don't use mics. if I see a downed player regardless of mic usage or not they will get a stim res but I wont play the "guess that emoji" game and I wont just throw valuables at a new player without any guidance on what they need. I highly recommend you get a mic and use it if you arent already. and dont feel bad about asking. ALL of us have received awesome gifts and support from other players at some point or other.
---
I second this whole heartedly its a bitch getting past that hump.
---
That would remove most of the risk. I hear that Adventure mode is where this thing really shines.
---
I‚Äôm waiting for the code to register incorrectly and do the animation of the dragons crash landing into the from Skyrim with the ScorchBeasts. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs hidden in there somewhere with how stolen the scorchbeast feels from Skyrim Dragons
---
I think he‚Äôs talking about the boxes, not the inventory thievery.
---
Most GTA hackers that I‚Äôve seen do the exact opposite of this. At one point I had billions because a hacker felt generous in an online lobby I was in.
---
Your Pipboy respawns when you reload into a server
---
$8? Biggest scam I ever seen in my life, that shit isnt even worth 2 bucks
---
I experienced the same with gov supply drops
---
You know that's not how it works right? 
---
If someone advertises that they are selling....I don't know...how about a steak that is covered in skittles? You buy this steak and it came with no skittles (unless you pay a little extra) but you decide to eat 3/4 of it anyway. 
---
You can't then sue the chef later because you didnt get the product that was advertised. Because you still consumed the product. Doesn't matter how big of a hate boner you are sporting.
---
By force? Hahahahahaha
---
Are you going to Naruto run in there and threaten them with a katana? 
---
Hahahahahaha
---
What sucks is private servers sometimes don't spawn the Christmas Scorched. So then what...I forget how long private servers stay up without anyone in it...so could you get out of a private server for like five minutes (or however long it is to take it down), then join a new server or would it still be the old server?
---
If it's the same old server...that sucks.
---
Play in private world,no Jag-offs.
---
It is an unique weapon why would you scrip that?
---
I get the collision course bin following me everywhere.
---
Sure. I'd say any disagreement we'd have is purely semantic, specifically how broadly terms are being defined. 
---
If you started stealing people's stuff, then put it on their bed or something, assuming the server doesn't go I'm okay with it. (no harm, no foul) The thing about this is it reminds me of the fallout 1st website having thanks from chan anons; these are not the people you want to negotiate with because they tend to be nihilists, rather than people who are genuinely surprised if it works. 
---
That said, a lot of people are agnostic, take their holidays on regular weeks, and are happy to work Christmas through New Year for extra money. How destructive this turns out to be is a function of who, if anybody, is around to fix it, and how difficult such a process is
---
It is possible that the server exports much of what is possible in the single player games with the debug console, as API functions to the client. Obviously not a good idea for security, but then neither was to ship the game to the public with a developer room.
---
To be fair, if (and that is a big if) there is a major update to the net code with Wastelanders that fixes or at least significantly improves on these issues, then the original plan to release it in November would have been just about right for resource management, as the hacks are now becoming widespread right after the old code would have become obsolete.
---
I'll take one plz, what system you one
---
That has been in the game since July at least which is when I did it.  Guessing it's probably been there since launch.  Cool that it ties in with wastelanders though!
---
It‚Äôs been a while since Iv had to do either but is the helmet better now than the top hats? I remember making sooo many top hats to sell but then they changed the mats needed or something.
---
Why would someone try to ruin something that they are earning cash money off of?
---
Stuff them in vending machine price at max
---
Um hackers are in Counter-strike for decade.
---
GTA V is umplayable on PC. 
---
Yeah we should blame bethesda, because they don't give F about their games, but Hacking is mainly PC problem.
---
If I see you taking all the workshops I will challenge you. 
---
Ps4 as well.
---
I for the last few patches have had my vampire handmade fire alot of rounds stuck at half condition nevwr degrades preety sure its glitched and id like to know why as well
---
Sometimes I'm just waiting for someone to come by and kill me ... So I can reload before I take care of a chore or go get a drink or something to eat... Hell I have even ran to the store while I was bush squatting...
---
It hasn‚Äôt been released yet.
---
The problem with unstructured pvp in fo76 is *exactly* the same problem GTA Online has with unstructured pvp.
---
The problem is straightforward: It's not pvp. It's just griefing. People who enjoy this aren't looking for a fair fight: They "win" by ruining someone else's fun.
---
For pvp to be enjoyable for all parties, it needs rules and a balanced playing field.
---
I store mine in my vending machine at 25k. That way at least if someone buys it, I‚Äôll be rich :)
---
Did something similar on Friday. Grabbed all workshops except the energy plants because I knew they were a pain in the butt. Here‚Äôs a couple of things I learned.
---
- Santatron is invincible and will agro most of the defend spawns.
---
- Santatron collectors are tough but will be destroyed sometimes. Repair costs are cheap.
---
- Never defend, always retake.
---
- Santatrons will continue to collect even when the workshop isn‚Äôt owned by you.
---
- Some locations are bug fests and not worth taking (The farm with a big building can get the enemies stuck in foundation, the bog one has a scorched yao gui that spawns everytime and destroys everything)
---
- Overall though I made around ~100 smalls, 30 Regs, 15 Large from casually checking over ~6 hours.
---
Realistically, it‚Äôs probably not the best way to farm but I was semi AFK during this process and I was farming other places while waiting for Santa collections. I didn‚Äôt bother with collectors as they‚Äôre most likely just going to get destroyed. I did use the ammo crafter though. Hope this helps!
---
I 100% agree with you. My main platform is pc, but due to the place I was living, I had no other choice to play on console for a year until very recently. I can say that NW was really fun to play on console. Energy explosive weapon where almost non existent on the servers i was playing too. Now that I'm back on pc, I can't lie, modding is a great thing, I enjoy a bit more my sessions (constant 60fps and shit helps too). But I can't acces NW because of the mods, and I doubt I can enjoy it with one hacker using a No-Clip ESP Aimbot  to kill everyone. Bush wookies are also part of BR games, even if it pisses some people, that's how it is. To me, hacking in adventure is okay as long at it doesn't give you an advantage on other players. For exemple spawning entities or some weapons and nocliping are okay if you don't annoy bother others. Hacks are hacks and shouldn't be here, but there's a limit between having fun and being toxic.
---
Nah I‚Äôm 100% not confused. Just lucky enough that I‚Äôve had several Plasma Mine plans drop for me. So many that I just assumed it wasn‚Äôt rare. I remember because each time I saw Plasma flash across the screen I got excited until I realized they were mine plans instead of grenade. I just sold the mine plans for base value cause I had no idea it was supposedly hard to get. Oh well.
---
Drop the one off my username on here and that‚Äôs my gamer tag. I‚Äôll happily make you some new stuff, got plenty of junk to use and I‚Äôve unlocked a lot of plans. Plus find as many scorched as you can and get a good legendary while this Christmas event is on.
---
If you let me know what kind of legendary effect you‚Äôd prefer, I‚Äôll keep an eye out from any I find.
---
I'll third that. It was the hardest part of the game for me. It seemed pointless running around and killing level 1-6 enemies, but even a level 40 mole miner was hard to kill, let alone a group of 5 super mutants, level 52-68, with miniguns and missile launchers.
---
Fuck the hackers.
---
When I was taking the time to get workshops, my friends and I would test how many you can claim. We usually got to 7 workshops and the server would crash. Best recommendation is not to take more than 6.
---
This is why I stopped bothering with workshops.
---
Your still young lol. I manage to keep a steady balance of at least 20,000 caps. I usually sell every Chem, mine and grenade that I pick up to the bot vendors. Plus the stuff in my vendors (ammo and stimpaks are bank)
---
Usually that's why some kind of hackers do this. They hack to wake up people/dev' . Some are doing it for money, but imo, this one was made for the first reason. The only problem I see is : if you really enjoy the game and wants to play safely, subscribe to fo1st and play on private session which is not good for the players and worst for BGS reputation.
---
Claiming them all is easy, dont bother building them straight away and ignore the defence missions so round the map take them go round and re take them u an build after first re take.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt. It sets it to 11 if lower.
---
Find someone who has access to private world and join them.
---
I was doing the same thing yesterday.
---
Which he can‚Äôt wear as IIRC Combat armour is a lvl 20 minimum.
---
It happens to me often with a dead scorchbeast. Just falls into my camp.
---
I've even seen a t-stance super mutant appear around every corner of a dungeon. Freaks me out even though it doesn't attack.
---
Thats funny.
---
Would be a cool side quest if you didn't or secret dialogue if you did.
---
I bought the collectron and realized I cant use both it and the santatron
---
I [dunno](https://imgur.com/a/RgrrbG9) what you're talking about !
---
If you played fallout 4 then you have an idea of the most valuable junk items. Make sure to grab those desk fans and paint cans for screws and lead. It's important to have a good stash of supplies for building and repairing. Fallout 1st helps too
---
My anti armor explosive flamethrower is a unique weapon or should I say a legacy weapon.  The perfect storm isn't to me but maybe to some it is.
---
Yeah I've been saying this from the start, a lot of people will set a down arrow and mark "free" where they leave a bag. I don't find this a viable solution, but it can be for the interim
---
I like how you get downvoted becouse you kill AFK idiots ruining the game for everybody
---
lol are you for real? You sound like one of the biggest tools ever. I bet your thoughts and opinions are treasures by many.
---
Thank you! I will explain my shenanigans! I will go up to the nearest player's camp and just stake it out playing random voice lines on a soundboard, mostly the "No, no, why did you do those things" clip, then I will go to public events if they're full and play it, no one can stop me(maybe the mute button though)
---
Yeah when I got there I just hunkered down on a good farming route and hunted lead and legendaries until I could continue my solo journey
---
I would love to get in final circle with another player and agree not to kill each other and see how long before game just decides a winner.
---
And then I had smug twitter trolls sending it to me days after THAT, as evidence of *current* problems with the game.
---
Right, she's just the cm, she can't fix it. I just hope there's enough people left to fix this.
---
It kills you circle goes to nothing last circle before that is enough for one player to stand in
---
This sounds kinda cool!
---
Tip to make easy caps. First get Green Thumb perk- will allow for 2x amount of harvested plants. Available early in game. 2. Get Chemist perk- allows for 2x chem/healing item production. Available at lv 20 or there about. 3. Max hard bargain perk- allows for better prices buying and selling. Once you have those perks start behind church in Flatwoods, follow stream up towards overseer camp picking all the blood leaf, soot flowers and glowing fungus you find. Once at bridge at overseer camp go down other side of stream and collect/ harvest every thing you can. Once back at Flatwoods craft healing salves and glowing fungus soup. Always nets me around 150 to 200 salves which can be sold for 4-5 caps each depending on your perks and and chems you take ie grape mentats. You can also go behind vault tech farm place all the way down to the hot dog stand place and along riverbanks to point pleasant to get more crafting ingredients. Will net ya about 100 more salves. Later on add super duper to get a chance at even better crafting wields. Easy low level area with practice you can almost make daily cap max in about 20-25 mins with no real danger of any serious harm.
---
Invest in serum plans and grind the scorchbeast queen for flux. The average resale price of serums is 300 caps at bot vendors and I sell them at that price at my vendor
---
With all that stuff with hackers that is happeniing recently a lot of people are scared to play. But enjoy, you have private world without Fallout 1st lol
---
Join nuclear winter, pack a bowl, select placement, crouch, bong rips, z to exit, rejoin, and repete
---
It's how I got the 14k for skeleton while smoking and drawing lol
---
You can fix this glitch for 5000 atoms
---
Simple: Just dont play on PC
---
To take less damage from ghouls, use the blocker perk (rank 3 reduces incoming melee damage by 45%) and high radiation resistance, either power armor or some Rad-X. High level ghouls deal a lot of rads, and they tend to infect your character with rad worms almost immediately, which then makes the rads even worse.
---
Hacking problem that allows people to steal your inventory.
---
Is there a way to avoid this? I want to play.
---
Death isn't cheapüòÅ
---
Dying light, New Vegas, Fo4, Skyrim, Morrowind
---
Private server or Nuclear Winter
---
This is jake from state farm....
---
Why not just dump stuff in the stash and focus on some variation of play using common weapons?
---
That's what I'd do if I were on PC.
---
Since survival time gives so much xp it would actually be beneficially for all players to not fight until the end. Sitting in a tight circle singing camp fire songs would actually give everyone better xp, and for the kill xp one could start killing each other at the very, very end before the circle closes completely.
---
It‚Äôs terrifying to know that people on PC like that exist. Hacking and adding in legendaries and other things to prove a point is one thing, but terrorizing people by threatening to take all their hard earned stuff is disgusting. I wish the best of luck to you PC players, I really hope this was just a tease and not a serious warning.
---
Do you have to be invited to private or if you have friend in one just join them?
---
Try reinstalling the game. If that doesn't work, contact Bethesda Support and they will give you a generic reply in two or three days.
---
Commenting to find when the mods delete
---
Sweet thanks
---
I play public all the time. I have never ran into any hackers except for 2 nuclear winter matches
---
Thanks for the post.   Well done
---
PC, Xbox or PS4?
---
I totally agree
---
I was having trouble at that level too. Everything changed when I found a Gatling Gun and started putting perks into Heavy Guns. It was a game changer. I could take on multiple enemies at once and basically hold my own against most higher level ones too. I would take all ammo and guns from enemies killed. Sell ammo in my shop and sell guns to robot vendors.
---
The game does seem to try to make it take as long as possible to build a "perfect" character. You cannot rank perk cards down, but can have them at every possible rank after grinding long enough. And it is easy for a new player to make bad build decisions with all the level gated perks (a lot of good cards require level 40+), and not knowing what will become available later.
---
Ive been playing private throughout this event so the scorched locations aren't farmed out when i get there and so I can set up Santatron's on multiple workshops without PVP people trying to take them from me. Once the event is over I'll go back to public servers. It has nothing to do with being afraid of hackers.
---
Yeah I hadn't actually thought of that but it would be great.
---
Water is important, collect and cook food. Collect and scrap everything until you know what you are doing. Looting is a huge part of this game. You can sell junk to vendbots for caps.  Use any weapon early on and repair as little as possible. Use any weapon you have ammo for then scrap it when you run out.  Level 5 to 10 you can start to get picky. Build super simple camps in the beginning. The forest is rather safe and you need scrap to build. Explore and enjoy.
---
There is a plan for a small backpack on a responder body or in the overseer's stash in Morgantown Airport. The big one you get from earning possum badges and that takes awhile. You need the camera on a dead tourist. If you build the terminal in your camp, it tells you where the body is.
---
Thank you! Any tips are appreciated. It's this game much different than FO4?
---
Go into a private server. 
---
Place down a Santatron at every factory/don‚Äôt worry about defending them. 
---
Hop between them all and collect your presents all day long. 
---
Enjoy your Christmas presents. You‚Äôll feel like a kid again.
---
I've gotta go with glassed caverns but it really works out best if there is at least one other person in there with you. Collect one ultracite or and wait for the mob to spawn. After you kill them collect another ore and so on. With just me and another person we can collect between 15-30 gifts each.
---
Mine are as well cept that 1 i dindnt even know that armor was glitched till they fixed it
---
Brad, you suck.
---
PS4, and thank you for reminding me to edit that into this üëç
---
I‚Äôve dropped all my notes and holo‚Äôs. My inventory is much faster now... it‚Äôs noticeable!
---
It also makes trading nicer for the OP not having to scroll through all the dross...
---
Or a lost loot machine similar to BL3.
---
Selling weapons/armor will not earn you much unless you get a god roll. What sells best in my vending machines are bulk ammo: 5.56, 5mm, 45, and 44. I just get a ton of steel from killing enemies at grafton steel and other locations with lots of super mutants and scorched, then break down their weapons for steel and loot at the same time.
---
Also what sells well is bulk junk, especially junk needed to produce ammo, or repair power armor. Usually sell a lot of bulk steel, lead, springs, gears, plastic, adhesive, etc. Stay away from bulk that does not sell like bone shards, cloth, leather, etc. I sell that to the vendors. Usually I make 1400 per day selling to vendors an about 2k-5k caps in my vending on ammo and bulk junk each play session.
---
Lastly I shop each players vending machines for under priced items and resell them for higher in my machines. I also buy legendary items priced under 100 caps and sell them for scrip and try for a god roll from time to time.
---
Shoot me a DM if you‚Äôd like to join up, or if you have any questions about the server
---
Wait people actually buy that i would hope as a misclick
---
Glowing Caverns has been my best so far.  Clear an area then mine the ultracite ore. That should spawn another group of Scortched.   Rinse, wash, repeat.  The Big Bend tunnel is also a good area with usually 2 - 3 Santa‚Äôs.  
---
If your in Fallout 1st fire up a private server and capture multiple workstations and build a Santa Tron on each.
---
I Know, but I never realized it was duchess' stash.
---
Will do!
---
Make purified water at your camp.  Keep picking it up and selling to vendors.  Any budget in camp you don't use make water purifiers.   If you're playing for an hour, you'll have 20-30 easy.  
---
Every little thing helps.
---
Ok i'll try that, thanks a lot.
---
There's been no proof of any of the hacking being mentioned in this thread, just a bunch of rumors. I think it's all BS. Half the people mentioning the hacking probably play on console and are just saying it because they read it on Reddit but have no first-hand knowledge and if you notice there's not a single story in this thread of a PC player who says it happened to them or vid evidence on YouTube even though you can find vid there of EVERY other hack.
---
May try that üòÇ
---
Arent you the infant thats base got nuked by me then left the server like a Bi###.
---
Thanks very much, I'll keep this in mind
---
Y‚Äôall are so awesome! Really makes up for the others!
---
Thank you, I appreciate the support
---
Everything about this game is shitty code lol
---
*laughs through Xbox headset*
---
You have 5 minutes. I just got dc'd, killed the game out and relogged back into the same server.
---
I've reads somewhere that having lots of notes etc contributes to crashes, especislly when crafting or using your pip-boy. Not sure if it's true but it makes a lot of sense!
---
Cept they are recycled instances not private servers.
---
That's what I've been doing. Combined with the double XP weekend the brand new char i started for this event just hit level 49 last night and is loaded with plans from both gifts and taking workshops.
---
Are you referring to proof of the "inventory stealing hack" that people have been talking about the past couple days?
---
There is video proof of this one, and Bethesda has acknowledged it. This one is real.
---
It‚Äôs been there for a while, at least when I started playing which was right around now last year so it‚Äôs probably been there since launch
---
Not sure but everyone i know has done it... Also thrown all of the out of the stash box too! Faster stash box too!
---
Ahhh ok, that makes sense. Forgot about the glassed cavern completely lol.
---
I keep 'em in my stash, but i dont really hoard anything else. Think i only have some outfits, a couple weapons and ammo. Never saw the point in keeping 20 wepaons ill never use.
---
What plans do you still need? the Scorchbeast(and the Sbqueen) and Mirelurk Queen aren't in game but the rest are, and I probably have extras.
---
I have blueprinted a few quick buildings to drop when I take a workshop that provides power, stash and a fast travel mat.  Saves me time building.
---
Sadly I don't have 1st but that sounds hilarious having an army of Santatrons spread throughout the world to have them get gifts passively for you üòÇ
---
I've been hunting them on my main character, grinding events and workshops, but am finding that many of them are only available for caps and or are insanely rare. Been hunting that dense combat armor mod for ages. I'd be interested in the discord group.
---
Or, you know, a working system maybe.
---
At this point, is Wastelanders even going to be released? Maybe it's just me but I don't see shit anything concrete about a release date on the Bethesda site.
---
tons of ppl on console\* this game is pretty much dead on PC. Try server hopping you will find there are only few servers up
---
Damn he looks mid mutation and everything
---
Yeah.. it's a lot like Minecraft if you ever played that .. you can really do whatever you feel like. I will follow a quest or daily challenge for atoms when I don't know what I want to do. Oh and I wish I would have known this. Tyler county race track workshop. Take it and build a water purifier when you have enough scrap to build one .. you will remember how to and be able to build one at your camp.  Remember taking a public workshop is a pvp event and another player can come in and kill you to take it so store your junk in your stash box, you will lose junk in your inventory and the caps for the workshop if you die.
---
I spent 40k , crafted a ton o' gifts, learned every plan, made my money back selling plans, and still have plans to sell after event to keep the caps flowing.
---
What's the risk on a private world?
---
Less vats cost.
---
Hit me up cootdog level 396
---
It‚Äôs actually been here since BETA. And you can check out the The Rusty Pick for another note from her.
---
Except they‚Äôre not recycled instances. Why continue to spread that misinformation?
---
More/less a bug in the system
---
Don‚Äôt call people stupid when you write like you barely paid attention in English class. You look like an idiot.
---
What he means is there are certain world containers that have no storage limit. You can put items in there and come back to the same server on a different character and take the items you placed in there from your other character.
---
Mad lad
---
I too read reddit while taking a shit
---
This is why i stopped playing games on pc years ago.
---
Consoles for the win.
---
Grinch it and just lockpick other Santa trons while you vendor hop
---
YOU MONSTER MR SCROOGE!! üòÇ
---
Ugh. I have the same problem, but I LIKE having strangers on the same server. I sell them stuff and it's the reason I play online games.
---
I haven't seen any acknowledgement of any sort from Bethesda.  Their standard policy (and that of most game companies') is to never make public statements regarding the existence of hacks or their efforts on countering hackers for sheer purposes of playing the 'long game' on recording, catching, and neutralizing hackers.  
---
That's not even taking into account that it's the Winter Holidays, and most of the staff are out of the office until after New Years.  If I am mistaken however, and you do have links to Devs and Bethesda staff referencing these reports, please do by all means share with us, because I don't want to be giving out misinformation or feeding rumors.
---
But hackers already did that 'mod' on PC. They take what they need and leave what they don't. Straight from your inventory. So no need for a special crate from Bethesda.
---
Why keep them at all (notes and holo‚Äôs)?
---
Not all of us support FO1st. We don't all want to buy a solution to a manufactured problem.
---
I run an RP discord, it's nice having the notes and holo's for reference.
---
You can build Santa travel me at every workshop?!  Wow... I kinda hate 1st even more now...  no offense.
---
if you dont have first you can get some luck if you take the way underused workshops (ash heap, dolly sods, waste dump in savage)
---
I don‚Äôt think this was said directly, but make sure you boost your charisma as much as you can before selling to the robot vendors as you will get more caps per item. 
---
Two easiest ways to do this is beer and grape mentats.
---
Yeah. That's why you only drop 1 instead of all.
---
Ahh gotcha bud - good thinking üëç
---
I had this issue. Check your pagefile system. Windows and the have are installed in a SSD but I setup as 8gb in my HDD.
---
https://mcci.com/support/guides/how-to-change-the-windows-pagefile-size/
---
Genuine question - has this been officially confirmed by other players as to happening? If so, is it wide spread? 
---
I'd always be happy to set up a private world for people if they need it.
---
I've been PC gaming for 30 years.  This is unprecedented.  These kinds of comments just come off as a shitty attempt to try to justify it or cover for Bethesda's blatant incompetence.
---
1st quarter of 2020 was the last they said. Jan-Feb-Mar.
---
It's not confirmed. Just a rumour.
---
I heard a npc talk to me in game telling me im spending to much money. Closed the game right after. Think i was targeted because i was on a lvl 500 character. The sound was ingame, heard the voice from the main protagonist from fallout 4 talking with another npc.
---
I had the same.  People basically showed up and spawned neutral alien ships outside the houses, and they'd run around giving you free money.  I think in my case Rockstar later came back and had some feature in the game where they could tell the cash flow wasn't legit and they'd claw it back.
---
It's based on the average level of the players on the serve and only way to control who is on server with you is fallout 1st
---
I‚Äôve only seen a handful of people who do this. It‚Äôs probably because notes don‚Äôt have carry weight aside from plans. It‚Äôs mildly frustrating but I don‚Äôt think anyone does it on purpose.
---
This is garbage... I‚Äôve played countless NW games since they re-released the Thanksgiving challenges and maybe come across a hacker 5% of the time. 
---
When you do, it‚Äôs an easy fix... Block and Report them through the Social Menu and you won‚Äôt ever be paired with them again. The more people who block them, the harder it is for them to get into a lobby to begin with.
---
That is just the game.  Thank you bethesda.
---
Same problem with my ps4. Fallout 76 is the only game that freezes and has trouble running
---
I find it fairly easy to max out my 1400 caps per day at robot vendors by exploring a nuke zone with the Green Thumb perk equipped to pick the raw flux there, then going to a vendor and equipping the Hard Bargain perk and taking Grape Mentats. By doing that (my charisma is at level 6 normally), each flux I sell is worth 8 caps I think. A nuke zone can give me up to 300 nuked flora depending on how well the zone was placed. 
---
TL;DR
---
&gt;Goes to nuke zone with Green thumb perk
---
&gt;Picks nuked flora for raw flux
---
&gt;Goes to robot vendor
---
&gt;Hard bargain perk and Grape mentats
---
Higher charisma = Better rates
---
What is you are not the only one crashing, but it is the whole server instance. Don't get me wrong they could have a queue for you to join waiting for a rebuild of that instance, but it would also show how unstable things are. Besides they want you to pay for "stability" with private servers. Win Win for them, put out a crappy product and get people to pay extra for a half-assed solution.
---
How can I get rocket turrets????? I think you have to be a level in science to get them??
---
I know the game has problems. But some of the game crashing might be from internet providers being overtaxed . I took over every workshop and my game didnt crash. Mine doesn't crash that often when it does I can log right back in and still own everything. I am on a private server. I won't take over public workshops because I could never get anything done someone would come and kill me.
---
Ah. Ok. I thought it was just the players (including me) in that particular location.
---
Not true. My wife and I play together on Private. My char is 57 and her's is 50. We still encounter enemies (in high lvl areas) between lvls 23 and 68.
---
I did this yesterday. Claimed every workshop in a private world... Just lay down a foundation, put the Santatron on it and build metal walls all around it. Set up a couple of turrets and you're set... Only do the reclaiming, as defending makes you wait for waves which is a waste of time. I was pulling in 100+ gifts per hour between this and Poseidon, Glass Cavern, Berkeley Springs runs.
---
Nope me and my girlfriend play all the time and we can be on a private server across the map from each other and cause she is level 100+ and I am around 70 we find the the enemies are between the two of us.
---
Agree. That would be a nice option.
---
Thanks. I was just gonna ask about this. I need the brick plan.
---
The guy that does the monthly bug list aten_ra or such (very trusted poster) has also verified this bug. The person that posted the video only mentions Bethesda acknowledging this, no link.
---
Wait, that's possible?
---
You do realize that unless you set your servers to invite only, your friends can still hop on your server without you knowing it.
---
My expectations were low but Jesus Christ! I didn‚Äôt know it was that bad!
---
And if they hop on their friends can also hop on by way of joining them, so the private server is not private.
---
76 is not cross platform.  I sell collected enemy weapons to vendor bots for caps.  I have runs I do each time I play to finance my quests or builds so I rarely finish a day with less caps than I started. Captainnoob on YouTube does videos on weapons and perks to amp them up. I learned a lot there. It helped me out quite a bit to get better damage at lev 30 especially since I have a mixed build going right now, riffle, shotgun, automatic, stealth.  I have found that team play is kinda rare so I like the mixed build but it is weak compared to specialist builds.
---
When you launch game and join a server, the load screen shows you as level 0. This is used to calculate the NPCs you spawn in before your actual level gets loaded.
---
Yup. I can't use technical data at all and have never been able to. 
---
Granted, it was like, over a year ago now, but it still irks me.
---
There is a video proof and even Aten_Ra confirmed it's possible. What more proof do you want?
---
Are you sure you cannot do it? That doesn't sound correct. 
---
Go to the asylum and once inside the main entrance to left through a hallway opening and there is a board there with a note that you click on to activate the quest. 
---
I've activated it long after I've completed other parts of the main story on a couple of my characters.
---
Added an SSD to my Pro which cut my load times and number of crashes in half. Beyond that, don't think there's anything to be done. Bethesda needs to address it.
---
But if that were the case then every server I‚Äôm loaded onto the enemies would be low level, right?
---
care to show that video proof?
---
That's some bullshit. How did you skip it?  I'd like to avoid whatever it is that just skips it, wife and I are currently doing the BOS missions.
---
100%. I'm level 230 now with 1300 hours in, everything done, and occasionally I'll still go try to fuck with any of the BOS stuff. 
---
Button and Elevators at Asylum are locked out for me, no quests start from note, technical data doesn't do anything etc.
---
Happend to me too. After completing the quest in the asylum you have to go to that big  City. I forgot the Name. But i went in the enklave Bunker First and Then the bos quest failed.
---
1 - Build a PC. 
---
2 - Have the same problem.
---
3 - Delete forever, never to play again. 
---
If you don't want to build a PC skip to step 3.
---
When "something a lil weird happens" on Festivis, that's a Festivis Miracle. Also the airing of our grievances are perfectly fine.
---
There are a small handful of the notes that you need on you sometimes.  I used to store them, but got sick of being told to do back to basics again.
---
Ah, victory!
---
I‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt have vending machines because you want to stay hidden. You can build the vending machine and then just don‚Äôt power it,  and put your stuff in there. You‚Äôll remain hidden.
---
Not this old shit again give it a rest no one cares I got fallout 1st and I don't give a shit  what you or anyone thinks of it
---
I beelinded the bunker for the first few days after release cause i wanted to catch up to my friends. I'm still unsure of the How to be honest.
---
It's literally the 4th post in Hot.
---
My condolences, fellow outcast.
---
I happen to be a weapons and ammo dealer.  But I conduct my business on the two fallout committees.  I can be on my private server and receive messages from playstation network.  So it works for me but I guess not for everyone.
---
Oh i think it's good to air concerns and such , bethesda needs to stop the hacking thats going on , but to cause a frenzy and spread false info is never a good idea
---
Game was already destroyed by Bethesda. 
---
Maybe they'll actually fix the game or stop development.
---
This does not sound accurate at all.  You cannot 'lose out' on the quest.  There might be some server specific glitches, as there was on the Rose questline, that require non-intuitive backtracking to a state where you last were checkpointed on the quest, but to my understanding there is no way to permanently lose out on the BOS quest.  
---
You may also have been trying with the current bug (feature?) for the Forbidden Knowledge quest that disallows any previously obtained Technical Documents from 'triggering' or fulfilling the quest.  You have to pick up a brand new Technical Document in world, after having found Scribe (whats-is-name)'s terminal on the upper floors of Fort Defiance that actually starts Forbidden Knowledge.
---
Obviously you must obtain access to the upper floors, by doing the BoS questline.  This is started by going to Abbie's Bunker and reading the terminal entry Defiance Has Fallen, before proceeding to Camp Venture and then Fort Defiance.
---
I did the Enclave quest first before even starting the BOS quest at all.
---
Luckily that didn't lock me out of the BOS stuff.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I'm available. PSN is AnthonySunkist.
---
Or they can just fix the bugs that are causing the crashes. Haha!
---
Yes. There‚Äôs proof on this sub already.
---
Well the elevator and technical data don't do anything until you've completed most of the BoS quest line. 
---
Whenever I click on the note right inside the asylum it activates the first quest called "Defiance Has Fallen". This quest doesn't show in your pip-boy quest tab?
---
Red menace
---
PVP can be fun I do t see why people are so scared of dying lol it's a video game....
---
&gt; I don't even reclaim since there is no need. Collectron will keep doing his thing and I can keep looting his box no problem.
---
oh holy shit.  i know what i'm doing today.
---
Or you could tell people your belly button is a second penis
---
Just the first. When you return to the main menu (no exit game) the next login is normal.
---
No problems on Xbox one X. Not yet at least.
---
Go to private server -&gt; capture as much workshop as you can -&gt; build a santatron for EACH captured workshop (Yes, you can do that) -&gt; wait a couple of hours when the shit got collected -&gt; collect the shit from the santatron station's -&gt; PROFIT :D
---
Why would the mods delete this post?  I'm sure they want word of this to get out as much as everyone else does.
---
Ah OK.
---
Yes, I have sold a couple that way. Maybe a mistake, or maybe they're too lazy to go and find one to complete the quest.
---
Arf
---
But Aton Ra doesn't play the game on PC. Also, he only speak about possiblity. The bug is not confirmed.
---
Aren't NW and adventure mode completely separate besides the rewards from challenges?
---
you can put power conduits on the tree base and hang lights of that.
---
Well some cant afford the subscription fee and others feel like you do and still others may have different reasons.  Whatever the case may be I like being able to launch a nuke and invite only who I want to the event. If you launch on a public server you have to fight people who contributed absolutely nothing to the launch. Then they go in and kill the legendaries and you get nothing.  Also on a private server I can farm materials.  I can collect 800 pieces of lead in one run. Then leave the private server and log onto a public server for 20 minutes then log back onto my private server and the private server is reset. This means I can farm lead and enemies again. So again it's not for everyone but I think it was a much needed addition to the game.
---
Seems like that‚Äôd be difficult to gauge, since most high-level enemies (not scorchbeasts or deathclaws) are lower than YOUR level (Whitespring ghouls, West-tek Mutants, etc), spawning only as high as level 68.
---
They're rare. I spent three days straight grinding like eight hours a day (visiting scorched spawn areas, upwards of ten workshops open with a Santatron in each), and as i was opening all my gifts before i went to bed last night, the very last gift i opened had them. I have so many other duplicate plans from gifts, but just the one icicle lights drop. They're there, but yeah, pretty rare.
---
Craft and sell serums to robot vendors for 500 caps each
---
Agreed
---
Stuff like this that I don't think about. Thanks.
---
I‚Äôm waiting for the feats of strength with Todd Howard
---
Good point. Check the terminal in Abbies bunker. This is the other way to activate the quest. I usually just click on the note inside the asylum entrance.
---
Hahaha go ahead and loot me what are ya gonna get a 1 star legendary and 12 caps I've had a rough time playing the game from the start I'm lv 50 something and still dont understand how to build a good charecter lol I can barely take on lv 50+ enemy's and if a player walks up and starts attacking me forget it I'm fucked I've tried power armor and cant get enough cores to use it I've tried heavy guns not enough ammo so now I just kill low leveled scorched with a sledge and hot to find ammo had been working at that for about a month when I thought I had enough ammo to do the quest I wanted to then I got 3/4 finished with the quest crashed and had to start again with almost no ammo so back to hammering low lv scorched for me so I dare the hackers to take my shit give me a reason to start again
---
So basically just fire everyone and make a whole new game?  Sounds pretty easy.  Hop to it!
---
You ever play GTAO on PS4?
---
This sounds like Bethesda 
---
has grounds for a major lawsuit against these people 
---
I know some  video game company's 
---
have sued Hackers for selling cheats
---
Unfortunately, blocking doesn‚Äôt keep you from being matched with them again.
---
lol you mean a console.  Macs aren't locked down by any stretch.  It's fundamentally an OS issue.
---
Same here
---
I never actually found that the note at the lobby of Fort Defiance starts the questline.  People swear to me that there is one there, but in my multiple playthroughs I have not had the BOS questline trigger through this method.  The only guaranteed method I know of triggering the BOS questline is to first visit Abbie's Bunker in the Mire, as part of the Free States questline, and find her terminal entries.  One of the entries will reference the BOS, Fort Defiance, and Camp Venture.  This will immediately trigger the start of the BOS questline (which you can then follow without having to complete the Free State's questline), that requires you to investigate Camp Venture.
---
Their friends cannot join if the server owner is not friends with them.

You are all naive.  I have been hacking on consoles since before PC, people just think it‚Äôs less likely which is great.
---
 
---
Some games you can just edit the saves, others you can have run from modded firmware or a chip you can buy for like $30.  Theres little to no protection on console games.  You can hack freely on Fo76 it‚Äôs just no one notices.
---
Ha you watched to many young yea videos
---
Its simply bullshit, data knows no distance so why it should only work in an Radius of 200m? Are the Bytes then close enough together in the Server harddrive or in the mighty Internet?
---
Or did bethesda set this distance to protect us from ingame Intercontinental hacking of from Chinas blowed up coast to us in Virginia? So only our Friends and beloved could Steal us our shit out the inventory?
---
This hole thing is simply bullshit, an Propaganda against the game or just an joke to generate likes
---

It could just be my subconscious playing tricks but I turned off the boost mode and turned on supersampling. I feel like it improved.

Weird.. it has worked for me and my friends.

---
1. Need Caps? Go to point pleasant and farm all the mothman eggs. They are in two spots, by his statue and at a shrine beside the river not far away. Cook them. Keep a couple to boost your Charisma when you trade the rest for caps at a robot vendor. You should clear 250- 350 caps per visit depending on charisma, grape mentats, super duper etc.
---
2. Need legendaries?"**Leader of the Pack** is a regular event that occurs near the race track/county fair in the NW. You will have to kill three groups of 4 level 10 wolves. Each group is led by a legendary who will drop up to a level to legendary. Usually it will be trash (which you can convert to scrip), but you may get some useful items like instigating/furious rifles/sledgehammers or chameleon/autostim armor.
---
3. Need Both? **Uranium Fever** at Blackwater mine is essential. As a low level player you will get creamed alone, but as long as there are others there all you need is to tag the moleminers to get the XP and the 3 leveled legendaries (up to level 40 and up to 3\*) that drop. Only downside is expect the occasional asshole who will oneshot them before you can tag (you need only hit them once) them.  Best weapon for that is the tesla rifle, but an automatic on spray can be useful. You can potentially collect enough loot that you can hit the cap max at the robot vendor just selling weapons. Don't worry about lumbering out to the whitesprings RR station overweight: take everything! Also there is a decon shower right by the entrance to the mine.  
---
4. TAG ALONG. Regardless of your level tag along for any public event (except scorched earth till you have a decent weapon) as long as there are other players there AFTER YOU PUT YOUR JUNK IN YOUR STASH. You just need to tag things to benefit.
---
I mean maybe but ps3 and ps 4 are just as easy to hack on you just download hacks and put the on a thumbdrive and plug it into your ps that easy I'm not saying  pc is better or xbox is better I'm just saying people fucking suck lol I have an xbox and a ps4 and a pc I enjoy pc gaming just as much as any other type of gaming if I see hackers in any lobby on any system I just leave the lobby
---
Yeah because it's been such a cluster from the jump that it's rare to find anymore, the "newer" people don't really know. Been here since beta and we all had to figure this shit out on our own, most newer players don't even realize it's a quest lol they get everything handed to them. Not all, but... you feel me lol
---
No. This is only misinformation.

"FO76 is broken AGAIN" may be clickbait, but its also not wrong in the slightest, and that says more for their reputation than most journalists.

Okay, that part is fixed, but unless you switch to invite onlythen you still have your friends list that can come uninvited any time your on.
---
Most of the times I‚Äôm running 2 pylons, also they could have a bloodied build.
---
heavy fines and jail times for the little pricks 
---
its not only destroying Bethesda's property rights 
---
its also taking money from people who have paid for the game and have time and effort invested in playing
---
Impressive. Are you selling all those duplicate plans?
---
This can be a good thing on occasion. If you kill an SB or even the SBQ and can‚Äôt loot it, FT away and then it‚Äôll often drop at your new location and you should be able to loot it.
---
Happens after completing the crash course event at the Morgantown Airport.

---
Can you clarify on what you‚Äôre talking about op?
---
Agree to disagree, sorry! I like PVP like that, I enjoy the tension and fighting off aggressive players. Rules and structure are great for matched based PvP but open PvP should remain lawless. Especially in a world without law like fallout. It's funny that you say that open PvP is bad and other modes good and in the same paragraph you note that the lawless servers have much more activity despite the more "moral and fair" PvP servers having better rewards being empty. Clearly there is something fun/satisfying about it that can't be recreated otherwise.
---
As for open PvP having a place in fallout.... May I remind you that the setting is a lawless wasteland? In a series that has a history of letting you choose to play an evil character if you wish?
---
I have seen level 70+ scorched.  I have seen level 70+ assaultrons.  Both of which were in the white springs area...
---
Encrypted rewards aren‚Äôt worth the effort even with a full gang of experienced players. I usually hold down one pylon an entire session and I spend more in stims then I ever get back in rewards. The imposter should drop 3 star loot every time
---
No clue what he's on about.

Activate pylons, sprint around avoiding robots, wait for everyone to activate a pylon, it makes sheep squatch vulnerable, fuck that guy up. Takes a few tries

To my knowledge, the game obtains world and player data through requests to the server which return JSON formatted data. Once a player enters a close proximity, it starts a UDP stream to gather more information about that player such as where they're looking, emotes, and most likely their inventory data...
---
This story is credible, especially given the poor netcode implementation in this game has already been proven time and time again.
---
I feel that man. I feel that
---
I have my fusion genny in a sealed up room upstairs in my camp and the fuckers spawn in the room I hear munch munch bang bang and I instantly know where it's coming from so I've put a window in the wall so I can blast them in the face
---
I have a bloodied build but I radawayed so I could stay alive longer, you‚Äôre not really hitting things until the ‚Äòsquatch is vulnerable
---
Worth a try
---
Gave it a go for a few hours.. sweet!

An unexpected bonus was that it gave me a chance to try some builds I‚Äôve been thinking about .. (Pipe commando worked really well in the forest)
---
Players are busy hunting Santa gifts.
---
It's very hard to learn to do something if you've never done it, or ever been there for a successful run. If you expect a high level to always know literally everything, then you have some highly unrealistic expectations. You have no idea if they ever ran the event, or know fuck all about it. I've personally only been to one successful run because it's a fairly difficult event if you don't have a full squad that can tank pillars, dps, and that won't get steamrolled when curious newbies roll up to see wtf is going on, and pump the difficulty up.
---
What is your IGN?
---
This times a bagillionzilliongabilliontaint
---
Is this in reference to the bug where people can take others player items when trading?
---
Everybody has just about everything already.  I started making geae for level 10 through 40 and it sells pretty well.  That and ammo.
---
The original post talking about this seemed a little vague to me. It also doesn't really make much sense that they would be warned ahead of time about it.
---
1. It's Christmas; lotta players away from game.
---
2. Market is saturated; almost everybody has everything.
---
3. If you're on PC, there's a rumor about malicious hack going on; people are on private servers.
---
Could just be luck. Sometimes I'll go days without hardly selling anything and then one day I'll barely be able to keep up with keeping my machines full. 
---
If I'm focused on making sales and I'm hardly selling anything after a while of being in a server I switch servers.
---
It‚Äôs a feature. GOSH!!
---
Wrapping paper is currently what most people are spending caps on - haven't had many sales either recently
---
I'll give that a shot. Thank you. At this point happy to try things. =P
---
Graftons a good spot I go up the mine belt snagging dat ore then up to the top of the next platform thing and just snipe

They are great if your farming bots at white springs I use it there once in a while for fun and power cores

Wish I could add my PA to the wheel. Too many times I‚Äôve been loaded into nuke zones
---
You're welcome.
---
I want to display notes like the Propaganda Flyer and You Have Been Insulted in my camp as part of my collection, so I like this idea.
---
I currently use an unconnected and hidden vendor machine for protecting items I don't want to scrap by accident. I keep it in my generator room and price everything at 25000 just to keep it safe.
---
If you have Fallout First and that happens most if not all of your workshops are still owned and running. In some cases you may need to reclaim but whatever defense you've built will still be there
---
I get that. What I mean is that noone ever even bothers to fast travel to my camp to check it out. And when they do they stay for five seconds and immediately leave. Even though it takes two minutes just to scroll through it all
---
My current playthrough I didn't do any story quests till 50, joining the enclave was the first quest I did and I had no problem joining the BOS when it came time. That's a wild bug you got there, mister.
---
Make a good point I guess. Btw on xbox
---
I'd quite like a "Tape Deck" display item for our camps. Maybe a machine were you can listen to any tape you like without having to carry them around in your inventory all the time. I'd happily sit in my camp listening to a 'Tales from West Virginia' whilst I'm just decorating a camp or crafting some items.
---
Maybe I should just start pretending I'm selling giftwraps and presents in the vendor. Might get more customers that way
---
I dont know about the workshops because I dont even fool with them on a private server.  But I do do this farm lead and steel and gun powder. As I make my run on a private server I collect 800 + pieces of lead,  2500+ steel pieces,  and enough acid and cloth to make gun powder. Then the best part of it is I leave my private server and log on to a public server for 20 minutes or so and then log back onto my private server and the private server is reset.  This means all the lead and gun powder and steel is reset also.  Private servers are a gold mine for resources
---
Damn that sucks man. I wish Bethesda would get their shit figured out and get this mess fixed. But we all know that won‚Äôt happen til after the first.

Was put with a rank 100 in nw and he didnt know how to launch a nuke lol
---
Ok thanks I hve 7 bc I find them a lot so I guess I‚Äôm sitting on a gold mine
---
Top of the world is great for junk farming.  Ski poles and skis are everywhere.  Go up the tower and load up on 10mm guns on the 2nd floor and frags on the top.  Grape mentats will increase your sale prices too.  Also you can bulk scrapped junk and sell.
---
I thought this was the case until tonight. I dropped some loot due to weight and went back for the loot after a bit of storage juggling. Got disconnected and logged straight back in to a new private server.
---
Isn't the literal entire game of Skyrim hidden in the code? I remember something about it launching Skyrim instead of the normal game sometime around launch.
---
This
---
Depending on what setting they have, if they have team only you cant join them however if they have it on friends only you can just join at any point
---
Yeah, Bethesda has just made a game purely to be expensive and not that good, a short term project for cash.
---
A lot of players struggle with this event, It also sucks for bloodied builds which are a majority these days. I run a bloodied rifle build as my main now and the only way I found  I can tank pillars is by using my VE combat rifle and constantly shooting to regen health. Most players dont have high tier vampire weapons to make this viable though
---
i‚Äôm level 186, haven‚Äôt done it yet (though that‚Äôs not for trying) i‚Äôve never caught the event when someone else started it and no one joins when i try.
---
god i want the plans that drop
---
Sad but true
---
Lmao, or you can literally just press x to initate auto-walk and you‚Äôll never be kicked
---
You should have known what you were getting into. There were red flags surrounding this game since launch. Now deal with it. Boo hoo.
---
I've had 40 sitting in my machine for a week now, nary a one sold.
---
.
---
Sad times.
---
What are you trying to sell?
---
Both are to blame if the bypass is trivial to begin with.
---
The game's running on a server, which bethesda should have full control of which logic runs through it. Last I checked, car companies don't control reality.
---
Shit comparison.
---
How many items are you selling. If you have less than 10 in armor and weapons people tend to not visit. Yeah it sucks. I with there was a way to show a difference with regular items and legendary. I hate going to a camp with 50 weapons and they are just normals.
---
Outfits are a shaky endeavor.  Most people with the odd outfits, have them already.  The ones they don't have tend to be the extra rare ones that sell for 10,000 caps or higher.  Newcomers that don't have the outfits ingame, are less likely to blow several caps on an outfit impulse buy.
---
I'll need examples of what you consider semi-good Legendaries.  Because, as much as I hate it, there's a snobbery that's infected the trade market that says if you're not selling a min-maxed optimum item, it's scrip-bait.  
---
Plans should **NEVER** be based on the suggested ingame entries for prices, **EVER**!!!  Those prices are so skewed, they're worthless.  Rather, you can take a look at what some of the higher end player vendors seem to be selling, how much they ask, and what seems to be staying in the vendors and what's going fast.  For example, no one is going to pay the suggested price of a Mole Miner Gauntlet plan, or even half that.  It's basically so common, as to be worthless as toilet paper.  I think I had a few left in my inventory, that I let sit around at 25 caps and they still didn't move.  Likewise, some items are underpriced based on demand.  Any Prime Plan that works for high-demand weapons like Combat Rifles, Handmades, and so forth, are going to be priced at a higher value than their suggested 500 caps.  
---
Your location is not bad, but consider that most of the traffic in the Forest is either: 
---
* 1) New players and low level players who don't have a lot of caps.  Or... 
---
* 2) High level players who are already own near everything and are semi-retired and enjoying themselves in a quiet spot.  You might find better clientele over by the train stations at Top of the World and Sunnytop Ski Lanes.
---
Suck my dick
---
When cheaters have more control over the game and your character than bethesda support, it's no longer a scare, it's reality. The dupers that created thousands of tse gatling plasmas and be tesla rifles still aren't banned, the level 105 aimbots running around NW still aren't banned, the people spawning in alien commanders and preston garvey aren't banned. This is a joke and in no way acceptable, ESPECIALLY from a publisher as big as bethesda
---

Welcome back!

Amazon Prime!
---
Like the other guy said about plans, i charge 10 caps for all my plans apart from rarer ones and they still take days to sell. Also most people seem to have no interest in legendaries anymore unless they‚Äôre god tier so best way to price them is scrip pricing! I‚Äôm finding it really hard to sell decent explosive weapons nowadays
---
A nice concept, but sadly will not likely happen. Adding another extra inventory to every player that they can fill with junk spells doom for server latency. Remember the #1 bogging servers down in the player stash. You're essentially asking to double the ammount of lagg.
---
OP is clearly a "glass half full" - kinda guy.
---
This is so old and easy to replicate just pick ups melee and use a stim.
---
Oof. Man I wish I would have just got a slim. I really only got it so I could get an upgrade and play fallout in my office. Ended up sticking this in my office and I just suffer if I want to play in there. 
---
May be time to look for someone with a slim to trade me I guess.
---
You can find places on the map with spawn rates very low to zero. I haven‚Äôt had defensive turrets for awhile.i would rather have a pretty home in a safe neighbourhood.  You just need to move out away from the low income housing for mole miners.
---
Most of the popular spots: whitespring, West-tek, general‚Äôs steakhouse, huntersville
---
Why are you happy this is ruining the experience of so many player who actually like the game
---
What level are the enemies?
---
Zap Brannigan has spoken about the dangers and how they don‚Äôt exist, we‚Äôre safe
---
It just works.
---
technically all true - the problem is the +100% was to the base of 25%
---
if you shoot a two shot weapon with your damage numbers up you will see 2 bullets strike your opponent - each with 62.5% damage for a total of 125%
---
So factoring in the same 2 bullets existed each with 125% of the base damage it means you hit with both bullets the total of 250% - factoring in both of those bullets also would do 100% more (using the 125% of the base) thats 500% damage output
---
You basically have to factor in the fact there actually is two shots meaning everything is doubled
---
I played with it for a while yesterday. I used it on my rifleman with vats and killed myself a few times. Lol. It was a lot of fun, but could never be a main weapon. It breaks pretty fast. But I definitely had better luck killing when I used it in vats!
---
What are you selling? Where are you located? And are your vendors connected to a power source?
---
Just because his IGN isn‚Äôt Aten_Ra doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not playing
---
Whitespring has been spawning almost exclusively level 9 enemies. West-tek is spawning levels 5 thru 10 outside and level 35 inside.
---
Funny they start banning those helping them fix bugs, then this chaos starts.
---
You reap what you sow Bugthesda.  You reap what you sow.
---
LMFAO.
---
Sort by weight or value, will bring the plans and recipes to the top.
---
What are you talking about? You can do any quests in any order. Did you read terminal in Abby‚Äôs bunker?
---
I found out that private servers can also be used to transfer items between characters
---
yeah and basically impossible to use in vats 
---
Honestly I prefer either Anti armor / Vampire / Junkie - I know a lot of people like bloodied but I feel like they handicap team play since a team buffs through charisma don't work with them like rad sponge
---
What is your run for lead, steel, acid, and cloth?
---
You can‚Äôt use technical data until you start the BOS questline..
---
I'm a weapons and ammo dealer in game.  I conduct business on the two fallout 76 communities . I have no problem selling there.
---
After reading all the comments, I'll offer what advice I can.
---
* 1) The Pylons should have the tankier players activate them.  DPS (Bloodied) should snipe from the shack roof.
---
* 2) For gods sake, if you plan to be on the ground, equip the Blocker Perk.
---
* 3) Targets of priority are as follows:  
---
    * Colonel Gutsys
---
    * Imposter
---
    * Everything else.
---
* 4) If you can, use targeted VATS on the following targets with the Concentrated Fire Perk.  
---
    * Colonel Gutsies (Thrusters)
---
    * Imposter (Combat Inhibitor)
---
* 5) If you can afford it, get yourself a Railway Rifle and/or a Troubleshooter Weapon.  RR's pretty much ignore DR, so they will tear through the Imposter and Gutsies like paper.  Troubleshooters can often be found for cheap, and lend themselves quite handily for this event as well as Missile Silo runs.  Likewise if you're rolling in the caps, consider investing in a set of full Troubleshooter's armor just for these occasions.  That's 75% damage reduction from robots.  It's actually worth considering if you're a Bloodied Build that you may wish this as an alternate set instead of Unyielding for when the extra stats are less important than the DR, while you can still deal out the damage.
---
The Event is basically like a Raid.  There's certain 'fight phases' that cue about the Imposter's tactics, I am trying to remember the details...  
---
But I *think* that when it's invisible, it's a waste of ammo to target it for purposes of damage, because it will restore up to a certain health when it enters the next phase of the fight.  It's at its most vulnerable when it's visible and merking the players up close. 
---
Off the top of my head, those are the things I remember from the Event.  Like I said, it takes  a group, best done preformed and cued up.
---
Maybe, just maybe not everyone was playing when encryptid was released.
---
Hell, I got to 156 and I stopped playing well like a month before encryptid was a thing.
---
Yes!!!
---
I was stalked over 10+ fast travels. Just crashing into my camp.
---
Didnt know this was a thing. I'm assuming PC?
---
Ahhh well then yes you need to finish tadpole first then. Good news is deathclaw hides are a lot easier to come by now.
---
Where are you loading in? Some regions are level capped.
---
Button and elevators are supposed to be locked out.  You need to reset the circuit breaker (go through the open part of the asylum), or wait for someone to open the door for you I guess.
---
Then after you fight your way to level 3, you'll find a terminal.  Try logging in, it'll say only military can join.  Then look around for a note that explains to go to McClintock.  If you already did that you just need the government issued ID at the DMV.

Terraria has a better online system than this game. You can‚Äôt rebuild America if nothing you build is Permanent, and nothing can be permanent when you keep flipping between servers. They should‚Äôve made this a single player game with an online survival mode.
---
This hasn‚Äôt worked :(. I‚Äôve set it to 8gb on hdd (where game is installed)  and left the SDD (where Windows is installed) as system managed. Not sure if you recommended I change that one or not so I left it alone.
---
Well it's new to me as it didn't used to. I would always have to throw on PA to prevent sludge lung even with the Sentry not helmet on
---
I cant remember the communities off hand but if you would like I'm on ps4 if you are hit me up and I'd be glad to get the info to you. My tag is cootdog.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
PC
---
Exactly. They are never going to fix for free what people are willing to pay for, so might as well get used to it.
---
It happened to me too on ps4. On day I was teamed with some random for shared perks, we were all playing solo and I had the bos quest shared by the leader. He complete it. For some reason I won the rewards too. Some days later I realized I could no longer had this quest on this character. Can't access to BOS terminals and shit.
---
I just made me a reason and moved to another quest.
---
I'm level 216 and have never done that event or many others for that matter, no nuke launches , overseer quest remains unfinished etc I bought the fixer plans from player vendor. So if I showed up I would have no idea what to do!
---
but you don't keep it when you log out, even if you swap characters on a private server you don't own them anymore , you have to recap them all .
---
All I know, is I need a huge goddamn checklist...
---
How is it ruining the game for everyone its just tactic all fair
---
Ok then in the brackets put  ‚Äú[PC]‚Äù
---
If you were on PS4 I would have just went to get you one as a Christmas present lol but unfortunately you‚Äôre on pc so I can‚Äôt. 
---
Best of luck though my dude .

Merry Christmas
---
You actually trade p2p?
---
That is true however be extremely careful in doing so. Let me drop a little knowledge on you. One of my friends was doing that by himself and he had a nice load put into the famous suitcase at the train station.  He had a anti armor explosive handmade,  two shot explosive 50 cal. , junkies explosive lever action., and a couple of other items in there. Well he got a server disconnect and you know the rest of the story. I never heard a man piss and moan like that before lol.  Just be careful.
---
Marketplace and Flea Market (reddit)
---
yo, I'll buy some of the plans too, if you're willing to sell, gamertag is jacksongamer128
---
A follow up.....
---
Can anybody offer cold hard statistical data analysis in fixer drop rates from mumbles?   I've gotten a little over 300 ranged 3 stars from her, not once has she given me a fixer.   I'm very disappointed in her business model.
---
I upgraded to the onex and haven't been disconnect by anything except really bad lag since
---
McCarthy was right though.
---
It started today. Player reports already coming in of their inventories "disappearing." Pretty sad to see people downplaying this as Bethesda deletes threads to cover their ass. If this wasn't a real thing would they be deleting all these posts so consistently...?
---
Proof. Video?
---
This has literally been an issue since beta. They aren‚Äôt going to fix it.

Seriously scrap everything do acid runs and lead runs and just make bullets 5.56 and 45 sell best but other ones sell aswell I had someone come along and buy 1000 shotgun shells today cap a piece minus the 10% charge
---
Is this a PC issue? I‚Äôve never experienced this.
---
YES
---
Pvp areas
---
I'm honestly surprised the servers for this game are still on. I haven't played since duping ruined the game but I come back every now and then to see if they care enough to fix anything. Kudos to you guys for toughing it out this long.
---
Your good. Thanks for the feedback. It's just that I remember when people were charging 5k for the outfits and now I cant even get rid off them for 200-400 caps. I hate the market on this game sometimes lol
---
Front page of 76 Reddit, Mantis' post is actually still up. 4th video down shows how it works and how quickly it's done. Nobody was recording during the split second it happened and unless you're a streamer/youtuber it's pretty hard to catch on video. People asking on forums where their inventory went because they don't even know what happened.

Serious question: Where does one find reports of those victims?
---
Na. That's the only video. Made for a YouTuber hunting views. Not actual recorded evidence.
---
I don't feel qualified to make a statement on just the merits of what we've seen.  I do think it is notable that the volunteer who runs the 76 Bug-Fix Subreddit, u/Aten_Ra, has stated after checking the data that there is an actual risk.  However, as the old phrase "Trust But Verify" implies, there's a LOT of unknowns so far, and no actual recorded evidence that has been provided by an outside party other than the hacker-provided footage.  This doesn't mean there is no risk.  
---
One has to look at everything and make a balanced decision about the risk versus reward assessment of the threat.
---
Oh ok.
---
Not a reliable source. It's been the only event. Only paranoia.
---
Are you wanted? I find it hard to believe NOBODY is playing this game on pc.
---
It‚Äôs Bethesda being too nice and dropping too many items during those events. Look at the holiday one now. 
---
How many people have plasma grenades and Tomahawk plans?!?!
---
How many people have the Whitesprings jumpsuit?!?!
---
Bethesda needs to keep rare shit rare.
---
Quit giving us ‚Äúparticipation ribbons/trophies‚Äù. Make people work for stuff!
---
Most people playing these days have everything and new players progressing to the "end" game never make it that far. I've had a machine stacked with jffr je fe fffr, you name it it and havent sold anything in a week. Why, because 95% of the players are vets who have a smaug worthy hoard to begin with lol. It's really sad to see it and to say that, but it's true. I'm seeing the same players over and over now. 
---
Edit: also look at the streamers lol. They're all just making trap bases or camping workshops. There has to be more end game content soon or I'm afraid it's going down fast. There is nothing to do at high levels. Sbq can only drop so many plans and 1 mediocre raid wont cut it.
---
Just buy the plan
---
I was sifting the Bethesda forums.
---
They have no proof.
---
No. Real power is when you can fuck with the cheaters life in return for being a cunt. Like, invalidate their credit cards. 
---
Better hope that doesn't happen to them, would be a proper tragedy.
---
And then again... You're spreading paranoia.
---
The RNG is way too poor, would be nice if we could further refine the pick to heavy/rifles/pistols on ranged and similar on melee, with the amount of affixes the odds of getting something really good would still be rare, but at least you would get something usable by that toon.
---
i am not sure, i assume it is like with every other registration of damage. if you bash with a vampire's weapon it heals, throw a nade while holding it, it heals, explosive bullets have two possible ticks per shot (direct hits) so 2 heals per shot
---
Bethesda just cant win. Give us bad stuff we hate them. Gives us good stuff and we hate them. It's a curse lol
---
Happens to me when I do not allow the game 3 minutes to load.
---
I hate it when a level 400 something just kills me at my workshop then doesn‚Äôt take it. Happened more times than I can count.
---
When you fast travel to other players camps check for unlocked water purifiers. Robot vendors buy them for 5 caps each and I easily get over 100 bottles a day. You can also buy cheap serums. If you can get them for 130 to 150 caps buy as many as you can afford. You can resell them to robot vendors for 480 caps each. It's the easiest way to hit max caps each day IMO. Make sure Hard Bargain is maxed out.
---
I'll get it to you on here. It works great I can be on a private server and still sell. The best part of it is I have them join my private server  for the transaction.
---
It's Festivus! For the rest of us!
---
The ONLY things I hate...
---
1. Guitar Sword - give me a guitar axe with the blades on the bottom not the neck.
---
2. Ski Sword - straighten that thing out. Dumb weapon.
---
3. Pirate Outfit - it‚Äôs SO boring and plain
---
4. Give us a damn shield. We can make nuclear generators and things but can‚Äôt pick up a damn trash can lid and use it as a shield. (And those who say go play Skyrim - go suck it lol. This is my rant haha üòù).
---
Why not just run Keyhole Mine with excavator for all that lead in one spot?
---
Yes, and I just remembered that it was metal stairs and not foundation stairs. You can't attach flooring to the bottom of concrete ones.
---
I want to be a pirate with a shield so badly now.
---
I could I just never did. My friends will join me and start the workshops I just have fun doing the run and killing shit lol.
---
That was a real player with the name player because the person choose to use the settings to hide the player names, which was implemented last update. This is probably do the people filming don't have their names revealed and get insta banned. Was a level 2 player though.
---
Melee definitely can when Bloodied. All of my specs are over 15. I can share any card and can deal about 400 damage per Swing with a knife. I have resistances around 450 of each and negate most incoming damage. I play 100% Bloodied at 16% health usually. I rarely ever go down. It got to the point I even took an empath serum because it only adds an additional 8% damage but negates my teammates damage by 33%. I‚Äôve only recently started going down-ish
---
It‚Äôs all about timing, you have to be in it for the long haul. If you are watching it daily you will go crazy. I put items up and just go away. It‚Äôs amazing how some days one player will purchase all my high end items, other times weeks will go by where I only sell magazines or maps. That is just the way it is....
---
It's an exterminators lol.
---
Enjoy the ride. There is pretty much nothing that you can fuck up in this game and you can modify your stat points after lvl 50.
---
Few notes from me:
---
* Scrip every junk you find to save weight unless it is something that you want to show up in display case
---
* Using melee saves ammo especially in the lower levels
---
* Suprising things can have huge value on the markets. Learn these things if you like the trading aspect of the game
---
* If you like to play alone you can do that. If you enjoy playing with other people you will find friends in the wasteland to play with 
---
* Don't get scammed. Trading menu is open to scam and you should only trade with trusted people or use a middle man
---
* Don't drop atom shop painted legendaries because they will get destroyed. Also never drop anything in the ground that is valuable to you, always use a stash box
---
* Workshops are the only place for pvp and griefers will take on you when you take those. Stash your junk before taking one so you have nothing to lose
---
* Low health builds are easiest way to deal big damage numbers. You need adrenaline mutation, nerd rage card from intelligence, bloodied weapon and unyielding armor (if melee character). When your health is below 20% the magic will happen. Anti-armor or Junkies weapons go best with full health build
---
* Dont rush the main story
---
I have that problem with scorched beasts after i kill them.
---
They'll spawn on me sometimes 3-4 and drop their dead ass on my head.
---
I just now built underground in a couple workshops to place my santatron underground so I don't have to defend it.
---
I just drop them unless they have a funny name, ive sold like 10 "I Hate Flatwoods" and "Best Plan Ever". For 2000 caps ea.
---
Bugged, has been and still is....
---
I only play public....
---
Since last night my game was crashing literally every 5 mins but only if i was on a party and i also had a few workshops owned and happened just now too lol
---
Not to my knowledge.
---
And maybe *you* are spreading a bit too much skepticism.
---
Rather than stabbing the messenger, I choose to listen to the people who have some technical background in this game.  The data miners and people like Aten-Ra, and they are telling me that this attack is plausible, but not disseminated in a form that's easy for a wannabe hacker to pull off.  But that's only a matter of time.
---
You are being extremely disingenuous insisting there's "nothing wrong."
---
There is no acknowledgement of the hack. It is still rumor.
---
I can't say for sure, but multi-shot/hit weapons like autos and shotguns do benefit, so I presume the Tesla functions similarly.
---
Bethesda aren't already said they're working on a way to make workshop ownership permanent for private servers. This was discussed not long after the sub model came out.
---
If only I was not poor
---
I made him large and tall as I could with the body type. Running around next to other players is actually pretty fun
---
Lolol
---
I just want a lightsaber hahaha!
---
There is video proof of this one dumbass
---
Fair enough.
---
I had the same issue last week. I had to shut down other wifi devices like my PC which was torrenting. It worked great after turning off a few devices.
---
The vault released a FEV vapor after everyone left so I was affected halfway thru the night.
---
I hate that shit. Yeah yeah it is creative but it completely goes against the whole player vending thing. I dont think it is funny at all....
---
OP, not sure if you had a different situation but I've been farming santatrons and have disconnected several times. Each time when I log back in my private world is initially empty with 'unknown' workshop owners, but after a minute or two all of my workshops pop back up as owned again. It always initiates a series of raids so I have defend them all again, but I do get them back.
---
HOW?!?! Hahaha
---
&gt; private servers sometimes don't spawn the Christmas Scorched
---
oh well, at least I know now that it's not just me...
---
Thanks for sharing it.
---
Yes. I have a two shot FFR so I can have Unlimited Power and declare myself as the Senate.
---
You must search for evidence or you fall to superstitions and liers.
---
You've got a poor memory.
---
What is a reliable source for you, The Guardian? Several people, who know a thing or two, including Aten_Ra, confirmed the possibility.
---
He provided source code on how to get his results for the hack. I‚Äôve been in several games where I spawned in, walked five steps, and everyone BUT him died all at once. The inventory steal has videos of it IN FUNCTION! Like literally him using it to take shit on a private server. But okay lol...
---
Every now and then this bug is actually helpful.  (Though usually it's just annoying...)
---
Quest: "Gather Scorchbeast DNA"  
---
\--scorchbeast that I killed 30 minutes ago drops out of the sky
---
Right?? It was a high level player so I had to assume they knew what they had. Then again, they had 3* legendaries for 1200-1500 caps. One of those 1 in a million traders.
---
You may want to use the Xbox function of Recent Players, which works better in 76 now, or photograph the player list. Then rejoin a player who is in the lobby you got kicked from. I use this as a way to move stuff between characters: drop something in a world container, photograph the player list, leave, switch character,  then rejoin using the names I photographed earlier.
---
I took adavntage of the 76 hate around christmas and got the onex bundlr for 199 at walmart
---
Possibility is not a fact. We need several report with recorded evidence in order to confirm the exploit.
---
I got a TSE FRS Dragon for 2k from a vendor once lol.
---
Seriously? Sitting in a bush to go make a Sandwich is a tactic?
---
Best solution is an xp multiplier for consecutive days playing NW. A lot of games already do that. 
---
Player kills in Adventure should award xp in NW. 
---
Daily challenges for NW should award xp and not cards.
---
Playing solo from start to finish in matches should award bonus xp over being in a team since it is more challenging.
---
Playing solo from start to finish and winning should grant bonus xp and a camp trophy of some kind. After all there can only be ONE overseer.
---
Go ahead then, take one for the team.
---
I set both to 8gigs and restarted my system. It didn‚Äôt change anything :(
---
The source code is no tested. For anyone except himself. M
---
Oh... Sorry.
---
Congrats!
---
Would that actually happen? Unless the sheshkabab were constantly striking the creature until the were cooked, I don‚Äôt think it would actually cook the meat, more so just burn skin and flesh.
---
The cryo grenades somewhat make sense but considering that the effect of it wears off within seconds, I doubt it would preserve meat properly.
---
I'm playing. Nothing has happened. I will continue playing.
---
Shhhh... dont give them ideas. Gonna give a 10 dollar skin for it
---
I'm a little confused why hackers are sending you updates on their hacks. And why you're posting this after recently having posted an anti-76 video which followed a rant post about Bethesda and seemingly a lot of negativity from you about this game.
---
I would too...but only if it will cut thru locked doors and bins
---
Because it isn't public yet. Right now about 20 people know how to do it, and it requires actual coding knowledge. Once Erectban releases a dumbed down plug n play version for average Joes - that's when the real fun will begin. So do what you want, but I'll choose to trust people who I know to be reliable in their findings.
---
I cant offer a deep dive on the numbers, but anecdotally I've gotten about 15 from mumbles. Out of I'd say 100 rolls. I usually roll 2*, unless a sale is going on. Do you have the fixer plan learned?
---
My suggestion is a game that doesn't crash but let's bring it back into the realm of possibility for Bethesda.
---
It's the building blocks for getting into "professional" hacking. There are some.prominent cheat makers from waaay back in the day who are actually programers for professional grade anticheats/league anticheats now. Some went on to make games of their own or become people who are hired to find exploits in programs/websites/whatever. Some have other random jobs in programing but still make cheats and sell them cuz it's really good and easy money. There are several I know of that actually have to file taxes every year from how much money selling cheats makes.
---
Of course. If that happens.
---
I'm with you. I don't travel to a camp with less than 7 weapons for sale. I'll look at other inventory and perhaps buy but you'll need to get me there by selling a good amount of everything.
---
I literally just went to gamestop to buy the new star wars game and i come back to this. Funny coincidence I ever had
---
People said the same about the spawner. People swore by that up until Bethesda confirmed it. This thing is real. The same dude that made the spawner made this.
---
There are precedents, Blizzard sued hackers and won.
---
https://www.criticalhit.net/gaming/blizzard-just-won-8-6-million-lawsuit-overwatch-hackers/
---
Both are 1k tops and that's being generous.
---
If you are an hacker, you could be a communist.
---
Don't die, it's bad for your health...
---
Not inside my camp but last night was the first time I was being followed by them. I‚Äôve heard about this happening but never witnessed it. It would have been nice if they were actually full and not empty.
---
Thanks to VikingGuy, a lvl 21 who was brave enough.  Gave him 5 Holiday Gifts.
---
It‚Äôs not even the whole source code he posted... He posted a few lines of how he was able to get to his results for other hackers to follow his work. If he posted the entire source code Bethesda could easily (in theory) undo all his work. 
---
He posted a video of him using his hack transferring the inventory of one model to another on a private server which runs essentially identically to an adventure mode server. This video was leaked by the person filming the hacker. So yes, his hack is tested.
---
Yeah. People reported 10 star legendaries. You can publicity this guy, but that doesn't solve anything. Just keep playing if you want. Or stop playing if you want.
---
Could've been. Hard to say at times with this engine. Just glad they've limited it server side so we aren't seeing the world's lamest speed hack &amp; the wonky lockpicking like happened with FO4 heh
---
Claim a workshop to do some farming and it‚Äôs bound to happen lol
---
How? Anytime I see a wanted icon on the map - it's like "red alert! red alert!".
---
Wanted players are a precious luxury nowadays.
---
No its the game thats shitty
---
Haha that's fantastic!  I'm glad I spent almost two hours trying to find and convert them for such a noble cause!
---
Is not. We only can wait one week. But right now we don't have evidence.
---
Yes u are safe
---
No one reported a 10 star legendary. One person shared an image and everyone went crazy with it and attacked all the people who said why it wasn't real.
---
The guy who made that spawning script even made statements that it wasn't real but people didn't want to believe it. There's a difference between the two.
---
This new one existed as a bug in FO4, just like the one that allowed spawning.go ahead and downvote me for pointing it out. I was downvoted for reporting the spawner. I was downvoted for debunking the 10 star. I know I'm right about this. When Bethesda fixes it, I'll get to sit and smile.
---
Uh... Bethesda has acknowledged this inventory hack already. Stop spreading misinformation please.
---
couldn't you just enable the game's built-in subtitles?
---
Where? Please share the link.
---
Ok thanks, now does that meant that it is impossible to load scripts like those on console? Like in the future any script base exploit would not be on Ps4.
---
I‚Äôve seen multiple sitting at Morgantown airport and more than one was full, makes for a nice treat to an end of a scorched run.
---
After hundreds of players lose their shit. Brilliant idea, Todd!
---
Bethesda should be doing more. That said, I'm in no way letting hacking or rumours of hacking spoil my fun. I don't base my gameplay decisions on reddit posts.
---
If you let angry basement nerds win, you're letting the terrorists win.
---
Even with the hack being real, I think the point of the thread is that people will now blame all inventory glitches and disappeared items on hacking, while actual item theft might affect only a small percentage of players. Similarly to how dupers were often claimed to be responsible for server instability and disconnects a year ago. There is a grain of truth to it, but how many of the reports are real hacking? **Edit:** already mass downvoted, but it just proves the point about stupid hysteria and scapegoating.
---
The drop rate is low and so is that stupid event success rate. I think I‚Äôve only successfully completed it once.
---
All the extractors should still be running but that's just how it works for me
---
Oh yea I went there last night and there was 6 all full. But the ones that just dropped everywhere I fast traveled were empty.
---
That dude has zero power even with scripts. The only part he has is ruining your fun. Don't let him do it. If you wanna play go ahead. If you don't wanna play, alright. But stop playing because this is like a terrorist act.
---
He literally linked numerous videos showing evidence of his items being stolen
---
Quest called "Miner Miracles" at the Garrahan Mining Headquarters rewards you with the PA Station plans.
---
I only took one and crashed
---
Note though, if you don't retake your workshops after the defense fails, the enemies will swarm your santatron and/or destroy his capsule, and then you won't get any more presents. So you do need to put some consistent effort into making sure the workshops are guarded.
---
https://youtu.be/w7FtkkDhw_I 
---
Go to 1:30. Several tested now. Still not enough evidence, bud?
---
I'll need to try and do the event again to try and get the plans to level it up
---
&gt;That dude has zero power even with scripts.
---
you say that as if the item spawner was "paranoia", too.
---
let me put it this way: if it can be done in Fo4, then it can probably be done in Fo76, too. and you can definitely do that in Fo4.
---
Well ok but actually no. When the game crashes the server doesn't know it was the game, it thinks it was the player who intentionally left the game, meanwhile the server removes the player from the player's list so that other players in joining queue can join the server.
---
Yeah... That can happen or not. He really can't affects me, or anyone in the game... Really. I only expect he have a decent Christmas. But he's investing a lot in a game, maybe he really needs help. But this is the last I can comment about the issue. Good luck!.
---
I don‚Äôt see where it says he doesn‚Äôt play and I‚Äôve met him in game, on PC.
---
1:30 in. Second person to prove they‚Äôre capable. What more evidence do you guys need? Seriously...
---
https://youtu.be/w7FtkkDhw_I
---
Learn a serum recipe then it‚Äôs easy from there
---
Let the defense fail but immediately reclaim the workshop after it's taken over by enemies. It's much easier to reclaim than to defend because you don't have to sit around waiting for the waves to spawn, you can usually just run up and kill all the enemies at once. Then all you need to do is repair the santatron capsule to ensure it's operational. I do this every 20-30m and I get a nice number of presents per hour.
---
BTW my comment might seem contradictory to yours, however I upvoted your post so Bethesda may add it to the game
---
Let him be. He prefers to live in denial. Hacks don't exist if he remains ignorant to the issue!
---
If you wait a few hours without defending your santatron will quickly stop collecting. You have to either defend or immediately reclaim the workshop to keep this operation running.
---
Sorry, been busy, and getting blue screened a lot.  Player id same as here, if you catch me on i'll give you the blade
---
Yeah. I'm just saying, I don't care. And you shouldn't. He is a sad guy in need of help.
---
Maybe you should just see If they would redo survival in that way instead of dropping aid and caps getting rewards for faction based pvp
---
Not enough. Sorry.
---
(Edit)
---
Checking again. That was Juicehead. Bug confirmed.
---
Brother, you can use laser traps connected to alert pylon. Though it's a hard thing to do.
---
You're the first person I wish they hack lmao
---
Pls ErectBan, DEW IT
---
Thanks for the advice I‚Äôll give it a go!
---
That was your video proof on a adventure mode sever. Bad troll lol.
---
1. Find a decent location you can clear.
---
2. Rise and repeat. 
---
My main cleared out Watoga many, many times. Those robots are usually high level and there are plenty. My alt has been hitting Camden amusement park during this holiday event. And, there‚Äôs a vendor there so you can sell all the weapons you pick up.
---
At this point i assume most bounties i see are bait.  Some low lvl with a 5cap bounty with a couple of high lvl stealthed buddies waiting in ambush.
---
That being said,  i usually  see a fair amount of high levels hanging out around WS train station.  Afk there and you're bound to get killed.
---
I'm going to keep playing in my private servers
---
Not once did I act like he's a god or that I'm not playing.
---
I'm trying to spread awareness of what's happening in the game. If everyone's aware of what's happening, we can come together as a community and pressure Bethesda to get this fixed faster.
---
When people start turning on those reporting bugs, eventually the people trying to get help will stop. Luckily, the people in this community have never stopped, even when no one acknowledged they were right in the first place.
---
The Santatron is immune to damage, but his capsule where he drops off the items can be destroyed, and the Santatron himself can be 'occupied' by enemies that swarm. So unless you find a way to completely prevent enemies from reaching/stopping the Santatron, you do need to defend/retake. Otherwise you can afk for an hour and come back to your Santatron having collected nothing because a few zombies are pushing him around.
---
Ye for year, until they added that non-sence flying bike and i have never run in to modders.
---
700,000 caps? How? :O
---
You do realize the stash box isnt part of fallout 1st right? You're thinking of the unlimited scrap box m8
---
you don't care people were able to spawn 5 star legendaries? or you don't care your entire inventory could possibly get wiped?
---
because that's fine and all but you shouldn't spread misinformation. yes, it's entirely possible this rumor is real. whether you should stop playing is up to the individual.
---
There is 2 types of crashes the type where the sever crashes and you get disconnected or the type where the game locks up starts buzzing and closes. Bethesda has mostly fixed sever crashes (from my experience) but just like all the Bethesda fallout games they don‚Äôt fix the game it‚Äôs self crashing
---
Thats creepy üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I give up on Workshop claiming..
---
Game is so unstable, it is not worth the hassle of losing resources to get everything going to be blue screened.
---
It happened so often, i wondered if a sick Dev was sat at home purposely disconnecting me.
---
My bad. Juicehead is a valid source. You win.
---
Yes, that is why I suggested putting him on a second floor, to keep him out of reach.
---
Because it‚Äôs pain in the ass to get his SLI smooth. That‚Äôs besides the point, he‚Äôs a super reputable source and his confirmation has value. Since I had access to these information early I actually deemed the danger real before his confirmation. The author of the first version of the code made it to allow trading raid armors - stealing is not the intended use, but it has spread already.
---
That is needed dude
---
Oh i see, i was misremembering the fact that they literally copy pasted code from Skyrim and Fallout 4.
---
I need to get 3 on PS4 anybody still willing to sell a few?
---
 I am on Xbox one s
---
Yeah. Juicehead confirm too. The bug is real. Sorry.
---
I do that often but none of my friends were on that day
---
Oh...
---
The bug is real. My bad.
---
Juicehead just release the video.
---
I avoid Wade Airport, the power stations, and the two Ash Heap workshops. They're a pain and not worth the time IMO.
---
My general setup is to claim about 8 workshops (the smaller, easier ones), build the Santatron only with no defenses, ignore defense events, and always immediately retake (be sure to check the Santatron capsule to see if it needs repairs after a retake).
---
I find this method gives me room to breath, but I get enough playtime in retaking the shops for it to feel fun and engaging. I also get an absolute buttload of plans/saleable items from all the workshop retakes. You may not need to do them if you have your Santatrons super protected, but I find it simpler and more rewarding to do them anyway. Plus you get a shitload of XP... I would often go to retake a workshop and because the Santatron is immortal, he will tank like 15-20 enemies. So when they swarm him I can grenade and get a massive XP gain for like 2s of work. :P
---
Is the application/game crashing, not there servers
---
No, it‚Äôs a real power. It has economic and IP consequences in the real world.
---
TBH that one guy who dropped a piercing combat rifle(i think) for me when i jsut hit lvl 10 is a hero, i use that thing to this day (lvl 25) and it allways does a GREAT jo
---
That would explain why I've been coming across them this time with my first new character, it was hell annoying with my main and never finished that exam section, like the plasma grenade plan üòí

---
Thet wan't you to believe you're safe. Let me hold all your gift boxes, just to be extra safe.
---
Oh. Please. He can have my things if his Christmas is better that way. I fear that can't help him.
---
A lot of stuff has been scavenged by Bethesda, but the idea that the entire Skyrim game is embedded in 76's code sounds like the kind of fiction that many youtubers use for clicks. xD
---
Right now we have evidence.
---
Oh ok sure thing, I can also give you my 5 star legendaries too.
---
I've been doing this. 5-6 santatrons going at a time. Just make a ring of 10 turrets around it.
---
We had evidence yesterday too
---
Hard Bargain Level 3.
---
1500 Caps a day from killing Mole Miners at Blackwater Mine and selling all their stuff at Whitespring Station.
---
Then when you reach 30,000 Caps still do the run for a ton of steel from the same junk.
---
Most games I own don‚Äôt crash as regularly as Bethesda games do. (Ark survival evolved is the only one that matches Bethesda level crashes)
---
No worries, as long as you respond to the reclaim missions quickly you'll be swimming in gifts in no time. :P
---
Wait till you get to level 50, make sure you read about all the in_game mutations on the net so you'll know which ones to have(some give you higher dmg) make sure you have legendary armor on, some will protect you and give you special abilities, plus, some legendary guns also give you higher dmg, like the bloodied or the explosives, or if you are lucky you can get a bloodied legendary. All in all you should go online and search for details on each gun, armor, perk and specially mutations
---
My bad. I don't see until dig enough. The issue is dark.
---
... Seriously? You ignore everyone reporting it unless they're a YouTuber who has (accidentally) on occasion misrepresented the issue.
---
Farm yourself some legendary scorched?
---
I‚Äôm not 100% sure if they count towards the quest, but the holiday scorched are labeled as Legendary.  Big Bend Tunnel (including the entrances at both ends) should net you 3-5 holiday scorched, not to mention the holiday gifts they drop...

Next time I will, thank you.

No worries. Worst case scenario I‚Äôll reinstall... don‚Äôt really want to do that because I am on hotel WiFi and it will take a while
---
It's definitely a very rare plan and it only drops from Large gifts. My first night of farming I opened about 15 of them and got one icicle plan after 13, and then last night I opened about 25 large gifts and didn't get an icicle plan at all.
---
Some of the heads are super duper rare as well. There are like 8 of them, including Deathclaw, and I think out of the 40+ large gifts I've opened I've only found like one or two of these.
---
Oof... It's rough still seeing blue screens happening this often across multiple platforms. But at least it doesn't dishearten to the point of not playing, for now üòè
---
Did you try to replicate the what you did before to see if it crashes again?
---
In case you didn't know, The Dragon no longer drops as legendary, except from the vault raids. It also ***never*** drops with the explosive effect anymore, so it's a double-legacy weapon. You really hit the lottery on that one!
---
I've never made a sandwich that does sound a bit much I've gotten a drink though but some people ain't any good at PvP or like me don't enjoy it so me and people like me have to miss out on the cosmetics and stuff to keep people like you who have a similar opinion happy seems unfair that you get to decide how we play oh wait no you don't bush wookie for life üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ
---
Oh. Yeah. I needed multiple valid sources. Juicehead is one but he link the others. My bad.
---
I been doing basically the same but underground. Don't even have to repair anything.
---
Have had the Scorched Beast/Cargo Drop Box bug sporadically since i started playing.
---
The new bug i am experiencing is not being able to deploy my Ultracite power Armour.Unless i keep walking forward whilst repeatedly pressing x.
---
Ye idk where i got that from
---
I don't think you know what this is about. Are you a bit lost?
---
That's the reason I gave up on workshops all together. - shame.
---
I blue screen if i have any veggies in my inventory or stash.  If i sell all my plant items i can use a workstation, but if i pick up any thing - corn, melon, etc. - i crash at a workstation.
---
Is the blue screen that blue frowny face that pops up on windows
---
It this about a game, right?
---
I don't think I'm lost.
---
I have always wanted like a super workshop were you have a opportunity to get a lot of reasorces but you have to defend constant enemy‚Äôs who gradually get stronger
---
Yeah, I realised this, too.  That's why I was glad to find a low level who wasn't worried.
---
LegacyKillaHD is probably dancing.
---
except in some areas the rocket turrets barely scratch enemies
---
Bloodied is still popular, junkies is becoming more and more popular
---
I don‚Äôt get a ‚Äúblue screen‚Äù I get the game locking up, buzzing and closing itself. The crashes are pure random I reclaimed the workshop for half an hour longer than last time before a crash
---
Hackers are killing this game. And it deserves to die.
---
You are safe.
---
You‚Äôre able to get lead from
---
the weight room inside Vault-Tec University as well.  From there Morgantown High School is very near by
---
and a great plastic raid.
---
Thanks so much man.
---
I love 1st.  It's the reason I came back.  I mainly play multiplayer games, but I do not enjoy this genres PvP.
---
I've been able to rejoin a couple of times if you can do it fast enough. If it's a hard crash forget it.
---
This is enough.
---
Yeah, you really are lmao
---
Ive had mixed results with the ultracite spawning scourched. Sometimes it does fine but a bit over half the time last time I did it I only got the ore and no spawns
---
Uh... Not sure... I guess it depends on your camp and placement
---
The majority of sales was probably on the consoles, I would guess between 75-80%. And even on PC, where the hacking occurs, there will just be a lot of outrage and bans for a while, but in the end, people keep playing.
---
Don't get discouraged, it gets easier as you move forward! I am 2500+hrs in last checked, at Level 360. 
---
I have the capability of 5 different builds, and various different routines, 1 for food, 1 for scrap, 1 for cap stashes, 1 for legendaries, 1 for XP, and the list goes on. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I still struggle from time to time, but you will figure out what works, and what doesn't. 
---
You need to concentrate on making a routine. 
---
Concentrate on what build will fit your character, and pick your cards, around that, until you are able to create more than one build.
---
Yes, mutations can be a benefit, but they have there pitfalls, even with the percard that reduces negative effects of mutations. 
---
Crafting, scraping, and making food will benefit you by saving caps, and will be more beneficial for gaining extra XP, Damage resistance, unlocking weapons and armor mods. 
---
In addition to the scrapped items, look at what each Item gives you in scrap. That way you will begin remembering what Items you need to scrap in order to  build up your inventory of  each scrap item. Also try and have plastic, so you can bulk your items to save space, and it will also benefit you when selling excessive amounts of bulk for caps, either through a vendor or your personal vending machines.  Money, money money, find the Trump inside of yourself young Jedi
---
I usually I have 100 bulk of each scrap Item in my inventory at all times, it frees up my time to enjoy the the game abit more, if I  exceed that I sell additional scrap for caps. 
---
Easy money, find location on the map that you can quickly farm weapons armor, and  chems for sale.
---
 I  usually have 5 places on the map that I will hit all back to back, to collect weapons, armor, chems, ammunition.
---
 I will start at Whitesprings, and the mine behind  the train station. Then I will go to the Train station sell all items. 
---
Then I will move to Watoga, and the cranberry Bog, collect scrap, weapons, food, cranberries, sell what I have in weapons, and armor. Create food, like Scorched beast, cranberry cobbler, cranberry relish, cranberry juice, cranberry jam. 3 of these items taken at once, with a rest periods, will grant you 20% XP, cranberry jam, will grant you damage resistance.  Before I forget, grow squash in your camp. 
---
Next I will move to Ferry Harper and surrounding areas,  like Berkeley. 
---
I will continue this pattern until my daily cap limits are reached. 
---
Another tip on keeping your fast travel cost down, keep your camp in the center of the map, near a water source. And use the perc cards that save you on caps for fast travel. Also use the perc card for selling items. It will help you sell less for more caps. 
---
As someone already mentioned pick up the Excavator power armor, and buy the plans to make her a beast. You can find these plans at the White Springs vendor. 
---
Collect all the plans you come across in game, if come across a duplicate set sell it for caps, in your personal vending machines, same goes for unwanted mods, and  rare items, like excess stable flux, mutations serums, Royal jelly, unwanted bobble heads, magazines. 
---
I not sure any of these tips will help you, but it worth a try. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best. 
---
I hope everyone has Merry Mutated Christmas, and a Happy Scorched New Year's.
---
Cooking meat and selling to vendors is a great way to get caps. Perks like butchers bounty and having berry mentats are an easy way to make quick caps. There are also other perks you can use to help with this.
---
As far as damage goes you really need to hone in on a build that you like around a specific weapon type, though getting perks you need is difficult until 50 then it's a waiting game, but thems the bricks.
---
I didn't start by being negative about Fallout 76. I have tried relentlessly to defend the game over the past year. Though it got harder and harder as time went on. Just because I am not happy with the game, doesn't mean I would support something like this or keep it quiet. I do not know why this Bungo character started sending me stuff, we know each other back from FOnline a few years back, but this is the first time I have spoke with him since. You bet your ass I am negative about 76 though, kind of hard not to be at this point.
---
Yup, that's my problem. Had 20k+ caps and went down to &gt;500 in one play session cause I couldn't help myself from making large handmade gifts.
---
A little late to the show.....but we finally have our answer. Lol. Dcg extra claw plan is actually dropping during this holiday event.
---
I seem to sell 45s, 308s, 10mm and shotgun shells fairly well. 
---
Fusion cores sell well but I sell them at half price of their charge. 
---
Other ammo sits for a while until one user usually buys it all. 
---
Mininukes, missiles, harpoons, railway spikes, stringer ammo and 50 cal balls are useless imo and I trash em.
---
And seriously, why on christmas? I guess no playing for me right now :( But thank you for another post, that should be first topic here, to warn people that have no idea.
---
 I'm too rubbish to kill anyone so hide a lot in the bushes. What can I say I'm a scrub ;)
---
And this is why PC is trash
---
For awhile gamma rounds were all the rage in my vendors. Plasma cores go well for me as well.
---
Our team killed 8 scorched beasts in about an hour at a fissure site the other day while farming holiday scorched. Fast traveled to my camp and 3 SB landed on my camp while it was loading in and almost froze the game.
---
If you have friends with private servers you could always join them, i just dont want people getting screwed over
---
I was in game for 10 minutes yesterday with character, but still stuck in load screen on my screen.. could fire, reload etc etc.
---
I, for one, didn't know about it, and thank you for posting.  Where abouts "around Welch" (N, S, E, W)?
---
No, this is why other people are trash
---
I just use RTSS (started with Fallout 4) and have no issues. https://www.guru3d.com/files-get/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download,16.html
---
I know but that‚Äôs the problem. None of my friends is playing it haha
---
What timezone you on?
---
Idk woodchucker is unlocked at lvl 17 and its in luck it and scrapper is unlocked at lvl 13 in intelligence
---
You gotta have a free point to use them though.
---
Like take off something else to use it.
---
But if it's completely broken you might need to reinstall the game
---
Easiest way for me was do the enclave events. Did this at around level 30 so it was a little tough but other people will join the events to help out sometimes.
---
CET
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/
---
Or twitter is another source. There is a large community there too.
---
Thanks, mate!
---
I read this thread last night then forgot all about it and played for a few hours this morning lol. 
---
I'll continue to take my chances lol.
---
Really? I traded it for some good stuff...wish I wouldn‚Äôt have now haha! Well, shit happens
---
It was as advertisued until several months down the line. Non-cosmetics on the shop were only added several months later, had they been added at launch I would never have purchased the game.
---
Wait .. you can edit the height of your char?
---
I refused to sell anything or more than 5k caps he prolly just had a similar philosophy.
---
3x3 shack with the center missing. You can make the collectron unit virtually invincible. Let my character spin circles in their survival tent all night. Went To my workshops 66 small gifts like 12 normal and 10 large.
---
Eh I guess not. I was just running next to other people who appeared shorter than me. I chose overweight and muscular on the scale.
---
Been there done that. Lol. I have never been given a  bounty for opening someone else's supply drop thought!? Maybe a glitch? 
---
You have one of three choices.  
---
1) Be an asshole and attack someone that will dummy you back. 
---
2) Wait it out until your bounty ends in 24 hours. 
---
3) Or private message someone playing and explain what happened, and ask them to do you a favor. 
---
Nonetheless I wish you, and everyone the best!
---
Video evidence. 
---
Yes, on 2 charecters.  It's been a shit show with mumbles.
---
Are you selling all ammo at 1 cap?  What's a good price for cores?
---
or just read this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ea4q47/top_25_locations_to_farm_holiday_scorched_3/
---
Well not live (yet). It is no more live than it was yesterday. People who have some technical knowledge can make the script themselves and do it, the ezpz plug and play version isn't released yet (so people without technical knowledge can't really do it yet). That is the thing that would make this more widespread and is supposedly coming on Christmas/Eve.
---
You are safe
---
It happens on pc but there have been reports of it happening on console too.
---
Aren't those instanced somehow though? As in you can clear all the beer bottles from Sutton Station and then load into what's definitely another server and the bottles aren't there because it's Bethesda's idea of continuity or something? Heck, I think I've had that happen to me when I was away from the game for a day or two, not just when the server disconnected and I hopped back into the game within a few minutes. Kind of a pain if you want to farm stuff, but I'm under the impression preventing farming is exactly the reason Bethesda set it up that way. People are more than welcome to correct me down below. This is just my impression, so definitely not stating it as fact.
---
r/agedlikemilk ? ;) 
---
No offence man, I'm just a snide asshole)
---
50 cal, 556 and 45 all sell very fast at 1 cap for me
---
I heard of one person who had this happen and for them it was anything they had, caps, stash box, scrap box, I mean everything...
---
Junkies full health power armour build might be more your style. Does a lot less damage than a full bloodied build but also does a lot more than no particular build
---
No saying they wont do it earlier though, and we all know how bad people are at keeping secrets, if a few people know about this now, it will be hours or a day before its a few more, then more then everyone.  
---
 And after watching TKmantis video yesterday on this the guy that made this hack sounds like a complete peice of shit so i wouldnt put it past him to be a liar too
---
Yes things stay built after you leave a server. Not sure if there‚Äôs a time limit either. I was defending someone else‚Äôs workshop on an alt for plans and they left right after but everything they built (even their fancy corvega green turrets) stayed built but the workshop was free and ready to be claimed.
---
who knows for sure...but I think that:
---
1. since caps isn't a dropable item,  I think they'r safe.
---
2. stash boxes are instanced, so they should be safe as well
---
I don't know about swapping characters but if j leave the world and come back within a few minutes I still own everything.
---
But you continued to play after those oh so horrible, pay to win, 6 pieces of junk an hour utility items were released didn't you?
---
The two shot does a lil more damage. Vampires will heal you. Both will break your bank because they are extremely over priced
---
lmao
---
just saw the juicehead video, and his caps remained, along with his misc and holo tab inventory
---
Yep, all ammo types are 1 cap. Fusion cores I undersell for half their charge. So 70 charge is 35 caps or so. 
---
I also play on private servers often so getting cores to sell is super easy that's why I sell them cheap.
---
This goes all the way back to skyrim where dragons did this too lol decade old bugs still prevailing
---
I was on my private server. I set up 15 workshops all with santatrons in them just as i had finished setting up the last one i got a message server closing down for maintenance..
---
If it keeps me from having to run into your ilk, then there is at least that silver lining.
---
Personally I dont like the orange one
---
Indeed it is! They added it to the holiday event.
---
He‚Äôs not wrong bethesda shills.
---
Thanks, I'm new to trading in this game.  Now I need to figure out which armor rolls have value lol.
---
Yes Sir, me as well, I made a  promise to the community, that I was not going to lose my cool again! 
---
I am finding it very tempting to go off on a tantrum, and  snap at God Howard, and  Bethesda again. Lol. 
---
I am getting tired of this Bullshit, these issues are like a  repeating Hershey squirt, after every dam patch! 
---
I played maybe an hour today, and was booted off the server, every 3.5 minutes, until I  literally through my controller out the window. 
---
Yes, I know I need anger management!  
---
But honestly how often do I have to continue putting up with same dammed glitches after playing this broken down golf cart of a game for over 2500hrs. 
---
These issues should have been behind us by now, what is the excuse this time Bethesda, the Enclave are on Christmas Holidays! 
---
"FIX THE FUCKING GAME " please, and thank you! 
---
Okay, I apologize for getting carried away! 
---
 Nonetheless I wish you and everyone the best! 
---
I hope that everyone has Merry Mutated Christmas, and A Happy Scorched New Year's.
---
Leader of the pack gives you 3 but my last bot stop had 3 holiday scorched so Idk Whitespring is usually the best bet though
---
I said better defenses, not specifically rocket turrets.
---
You can find most of that out via this sub and trading subs. Mostly tho its unyielding, bolstering, vanguard's, cavalier, sentinel, things with plus one strength.
---
üòÇü§£
---
been there, done that, lol
---
i'm at lvl 214 and i found a good way to sell my 3\* LegiesFast AND Cheap + i get more than enough caps :)Weapons:  250 per Star  !Amor: 175 - 200 per Star !
---
no matter what typ of gun or amor... ;)  
---
\*i forgot some , more or less Rare clothes/ outfits  
---
Brown , Green  and woodgreen nurse outfits. never put them over 100 caps in my vendors
---
Did you get one? I didnt have any drop from gifts yet, so I traded for it today.
---
Its ok you can't use the extra ones anyways had 20 on a toon and still had to pick up a new one everyday to start the daily
---
Items in your stash is safe, your caps are safe, same with scrip, etc.
---
the things carried in your inventory is not.
---
Yeah, I burned 50k across three toons and a lot of players have been dumping more than me into them
---
Or have quest steps saved. Who ever wrote the DMV portion of that quest chain needs to be savagely beaten whenever the server drops and messes it up
---
I placed multiple santatrons between workshops and jumped between glass caverns and big bend while collecting the presents in between and that worked well.
---
OP is there some glitch where setting them to scrap then gifts increases their gift chances?
---
Im in.
---
Yeah but nobody does the PvP events we already have like pricketts fort or monster mash.
---
They'd probably just avoid it but I've always wanted to see an arena
---
Bethesda should really keep a few rotating people around Christmas/breaks
---
I sell all my legendaries for 500 a star, unless it‚Äôs a really hot item. 1500 is my normal price.
---
Not that it helps you, but this is one of the many benefits less discussed about having FO1st private worlds.
---
Easiest way is to post your SN and invite someone to kill you.
---
I love this idea.  Just a convoy of friendly players waving at each other, casually moving with the storm into a weird crowd assembly at the middle until we burn together.  This is why we can't have private NW servers.
---
I heard bells jingling the other day and wanted to shoot first and ask questions later. Just in case. Good thing I didnt, it wasnt holiday scorched, it was some little kids dressed like elves! Haha. 
---
However, some of them were carrying wrapped presents, so....
---
Both. 20% Additional Damage. Small explosion
---
If I was betting, I would bet it comes out before Christmas Eve personally. Hopefully Beth patches it Mon/Tues
---
Damage is damage, whether ballistic or explosive. Both are included in the gun's damage description
---
It's splash damage besides the regular damage from bullets. I believe the explosive damage perk increases. But also heard it's not really worth the 5 points maxed out.
---
Wanna double your money? ü§£
---
The amazing part of this post to me is that you can have more than one...
---
Edit: Not that amazing actually, you can only have one in camp,
---
I'm in a similar boat.  The worst part is not knowing where other camps are... I want to go shopping again.
---
Man it‚Äôs like people are actively trying to kill this game. Sad.
---
My guess is they just need to do a soft relaunch (*sarcastically* say it got dos'ed) and blame it on Russian troll farm. Market it as "the game so perfect the haters attacked" you know typical PR bullshit/lies. Change the development team and burn the evidence. Then release the old 76 as a standalone with mod support. Everybody quietly nods as the new 76 is f2p. But most importantly Bethesda should not blame the Austin team. But differently quietly start firing management and hire other capable ppl.
---
I had that but with government issue supply drops. They were following me around the map dropping near me. I had no clue what was going on but they were always empty
---
Guess its that time to take a break from 76. Dont really wanna lose everything
---
It's best to just stay offline or play on a private world until bethesda has remedied this unfortunate affair.
---
I had 10 farming. Seemed like a hassle to collect them all after a while. Took about 15+ minutes because of loading screens.
---
Huh ? where ?
---
Yeah 10 is a bit much, but I‚Äôm definitely gonna put another one or two down
---
Guess its time to buy Fallout 1st, cant get your stuff stolen if you play solo
---
low 720 specs but it should get enough to start
---
Yes
---
one has nothing to do with the other. the trade exploit allegedly relied on a **bug** to force trades of unselected items for 0 caps.
---
this **hack** just treats everything as a container that can be freely looted, because that's how the creation engine works.
---
Impossible on console, idk why anyone even brings it up
---
I would, I also think its likely that there may be a pc rollback after all of this gets patched.
---
The only one that isn‚Äôt working now is my vampires fixer which is sad cause I like it the most.
---
It is possible to post a photo of this setup?
---
Yup it's not worth the investment.  Only do it when it's a part of the daily or weekly
---
Online survival and battle royale aren‚Äôt QUITE the same.
---
and then you'll have to farm for the large/plated one and will feel like blowing your brains out.
---
novice: gives heal items, 2 vault steel, and bulk ammo scrap
---
standard: gives heal items, 4 vault steel, bulk ammo scrap, 1 random chance at any vault armor plan, jumpsuit for first clear
---
expert: gives heal items, 6 vault steel, bulk ammo scrap, 1 random chance at any vault armor plan, vault 94 mask for first clear
---
It's called private servers
---
Dude you‚Äôre on console you won‚Äôt be affected lmao
---
I've made a 2 floor structure, with floors around the base foundation, so enemies cant go up. No turrets, they're expensive and cant take most of things.
---
This 100%
---
Literally impossible for shit like this to happen on consoles thankfully
---
I did this durring the Halloween event. Except i just wore the green giant mask and a set of trapper armor with a tenderizer. Got a lot of looks. Lol. Was pretty fun.
---
Did you see Juicehead's latest video about this?
---
I was making the point that the trade steal explit never worked. Making me skeptical that this one was. I have seen proof, it does seem legit, but I still am catious of saying something is happening because of my experiences with previous incidences.
---
Erect, if he releases, will include a source code, like all of his other scripts
---
Oh alright so if I cleared the expert first time around to get the mask and if i just want to take it easy I should just grind standard and save myself the headache if want the armor plans
---
Damn, was hoping this was fake, Had caps to burn and wanted to checkout some player shops for some weapons.
---
Sooo..
---
Did you see the Juciyhead video ?
---
it seems to work :/
---
This is good info. I've found that with all workshops going at once, every 2 hours I can collect 15 large, 40 med, and 60 small on average. 
---
I blueprint build a 1x1 metal shack with concrete foundation and one side has 2 half metal walls with the window opening so I can just run up, grab from the santron inside the building and TP away. The build also had 4 upgraded turrets on each corner of roof, with a concrete barriers in between them just in case one of my turrets goes haywire. Using level 2 contractor helps offset cost. Usually takes me about 45 min to claim all workshops. Much more efficient than just killing scorched.
---
I currently have 6 diffusers for sale in my machines at 120c each, will sell you 3 for 270 caps total.
---
It's fine really, just at the end of the game we will clap you every single time.
---
This is what I've been doing today in a private world, I wouldn't recommend doing it in public it'd be a waste of time, people keep picking the lock on the santatron at my camp.
---
Yup. Same here. Modding is fun as hell. But anything slightly competitive the basement dwelling no-lifes who think they're elite will begin hacking it. 
---
It's absolutely pathetic seeing cheaters in CoD or Battlefield. The only fun being had is ruining someone else's game, which means you're absolute scum. 
---
Scum.
---
While this is an unfortunate side effect, Bethesda may actually get off their ass now and do something, or watch their game crumble into dust. I like the game too, but with the gross monetization and the utter disrespect Bethesda has for it's customers, this game (and really all of their online games) deserves to die.
---
Yeah I just run by everyone and do the puke emote... They just stare. I'm mutating for God sakes... Get me a serum!
---
Thanks for the Metal plans, happy holidays and merry Christmas! You make the fallout community better and stronger!
---
Same, think it is a leftover glitch from skyrim and the dragon corpses.
---
Looks like someone got out with the Monster Mash mask. That happened to me a few days ago but it disappeared when I logged back in.
---
Probably to be the most disruptive. Devs are on vacation. There is a holiday event. People hate this game..
---
I wish I could run my own private world already.
---
That ain't true I've been down to the last and won quite a few times I said I didn't enjoy it so I've always got a gun good armour and I will go down shooting lol
---
I see unyielding/sneak build getting more and more popular. You‚Äòre almost invisible to enemies. Super Mutants walk right into me. You have tons of AP that you can use in VATS. I love my bloodied stealth commando build. I take down scorchbeasts in a couple seconds.
---
In reality. When Xbox 360 was at this stage in its life with modio and the generic file editors you could modify control schemes to run console commands. 
---
Don't really know if its been less persued this generation or if theyve just kinda been more secretive about it.
---
Heh, I just mostly buy all the ammo for my Bloodied Commando.
---
Thats a valid point. Thanks for the advice
---
Ugh 10:01+ video...yea no thanks.
---
No joke...they dont even need to trade with you if your in their range they can press take all from your inventory kind of like a world container just by looking at you...be careful.
---
Oh wow. Thats wild as heck.
---
Thanks! Took me awhile to work on the face.. I kept stretching it more and more til it got to a point I liked.
---
Console players fixing PC's problems?
---
What have we come to? Is this just another JuiceHead who plays more Discord than he does Fallout 76? People on various Discord channels have been discussing this hack for about a month now. I'm willing to bet you just ripped this info off a chat steam on a Discord you're a part of. You were definately NOT contacted by anybody but maybe some super-informed players who play on PC, that or you just read through unknowncheats...you did mention ErectBAN afterall...
---
You bought the plan for assaultron helmet? I've never seen an actual plan for it. I didn't know they exist, that's kinda cool. I unlocked the ability to craft one from scrapping a salvaged assaultron head.
---
*Shrug*
---
Played for a few hours earlier. I think I'll continue taking my chances in public Adventure.
---
This community is awesome and most players are friendly, I think I'll be fine. Not going to let a few bad apples put me off.
---
It's not a story the Todd would tell.
---
Can someone eli5 why this isn't possible on consoles?
---
Think of the plus side. You can now carry more stuff.
---
I don‚Äôt have any problems, but i‚Äôm running 4 unyielding/harder to detect while sneaking and 1 chameleon piece. Mutants walk into me at Westek and don‚Äôt notice me.
---
Turns out this was a major marketing ploy from Bethesda to seek more Fallout 1st subscriptions
---
I see no problem
---
I crashed 3 times in a hour in fallout 4 it‚Äôs just as crashy (with a bit less effects from those crashes)
---
It‚Äôs called I am broke and I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for the game to work
---
Add persistence as well, or at the very least let us blueprint the design so when we claim the shop again we don‚Äôt have to build it up again.
---
Coulda used this info months ago!!
---
Lol funny things is that their updates are gonna work unlike Bethesda's üòÇ
---
I get why people don‚Äôt like this game I really do. But why not just leave the people who do enjoy it alone? Why go out of your way to f it up for everyone else? I hope Bethesda jumps on this quick. If they want this game to live they may have to push their holiday break back a few days
---
Fair enough, its not *technically* in full swing yet only a few have a access to it, aoparently either xmas or xmas eve theyre gonna release it proper to everyone to abuse
---
They shouldnt be
---
10:01 lul no
---
TL;DW.  
---
Some hackers are abour to release a hack that lets them steal anyones inventory
---
So much for being able to play this holiday weekend...
---
Thank God you're here.  The 35 existing threads about this didn't quite hammer the point home.  It took 36.  You did it, you're our hero.
---
Sell junk and low level guns to robots. Can get 1400 caps a day.
---
Then change the color (if you're on PC).
---
I think this kind of bug is tied to the creature related quest, ie: scorchbeast to the daily "Heart of the Enemy" and i guess supply drops to the "recover supply" misc quest, everytime i start the daily a body will follow and only stops once i finish the quest.
---
Got a link for info on this ?
---
With a bloodied/unyielding setup in West Tek's dark corridors I have run into super mutants and they have not detected me.
---
U can if u r using a private server
---
Oh, that makes sense. FO76 is smart enough to know whether the hologame was looted but not smart enough  to disregard the purchased version in the inventory.
---
Maybe I missed it but didn't hear it mentioned in the video if they are able to steal our caps too, anyone know?
---
My method was to go to a private server and take over a bunch of workshops then build santatrons there.
---
I ain‚Äôt throwin money at a issue that shouldn‚Äôt exist
---
You have to allow for 8 minutes of telling you how to support the channel, of course.
---
And I'll play then too! I just don't like the idea of avoiding the game over something like this. For me the risk is worth it.
---
For real though, I do appreciate you giving people a heads up. I know a lot of players have spent much more time than I have on their builds and would be gutted to lose things.
---
Tru I feel u bt they shud offer dat to every1 becuz da game is always crashing
---
This is the exact thing I was about to comment lol
---
I bring it up because not everyone is aware that it‚Äôs not an issue on consoles, and I‚Äôm not entirely convinced it‚Äôs impossible.
---
Fwiw, there are reports of hackers gaining access to people's private worlds, so the best way to stay safe right now is to just not play.
---
For ages I had my camp at the junk point WSW of 76 near the screaming camp site if you know where I mean, so basically 2 minutes from a free fast travel point.
---
I sold recipes at 25 and plans at 50.
---
Ammo at 1 per. Basic (lvl 1-10) fully upgraded non legendary weapons and armour at 10 caps per piece.
---
I sold nothing for months.
---
I‚Äôve had cases open with Bethesda about looking junk during crashes too and they honestly don‚Äôt care. Their customer service is appalling. I‚Äôm not sure the responses are always real people...
---
I might run a Turing test against a support case, if it fails it‚Äôs a computer and I have my answer.
---
Flux, radioactive fluid, hardened mass. Glowing meat glowing blood.
---
Console no have stuff to make it go
---
How do you know that? I remember hearing it set ST to 11 even if it was higher.
---
You're welcome to the negativity, the game has plenty of faults, but I'm not going to eat up information handed over by a hacker to a person who's making videos about how the game is dead (for the second time?) and Bethesda is the devil.
---
You're basically among the least trustworthy sources of info at this point.
---
Nope
---
why your annoyed with me trying to help out pc players with this info is beyond me buddy...good luck
---
It‚Äôs impossible. Unless you somehow magically found a way to exploit the console to a point where you can compile a .dll and get that and a .dll injector onto your console and inject it into the game. Good luck! This isn‚Äôt the PS3 and 360 days anymore
---
Nope, I nuke camps when I‚Äôm bored if you don‚Äôt check ur map when the alarm sounds ur asking for it
---
I believe the industry term is "draw distance".  Here's what The Almighty Google tells us:
---
&gt; In computer graphics, draw distance (render distance or view distance) is the maximum distance of objects in a three-dimensional scene that are drawn by the rendering engine.
---
If it were possible for your machine to render and track every object on the map, including players, it would be a massive waste of resources for both the server and client. But, it doesn't do that, because it's not possible.
---
Not destroyed... a buggy game would be more preferable to a hackable one! Ideally neither but one step at a time!
---
Is there any actual cases of this happening, or just the video exposing the hack?
---
The hack works by modifying data on the client, i.e. the game running on your PC, not the server. That requires you to run another piece of software at the same time as you're running the game, and on the same machine. Since consoles can't run some random piece of software created by a hacker, there's no way to perform the hack on console.
---
Also relevant: the fact that the hack is done by hacking the client, not the server, is **very** unusual. Most games have some form of server-side validation, i.e. the server checks the data the client sends and doesn't run it if it doesn't make sense. Fallout 76 apparently has almost no server-side validation.
---
Plot twist Bethesda are behind the backs to push the fallout 1st subs
---
At least 10,000 caps.
---
That's actually a pretty optimistic video but it's simply rehashing the same provided footage from ErectBan's cameraman.  I am by no means discounting the danger of the hack, but like Juicehead just pointed out, it's not a clear and present danger to the game *at this time*.  It really does have some serious potential for danger stemming from script injection overall though.
---
Yeah juicehead on youtube has a video of it his buddy steals all his stuff to show you
---
Ha ha ... been there done that. Makes it a bit more interesting and the robots get eliminated as well ...
---
Fair enough but for most people i guess they wont ever refer to them. Personally i‚Äôd ditch all the damn keys and key cards too....
---
Lol, I've done that too many times to count.  And if you're using an explosive rifle you don't even have to hit them, the splash damage from hitting the ghoul will set them off on you if they are even close to your target. Run like hell!
---
Should of put "PC players" in your title.
---
I hunt the  bots at WS when I need a fusion core.
---
yea thats how it works. basically anything outside of a 200m distance is not rendered other than basic geometry. the game doesnt provide you any spawn data either outside that distance. the person who made the original comment is very misinformed as to how games work
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know. Is there a list of just the ones available through gifts?
---
absolutly right. with both of your thoughts.   
---
Private servers should be for free so long till Beth have an working Anti-cheat!   
---
ATM the sec.system is a joke , one of that rly bad ones for sure.  
---
One more problem is that u do not need any knowledge. it is 21century, the digital world.  
---
studyon the [i.net](https://i.net) dont cost u more than 3-4 hours on google and some "info-sites" or somthing else to get the basic knowledge of an script injection.   
---
it's so easy today for all that script kiddys today... tools here, tables there etc.etc...  
---
for the rest of normal players is that like pain in the ass.  
---
* i like that thought about Beth online banking xD
---
They shouldn't be close to Whitespring. Happy Gaming!
---
How do you think online games work? Servers arent freem your 60 bucks a year ago isnt a free pass to everything.
---
Nope you did your civic duty and made Vault Tec very proud !
---
You have to scrap the helmet to learn the plan. No actual readable plan exists.
---
I'm pretty sure it was from an Inside the Vault article some time after the FO1st sub started. I just tried to find it via google but I'm not able to find older ITV articles for some reason.
---
Bethesda says this, but unironically
---
That‚Äôs the joke
---
I thought every private server we started was different so I'd like to know how Bethesda plans to make stuff we do permanent
---
Thanks mom
---
didn't jim say himself he WANTS fallout 76 to be good so he could want to play it? pretty sure he did in his last 76 clip.
---
tho tbh if someone does a bad thing they deserve the bad press, thats why i want bethesda to learn from it and hire more staff to fix the damn game so im not on edge constantly on if the game is dying or not :(
---
Fucking neckbeard pissypants hackers.
---
People saying 'no playing for me' and avoiding the game over threats and hearsay is a pretty crappy situation for Christmas. And I have no doubt that kind of response is exactly what the people who stirred this shit up are after. 
---
They don't care about your items. They just want you to stop playing and make the game look bad.
---
Sigh...  I did.  
---
I also watched the first Hack video footage that Juicehead recycled for his video.  All of that footage was provided by ErectBan and his cameraman.  ErectBan is the person who is responsible for providing the cheatscript in the first place.  
---
The rational mind would notice immediately that while the threat is very serious and potentially destructive for the game and community as a whole, there are still no instances of the script being released at large, and no recorded pictorial or video evidence provided by anyone other than Erectban himself.  
---
One has to at least **ASK** the question of how reliable the claim and footage is, without a third party documentation of the claim and footage.  If we are to believe that there are people who have been affected by this, why are there no pictures or footage of even the aftermath of such a hack?  One has to maintain a healthy degree of skepticism.  I'm open to the proposition that script-injection on this level is possible, but like Juicehead himself says, it's at this moment not probable.  
---
People would be doing themselves a service if they maintain a critical eye and critical mind despite the rumors that would encourage mass hysteria.
---
Good to know, thank you!!
---
It doesn‚Äôt help that the anti cheat is horribly coded
---
The rough details have been released, you just can't say them here because that would be advocating cheats due to how hilariously bad bethesda's anti cheat is. Suffice to say that all you have to do is modify a message being sent to the game to take an item instead of receiving it, and when done right that will actually work
---
The junk option may be only available if, like Myself, you both the "normal" junkotron ...
---
Easily possible, it would just take more work. If PC dies, the cheaters will either stop or move on to ruining consoles
---
&gt;imagine all the innocent players who don't use reddit losing all their stuff 
---
This is half of the problem. People letting their imaginations run wild when nothing has actually happened yet.
---
I want this so much too. The prefab houses would be great for new players. I want the cloth roof, broken walls, glass walls etc. Just import em over as is.
---
Watch the video and look at any of the other posts. They have video evidence of the hack in action. It isn't hearsay anymore.
---
Those fucking camps make my game drop frames more than the pants of Frederick Coe‚Äôs victims. The only time I encountered 3 camps in close proximity at Whitesprings my frames dropped to 10 per second. I run a Ryzen 3600 with an RTX 2080 ti. It was in 1080p
---
Hmm, you may be right. My underarmor and regular armor have +5 ST, and I lose 5 ST when I put on my PA (it goes from 16 to 11). Interestingly, I have 15 ST in SPECIAL, so my ST without PA should be 20 -- but I have several mutations which decrease ST.
---
Vendor slots are maxed
---
No, but for many other reasons.
---
Happens to me all the time (more so as my camp is opposite bot/nasty spawn). Came home today saw bots fighting with legendary ghoul. I had to jump in and my main is a TSE lever... Got the goodies, had to kill several bots, then had to repair most of the turrets and a bit of wall of my camp.
---
That's a slash though, the backslash looks like this \
---
I‚Äôm really baffled why, with so much FO4s building assets in game already, some didn‚Äôt come over, and have yet to show in the atom shop or anything.  It can‚Äôt be because of concern of bugs.
---
If you're on PS4, you're safe *for now*. It would take more time and work for this to be ported over to console. PC is pretty much the test server for cheaters right now
---
its probably because you are coming across as a greifer, people use bait people to trigger group "PvP" (more like bully v player) your best option is to go to someones camp and start punching things to break them and hope for turrets to go crazy on you
---
Nope...not this. Just run around nekkid and kill low level scorched. Hit your stash often and play "dodge the death script." Just not play is the a-holes "winning." Just watch your tails out there and have fun!
---
They have over two minutes to check and leave...
---
I think it's connected to the private servers not spawning legendaries bug...
---
My only guess could be navigation for ai or people so they played it super safe
---
If it wasn‚Äôt a joke I‚Äôd almost call that a kamikaze
---
That seems a like an adequate exchange.
---
Yeah i realised that after posting, thatsvwhy i out for pc in the description
---
Also fallout 4 buildings cant be destroyed so I doubt they wanna work on that
---
Yeah, even if maybe just use thisntime to kevel up a new character or something
---
The Assaultron helmet works for me on PS4?
---
I dont think so since theyre not technically an inventory item, but i cant say for sure as i only know whats been in the videos ive seen
---
It's cause they are bitches. They feel I should just leave them alone so they get their xp. But in no way do I think they are ruining the game, let them hide in a bush if that's how they want to play.
---
Does this remove vsync or fix it? I‚Äôve tried the game with vsync off and it tore like Derek Redmond‚Äôs hamstring
---
And become a console pleb, HA, no thanks, I prefer not requiring aim assist.
---
*insert* Yes *meme here*
---
FO76 is no worse than GTA online. I agree that FO76 is anomalously bad, but so was GTA Online a year into its release and there is still a reason to play it. Bethesda just has to add the stuff that makes it worth playing in spite of the hackers and control the damage as best they can, like Rockstar.
---
Probably more of a pubic hair attempt of a neckbeard too
---
If you need an SB, then I believe doing Line In The Sand (and maybe Surface To Air) can help, esp as they have BoS missile launchers to help out.
---
Great, my name's StrangeMussel6
---
I think you‚Äôd be ineffective with either weapon with this build. Unarmed melee depends on almost all the damage reduction perks, including blocker, barbarian, dodgy and serendipity. Action boy and nerd rage are also important.
---
I think it‚Äôs more effective to just swap in white knight, fix it good, weapon artisan when in camp rather than dedicate so many active perk points, which are better dedicated to doing damage/staying alive.
---
I find an unperked secondary weapon works just fine. (I use an anti armor auto assault rifle).  It‚Äôs mostly useful for tagging things and low level groups. If I need to kill big mean stuff, I use a weapon I fully perked for.
---
I like ad skeleton, fireproof, sun kissed, born survivor, and healing factor.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt spend any points on stuff you‚Äôre going to do in rad zones. It‚Äôs really rare that you have to go into them, and if you do, just pop radaway, and power armor up.
---
Do you have a Tl;Dw version?
---
Or at least ask you if you want to join your previous server
---
I server hop a lot
---
How about they make it so people can‚Äôt shoot the Prydwyn at each other?
---
Worst part is they were at their camp the whole time haha
---
So here's the list of things that need to come or 76 will continue dying: Free private servers, mod support, larger camp budget, Fallout 4 stash, better ATX items, better anti-cheat. If I forgot anything, let me know.
---
I did it yesterday, a couple of runs to Morgantown airport and the collision course event.. job done!
---
Legendary scorched count
---
The solution for this would be to rejoin the server your friend was in as well.
---
It's hearsay that this is active or a problem. 
---
Let me give you a simile: Do terrorists have weapons that can cause serious damage? Yes. Are they in my city getting ready to blow me and my family up? There's no evidence of that. 
---
When I start seeing mass reports of this actually happening in-game, then I'll act accordingly. Until then I've seen a half dozen doomsaying/fearmongering posts about this topic already, with people exclaiming how they're gonna run for the hills. And I find it a bit funny that they would react with such fear when there is no real evidence that this is ongoing and there are actually several ways to avoid it as a problem-- the first being, simply don't run around other players with all your best gear if you're that fearful of being a target.
---
There are videos showing it‚Äôs validity and was confirmed by the guy who‚Äôs spent the last year making all of the unofficial bug roundups and PSAs on every stealth nerf since launch. Bethesda would never in a million years admit to something of this scale. So as far as proof goes, there isn‚Äôt a much better source you can find that doesn‚Äôt come from Bethesda‚Äôs mouth. What more do you want?
---
I'm not certain; I have GSync enabled so that prevents tearing for me. Try it? Maybe you can apply a better Vsync via RTSS or the Nvidia Control Panel overrides.
---
I'm on your side. I haven't seen any threads anywhere of people exploding over their own shit getting stolen.
---
Until then I'm not going to sweat it.
---
They should make a game that doesn‚Äôt repeatedly crash.
---
I use a tv not a monitor. It doesn‚Äôt have support for gsync or freesync
---
It wouldn't be a permanent fixture in the world, but in 'your world'. Which means it would likely operate just the same as your camp does-- the game saves the data and loads it into play when you spawn on a server.
---
That's the gist I took from it, anyway. Still waiting on actual details and no idea when that will happen.
---
That's actually really interesting, thanks!
---
I might be able to help if you‚Äôre on Xbox. I‚Äôll have to look and see what mods I can attach as I don‚Äôt usually use them.
---
I have mine in the bog near the fissure, I expect it to be nuked, it is destroyed most of the time. I have other camps.. goes with the area.
---
&gt;nerd rage, serendipity
---
correct me if im wrong, but i dont see how "bloodied build" perks help a full hp build, wouldnt VSS give me the tankyness i need?
---
my plan is to swap i heavy gun perks (stabilized, damage perks, etc) for the hard things (queen, imposter, raids) and use melee for general use.
---
&gt;wouldn‚Äôt spend any points on stuff you‚Äôre going to do in rad zones. It‚Äôs really rare that you have to go into them, and if you do, just pop radaway, and power armor up.
---
i dont think 1 single point in radsponge to get that 2nd \* of perk sharing is gonna kill me imo
---
E: i also think you missed the part where im not min/maxing for "muh absolute dps," looking to have fun with lower bullet consumption
---
I want to try to collect more unique plans from the event, guess I'm not doing for the time being.
---
I like getting ionized meat from bodies. It never spoils and it keeps my rads topped off for my bloodied build.
---
I made the changes and others before even playing just from experience and habit from 10 years of Bethesda games, so I don't know without changing them back if they made a difference. I have a 165Hz Gsync monitor and with most settings maxed I get anywhere from 50 to 90 fps.
---
Also if your fps are exceeding your 100Hz refresh rate, try using fast sync in the nvidia control panel. It uses Gsync while you're below the max refresh rate but will cap the fps when you reach the refresh rate to prevent stutter and screen tearing.
---
A what version?
---
\&gt;  If you have friends with private servers 
---
It was already discussed when FO1 came out, private servers aren't already private.  The next hack they're working on is being able to "drop in" on private servers regardless if they got an invite or not.  It's already been happening accidentally on day 1, people were creating private servers and they already had mobs dead and stuff in them, basically they were clones of existing worlds and the line between public and private wasn't quite as defined as you might assume.
---
Thanks Todd, very cool!
---
Well that's another way to it , but you have to travel . I ended up with so much legendaries that staying at the same spot was a better option for me and it's faster farming ...
---
Too long; Didn‚Äôt Watch (like tldr or too long didn‚Äôt read) basically a summarization of the information posted?
---
You mean Bethesda?
---
It's Bethesda.
---
They'd do this in literally any game if you let them.  Hackers have had 15 years to create something like this in WoW and it simply can't be done with the way the game is coded.  Whoever figured out how to do it would be able to make so much money selling items/gold they could buy their own island, it's extremely lucrative.
---
The FO76 hacks aren't even going to make anybody much money (possibly if they can sell the weapons online for real money) but they're mostly just doing it because they can.
---
Agreed. I built towns so complex in fallout 4 that the game would crash whenever I got close enough to the settlements that objects would start spawning in. Conveyor belts seemed a big culprit. Had to load an old save file for that problem.
---
That's the weapon. Not the helmet. As the other guy said, you learn the helmet from scrapping the junk item Assaultron head
---
&gt;  They just want you to stop playing and make the game look bad.
---
And Bethesda let them do it.
---
That‚Äôs funny I lost all my laser pistol mods to on PS 4 . I landed a nice legendary. Went to mod it and nothing
---
Simply put, the no loot drop timer needs to extend a few minutes after the event. Dying immediately at the end of the event is incredibly common
---
Fanboyism is nothing but toxicity and feeding into corporation greed, just saying.
---
Yeah. That's happened to me. I had ove 20 unlocked mods and today nothing.
---
Bethesda isn't going to respond to this and is going to pretend it doesn't exist.  We're unlikely to hear from any of them until the new year.
---
I put time stamps in the description if you are only looking for the mounted plans that dropped. That's only about 2 minutes. The video is about the average length of any YouTube video but it does seem long winded if you arent looking to see ALL of the rewards I guess.
---
Ok. Thanks. You on? Your gt?
---
I like to think I just hauled an entire fucking SB to my house to carve for a big feast.
---
I just got the Witcher for switch so at least I have that to go to
---
It‚Äôs not honestly about the length of the video but more that I don‚Äôt have the ability to watch the video atm. I was just curious if you had the basic information on hand or if it was video only. It‚Äôs fine though. I‚Äôll check it out later. Thanks
---
It's kind of amazing if they don't.  I took all of Thanksgiving off when my counterpart on my team worked, he's getting Christmas off and I'm working every day sans-Christmas.  The essential departments go home that day but we keep at least 1-2 people on call for an emergency.
---
I also work in a software company.  This stuff isn't hard to sort out.
---
Well said...
---
What do you get for 3500 and 21000 ? I got the first 3, but not a NW player ..
---
Shotguns are dangerous, too. Too much spread, then you nick a robot with a shot on a ghoul close by. Start running....
---
Bethesda isn't 'letting' anyone do anything. The company needs to take responsibility for poor design and security, but I'm not going to point at them as the cause because they're not the cause. That kind of thinking is stupid. 
---
The agents with bad intentions who spend time creating these hacks are the cause.
---
If you‚Äôre still doing this could I come by later? Even if just to see your camp
---
Sorry, I dont have the numbers on hand. All I remember is that I got 57 Santa Crashes, 38 Winter Icicle lights, and I think 35 Mothmans.
---
I stated it‚Äôs an alleged hack on PC, with no reports of this occurring on consoles. 
---
Exactly what part of that was untrue?
---
I don‚Äôt claim to know the minute details of how the hack works or why it could or could not occur on consoles. In my experience, however, claims that something is ‚Äòimpossible‚Äô often break down over time. 
---
Is the specific method used right now possible on console? Most likely not, otherwise we would have heard reports. 
---
Is another method that has the same (or similar) end result literally impossible?  I think that‚Äôs exceptionally challenging for anyone to make a definitive statement one way or the other. 
---
Technology advances and changes quite rapidly. The are so many reports of some form of data breach, even from high end companies, that it‚Äôs clear to me that often when the majority think there‚Äôs no way... a way is found. 
---
Hypothetical Example:  A data breach occurs at Sony, and users‚Äô account names and passwords are compromised. What would stop someone that has that information from logging in to another PS4, loading up FO76, and then transferring the victim‚Äôs inventory to a mule?
---
One path may not work. Doesn‚Äôt mean others are also roadblocked. 
---
Perhaps you are more knowledgeable than I am, and can tell me how the above situation couldn‚Äôt result in the same type of inventory loss?
---
Is it impossible for Sony‚Äôs data systems to be breached?
---
Is it impossible for another user to log in on a PS4 if they have another person‚Äôs account information?
---
3500 XP you get the Snowflake metal armor skin
---
Next 2 are:
---
7000 XP - Nuclear Winter beanie
---
14000 XP - Fur-lined Jacket &amp; Jeans
---
Private world - 6-8 workshops with santatrons. Opened around 300 gifts in one day.
---
Lmao
---
That‚Äôs a lot of Santa Booty
---
Thank god for console :P
---
If I ever find the douches who are trying to ruin the game for everyone, I'd like to see them try to do it from hell.
---
pretty sure the 2 cultist masks from the store also protect
---
First of all I‚Äôm not reading your essay, I‚Äôm just gonna assume you got upset and went on a tangent. It‚Äôs the fact you even mentioned consoles when it‚Äôs impossible. I cringe inside when people think PC FO76 hacks would even be remotely able to come to console
---
Lol. Yeah, I ended up getting 1417 plans so if you're curious feel free to see what else I got when you have time to check out the video.
---
Is the presents at the bottom an atom shop unlock or reward ?
---
Anyone know where I can find the pics of all the NW rewards ?
---
Do they have an instance of this happening in adventure mode publicly?
---
Like spawning the prydwen and looting, was it in a private server? Its possible that they've managed to give themselves some elevated permission within their own private server. 
---
The conspiracy nut in me wonders if someone has managed to get the server architecture yet to run their own truly private servers. I doubt that, but it's not impossible. 
---
Until I see evidence of it happening in a public game I'll remain skeptical
---
Will do
---
Thanks any pics of these things anywhere ?
---
Apparently if they take your PipBoy as well, it corrupts your character and causes a rollback to the point they have your items, while you still have them. Basically a duping method. All speculation tho
---
I'm good with just the CAMP items...
---
Them changing it to the XP not counting towards all rewards is causing me to say fuck it to grinding.
---
So what I've learned from this is that armor plans are rare, the plasma grenade and plasma mine are rare, mounted brahmin are not.
---
if you pay  $60 for for a game and spend  time and effort on your character 
---
you  should have  grounds  for a class action lawsuit  against these incel pricks 
---
not to mention the poor sods who lose their jobs 
---
because the company they worked for gets ruined by these jackasses
---
THIS IS A CONSPIRACY PUT OUT BY BUGTHESDA TO GET PEOPLE TO BUY FO FIRST.  WAKE UP SHEEPLE
---
But does anyone know for sure if the private servers are safe?
---
What‚Äôs your psn?
---
I‚Äôll throw you some nice low level legendary weapons and some ammo for you.
---
Edit: Who downvoted me.. Toxic AF..
---
Since you didn‚Äôt read what I wrote, your reply is not relevant. I never said a ‚ÄòPC hack‚Äô can be used on a console.  I addressed the end result, not the method.
---
And no, I didn‚Äôt get ‚Äòupset‚Äô at all. I actually asked for your input.
---
*Edit: However, it‚Äôs quite amusing to see the raised hackles and ruffled feathers over a polite and honest statement and willingness to have a rational discussion.  While that was not my intention, it was entertaining.*
---
I can't fault you for that...not gunna be fun grinding out that XP.
---
An easy bet would be for Bethesda to IP ban the user in the video and the person that made the hack and all alt accounts to slow the process down.  Furthermore, they should legally go after the hackers that are trying to ruin the game.
---
True, really hope you are right...
---
lol kinda, I mean they do get like 2 minutes of warning before the nuke goes off. So, if they don't move their camp, or switch servers, it's kinda on them.
---
Yet you said ‚Äúno reports of this happening on console‚Äù so you insinuated it could happen. My cause of response was because people act like it can happen on console lol and you happened to mention it
---
Hang in there. It will get better. Learn how to use VATS and build your character toward it. Spend a day or two simply collecting materials, scrap,  then sell them. Screws(2-3 caps each), gears(1 cap), springs(1 cap), steel(1-2 caps), acid(2-3 caps) all sell very well. Looks for globes, desk fans, toys cars, typewriters, clip boards, anything with steel, paint cans, abraxo cleaner.... pick up all tools you find and scrap them. Some give lead.

Think this is think to see them all.
---
&gt;I've seen a half dozen
---
That's more than half the player base!
---
This game is why I'll never another full priced Bethesda game.
---
You got hacked, a new hack released recently that make player be able to steal other players inventory.
---
There's a new hack going around that lets the hacker steal your entire inventory.  Sounds like you're a victim of it. 
---
Bethesda has known about the exploit for weeks now and they've done nothing about it.  They probably won't restore anything you lost either since they don't really care.
---
just do as many missions as possible and get a few good melee weapons because unless youre using a hunting rifle it is hard to find a gun and keep a sufficient amount of ammunition. Also pick up as much junk as possible and scrap it all eventually youll be running low on everything so get as much as possible as early as possible. maybe consider looking for areas to grind xp for more perks aswell. google is great help looking for answers for good grinding spots. also when accessing menus just make sure your in a safe spot or crouch to see if youre in danger before entering a menu and if you didnt know you can favourite weapons to switch between them easier while in combat. eventually youll get used to the controls or maybe even consider changing them a bit it that helps.
---
Because refunds were denied. This is (possibly) his way of getting more than even. Also they are already gone. Mark my word, nothing will be fixed until after their break ends. They didn‚Äôt do anything last year when everything was duped to high hell and back. That dupe iirc was force crashing the server to capture two instances of loot
---
I believe some of the plans don't drop unless you are a certain level so if you wanted to farm plasma grenade plans or something like that you should open your gifts on a lvl 15 - 30 because the pool of plans that can drop for them is smaller.
---
I have no hacking ability, but as someone who can only grow an Apache beard this comment hits to close to home
---
For the menu problem, try to favorite frequently used items like stimpaks, RadAway, etc., then they can be accessed much faster without having to use the Pip-Boy. If enemies seem too difficult, do not rush the main story, first level up in the easier areas: The Forest, then Toxic Valley after level 15, then Ash Heap maybe from level 25. The eastern half of the map is harder, and enemies can be scaled up to level 60+ because of other, high level players.
---
Thank you, omg that is the Xmas tree .. wow .. the metal looks dope but I am more of a PA user .. but might still do it .. will be a grind for me ..
---
Do you get more XP if I just join and be part of a team and hide vs going in solo, Don't want to let the team down, but if I get more XP ..
---
Same but I‚Äôm lvl 20
---
They gave extra time though.
---
I‚Äôll get downvoted for saying this, but I guarantee that outsourced crew would get vastly underpaid
---
Again, you clearly did not read my followup post.
---
Other than the Raid Glitch from a few months back, have there ever been any substantiated reports of a console player losing all of their inventory?
---
Is there no possible way that another user on console could acquire another user‚Äôs inventory without their consent?
---
Same xp
---
I mean, definitely underpaid, but it'll keep the game rolling without hackers if they knew basic things
---
Nah just fast traveling seems to cause it for me
---
Good idea. Honestly I just hate bearding Brahmin, especially when trying to do the event solo
---
Exactly, but last year I know that Bethesda took a break for a week or 2 and things went RAMPANT. They should learn from that
---
You get the same XP regardless..it all depended on how well you do in the match &amp; how long you survive...whether on a team or solo
---
The funny thing is I feel like while that outsourced crew is on it they would somehow fix some of the day one broken shit like 250drwr
---
No there‚Äôs no way, at least hacking wise.
---
Thanks is that in agility
---
have both SFE  and Perk load out 
---
as well a two minor mods for seeing damage percent and HP 
---
and keeping favorite items from getting scrapped
---
perkloadout is a godsend
---
If the playerbase was legitimately small that might be funny. But since it's not, you just seem like a dumb-dumb.
---

---
There's that guy in this sub who post a bug list every patch with the fixes for each and every bug, that they obviously haven't used. They should just hire him, even for the week lol
---
So sorry dude, Bethesda should be trying to fix these problems, not waiting for them to go away, the hackers have prevailed, so sad
---
Not what I asked. Again, what I said was there were no reports of ‚Äòtotal inventory loss‚Äô on console. 
---
Whether from a hack or glitch or data breach wouldn‚Äôt really matter to the average user.
---
I think it‚Äôs fun :(. And I hate battle royales. I bought the game before the mode was added. Didn‚Äôt think I would like it. It‚Äôs a fun change of pace every once in awhile.
---
Why do you say they are he only non-atom shop rewards? There were a ton of rewards released for scorched event.
---
Aten_Ra is too good for Bethesda lmao. He‚Äôs honest about what happens in the game code. He calls out every stealth nerf
---
They never bring back the old flooring like the astro turf and the yellow &amp; blue mosaic tile.. I've only seen the dark/ light wood floors come back once..
---
Iv been playing off and on all day. Nothing on my end
---
Do you have a theory why they run the game like this? Too expensive to safeguard? Inexperienced devs? Bethesda are the actual meta antagonist we need to defeat?
---
Honestly surprised they didn't do this when they first released it.
---
If you have a recording of it don‚Äôt delete it whatsoever. It‚Äôs the only chance you‚Äôll get anything back
---
I hate when they are killing MY legendary ghoul. It's a big decision moment about whether to attempt to land a hit without involving the bots. The ones that always get me are at one of the gates behind the golf club. The one by the 2 story building that you can go inside.
---
Does a hastily recolored beanie really matter that much?
---
I grinded for the Snowflake Paint.  It took two days.  It was worth it.  I don't plan on going for the rest.
---
I take a very nonchalant attitude toward Nuclear Winter.  I don't really care if I win or lose.  If I make it into the Top 10, I call it good.
---
So it started... :(
---
Contact bethesda support, maybe they'll be able to make some rollback.
---
I'm just hiding on my private server forever
---
That‚Äôs good to know, that such a hack couldn‚Äôt be the method of attack. Hopefully there aren‚Äôt any other ‚Äònon-hacking‚Äô methods that come up. 
---
 No one deserves to lose all of their inventory, especially those just trying to play the game legitimately.
---
Love the hackers in this game! Really does make the game actually enjoyable
---
You don‚Äôt. Bethesda does(n‚Äôt). Problem fixed
---
Got moved back to spring of 2020
---
That's him! And yes, he is too good for Bethesda, but the fact that he's doing all this while Bethesda fixes a few bugs here and there that break something else.. shit, he's GIVING them the bug fixes for free, and they don't wanna even try it out
---
Worst timing ever. Devs are out on holiday and a new hack allows people to use you as a container and take everything and leave whatever they want behind
---
The roadmap for this game derailed damn near right after it was announced.
---
Just went there and bagged 4 holiday/legendary scorched! Will try and return before the 31st to get some more üëç
---
Btw did they redesign the airport interior? I seem to think they did but not been there since the early days...
---
Thanks, I  knew that already. It's just that this guy made a 10minute long video to squeeze some more ads into it. Every video is 10mminute long even if the info you need is 30 seconds.
---
This is what I'm doing.  I capture like 10 shops and fast travel in a circle to recapture.  While I'm recapturing I pick up my extractor mats and gifts.  XP, mats, gifts.  I'm sure farming the caverns with a nice build is better for gifts, but this is the method for everyone else.  Very chill.
---
Dude, you're doing this to yourself. The cosmetic rewards aren't worth it; would you actually even use them over what you're currently wearing, or do you just want them for collections' sake?
---
Don't play video games like it's a job. That means missing out on some timed exclusives, but it also means you won't suck the joy out of what's supposed to be a fun hobby.
---
what?????????
---
wow
---
Here‚Äôs one source
---
that's apparently what's happening
---
Should I be worried if I‚Äôm on PS4?
---
Yes everyone has read about the new bug so everyone‚Äôs gonna bitch hopeing Bethesda will give them everything for free
---
I never thought to open workshops and put a santatron in each! Genius!
---
Same here.. I seem to remember being able to go up the escalator to where the overseers cache is..
---
I wish I shared your tastes, but I just don‚Äôt like the repetitiveness, the long loadings (back to the main menu after death, finding a new lobby, waiting in the lobby, waiting for the map to load)... I just don‚Äôt feel like it respect my time at all. And I‚Äôm not good at aiming, which means I‚Äôm constantly killed.
---
Really the only way for me to function and reach the last combatants I‚Äôve found is to hide in bushes and wait.
---
&gt; There were a ton of rewards released for scorched event.
---
Well... Yes and no. I was mostly talking about Holiday stuff. We have like some Santa Claus butt decoration and some ice-themed things you can put on your ceilings... Whereas NW gets:
---
- A wreath
---
- Presents
---
- An ugly (but adorable) Christmas tree
---
- Weapon skin
---
- Armor paints
---
- A unique reskin beanie
---
- A unique reskin winter coat
---
All for the ‚Äòmodest‚Äô sum of 27 000 exp. At roughly 250-300 exp per game, maths are telling me I should be actively playing *daily* to make sure I get everything on time. That‚Äôs what is making me angry.
---
If the rewards were simply stacked to the rest of permanent NW rank rewards and were at, let‚Äôs say, rank 100-150, whatever, I would be fine actually because I know I would get them *someday* at my own pace, but now I have to rush this *during the holidays*. It‚Äôs not cool :(
---
Maybe they can do a rollback on hes character. Players who lost all their stuff before from bugs got their stuff back.
---
Here‚Äôs a link to the first source. A lot of information in this one
---

---
I‚Äôm not saying OP is lying or anything, but nice PS4 Trade posts.
---
EDIT: OP is not lying. Thought he played on PS4 but he plays on PC now.
---
Hopefully that‚Äôs an option. I remember when in the beginning they swore up and down they couldn‚Äôt do anything to help you get stuff back
---
I haven't personally found the icicle plans or any of the rare heads! Only your basic Appalachian creatures lol
---
There have been no reports of mass inventory loss from console players, whether through a hack/glitch/breach.
---
Last I heard of anything similar was the Vault Raid glitch from a while ago and the Scrap Box glitch, but nothing recent.
---
Thanks!
---
Nice camp BTW. Love how you used the fascnacht garland branches.
---
Hey not to be a dick, but can you post a screenie or something? We haven't seen *any* evidence of this hack yet except the so claimed hackers themselves.
---
Totally fair, everyone should judge based on what they see and judge as valid until Bethesda chooses to respond
---
They fixed audio bugs multiple times. The nexus mod I have made sure it stays quiet now. There are many fixes that Bethesda refuses to use even though they work better
---
I think it was a joke. Dumb dumb give me gum gum.
---
Pc only
---
Just PC as it involves using an external script. Only way it could work on console would be if someone took an extreme level of work to make external scripts work on a console. So it's most likely never going to come to console.
---
I have 33/42 mods unlocked if you still need help.
---
These stories are believed because of the lack of control that Bethesda seems to exercise over cheating ie look at NW. These stories gain traction because there is a possibility that it's true given Bethesda's track record. This extends to all platforms ie long standing bug going unfixed, then attempted fixes that break the game further( I'm looking at you patch 16), Bethesda appears incompetent so these stories have an air of credibility.
---
&gt; Dude, you're doing this to yourself. The cosmetic rewards aren't worth it; would you actually even use them over what you're currently wearing, or do you just want them for collections' sake?
---
Considering I equipped and still currently use Halloween skins on my weapons and my combat armors, unfortunately there‚Äôs a chance I would actually use them. I was more forgiving with Halloween‚Äôs grind because at least I could level up all my rewards at once but right now I‚Äôm questioning Bethesda‚Äôs decision to force us through one reward at the time.
---
I mean yeah, in the grand scheme of things nobody really need these rewards. But that doesn‚Äôt make the design direction okay or not worth discussing. If we don‚Äôt say anything they‚Äôll just slowly make things worse. 
---
We went from a small 7k for VTU to 15k for Halloween (with all rewards earnable at once) to 27k for Christmas (one reward at the time). I dread what could come next.
---
Generally yes, the more people who know the more people who try do it and also further refine the process or find new exploits..
---
I agree, seems like it doesn't work fine on every servers. Teaming up gets better results for me . But most of the time random team mates don't understand why I shoot and ultracine to ask them collect it...
---
You fell for Todd's lies.
---
Hi. Yes. Are you on? Your gt?
---
Yup. Gt is tishu315. Shoot me an invite.
---
That is the reason I can't watch his videos anymore.
---
Bethesda is doing that all by themselves, especially when it comes to this very issue, that they have no anti-cheat to stop this. But yea I see your point.
---
lol yes
---
Nope, console is safe atm
---
have they said they where gunno fix it
---
They‚Äôre gone dude lmao. They won‚Äôt be back until after the holidays. The reason I believe this is it‚Äôs what they did last year when people were force crashing servers to duplicate items
---
They care, atleast the people I‚Äôve met do, but they are also a large company know, so less agile
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted, you're not wrong. Yea the people using the hack are assholes, but it's because of Bethesda that they're even able to be assholes on this game in the first place. Like you said with your WoW example, in a good game, this simply wouldn't be possible.
---
I'd rather it be cumulative and less time.
---
Solid 3rd party program, personally ran into stability issues with Sandboxie, but also have a unusual rig
---
I'm not saying the mentioned hack is not real but this post smells funny.
---
Has anyone from Bethesda commented in this yet?
---
Did you read the first sentence of my post? I sold my PS4 a month ago and switched to PC. I'm sorry that I didn't notify you.
---
Thank you for explaining. I appreciate it.
---
Thanks, and at my peak I was running 4 to 5 instances of ‚Äò76 on one PC, at that point it‚Äôs less about having an awesome rig and more about balancing the load :)
---
Good advice thank you
---
Thank you, speaking of the Vault Raid glitch, was that ever fixed?
---
What? People dont joke here on the fo76 subreddit. It's only srsbsns here!
---
No problem! Have fun in the wasteland!
---
yeah the whole ground floor seem diferent and a basement that wasn;t there before...
---
COuldn't find a way upstairs - my new mission is to re-explore the airport!
---
What do you mean hackers? I don't think there's a hack capable of clearing my whole inventory; even less so when I didn't trade with anyone.
---
Just avoid the game entirely. Problem solved!
---
Thanks again TFV, that was really cool of you to help out.
---
Invite sent. My gt amar0807

Hey brother! Happens to me, too, ocasionally. And don't be scared when a bunch of sleeping ghouls follow you!

Definitely NAH

I will be on later
---
Last year we had griefers attacking new players. This year we seem to have scare tactics. While I wouldn't be surprised at this point if Bugthesda's code was THAT easy to rip apart, until something more substantial than speculative videos claiming to have proof, then I'm just going to chalk it up to a bullshit post to take in some karma, and spoop the players.
---
Also are other players pretty brutal In this game? Is it better to play with a group? He cuz I don't have any Xbox friends and I hate online games where your constantly getting ur ass kicked if your by urself smh
---
You gotta be kidding me...
---
K joining. What you want on it?
---
If you are tired of hiding in bushes you should try building porta potties and hiding in plain sight!
---
Head through the basement, then up the stairs , before you do look through the crack in the wall at the end of the basement , that‚Äôs where you need to go to get the pass that opens the locked door..
---
Make a rifle, more dmg idk hardened recivernor something like that and that's it
---
is that the crack with a dead responder in a chair on the otherside?   
---
WIll definitely need to redo that place now!
---
Is Bethesda even aware of this? Wtf are they doing!?
---
K. Built for rifleman, not for commando.

Yep that‚Äôs the.. up the stairs and down the other side

Okey that makes more sense, overlooked the date the Trade posts were made, Sorry about that

I sold a lot of holiday plans at 50 caps each as well as armor, prime and other weapon plans at half list price. So much so I have to rush to a robot many times to spend the caps on gift wraps (\~40k). I also had good sale of my Junkie-s and Bloodied weapon collection (1k-2k) nobody was interested in before the holiday events.
---
Welcome to the club üëç
---
I mean the devs themselves can often do a great job at that
---
Well maybe hackers are on here seeing the bullshit prices people put up on the market and go after them to teach them a lesson about overpricing? I stopped playing a long time ago. I think I was level 16.  back when it was apparently okay to go up to people and jab them with a combat knife until they died and stole their junk, you can probably still do that now, I don't really pay to much attention to 76 news, I wonder what they added to 76 now.. and if it's okay to comback to? Now with the player count seeming to be extremely low
---
What you really are saying is you want it to take leas xp. Being concurrent vs consecutive is just the way it‚Äôs structured. They could make it cumulative but increase xp needed for final reward, resulting in it still taking same amount of time.
---
Pretty sure it isn't a thing on any version. The amount of fucketry it would take to do what that post claimed just doesn't seem reasonable at all, and the post felt like a lazy attempt to spoop players into not doing the event, and to keep new players from logging in. I'm not saying you'd need an MIT masters to hack this game, but to do so, on such a level, only to grief players, instead of, oh maybe doing something against Bugthesda, and the bullshit they've been pulling for the past year, seems like a stretch. Then again, if you gave an average person an immense amount of power, they'd likely feck it up as well...
---
Not as far as im aware, the ticket i made is "under review" so theyve seen it
---
I hope bethesda does something to care for it‚Äôs PC players right now. Either giving access to private servers like others have mentioned, or hasty fixes or something. It also sucks that so many will be afraid to participate in the holiday scorched events until this is fixed as well.
---
Not sure if it was there before .. probably was,  but before you go into where the cache is.. there is a locked room that has one of the best holotapes in the game
---
I know less than most(I'm a Xbox player) but from what I have been lead to believe hackers can use your inventory as a kind on stash box to take what they wish within a 200m radias of you, ask others for a more detailed analysis.
---
They need to take this guy to court and hold him liable for damages and intention to cause harm to the player base. It's one thing to spawn things in for yourself and mess around but another to go out of your way to hurt others just for the fun of it. These are the kind of hackers that end up in jail for hurting society.
---
There‚Äôs full on reddit threads about it including videos pretty comprehensive evidence go look
---
I sound like a bitch but ........ got anything to spare? Level 28 btw.......
---
No
---
Are other players pretty brutal when ur by yourself? Jw cuz I don't really play with anyone else online so some games I tend to stop playing if it's hard by urself
---
They removed slap damage a very long time ago, and high prices or not, being able to rob anyone of everything its like using a nuke to get rid of the jehovas at your door
---
Juicehead doing good work as always. Hope he doesn't get banned for promoting exploiting. Seems like the Bethesda thing to do even though he's actually the one helping the 76 community out.
---
:D
---
Well it‚Äôs not really a matter of whether or not a beanie is meaningful but nobody should encourage insane grinds during the Holidays, whether or not one enjoy the mode. It‚Äôs unhealthy. Out of all the online games I play, only FO76 has locked thematic rewards behind such requirements of nearly daily plays. Most other games actually offer something nice, relaxing and accessible, or to just log-in once. The PVE Holiday event is great on that front because you can do things at your own pace and in worse case scenario you can likely find someone to trade some plans with. Not in NW.
---
In addition, the ‚Äòtimed‚Äô NW reward system has gotten worse over time, we went from VTU asking for 7k exp to 15k with Halloween to 27k during Christmas. I‚Äôm just afraid it‚Äôs going to be even worse next time.
---
That juice guy did a video on it, with his inventory being stolen.
---
The hack is very much real
---
Yeah, if i don't have any backup I'm very selective about where/what I build. The low cost perk helps too in case I lose it all
---
We were chatting about just a few mins ago, thinking he migjt actually be liable for damages since its also stealing atom shop items which would amount to actual theft of a store
---
It's a nice idea but I just don't see Bethesda doing it. I'd more likely expect them to shutdown the servers altogether before making private worlds available to all players.
---
He said in his post that he was browsing reddit when the TOP comments are about hacks. Indeed this is trolling.
---
Ah damn. This is an ultracite one different mods. Of which I have zero. :( nice gun btw!
---
Have to agree with you on this one.  It‚Äôs only because Bethesda has shown to be such a mess that anyone even takes this stuff as a faint possibility.
---
"Are scorchbeasts falling out of the sky?!"
---
WHUMP!
---
"Yes, El Guapo."
---
OP is trolling. Too bad people can't smell it. 
---
   I'm still not sure the scrapbox bug was even real. I still believe people invented it so bethesda would give them free stuff because it was \*1st Membership and they knew they HAD to give something for paying customers.
---
Ok thanks anyway. But i can make rifle of it?
---
You must waste a lot of your life on these comments. ;)
---
The only video evidence I have seen has all been the same clip.
---
Edit: I have now seen a second clip. It looks like theyre displaying different verions of a client though.
---
Consider where we are.  Bethesda could slap their mother in face and these people would find a way to justify it.
---
That‚Äôs never going to happen. They want to take our money not give it back. They won‚Äôt even address these issues like the original hack or the update that broke all weapons and armor after reloading. They gave that half assed update on the new NPC‚Äôs bear Vault 76 as a PR stunt
---
Yeah hopefully they take note and take action quickly
---
the "evidence" was all provided by the guy who started the rumor, and various youtubers reporting on that same source.
---
I stand with everything you stated here. Altough the hack might be possible, before there are actual widely reported incidents or otherwice evidence beyond reasonable doubt there is little to none chance for a casual player to lose his inventory. 
---
I kind of hope that Betheada would come up and say that this is not possible at all or is under urgent investigation.
---
Now I've even more interested if there is new lore too!
---
I've been telling my freinds the same, thanks for spreading the word
---
Scrapbox bug syndrome
---
You‚Äôre a madman!
---
When your full time job is making youtube videos i cant really complain about wanting to make them to get ads on to be honest, i see where your coming from but i also see their side
---
If I'm wrong, so be it...but I gotta call bullshit.  You have over 20k karma, which leads me to believe you are on reddit a TON.  You telling me you haven't read shit about all this since its been all over the fucking pages and also expect me to believe you just happen to be the very convenient patient zero?  GTFOH.üòò
---
Thats a shame, maybe do a phycology analysis on the hackers :p
---
Leader of the pack event gives you three easy legendary enemies every time. Add that to a couple holiday scorched and it shouldn't take that long at all
---
It‚Äôs so strange how different peoples experiences can be.. so I searched the sub for ‚ÄúDense‚Äù to see if something had changed because since the patch I‚Äôve been finding Dense Plans at the (Lewisburg) vendor more often than I ever had before. 
---
Weird
---
That‚Äôs because the state of stuff you recently did can follow you into a private server. Stuff you‚Äôve looted in a public game will still be looted in a private game etc
---
If your farming for materials to make stabilized flux to use you need to pick up the high radiation fluids, hardened masses, and glowing masses to be able to turn raw flux into stabilized flux.  It takes one high rad fluid, one glowing mass, one hardened mass, and 10 raw flux to make one stabilized flux.  The raw flux comes from the fauna and will be different colors based on the plant type.  The raw flux will eventually degrade and go inert so I usually pick it last.  You can also drink inert flux and it weighs less than water.   I also grab the ionized meat since it never spoils.
---
I experienced similar on the free weekend - about 5 of those crates would spawn together - some I saw actively falling to the ground, others already there.  I couldn't interact with them and they didn't appear to be tied to any particular action or event.
---

---
Not sure. I had 0 mods for it. I dont think I've seen any ultracites to scrap for mods. Might have to craft a bunch or get someone else to assist.
---
Very good point, they started hacking to intentionally steal atomic items so yes it should be considered theft and pursued legally. Hopefully sweet justice ends this hackers career before he can do more damage to the game and create further invasive and aggressive hacks.
---
This might come as a surprise to you, but I didn't make this post to convince you about anything. I was merely looking for information, and now I have it.
---
Good day.
---
Hmm ok thanks
---
Just log off and back in
---
not talking about the hack, this guy is trolling
---
It's just another rumor without proof

No, nobody can really hurt you- you have to accept PVP by returning fire. If you turn pacifist mode on you won‚Äôt accidentally go hostile against other players. The only exception is in workshops which are PVP areas if you attempt to take control of one. It won‚Äôt matter if you have pacifist mode on there. 
---
It‚Äôs similar to FO4 in terms of enemy difficulty I would say. A few parts are more challenging but you can eventually level/perk up to make it no problem.
---
Nice find!!
---
tbf if anything explosive should be fixed over two shot, seeing as how explosive also needs perks to be worth it
---
An apache beard sounds cool
---
The holiday scorched are definitely gonna help with this questline.. but will keep my eyes open for that event as well...
---
He also did a video on the trade stealing that was fake to
---
Oh ok thank you
---
As I said, I haven't touched the game since Fallout 1st.
---
And as I said, I would never have bought the game had Bethesda not straight up lied about the future nature of the atomic shop. 
---
Had there been kits, bots, 1st, etc at launch I just wouldn't have touched it, I don't play such games and am not interested in them. Not to mention this is not a F2P, it's a full priced title.
---
20 whatever thousand is too much...NW is already a redhead stepchild of a mode that most people dislike.
---
14k total XP for all rewards would suffice...long as they keep camp items front loaded it'll be "OK"
---
&gt; If I ever find the douches who are trying to ruin the game for everyone, I'd like to see them try to do it from hell.
---
Yeah, I'm totally sure this wouldn't be you.
---
&gt;E-e-excuse m-m-m-me, w-what you're d-d-doing isn't v-very ni....ni..nice! You sh-should s-s-st.... NEVERMINDIMSORRY! *runs away*
---
.....that will keep you fed for about 10 minutes before you are starving again.
---
This is bethesda's way of making you pay for fallout first.
---
People mad at Bethesda and not the people doing the action or am I misunderstanding?
---
Of course they wait until Bethesda have their holiday break, so no one can stop the problem unless a whole team comes in 
---
But also I can't say I'm surprised, hackers obviously don't care about anything except for their own fun. Assholes
---
How so?
---
I build my Santatron right in the middle of an open space and a scrapbox. i don't bother building anything else turret or otherwise unless there's a resource I want in that current workshop. I don't like to build turrets because on day one I had a turret kill a Santa scorched and I got No loot from him because of it. sometimes I defend them sometimes I retake them it depends on what I'm doing at the time. I have yet to have my Santatron destroyed by a mob. He works great as a magnet though. Everything rushes towards him while I stand off to the side and kill it all. all that excess construction it's a waste of resources.
---
Yeah TKmantis did a video on this aswell and spoke to the guy who made the hack and the way he described him was as an absolute prick
---
Got 3500 yesterday just bush camping into the top 10...think I'll just go ahead and get the hat for shit and giggles...
---
Kept hearing about berserker for a while but Idk if anyone still uses it.
---
Then plumbers seem few and far between it seems anymore.
---
Melee and rifles are still king 
---
Heavy is runner up
---
Everything else is bust sadly
---
server hop to same area x 100...yeah..sounds really really lame, but hey to each his own
---
Same here. Either Gov Aid Drop or SB corpse. Sometimes when it happens unexpected it gives me a little fright üòÇ
---
Its just a patch here and a patch there
---
I call bullshit. Just a troll fishing for shit.
---
And if not, prove it.
---
I see it as not having any respect for my time. This whole trend with 10:01+ minute video is getting out of hand. I understand that this is how they earn their money but they need to show respect for their viewers.
---
Since this whole trend started I either don't watch any videos that are 10:01 long or if I watch them I directly skip to minute 4-5.
---
Im angry at the hackers, just need bethesda to be aware and the good community as a whole to be aware so you guys dont get your shit stolen
---
So its not a helicopter?
---
I've been actively looking for the sake of me and my friends for proof of someone getting griefed by hackers since the report and I've yet to see a single case reported on reddit. However I know the issue is real since supposedly a group I know had someone go out of their way to test and confirm that it was a real threat and the group considers themselves anti hack/dupe oriented. I'm starting to think that hackers know that they are found out and are too cautious to use said hacks because it can easily be traced back to them. By all rights a major hack like this should have had dozens of reports by now from people affected but we have yet to see a single one.
---
I mean, unless the hackers get into your private servers id say yes
---
So theres many gamebreaking exploits in the game that bethesda wont or possibly cant close off. But the defacto solution is to use their subscription service? Well its been fun at times, but unless Wastelanders is a game changer, im out.
---
I think he let the guy do it too him for no other reason than he couldn't believe it except with his own eyes
---
You can hack consoles to, but from my understanding, at least with Xbox(what I use), trying to use a hacked Xbox online Microsoft has some sort of check system and can disable that Xbox from using online services...
---
I've never messed with hacked consoles personally, but had some friends that would mess around with them for funsies and they said you simply can't use a hacked console to connect with Xbox live once they catch it, and they catch it quickly.
---
I recently finished a Berserker build and am having fun with it. Being a tank is easy, but running around naked is more exciting.
---
Wow that's pretty under priced. Good find!
---
Not today but a couple weeks ago I traded my bloody plasma rifle with extra crit damage with flame barrel on it to someone for their legacy bloody explosive laser rifle. I then found another bloody plasma with crit damage later that day in a vendor for 5k caps and haggled down to 3.5. Essentially I paid 3.5k caps for a BE laser rifle
---
I go toe to toe with people higher leveled than me and I‚Äôm 230. Some people are just wimps and act hard until someone higher leveled challenged them lmao
---
To be fair only a few people have it at this point. It‚Äôs not really released to the public yet
---
This thing  reeks of being a rumor and scaring people off the public servers. No first hand reports only vid looks fake. Most the evidence is Reddit posts and you tubers referring to each other as being the source. Bethesda Microsoft and Sony not saying a thing about a game breaking hack.. seems like a way to get public severs cleared out to farm scorched to me.
---
I've had this one for almost a year. üëç
---
Well that was my defacto solution, if its available, use that for the time being, if you dont have it yourself, join a friends private server, if thats also not available probably best to avoid until its fixed.
---
Because we all know that this sub is the only one in reddit. I have been unsubbed since the Fallout 1st controversy, just came back to post this.
---
The scrapbox bug was real and it was well documented. It happened to me and other people I play with. The bug was only present for approximately the first 48 hours and it did not affect every fallout first player. There may have been some people who tried to get extra scrap by saying it happened to them when it didn't. However, most of us reported it immediately and we had no idea if we would ever get our stuff back or if we would get anything at all. Also it was a month before I did get the scrap from Bethesda.
---
Weren't you in Rifle Gaming's camp with me and everyone else?
---
Ok. I think it‚Äôs a broad statement saying most people dislike it. I don‚Äôt think you have any data to support that. 
---
Anyway you are entitled to your opinion
---
Oof. So because my opinion doesn't match yours I am not trustworthy? Interesting. I came to my own conclusions about this game, doesn't mean I can't report facts about things when I see them.
---
No.
---
Why people continue to play this game is beyond me
---
Shame really
---
It seems to count for all rewards for me, just like the Halloween ones
---
Edit: Nevermind, this game sucks
---
Indeed
---
On console there are no hackers on FO76 so there's that too.
---
I saw a lvl 16 wanted player all alone on the map today. Thought I would help them (and myself to some caps) and get rid of their wanted icon. 
---
Showed up, 3 other players all lvl 300+ waiting in stealth to ambush. Fml..
---
Could make a new character for the time being and transfer them over after its fixed?
---
WHAT?! What view doesn't freeze up? Which one is the fucky one?
---
It's actually easy if you just...build the game right the first time, instead of shoehorning multiplayer into the original fallout engine, which was SP.
---
Has there been any tangible evidence of this "player inventory hack".
---
What exactly is this hack? And what platform(s) is it on? 
---
I‚Äôve seen many posts about a hack but honestly have no clue what‚Äôs going on.
---
Never tried NW honestly... How long does it take normally to get the xp for these?
---
What's the worst or best case scenario per match lol
---
holy handgrenade, you've all spooked yourselves into not playing!
---
Wasn't that the same dude claiming people were making 20* legendaries, because that was also proven to be bullshit.
---
Have fun in Nuclear Winter
---
My luck at the purveyor was terrible. I‚Äôve been using a 3 star legendary left leg for a long time, and it always breaks. So I decided to try my luck at getting a new one. I think I bought about 10, and 2 of those were left legs. One was another leather left leg with worse effects, and the other was a trapper left leg with equally terrible effects.
---
I‚Äôm still using my crappy leather left leg, and am carrying around a bunch of crappy rolls that I can‚Äôt sell for scrip because I hit the limit.
---
Cowards. That's why. 
---
If you have chosen the right Perks, there's no difference between a level 50, 130 or 500. 
---
So I see anything over 50 as fair game.
---
It happens by the Tyler county fairgrounds.  Which coincidentally is full of scorched to kill once you're done with the event ;)
---
But explosive is a secondary effect it shouldn't be that powerful. If explosive was a primary, like it should of been, I'd agree with you
---
Umm.  Can I team up.. lol .. all that free ammo must just suck üôÇ
---
There's been two videos already, and a lot of people "in the know" confirmed it exists. What else you want, white house statement?
---
Ah yeah now I remember it!!
---
Yeah i am in it lol
---
Hacker is another really easy one to get and do.
---
This! All afternoon long I have been followed by scorchbeast bodies dropping from the sky!  And it's the one I killed earlier today, same loot and all!
---
The view that shows when you are in PA. The one without the border of the PipBoy skin.
---
Ohh I agree well made characters can compensate and work with any team I was meaning it more in a general team concept - 9 out of 10 bloodied builds are very difficult to solo with in high radiation areas since generally things that keep a team alive debuffs their damage 
---
I know several bloodied builds who have ways to get around this and if not actually heal their party members like a friend of mine who drinks radiated food and drink while leaving rad sponge on himself but not sharing it thus letting him balance his rads while healing his team mates - he also shares some other perks depending on situation that makes people harder to injure thus helping the entire team.
---
But a lot of bloodied players are - look I stacked all these points and now can kill anything 1 hit - \*gets swarmed by radiation hitting enemies or rad zone\* I can't believe you didn't help me... also you can't use anything that heals radiation to heal me and still have to protect me from radiation in a radioactive wasteland...... or your a terrible team mate.....
---
And I've teamed with over 100 Bloodied build characters 7 of which I have not started making excuses to avoid teaming with
---
Ive only seen the Juicehead one can you share the other please?
---
Indeed. It seems to only be a pc problem
---
Yes, there is a Google sheet floating around...should be able to find it googling FO76 Festival Rewards IIRC, sorry don't have the link readily available.
---
I don't really have a way to transfer stuff between characters.
---
To be frank, these rewards aren't for you. If you don't enjoy playing nuclear winter, the higher tier rewards aren't for you. I was playing yesterday and went to revive my partner, I saw two glittering Halloween masks and said "they're high level players, we've been ambushed". Next thing you know, team eliminated. 
---
That's what the 15K xp reward is for. To show off how bad ass you are, same as the vault armour. I have to kill 94 ants this week to get the vault photo frame and I'm genuinely unsure whether the cost is worth the reward. It is for somebody. All of these things are worth it to somebody, just not for everybody
---
Lol. Message me and when I get back on I'll trade you the plans.
---
I could help you out if you want
---

---
The name of the safe is "duchess stash" lol
---
They would just lie about it anyway.
---
Agreed I'm actually max on my unarmed build at 39
---
the ACM called, they want to give you a Turing Award for solving all these longstanding problems in distributed systems. turns out nobody had thought to just 'build it right the first time'! wow!
---
?
---
The ants aren't worth it. The kleos is yours
---
That's not necessary, but thanks for the offer!
---
The post yesterday had video of the hack in action from the same group of players who published the method to spawn NPC, game assets, and any item in game. Also the guy who usually does the community bug roundups and usually tells Bethesda exactly how to fix them confirmed that it was legit.
---
Sort of, but the way perks are level locked it can take until 60-70 with an efficient build to really hve ll the right perks, not to mention gear.  RNG is pretty ridiculous when it comes to getting the gear that fits one's build.
---
Pretty much. I just wanted to see if it was as bad as people were describing (and it was)
---
Pc. It's something about hackers being able to access other people's inventory. My understanding is that hasn't yet been released in a form that's easily used by your average troll gamer.
---
"I'm hearing things". What are you, the president?
---
No evidence of this happening on console... I haven't seen any hacks or lost loot ever on PS4.
---
I hope I don't sound rude asking this but, do you have any screenshots/clips to use for proof? :/   
---
With the way FO76 is going atm, people (myself included) are getting spooked quite easily at the thought of this happening. But we're seeing little proof of it happening to players, other than the video that has been circling around the Reddit.   
---
If it's true, and people start to believe it's a hoax, it could end badly for a lot of players who just thought it was a hoax/troll. (I.E they could be mid trade, or go AFK for a few minutes and POOF all their stuff gone. Possible hours up on hours of grinding gone.)  But with the lack of proof people are seeing, it's just going to turn into "It's just a scare tactic, it's not real, it's just Bethesda being shitty"   
---
There's people who can't afford or just straight up don't want Fallout 1st, so they can't rely on a private world to keep their stuff safe. And I feel awful for anyone who feels the need to just abandon the game because they're fearing their loot will be snatched (if this is true) People should be allowed to play a game they enjoy, without fear.
---
Is that a serious question? Umm, maybe because one is a lot easier to kill than the other?
---
That must be very frustrating. How long has it been going on? Still no fix to stop it?
---
It is less about money and more about the algorithm. YouTube seems to promote videos with the mid roll more. With this video I tried to format it so you can literally see the hack in the first few minutes. The second half is just the extra info around it
---
Adding to what others said, a nice way to level up is to take lots of workshops and do the retake events. Lots of workshops in the forest with easy enemies. Once you get some damage perks for a decent weapon, clear out Berkely and Harper's ferry etc, sell all the weapons to the vendor bot, scrap any type you do use for the mods
---
Your a bad raider if you believe that
---
I'd be really interested in seeing that. If you have time could you reply with the link?
---
After about 70k in wrapping paper, I've gotten 1 plasma grenade.
---
It came from a small present from the Santatron.
---
Why are you guys still playing this hot garbage of a game.. until you guys stop playing and demand action only will these problems be fixed
---
Edit: you can downvote all you want it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I‚Äôm right :)
---
It's not a widespread problem... yet.
---
I didn‚Äôt even realise you could get them from there.
---
IT sounds like BS to me.  Though there are some dodgy pricks around.
---
Thank you. Does kinda seem like 2 different hacks are on display here though. As the one from juice required no trading(although this trading may have just been to show off that they had the items)
---
Wait they still haven‚Äôt done this? This was one of the reasons I stopped playing.
---
Yep :(
---
I imagine alot of the trolls and hard complainers left shortly after launch.  I just came back and I'm in love with the game.  The world feels huge and there is so much to do.  Adventure, grind mats, build/relocate your base, set up your shop, shop hop other vendors, nukes, ect.  This holiday event is icing on the cake.
---
I really don‚Äôt think you need to worry
---
Yes - the potus should make a statement then I will know it's cr\*p.
---
Lol. RNG and Bethesda Mystery. Who really knows exactly how it all works....
---
Watch Juicehead's new video.
---
i picked up several notes i like from all around appalachia and sell them voor 1K caps 
---
some are really nice, funny or sad
---
It's not clear that it has actually occurred in the wild yet.
---
Another thread said it might not be released til Christmas eve, but don't quote me on that.
---
I've been searching for an instigating hand made with 33% vats for a few days.  I stumble upon one for 300 caps.
---
I mostly stay in private worlds since the patch screwup.  Since BGS can't control hacking on the PC, it was only a matter of time before something like this happened. I'm going to strictly stay on private servers until they either get a grip on PC hacking or they can kiss public multiplayer goodbye.  No way I'm giving an asshat  my natural drop god rolls.
---
Lol master race... So glad I only do gaming on Xbox now for multi-player and only use pc for single player... This hacking crap is getting out of hand on pc multi-player games
---
Doesn't really read like the post of someone sincerely interested in coming back.
---
There's no fix to stop it because it actually hasn't happened yet. There's been one video showing it happen. There's been no evidence of it happening in public servers. Just because one person and their friend shoot a video doesn't mean it can be done in reality. I'm not saying it's impossible but it's also possible that him and his friend both installed some kind of script on each of their computers that allowed it to happen. Until I see video other than the one released by the terrorist I'm not going to worry about it.
---
I agreed to an extent but its more lile 50 to 56 unless yout a heavy gun build
---
Because I have over 11 strength while in PA without the buff of Motion Assist.
---
reminds me of the time i found a responders firefighter outfit for five caps lmao feelsgoodman
---
I'm just gonna play an alt in the mean time
---
But those items weren't bought with real money. They were bought with fantasy fun bucks that have no real value.
---
Q1, that‚Äôs still winter.
---
Assaultron keeps giving me warnings that I‚Äôm at risk  
---
That was when I last tested it.
---
I think you can forget free private servers.
---
I‚Äôm in the same situation üòÖ
---
Some definitely do. My first Bloodied build was exactly like this. It hit hard but died quicker. It‚Äôs what made me try to redesign a build dedicated to one purpose, mainlining knives. It wasn‚Äôt intentionally Bloodied. It just kinda happened. I applied every possible damage resistance I could and focused on the main melee boosts too. I threw out Bloody Mess and embraced Serendipity.
---
I could in theory move more perks and add them to Luck to add Bloody Mess but it would probably be over kill at this point. My BSSA Combat Knife out performs most SS DCGs with the exception of Furious, Junkies, Instigating, Bloodied, and Nocturnal given the right circumstances.
---
As it is I can survive entirely rad free and still kill everything with just a knife due to the immense amount of resistances I have along with basic perks like Blocker negating 45% of all melee attacks.
---
But you are right. Most people don‚Äôt build proper and focus only on damage. My character can mainline melee in nuke zones using hazmat suits and still sustain over 250 of each resistance. It‚Äôs really nice honestly.
---
I think we need more than one video as proof.
---
The method/tool hasn‚Äôt been published yet. The user on the forum seems to really test his shit before publishing anything so I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs just finalizing it. Gotta work that PR circuit before a big release.
---
This is a problem going WAAAAY back and BGS can't get this fixed?  Crashing  is way to common with this game.   BGS really needs to hire more people who can fix these things.
---
Weird, i have gone into the Ash Heap and around power plants and gone down that one burning mine with no issues.
---
Two of my characters haven't worn armor since the overseers camp because I got tired of the grind for fiber
---
I've been watching Jim since his Escapist days and this is exactly how I feel. During his E3 video he said he knows he's been ragging on Bethesda so much "its become a self parody" and will slow down about it, but in the same breath said Bethesda should stop being a developer and become only a publisher. Even his videos about Randy Pitchford, someone he has personal beef with, aren't as weirdly obsessed and irate as his Bethesda videos. I've just stopped watching them because the whole situation has been straight up off-putting, and I'm not even a Bethesda fan (just a Fallout one)
---
Whats the traveling leather coat do?
---
I feel like thats a bit harsh. Injectors and memory manipulators are a big issue in gaming, and as far as I know always will be.its a constant race to break the code before it gets changed, and developers almost always lose.
---
What do you want? A screenshot of what? I have no Pip-Boy, I can't even see my (empty) inventory. The only thing you would see is my naked body.
---
Ok. I just heard spring. Thanks for clarifying.
---
only because the script isn't accessible. the spawner for example required some "advanced" knowledge.
---
case in point: everyone and their mother were duping when it was as simple as "build artillery, load item, quit and reload".
---
It's the same thing. It's explained in the post, in bold, that trade was open for the purpose of demonstration.
---
You should be fine on consoles yeah
---
Imagine if every non-hacker stopped playing. It would just be the hackers taking each other‚Äôs loot back and forth. It‚Äôs like its own game within Fallout lol
---
I cannot argue with this one :)
---
Yes it was fixed a few patches ago. And it was never a huge problem to begin with, effected like 2 people and was under extreme  an very specific cercunstanses
---
What makes you say that?
---
The thing is too though, theyre not really after your god rolls, they just want to cause misery, this stealing hack follows on from the ability to create anything they wanted, so if they wanted a god roll, they would have just made it themselves, but clearly having anything they want wasnt enough, now they gotta take other peoples enjoyment too
---
Next to the dried up lake in the mountains there‚Äôs a lead mine next to an abandoned campsite that had a good view
---
Fasnacht masks also
---
I read one of the kids who hacked Xbox and PS4 a few years ago on Christmas got busted. The article said he rolled over on 2 of his hacker buddies and got hit with a $350k settlement and 3 months nun jail. The article said she cried like a little bitch in court. That made me feel better.
---
It's not a problem at all, it's a potential problem.
---
If it happens, then we deal with it, if it doesn't, there's no need to give hackers the advantage by reacting to their threats.
---
Ahhh, gotcha. Didnt actually read the post only watched the video where he brought it up.
---
Always unyielding. Bolstering sucks.
---
I've already found stuff looted and enemies dead in whole areas on a private server.
---
Just sort by hot, it should still be near the top.
---
u/Aten_Ra is the one who does the bug roundup and confirmed the hack. I think his comment is like third or fourth.
---
They are brought with bethesdas income source, just the same as if you went and stole items that are supposed to be acquired with tokens at a fairground, its still stealing
---
Not really, a guy can dream.
---
And that was last night the first time I've played in 3 days sorry should've said that
---
That'd be a fun youtube channel to watch, just seeing them get angrier and angrier
---
This is happening on Xbox as well. I reported several people yesterday for doing exactly this.
---
Should I aim for a full set of unyeliding BOS combat or a different armour type ? :)
---
Really?  
---
This hack isnt even *officially* out yet and thats on PC where it easy to do this shit
---
You're not trustworthy because you clearly have a grudge, and you exaggerate (like your 'gaem is dead' post from a few days ago). 
---
Your bias clouds your judgement. It doesn't matter to me if you're generally positive or negative, you're still a person with a heavy chip and you're passing on information from hackers, so yea I'm taking every single thing you write with a massive grain of sale. No offense intended, it's just being pragmatic.
---
You don't need aPip-Boy to screenshot on PC.
---
It is possible on console. Its happening.
---
Ona private server with 4 players we took 10 workshops and the server crashed lol. We were trying to spawn Ghram at one of them, he never showed...  imagine on a public server? This is a great way to consistently crash the serves most likely...
---
Whatever floats your boat really. I'd say first worry about getting better legendary effects, and only then the armor type.
---
Yea fuck those guys I hope Krampus strings them up as decorations by their entrails.
---
Equip via Atomic Shop.
---
Don‚Äôt wear excavator.  If you aren‚Äôt, then yay!  Otherwise, excavator just says you are overloaded with junk, likely not running a specialized build, so you‚Äôre ripe for the picking.
---
Its just a reskin of the regular, try placing your tent and it should be holiday, if not, maybe try and equip it in the atom shop?
---
There have been reports, here and on the Bethesda forums. Each one was either removed or the OP was attacked for reporting it. Just like the spawner.
---
The source code isn't out yet, which is why it isn't rampant. But the guy who made it gave people hints on how to do it in private, so it is being used by a very small group of people.
---
Right now, everyone's should be safe enough, but once that script goes public, there's going to be some serious issues.
---
edit: it's now out. Please Bethesda fix this ASAP.
---
Yep. Sadly there was a posting yesterday in the Fallout 76 official Club on Xbox saying that he's trading rare outfits and selling Dev room items and then when you join his game he steals everything from your stash and then makes a post saying he's going to sell the outfits and then just repeats the process.
---
Edit: he has several accounts as well I found them through the club and through his post history and various Clips he's taken all of the accounts have Lego Star Wars characters as the profile pictures so avoid those at all cost
---
Edit 2:  he was screwing over a pretty large amount of people cuz multiple people started making post saying that the dude is scamming and that he's stealing from their stash ect.
---
Lol downvote me all you want. At least I don't have the mental state of a 12yr old and deliberately try to destroy games cause my life is trash
---
Edit3: even if it's not this exact hack with this script, there is still an exploit on Xbox allowing people to steal items from your stash.
---
Nothing special. It‚Äôs a super rare outfit though. I‚Äôve been grinding for it for a long time.
---
I usally hit the bumblebees with my powerfist till they pop
---
The fucking match sizes say so.
---
Halloween and prior to, I never saw 30s-40s for player count.
---
Can't say that anymore.
---
I don't even bother trying to get a match in the morning anymore.
---
My friends list never had anyone playing NW anymore and I doubt you can give me one good reason as to why 27k XP to unlock everything is a smart decision other than to make people play a mode they may or may not like longer than they want.
---
1 person claiming to be able to do something on YouTube and there are tens of thousands of people playing the game on PC... I think you‚Äôre good.
---
It's supposedly being released to the public on December 24th or 25th, likely to hit the game while Bethesda is completely unable to respond to it.
---
You can go to trade menu on train station or with a friend to see your stuff and take a 3rd person screenshot missing a pip boy
---
hahahah. I remember when I got on the exact same situation. I got fully naked, then started to punch people with power armor. The system works!
---
I always have full 51 person matches...
---
You think only 30-40 people play? That seems to be what you are implying.
---
Anyway your assumption is wrong. Also saying most people hate the mode is an overreach. I don‚Äôt play often, but I enjoy the mode a lot. It‚Äôs just not something I will sink hours into on end.
---
Personally I wish rewards weren‚Äôt tied to xp but rather actual challenges (kill x number of people, win a match, etc)
---
I didn't even know you could build a camp in already existing building
---
There is a train bridge crossing a river in the harpers ferry area with derailed freight cars. if you stand just south east of HF it looks just like the accident. Uncanny. I think Bethesda caused this.
---
Guys I have a solution. Just leave this dumpster fire of a game. Or are your standards for gaming this low?
---
Follow the road east of the Charleston fire station and you will stumble acrossed one, small but nice
---
Jokes are great when they're great jokes, and bad when they're bad jokes.
---
On average, you can get around 400XP per match. That's with getting a top 10 placement &amp; killing 2 or 3 other players. "Bad" match I say you're looking at around 200 XP a match...give or take.
---
My favourite spot now is by pleasant valley train station. (Top of the world train station). On the main road there is a small pond just over the railing. I build there for all of my characters now. Very central, busy location, close to a vendor, water in camp, and close to top of the world for lots of enemies with weapons (for steel and other junk), and 3 level 3 locks to pick each day in the cabins nearby. 
---
If you dont like being on the main road, there are a couple more lakes just down the hill from there as well!
---
It‚Äôs like painting a neon sign on yourself.  You see T51 and a heavy weapon...
---
That did it!  Thank you!
---
I don‚Äôt really associate thematic rewards (like the glowing costume) with skills though, but time and dedication. I‚Äôve unlocked the Glowing Halloween costume by strictly hiding in bushes and I‚Äôm definitely not a skilled NW player. So when I see these rewards, I see someone who sat through the grind. A player could have also unlocked them as he freshly bought the game since they‚Äôre not tied to the overseer ranking.
---
Overseer rank levels, however, are more telling than the rewards.
---
Thanks I'll go check it out
---
Np!
---
I'd tell you but I like my spot. Can't have a bunch of people setting up in my swamp.
---
LMAO IT DOESN'T STOP
---
Thank you :) besides unyeliding, what are some good secondary and tertiary effects to aim for on the armour pieces ?
---
Has a few other houses near by so it can really feel like a lived in area.
---
Yea but cryptocurrency isnt tangible cash what's the difference?
---
Uh... are you dense? The point is that you wouldn't see anything but a naked guy. There's no inventory to see, don't you get it?
---
Consoles are good. Haven't noticed anything on PS4 and I play a lot. 
---
Someone said Xbox had hackers but I'm calling bs.
---
That's fair lol
---
Oh right, I could of sworn the plan I bought was called that. Oh well, my bad.
---
Can you recommend an area where I can get the helmet to scrap please?
---
I wonder how long it will be before a hacker manages to squirt ransomware onto our PC's via one of these scrips?
---
Thanks a bunch - just sent a friend request. Thanks again, I really appreciate it!
---
Until you're not. I have too much to lose. I can't risk.
---
Just but the private servers its only $12
---
I thought I did, but it seems I bought the weapon going by them comments here... I feel stupid now.
---
Only if you can run through it. I hated the companions in FO4. They got me killed so many times by getting in my way in a narrow space that I quit using them.
---
76 first program for the win
---
Did Bethesda said something about this somewhere? Did the acknowledge it?
---
There isn‚Äôt any real evidence of it being a problem though... just fear mongering at this point from people who seem to just want to make people stop playing.
---
I've had far more matches with 30-40 something players lately than Ive ever had.
---
That tells me the player base is dwindling. Also, I shouldn't be able to recognize the majority of players in the 51 lobby... Yet I do
---
Didn't know they had an end date listed for it. Thanks for the info!
---
I think there are far more good or neutral players than there are evil players. Keep playing.
---
I really hope you're right. Til then I'm staying in nuclear winter and privates.
---
That‚Äôs a shame
---
[Here you go](https://imgur.com/UhBBAbA), you seem to be having some trouble
---
Well there is an exploit on Xbox right now where people can steal items from your stash. It might not be this hack exactly but this is an issue on consoles right now I literally saw first-hand yesterday.
---
I don‚Äôt know about your experience, but my lobbies are never the same people. I‚Äôve even screen shotted to test
---
One day at work this guy had the most annoying sound on his phone when he received a text. I always thought a bobble head was nearby.
---
Because it's Bethesda's job to prevent this
---
Lol why.
---
Lol Bethesda and fallout76 is a joke
---
What helped me was the articule from Bethesda site. It has all the info how to claim it.
---
 [https://bethesda.net/en/article/4rLVr7UcZtam5TuwR1zQjF/fallout-76-gets-a-twitch-prime-holiday-bundle?\_ga=2.231305051.558525181.1576243014-1561328558.1575569693](https://bethesda.net/en/article/4rLVr7UcZtam5TuwR1zQjF/fallout-76-gets-a-twitch-prime-holiday-bundle?_ga=2.231305051.558525181.1576243014-1561328558.1575569693)
---
You only think it's bad because I made fun of fallout 76, a game I also play....
---
The Day Fallout Died is a video comparing the first death of the series to what we see now with Bethesda. Sorry if you don't agree.
---
I know Bethesda did mention something about that being a known issue with private worlds, that enemies spawn in dead
---
5 unyielding or 4 with one chameleon?
---
Woah, no need to be rude. If your Pip-Boy was stolen too, then it wouldn't show on the screenshot. Throwing insults isn't going to help. If anything, it's making it seem like you're trying to bait for attention.
---
Grats üëçüèª
---
Supposedly they already are.
---
&gt; They don't care about your items. They just want you to stop playing and make the game look bad.
---
This is true, if they wanted your items they would have just used the hack from the other week which allowed them to create and import any item they wanted in the game, this latest hack is designed specifically to grief the playerbase
---
use a bed to sleep increases xp points....make sure to use the transparent pip boy menu use melee at lower levels...pick up everything
---
No pic no proof
---
Also just a heads up looks like current bundle for twitch prime expires Jan 28th so unlikely we will get any more info anytime soon. Might be lined up with Wastelanders release so must be a good drop especially if this is to help generate attention to the game during its first huge update.
---
whoa, slow down there billy, I just want them to grow the fuck up, not gonna wish anyone harm over a game here
---
Dump everything in stash, try out a new build using common weapons?
---
Why 300 loading screens?
---
Not in the drop pool
---
Honestly it is probably due to the game servers. I can run more graphically demanding games at 60+ fps with my i5-8600k and GTX 2070 yet I can't average more than 40 FPS on fallout 76. Sometimes drops as low as 30 FPS
---
My money is on Bethesda releasing this hack scare to encourage people into buying into their private servers...
---
Slow clap for them on forced capitalism.
---
Whatever, troll.
---
Not in my intention to cover for or justify bethesda's lack of a proper anti-cheat program for their online game and im sorry if it seems that way
---
Im just trynna say i've seen people that are acting like hackers spawning in items/props (or removing items from a player's inventory) that werent intended to be in the game or intended for player use is a F76 only issue when it has happened before F76 and continues to this day, probably not on this scale yeah but its still there at times
---
I just relocated to the stone arch near Camp Venture. The views are unbelievable. No resources there, though.
---
Damn it.... I‚Äôm sure it was on the list of possible‚Äôs when the event started?!?
---
I'm jkn
---
A simple difference of opinion is one thing but how you express your opinion-- and project consequences-- is a different matter. A title like that screams clickbait hyperbole.
---
That some next level conspiracy shit, they'd make a lot more money by not having the bad press around this, because who would buy 1st after this, who wouldnt have otherwise brought it?
---
For the secondary it's set in stone: AP Regen &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; poison resist (you want at least 1, pref 2) &gt; rad res (nice, but not necessary) &gt; stats &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disease resist.
---
Tertiary are more of a preference. Most people like sentinel/cavalier, I think that those are vastly overrated. On mine I have 4x food/drink/chems weight reduce, and 1x weapon weight. You can pick any amount of weight reduction stuff as you see fit for your use, for instance if you carry like a dozen guns - go for weapon weight. Ammo and junk weight are less desirable in general. For me food/drink/chems is the most impactful one. Then there's better sneaking, but I don't sneak, so can't comment how good it is. All other remaining effects are not worth it.
---
Thats ok then
---
I had the same happen but i also had hackers remove all my guns and spawn a campfire in my torso, thus killing me till i reset my game's cache
---
Go on...
---
I have a spot just north of winter spring on a lead node.  Its up in the mountains off an old trail.  I searched google for a map of resources and then posted up when i found a spot i liked.
---
Don't feel stupid. The titles of plans sometimes are very vague as to what they craft.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w7FtkkDhw_I
---
We would see a naked toon -without- a pip boy. You can also see your inventory on a trade menu with vendor or player so there is that. It should show quest items but nothing else. You are avoiding the question here and by doing that you are making this troll post even more obvious than it already is.
---
No, I think it's bad because there's nothing clever, new, or true about it.
---
Bethesda publicly acknowledged working on this hack that only was only privately released over the weekend?
---
I guess the game is wild wild west now. Then again Todd lied from start so yeah enjoy Bethesda. Where is Pete Hines the VP?
---
To clarify, this is real.  Watch the video... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w7FtkkDhw_I
---
Wait a min of 5 min for a fresh world.  That seems to be the min time limit.  Test it by placing something useless in a train station suitcase. Leave and come back after 5.  Should be gone
---
A yao gui spawns off one of those lower lakes.  I had a camp there for a while.  Easy way to load up on meat and springs.
---
Chameleon is worthless in pve, and since there's like 7 people who still try to pvp left - not worth it imho.
---
Believe me or not, your choice.
---
Great spot with a lead deposit just north of Huntsville. I used to have my camp there before I moved to the bog. It's mostly flat with some trees. Only drawback is no water
---
I totally killed you yesterday. You were alone with a .50 cal and i was the sneaky bastard near the monogha power plant.
---
I could even steal the 50 cal 'cause of the  impending fire.
---
I think spring at the latest (hopefully)
---
My bad mr. Joke aficionado, sorry my joke wasnt high brow enough for you
---
Charge his controller
---
Victim or it didn't happen.
---
I don't play anymore. I quit after that 5 star legendary hacks. But I keep visiting reddit to see how this game is doing and jesus christ now people can steal your whole inventory and your pipboi on top of that? No thanks.
---
We‚Äôre on PC, he can click start but everything disappears and he‚Äôs stuck on the menu cinematic screen.
---
I'm going off what the dude said on the first video that was released. Not the juicehead one. He said he was contacted by bethesda and they are working on a fix. 
---
All hear say at this point though. There it evidence of it being said as far as I can tell. It would be nice though.
---
Same, Santa is ruining my business, no one buys legendaries anymore.
---
I want one single victim. So far this is a victim-less issue.
---
Creative. All I'm trying to do is get answers, and you revert to insults. Classy.
---
Y‚Äôall need a fo76PC sub...
---
People that are hooked. Some people love games so much that they "have" to play them. Maybe they are trying to get everything drop squeezed out of first. 
---
Maybe I was just memeing
---
Can you enter photo mode and take a shot of your pip-boy-free arm?  Or have someone take a picture of you?
---
Unyielding way over performs with a bloodied build. +3 to all stats is crazy. Tons of extra carry weight,  better vendor prices and the high agility and luck do wonders for using VATS.
---
That‚Äôs cheep, you on PC I might visit you see what you have. 
---
I scrip pretty much 99% of mine lol
---
Log out and back in and it will be gone...
---
I got killed by the crate a couple of times! Got knocked off a high cliff twice till i realised what was happening...
---
Nah, there should be a FO76consoles sub instead
---
I was just trying to get an upvote for a krampus reference this close to Christmas lol
---
Bethesda should have made an Online Fallout game from scratch instead of taking Fallout 4 and turning it into 76
---
Comprehensive... but still no victims.
---
I call B.S. until then. Maybe it's legit, but then, since there are no victims, maybe it's not.
---
True.
---
There are also a lot of follow me emotes which turn into a good hour of random team ups ridding the server of the scorchbeast threat
---
Looking at your posting history, it looks like you're a PS4 player and not PC.  From all of the information so far, this hack only impacts PC.  I smell some BS on this.
---
If you have camp budget, build up a bunch of purifiers and lock them all, purified water sells pretty good, to the robot vendors. Use Hard  Bargain Rank 3 and some grape mentats, if you have them as well.
---
It's supposedly has already been released to the public. There should be victims, Where are they?
---
I said they've been removed... Did you not read that? I'm not going to memorize everything.
---
Right now, the best evidence of it is the existing 2 videos which showed it in action. Not to mention the fact that the guy who already shared part of the source code is the same guy who shared the full source for the spawner.
---
I remember everyone claiming the spawner was fake. Then Bethesda announced they fixed it.
---
I remember everyone jumping on the hype about that faked 10 star legendary and how the people debunking it were attacked for doing so.
---
Once Bethesda fixes this one, it's going to be funny to see who all acknowledges they were wrong.
---
A hack happened recently, it took everything including he pipboy, it seems you were effected
---
Well I'm not saying you specifically, but it's just quite annoying going through 2 to 3 circles looking for the last person that's outnumbered, we honestly just want the game to be over and start the next one as quick as possible.
---
I personally believe FO4 was supposed to be their online fallout, then mid production they decided not to, there's a lot of things in FO4 that make no sense in a single player game (like trap doors for instance)
---
try spreading cheer instead of jeer
---
It is public now, says yesterdays reddit.
---
It's probably related to the lax (or non-existent) server-side validation that lets the hack work.
---
Oh, another fun fact to file away in the back of your brain: the server protocols for the PC, Xbox, and PS4 servers are all pretty much identical. If a way is found to bypass the Sony/Microsoft account verification portions of the server connection routine then you could get PC clients connecting to Xbox or PS4 servers. I was all in favor of someone finding a way to do that in the past. Not so much now.
---
Thats all i know lmao. I cant say its this exact hack, but there is an exploit on Console allowing people to steal items from your Stash
---
Yeah I get that but life ain't fair gotta go with the flow and if that's what you gotta do to get what you want then hell get it done
---
It's the same footage from ErectBan, just recycled for JuiceHead's youtube video.  &gt;_&lt;
---
A thousand videos is not a victim. There is a pattern developing. "But the video!"
---
"But no victims."
---
Even more smash
---
Oh yikes
---
It just got released earlier
---
Why doesn't anyone read the first sentence of the post? /sigh
---
It hasn't been released to the public yet. The source of the hack is sitting on it until December 24th or 25th.
---
Thanks.
---
Why on earth is this game so easy to hack compared to other games?
---
Same I try for it everyday
---
stuff priced at 0 caps still takes up stash space as well. Would be nice if I could just have  a blue suitcase type container for anyone who happens by...that also can't be locked.
---
Likewise for a "donations" container, like maybe a container that only the camp owner can pull stuff from as well? like if someone leaves something at your camp in it, no one but you can take it.
---
Juicehead claims it‚Äôs his own footage throughout the entire video. The footage provided in mantis‚Äô video is different than Juiceheads. So now at least two known players can do this.
---
Whatever you say.
---
I would love a lil ED-E follower.
---
Usually have this after doing the scorched vertibot quest at Morgantown airport. 
---
Always fun getting stuck in the monorail lift when trying to farm lead
---
You *do* realize this sub accounts for a very small percentage of actual players, right?
---
Covering a shit game and saying how its shit is toxic?
---
Because its built on a single player based engine that was jury rigged to be multiplayer, other games (and engines) are built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind
---
Have been sick for the last couple of weeks so I've been doing absolutely nothing but grinding this game out in time for wastelanders. Please dont tell me I just dumped hours upon hours of progress into this game for nothing üò™
---
Set up a ghost team member that can get the workshop transfer but on a timer.  That would solve the issue Bethesda.
---
No one is removing anything if they are on vacation, furthermore, no one is removing anything about it from reddit, or any other location. This statement only adds to the suspicions that this is B.S. 
---
Oh, 10 star was fake, the guy that did it posted his reasons and screen caps here a few days back.
---
 You're lying.
---
This is a fear campaign, not a hack.
---
Just FYI everyone has their own loot pool for enemy loot. No sharing involved. The only thing you really can share  are world spawns like junk.
---
yeah but if it was single player they coudlent try to take more of your money for un-reasonable amounts.
---
Sorry, never was.
---
Does it have +250 DR while reloading?
---
Are you volunteering? ü§£
---
No? Reddit posts get removed a lot. The mods here aren't Bethesda employees. Bethesda forums mods aren't on vacation either.
---
Also, the guy just released the source code. I really hope Bethesda is here and fixes it.
---
EDIT: Nice edits you did there to correct your statements after my response. Good job.
---
Yeah, the possibility is alarming, but before you panic I want to stress that both Microsoft and Sony are responsible for portions of the connection validation when it comes to consoles, and they've got a fair bit of experience keeping their connections secure (data, maybe not so much in Sony's case). I am not betting on a PC-to-console-server exploit being found anytime soon, if ever, and almost certainly not before this exploit is finally shut down.
---
You have answered way too many questions of mine for one sentence
---
I'm sure you'll enjoy your inventory being empty soon
---
I hate that bug so much. Almost as disturbing as super fast moving t pose scorched
---
When I do whitesprings golf club and they are all glitched lying down I don‚Äôt know whether to laugh or cry.
---
It doesn't affect consoles.  This is largely because of Cheat Engine, which allows you to scan a game's memory usage and inject things into it.
---
You have to come into contact with a hacker for them to steal your stuff
---
Sometimes I'll buy low level legendaries at a vendor for my alt character. Done it a few times. got a level 25 TSE Handmade that's been used on 2 different characters....paid like 900c for it.
---
I got the first 4 just fine, but now the real grind soon begins. Not looking forward to it.
---
One the biggest advantages I feel I have as a console player on many games is that there is minimal if not imo hacking. I have never really come across hackers on Xbox. I love playing some games on my pc, but some multiplayer games are just hacked to shit.
---
Found a vampire's explosive 90% rw fixer for 10k caps in a vendor yesterday. Already have been offered 150k 556 for it
---
Or just enable the Atomaton DLC. Or sell it, whatever.
---
5, got the first 5 just fine. My bad!
---
Ok cool, unsure why ingot downvoted for that?!?
---
It means the people spreading fear win
---
It‚Äôs just sad if you‚Äôd lie for ups on Reddit
---
Probably just general haters.
---
How dense can you be?
---
Or do you have something to gain from spreading this kind of clueless skepticism?
---
By not giving us the proof (which is very simple to get at this point) you are pissing in your own cerials. I can come and take the photo myself next time when you are online, all you have to do is connect to a server. I can even open a trade menu with you to see what you have in inventory. What is your ign?
---
Santa outfit is in the atomic shop already.
---
There were other Christmas items that haven't been in the shop (such as elf costume, stuffed reindeer, Blue snowflake suit). I'm just hoping, by some miracle that Bethesda gives us something good for free in the shop on Christmas. I appreciate the Santabot, but it's been the free item for 2 weeks, and I think it's crazy that at Christmas time, there's no event that gives a free Christmas tree or even a santa hat.
---
It is a lot like the ESO Crafting Bag, basically.  I personally though want a damned Account Bank/Stash, one that can be drawn upon for caps and transferring items.  Make it smaller, if you must, but it is such a quality of life perk that almost every other MMO out there has.
---

---
I didnt know I couldn't pick a lock in the converted munitions plant while it was claimed I got my first bounty so I'm all over the map no one seems to care so I say the heck with it and go about my business. Then I'm at my camp on top of Seneca and about to deposit my scrap when bam lol
---
Yes it does
---
Have to agree I‚Äôve stopped using turrets at workshops due to this. 
---
Apart from Hemlock Holes, damn the combination of the small area and many many anglers is brutal.
---
Armor displays first. Or we riot.
---
Surething, but let me ask something. .  If I lose everything you're gonna buy them back for me? :)
---
Also, unless they add new files to the game with an update. All new datamined Christmas items have already been released into the shop. So unlikely a new a bundle of items
---
Because they'd rather dripfeed it back to us so we can spend Atoms on them.
---
The fix for that got reverted, if you‚Äôre depending on a +33% hit chance effect then it will break every time you reload. Only way to work around it is to crouch whenever reloading.
---
Fix is hopefully coming early 2020. Possibly with wastelanders.
---
It's spelled 'cereals'. 
---
Also, like I said, I didn't come here to provide proof - quite the contrary, I wanted to get information myself, ans I did. And second, there's really nothing to see. 
---
Sorry if you don't believe me. /shrug
---
Sorry, I meant I have not seen anyone actually using it wearing the Santa outfit and Santa backpack skin.  It supposedly leaves the store soon and that had me wondering if they were going to add other Christmas skins or items.  
---
Thanks for the info re: the elf outfit and snowflake suite.  Let's hope they're added.
---
Well, at least you know it might not be a push-over.  
---
I don‚Äôt like raiders, but I appreciate the ones that are.  
---
Most are really just ass-hats trying to make the game miserable for others.  
---
Then some are raiders.  PvP players role-playing their part.  
---
Ended up talking to one for half an hour when he came to kill me.  I was doing a workshop when he showed up and I just hit the mic and told him I‚Äôd already stashed and was logging out.  No interest in fighting.  He was welcome to the place.  Instead we just ended up talking.  
---
Good dude.
---
B.S. They were just saying yesterday it was released.
---
Fear mongers. There is no hack.
---
No hacker is gonna sit on his new toy , announce it to the world, and let the software company fix it before it gets used.
---
No one works for free. Hacking is work This is B.S fear mongering.
---
Is there still no official response from Bethesda on this?
---
The scrap box should never of been behind a pay wall like fallout 1st. Should of been a atomic shop purchase
---
Might go for the snowflake armour but, I'd be done after that, I think, not worth it when the XP doesn't stack, like it did for the Halloween event. Got the wrapping paper for the hunting rifle and it was rather...plain. The Charlie Brown Christmas tree, gifts from Zax and wreath are probably the only worthy items to "grind" for.
---
I‚Äôm lvl 224 and I don‚Äôt know the value of anything as I really don‚Äôt trade much. I just sell for what is valuable enough to me and for things to move quickly.
---
thanks for the headsup , i was going to login after not playing for about 2 months
---
Not yet, it is sunday just before xmas though, so im guessing all the top dogs are out of office
---
Link to the one you said wasn't removed but was attacked.
---
Or you lie.
---
5 times in an hour today. Fix your shit Bethesda. This isn't an issue on my end, as my teammate on the same internet doesn't get disconnected.
---
Edit: 6 times. Was on less than 10 seconds that time.
---
Did you really go back almost two months to comment about something that wasn‚Äôt even a thing at the time of discussion?
---
if your IQ is more than 90 you will not have fun with this SHIT! :)
---
I suppose it is, if one actually cared about them.
---
The fact that you are focusing on my spelling instead of providing the easiest screenshot to prove yourself makes you a troll. Reported for violating forum rules.
---
Lizard squad guys did this a few years ago with Xbox and PS4 on Christmas day.
---
I read earlier that one of the kids got busted and was facing 10 years so he snitches on 2 of his hacker buddies. The article said he got hit with $350,000 in settlement and a 3 month prison sentence. Said he cried like a baby in court..... LOL.
---
What difference does it make
---
they are empty.
---
Wow, didnt think it was that serious
---
did you get the emote? that's the real raid challenge
---
Because I still own the game.  Duh.
---
Under normal circumstances for sure, but this appears to be pretty game-breaking. Coupled with a seasonal event, it seems like it should warrant some attention - even from the B or C team.
---
I wouldn't mind those people dying in real life and ridding the world of trash.
---
to be fair they post in r/yiffinhell , so it's fair to say they don't have much of a life.
---
I don't like fo76, infact I hate it, but you're probably right and I'm not sure why you're being downvoted. People don't like it when people fight back against assholes, I guess?
---
I'm not sure private servers would be a fool-proof plan. Someone using that exploit could socially engineer their way onto private servers and use it there too.
---
I don't play the game right now, but I'm fairly certain that it was an option in the weapon mod menu, back in the beta. Did they remove it?
---
I didn't say that. But since you've now edited comments to fix issues after I've corrected you, maybe I should start quoting your comments directly?
---
The guy released his source code now so we need to focus on getting Bethesda to respond before it becomes a serious problem.
---
This mentality of attacking players who are concerned about legitimate threats only helps the people exploiting the game.
---
Yeah. These kids don't think they'll get in any trouble. Little do they realize that Bethesda can estimate how much revenue they lost due to the hacking.
---
No wonder the kid cried like a baby.....3 months in low security prison is easy but he'll be in debt for the rest of his life paying off $350,000.
---
I gotta say that's a good way to do it. I'll give the videos another try.
---
Or better yet, refund fo1 to everyone who bought it and make all that shit free
---
Yeah I also play like a little bitch when I feel things are unfair. Why try, when you can act like a baby instead?
---
Fallout 76 has. hadsome faults and a few bigones.
---
But all and all I,ve enjoyed it.
---
Makes me wonder if the people.
---
with the major hateon for this game are being paid or doing this shit to bring people to their you tube channels
---
This guy gets it.
---
Also, Juicehead will post anything that gives him views.
---
He's not a reliable source, like, at all.
---
I've been online all evening, having roughly 60 weapons up for grabs and been visited by the usual 50-100 guys.
---
So far noone had nicked anything off my lvl 1 mule (aptly named, TotallyNotAMule).
---
*shrug*
---
Well it is 100% bethesda's fault at the end of the day at the end of the day.
---
The risk versus reward is waaaaay inbalanced, though. I might be given a few stimpaks, but I risk losing legacy weapons to hackers. I‚Äôm staying away from FO76 until this is addressed. Even private servers, out of principal. This needs fixing
---
Make it so you can pay for fallout 1st with atoms
---
Whatever you say. Now get out of my post, troll.
---
Yes. It relies on the injection of a script into the game itself, which means the amount of work needed to do so on a console would be too much for most. (It would need serious hardware modification that would result in a ban form Sony/Microsoft)
---
Consoles are safe from this one.
---
It's not being a baby but it takes so long to load in    and all that bollocks if we don't bush wookie it ends up being not worth the time
---
Thats the same thing. 10$ atoms is about the same
---
He announced it and said he wasn't releasing it right away. If Bethesda doesn't have access to it to see how it works, it's hard to patch it.
---
U should always drop them in a container more reliable. Bags that quests drop don't always stick around i believe there is a time limit on them. Always use a container.
---
Haha....yep I remember you. I hardly ever take that route, chance just lead me in that direction. Fair kill, well done!
---
What a relief. Hope everyone else's inventory is safe and secure üôèüèªüôèüèª
---
There's a principle in programming where you should *never* trust the client for anything sensitive, that all goes to the server to get processed.  Bethesda completely failed to adhere to that principle.  It's just as much their fault that the exploit exists in the first place as it is the hackers who are abusing it.
---
I know now
---
You don't use campfires anymore. The rules were spelled out in an old patch note. It's hard to explain to someone verbally. I'd recommend going through previous patch notes and looking for any mentions of the word "foundation"
---
I agree it has made life in the wasteland so much better.
---
When u transfer never drop it in a bag. Always put it in a container(like a suitcase at whitesprings station). That way it always stays as long as ur game doesn't crash.
---
Well, maybe if the game had decent anti cheat it wouldn't be such a problem.
---
How am I a troll? You can block me if you like but I am saying the obvious: unless you show the proof, you are just another kid adding fuel to the flames
---
Cryptocurrency still has value AND is considered property, even if it isn't material property. Stealing it is still theft.
---
Ouch.
---
Yeah its pretty anoying trying to play nw and getting 2 minutes into a match only to get dc and no xp
---
Holy jeebs, that's harsh.
---
Oh okay thanks.
---
Its just a game buddy, dont go wishing harm on people for a game
---
For the last hour ive been disconnect about 3 times. Ive gotten the "server not responding" about a dozen times too.
---
Whatever, troll. üëã
---
I guess it could be instant karma for me being greedy on 10 caps, lol. But yea, I didn‚Äôt stand a chance.
---
Yeah but then theyd have to get into each and every private server to get to someones loot
---
My spot is right next to lucky hole mine, off to the left is a small pond nestled next to a cliffside. I place my tent by whitesprings, use the vault, my tent and camp to help cut travel costs. So far i have only been attacked my glowing moles which is nice for glowing meat.
---
Except I have over 10,000 atoms and didn‚Äôt pay for any of them......
---
Have a good one
---
How much you like to whine and take take any chance to say ‚Äú**See?! I was right!!**‚Äù even though these are two separate topics?
---
Yeah I just sorta gave up and decided to continue on my play through of Fallout: New Vegas. Never completed the game before so hopefully by the time I‚Äôm done or tired of playing the servers won‚Äôt be disconnecting me anymore.
---
I don't engage in PvP but I thought the answer to his question was fairly obvious. (I actually play most of my time on my private server because people suck)
---
Holy crap nuggets
---
The atom shop is where bethesda gets their money from this game, private servers will eventually allow for mod support, mod support will kill the atom shop, so paying for servers is a must for bethesda if they are to make money from this game
---
Mods should be in the scrap box. Otehrwise it is imposible to save mods for potential future use. Too heavy and random...
---
But your a raider
---
I'm on a PS4 private server, not been disconnected yet but it's been laggy for a couple hours.
---
I understood she only gave light and sturdy of any armor type. Did you get some heavy CA from her?
---
You are lying. 
---
Link please.
---
Im just powerin through it. I just moved my CAMP, and dammit im gonna finish it. It was working like a dream last night when i was on NW.
---
the so called bugthestards
---
Why not give them to your friend to hold instead ?
---
Did you try hitting the transfer button on the corpse? Sometimes they look empty but going into the transfer menu will make the loot show up
---
If you're on PS4 I came make you one. Along with the all other similar helmets.
---
maybe they are not familiar with the words 'Bug Roundup' themselves? Like every layman, maybe...? Just saying.
---
I got to 5,000 at one point. Just decided to buy some of the skins because no reason to continue to save them.
---
They have been doing this scam for a while.
---
Thats what I call karma. Ruining millions of people's Christmas for fun is just being absolute human garbage. Knowing that he cried makes it better. I feel kinda sadistic after what I just wrote, but these assholes hackers must know what can be the consequences of such a dick moove.
---
&gt; And seriously, why on christmas?
---
"Why would malicious, selfish people who seek out ways to harm other people who have never done them any wrong choose to do this SPECIFIC malicious, selfish thing to harm people who have never done them any wrong?"
---
In my experience, getting the heavy variant is normal, but maybe it depends on the player's level, or some other factor like knowing the plans?
---
Good setup. Careful though that looks like a lot of materials being used.
---
Well good luck with you endeavor.
---
I am not a bloodied build and prefer vanguard cavalier.  It helps when im running to power attack an enemy. If i was bloodied i would say bolstering since it is for full health. 
---
U can really solve ur dilemma by just wearing PA all the time then u dont ever have to worry about buying expensive pieces of armor. I run PA when fighting the queen.
---
No, asking before I pay her a visit...
---
Link to the source code? No. I will not spread a hack like that.
---
If you figure out where the last one was, this new one is in the same place, by the same guy.
---
I was downvoted for reporting the spawner. I was downvoted for trying to debunk the 10 star legendary. I can't wait to see the (lack of) acknowledgement when Bethesda fixes this one too.
---
I remember this, the guy cost Sony millions in lost revenue.
---
Is there any actual proof this hack is live outside of the fact that a youtuber recycled yesterdays thread into their latest video?
---
love me some BUGthesda drama!
---
get triggered bugthestards :)
---
First thing I do at hemlock holes is get rid of all the vehicles so there are less things for the bad guys to hide behind. Then I stand on that roof above the workbench. If you build a small stone wall on either side where things can walk up onto that roof the only things that can get to you are things with guns or things that can burrow. (Radscorpions will go underground and then miraculously pop up through a roof) it also gives you a pretty Clear view of every entrance into the area. Let's take a look at that point Santatron works as a pretty good decoy for luring enemies out.
---
I‚Äôve read about it lots of times, but it was my first time experiencing it first hand. I never went after bounties seeing as how I‚Äôm not a pvp build. Can hold my own on anything else no problem, but bring another person to the mix? No thanks.
---
"Look, this guy didn't even put any bars on his windows. He's LETTING me break into his home and steal his stuff. Plainly, he's the villain in this story, not me."
---
Yeah definitely. Someone made a post about it before with a link if you just search it
---
Fuck Bethesda more
---
How u get them. Just grind dalies and weekly?
---
I didn't know this. I'll try it next time. Thanks for the heads up.
---
I mean, if you watch the video hes with one of the hackers who uses it to steal his inventory
---
Thanks, im gonna need it!
---
I heard that they can loot your pipboy too, I have no proof thats just what I heard.
---
I wore it for a couple of days had some fun but went back to my usual outfit. On both of my characters. I spend most of my caps on rare outfits, I mostly wanted the beard.
---
You definitely do get Heavy pieces from her.. I can‚Äôt say if they are more rare than light or sturdy.. but they do drop!
---
Well, no.
---
Everybody whines about Bethesda keeping the same "engine".
---
Which was originally built for a multiplayer game.
---
I'm not sure if power armour would work for my stealth build though , but thank you :)
---
If you had an IQ past 100 you'd see how buying games that are buggy messes is detrimental to the industry.
---
I don't think so, only the player. I tried it with heavy weapons and scrap to no avail.
---
I agree. There is a difference, surely, between wanting to attack Bethesda and stealing from other players? I don't understand at all their reasoning behind it. They aren't having fun so they have to spoil other peoples? 
---
To hell with them. Apparently they can only access your own player inventory and not your Stash, so I'm going to carry some shit on me of less value. If I see one and catch them doing it I am absolutely screenshotting them and handing it to support. Fuck them.
---
It would sell, junkies is popular right now.
---
True enough. Just enough to cause some concerns for people. I even thought it might have been a hoax for a while, but IIRC it was actually addressed in an ITV.
---
It does not, none of your perks reduce the weight of things in your stash.
---
U can add a stealth thing to torso of x01 but yeah thats it tho. I believe wood armor is the best for sneak and get a fixer
---
All console players sitting back eating popcorn and watching the soap opera that is fallout 76 on pc unfold. Can‚Äôt miss television in action
---
No.  Perks only affect you, not your stash.
---
The real question is, did either juicehead or erectban report this issue to Bethesda?
---
Did you miss the part where I said I don't engage in PvP and play on a private server? I'm not a raider, I'm Raider Nation.
---
You're fucking delusional. It's entirely Bethesda's fault for shoddy programming and trash anti-cheat. If this was ANY other developer it would be entirely inexcusable.
---
