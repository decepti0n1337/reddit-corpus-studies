what do you get from meat week? except bullion
---
---
---
Calibrated shocks will help if you can get it modified.
---
Its just thing of a bad design or poorly done mechanics since ppl participating in events wont get loot from legendaries automaticly. Dont blame ppl for this they just do what they suppose (kill enemies)... Show me one game where people wait to kill something and ensuring everybody just got some hit. Maybe few years and we get there...
---
Keeping the bar from deteriorating is contributing. 
---

---
You like playing the semantics game, don't you. 
---
So great for you. I'm gonna go ahead and block you now as you're crazy annoying and basically brain dead.
---
Hahah can’t argue
---
Okay, you get to use it twice a day or unlimited with 1st?
---
Those look fantastic!
---
it's all meat week. The whole thing. It's called meat week. All the events are part of meat week.
---
Yes. I also believe that it’s always good to have people on those no matter what.
---
You like onision... that explains a lot
---
Probably yes. The whole game is a massive bug and glitch. It’s not our fault that they can’t fix their game. As mentioned above there was a score glitch related to the ammo factory that they patched right after it went public. If they wanted to fix this, they would’ve done it already
---
You're not using unyielding, I presume?
---
I’ll give you that. This is the first one since Wastlanders launched. ***sigh***. Guess I’ll take my meds and chill.
---
You know just as well as I do that they’re not gonna do anything with this idea.
---
The year is 2457, an ounce of prevention’s patch is still said to be coming soon
---
Thanks for the idea.
---
Hate to break it to you but that sub was actually taken over by people who can't stand Onision, myself included.
---
To be perfectly honest with you, I don’t understand *why* it works, all I know is that it does. Why can’t I blueprint the fusion core generator? Why can’t I blueprint the food processor?
---
Where do I go to turn in all the stuff tho. Does he have a set spawn?
---
No.
---
Ty man I was trying to find where tf he was lmao. Good stuff brotha
---
Buy it bulk from vendors. Or scrounge around military outposts and nuke silos.
---
Thanks!
---
Wow, that’s crazy! 10000 XP in 26 minutes?!? I’ve been just stacking for max XP and then going to fissure sites to kill a bunch of high level enemies. For 100 score I’d probably need closer to 45 min/1 hour!
---
Rare plans, outfits
---
I guess almighty Todd was right when he said „it just works“
---
No prob my man!
---
It’s also a little confusing because he doesn’t have a map icon unless the event is active.
---
Theres something about old feet he almost shouts at me every time I'm at home in toxic valley.
---
Yea lol . Btw. Are the primal cuts an actual item? Do they spoil?
---
Also, why did I type "of about"? It's not brain damage, cause I've had numerous scans...
---
Wait... why did you spend 4000 caps???
---
Also starch them genes
---
“It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!”
---
Uh, Todd? You do realise it can be turned on it’s head to benefit the player, right?
---
“FIX IT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE I FUCKING SHOOT YOU!”
---
Or evil
---
But if you don't run after them sometimes the prime mobs don't come to you. You run after them, you complete the waves faster. 
---
This is my first meat week and I've already learned that.
---
Yes sadly they spoil. 
---
But when turned in you gain legendary scrip. 
---
You do that at the big fire pit in the “middle”
---
Or both.
---
Maybe. Some defintitly notice the problem and won't wipe out the enemies right away. Most camp the spawn location and not actually help with the event.
---
If your on xbox i can mod your PA with shocks for free. Adds 100 carry weight. You just have to bring the mats and your PA.
---
You say that like it's a bad thing
---
It makes sense in MMOs. And it's better than grinding X amount of levels to redistribute Y SPECIAL points and pick Z amount of perks, if I hadn't already had or saved them.
---
Twice I've saved up to play with my build and it's taken ages.
---
Oh nooo. You look like you block people that disagree with you. I'm glad to be on that list. Back to the echo chamber with you. 
---
And No it is not contributing. If I don't need anything from you and get the job done, you can't stand there afterwards with your finger in your ass and say you helped. It's AFKing that equals rewards for not actually playing.

Fast travelling was a nightmare today. My game also kept freezing during fast travelling. Had to keep restarting.
---
Well, when the prick is walking around near Fissure Site Prime or Vault 79, even in my camp once, and I expect him to be in Foundation then yeah, it can be pretty difficult to find him without a quest marker. I don’t like the ones that point you right on top of the thing, I prefer the area markers that tell you roughly where it is but not exactly.
---
Damn my man. Good job. I would definitely use them if they looked like this instead!
---
I noticed this too. 
---
But for me the mining helmets with lights on didn’t change color. But all regular suddenly became yellow in my stash
---

---
I've done a massive respec thrice (below I said twice, I forgot about my initial one). It takes a long time and was rewarding the first time. The second and third times I drained from the grind. I look at games which implemented it simply, like Borlderands 2 or Elder Scrolls Online, and feel there is a real benefit in saving that time and energy.
---
It is so funny how people complain about the AFKers but they are actually helping and not hurting anything on this one.
---
As a console player I would gladly take token Camp Items
---
I might make a junkie build, just to do that.
---
You might get a team who has prepped a silo and has people outside to engage you in PVP via workshop, banking on the fact that your focus on PVP will prevent you from checking the map when they nuke your CAMP.  At least, this has happened to me once.
---
But that's the exception, not the rule.  If you PVP, check your map when a nuke launch alerts!
---
This displeases Chally The Moo-Moo
---
Drums and spits first. Everything else once those 6 spots are full.
---
The free range event only drop one star crap anyways, unless they buffed the drop in recent patch?
---
All one star assassins for me!
---
I feel this should be direct at the NPC you have living at your camp rather than me.
---
Definitely. If it starts after the :52 mark, skip it just to be safe.
---
Keep rejoining servers, it'll work eventually if not a single person has completed the quest stage since the server started. I got lucky on my alt a few days ago.  
---
I know this is a band aid solution and not an answer to your question but at least you'll be able to progress. Forget about the snake oil solutions, this and that first, it doesn't matter.
---
if next season is like this season, im not doing it.

You talking about random

Junk just spawning in a pile when you FT somewhere? That happens almost every time for me at least.

Dont want ot sell them incase I get called an exploiter &gt;\_&gt;

Fallout is mostly wholesome. When I don’t want pvp they call me a foodbuild and then I pull out my gamma then they leave without giving me chance to kill them. Most people in the community are cool and nice people.

Oh my god they listened, a fall asleep emote for us to use during SBQ fights!

Grahms trading post: coming soon, to an appalachia near you.
---
I'm pretty sure the intention is that Honeybeasts are just freakishly mutated drones adapted to carrying around their hive, the honeybeast "queen" would just be a normal sized bee somewhere on it's back.
---
i finished 2 days ago, and now Im taking a break from 76. really hope the next season isnt like this one.
---
Love it!  Look forward to adding that to my long coat!
---
Why have you done it so many times though?
---
So who’s to say the Queen can’t be mutated in the same way the drones were and start a colony?
---
Seriously the incompetence here is crazy! They said they had a fix coming pn the 18th but it didnt quite work again ?!? Like this is ridiculous now....the thing that annoys me the most is that bethesda wont even make it upto to any of us! No sorry, no compensation or free in game stuff just carry on like nothing happened to a MAIN quest line
---
Well, at least it’s scrip for the 50% off week
---
I swear to Mothman, if they so much as look at our pal Grahm funny there will be a reckoning.
---
Alright, I have been hearing that the issue is other people doing the quest so I guess this could work, it may take a few tries but when the sample goes through it’ll be worth it
---
Also when does a sever start? Is it like they get replaced every now and then?
---
If it seems too good or just too odd to be a feature it's obviously a bug.  Don't promote people exploiting this shit, submit a report to betehsda.
---
Listen to Graham at the beginning and during the event, he’ll let you know what to do.
---
Maybe. I'm not really sure. It just happened to me a few times at different events over last couple of days. Got kind of annoyed and was trying to see if this bothered others as well.  Most of time I really enjoy this game. It has definitely been my grind during this Covid crap. Not really blaming anyone. Like another person said poor design.
---
you have to do several things. when you fast travel to it it tells you
---
and you donate the prime meat there
---
I am not grinding the hell out of another event for another goddamn backpack skin.  Disappointing or not, I don't care.  Why the hell do  I need another backpack skin?  I don't.
---
All that stuff is valid. Here’s a post with a link to rewards and mechanics in the bottom.
---
It's exactly the same as last time.
---
For once I wasn’t mad lol. This one dude I was on a team with had three alternate accounts afk on the drums til they died of starvation. Once the event actually started the bar was already 3/4 full.
---
Well way to grind your axe
---
I just bought the owl mask for a new character from someone for 200. Seemed fair. They also had the bonfire for a few thousand but I ignored that. Ill wait till next year...
---
Every hour, on the hour there is a main event called Meat Cook. This is the one you want to do to get the event rewards. The other events are ones you can do to earn Prime Meat. This meat is special that you can turn in at the main Meat Cook for extra legendary scrip and rewards
---
Classic bethesda.
---
Surprisingly, that emote has been in the files since Wild Appalachia as far as I'm aware. In fact, most of these emotes have been around since launch. No idea why some of these aren't used though.
---
Yea when dick happens it’s surely annoying. I haven’t done events such as free range and uranium fever since long time ago, because the drop is guaranteed to be useless and not a big horde to gain xp.
---
Speed demon, healing factor, marsupial
---
Not nned to worry, I only steal from Fallout 1st owners anyway.
---
All one star suppressors for me lol.
---
That’s the same as my luck from the scorchbeast queen, you’re doing absolutely fine.
---
Actually I get exclusively nocturnal legendaries from the queen.
---
You'd think people would be accustom to that. When I have school work to do (college) I set up my vendors with any new items ive got to sell and then afk playing music at my camp. Only have to tab in stand up, and go back to playing tunes and letting the caps and collectron scrap trickle in.
---
Ofcourse, but it doesn't mean one isn't allowed to joke about the levels of greed and ineptitude BGS tends to show however. :)
---
Take over workshops. It’ll eventually drop.
---
whenever i try to get back into 76 i play for about three hours, run into a slew of bugs/glitches or other inexcusable nonsense and i walk away in disgust for another month or so. i put a lot of time into this game during the first year or so, but i really don't know how much "fun" i had while playing it. when i have 100+ games installed on my ps4 i really don't have time for something that barely works and often frustrates more than rewards.
---
You'll need those levels if you want to even consider sniffing legendary perks.
---
Even then, entering power armor still takes away the carry weight benefits of being outside of it. Any normal armor piece you have that gives strength, or lowers the weight of other items, goes away. Backpacks are also unequiped in PA. I have a compete set of excavator with calibrated shocks on both legs, and even then my carry weight is better outside than in it.
---
I will always revive you even if you don't revive me.
---
Yeah they mentioned in the recent patch notes that they fixed an issue where a tent's no build space was remaining in-world after the tent had left. So if that was happening that was likely responsible for a lot of this stuff, and if they said they fixed it there's a 50/50 chance it's still a problem.
---
I like the tents, but I wish they'd just move my tent if someone's camp was incoming. Maybe there's an issue with moving a tent while someone is using the bed inside of it or cooking or something.
---
They don't have a larger no build zone than a camp though. I've messed around with that a lot and it's a pretty small no build zone, about the size of a camp's actual build area.
---
Well, if they do implement this idea, we’re gonna have a short but sweet dupe wave in which I can recover my pre wipe inventory.
---
I revive when I see someone down. Not anymore.
---
Never
---
At the queen most people are looking up. Ive been mobbed a ton of times looking for some help just on shooting enemies and i get none. I try to revive people if i see them though i had a similiar issue as you i got downed after the fight and a few people passed and 1 guy was standing there waiting to loot my corpse, luckily a nice person revived me.
---
Will it still work if you are already doing one of them when it starts or do you need to wait until it has started? I'm managing 2 characters at the same time, so I obviously can't actually control both at the same time.
---
That's fucking dope!
---
Once again, the dupers could dupe easier with this stuff. They use mule accounts for that, and would speed it up for them without mules.
---
The Queen died. She died like 20 seconds before I went down from the swarm of enemies.
---
I missed the first time round, though most failures have been either not enough players attending for meat week, or enemies spawning underground in primal cuts!
---
Then why does it matter to you who kills the creatures. The creatures don’t drop prime meat. Just let people kill stuff and collect what you want out of the event at the end.
---
The big issue with the failing events is that the mobs spawn way out and don’t path to the meat in the cage. You gotta go hunt those targets down to complete the event.
---
Hmm sadly I wouldn’t know. 
---
I always wait for the timer to go down. I’ve learned with Bethesda that you have to be patient not to bug the engine lol.
---
The event exhibits the same behavior without a tent nearby. Some burrowing mobs never come to the surface, some mobs just never spawn. Some spawn 100+ meters away from the post. 
---
The event is a buggy mess, the tents are a red herring, this is just a witch hunt.
---
Well, I don't really know when a new server instance gets launched, but speaking from experience: when all the others are full or overloaded or there are none running in your region. Shuts down if there are no users and a timeout expires.  
---
At least that's how I do service scaling and it worked great so far.
---
I thought this recently but realised it was because they had skins on them and was looking at my stash through the vendor.
---
I always look for a server where I see a lot of public teams and see how many people attends to primal cut events. That’s usually a good indicator that the event will be full as well
---
I did not think you could die of starvation...
---
I didn't put any skins on them
---
Dude I’ve actually been getting so mad about this lately. Like it’s that hard to walk up to someone &amp; press a button to revive me... I’m spamming help for THIRTY SECONDS... not one of the 20 people around can walk up &amp; press A.... but they’ll all sprint for my junk bag!
---
Gotcha. They always seemed to have a larger area but maybe that’s because they are so small and the circle around them is so big lol. Deception haha.
---
Yes you will be perma banned might as well just quit now
---
/s
---
Primal cuts seems to bug out when people use their 1st tents, it's solo able if no tent is around, if a tent is around you need 2 or 3 people and to split up to reach the wider spread spawn points!
---
Don’t get discouraged. Super rare drop rate of 0.15%
---
Was just saying incase you could relate. No idea then.
---
Yup all one stars. Thought it was supposed to be like Fasnacht? Either BGS messed up again or we’re misinformed 😂
---
How long can you afk kn drums before it kicks you for inactivity?never knew you could stay on instruments forever
---
Especially higher levels bro. It's just so irritating. I put a good amount of damage on the queen. I just don't fucking get it, with stimpacks being abundant in this game.
---
I have an entire set in my stash...no idea why
---
Right there with ya, never spawned  the final wave multiple times
---
Is this why they are every 15min? Lol
---
I hope you didnt make too much of a mess
---
Oh yeah people should stop placing the tents too near the event. Seems like that’s what causing the problem in many cases. 
---
But also it seems to happen anyway. I’m no sure. I haven’t failed one yet..
---
I've heard rumors of the vendor steal shit coming back but no solid proof so Im.just confused at this point
---
I honestly dont even care about dying my thing is people will sit here &amp; let me die but once my junk bag is down they’ll drop everything to sprint &amp; take what they need. Sometimes I’ll die right as the event ends so instead of my junk staying with me it drops so unlucky😂
---
Spread far away is manageable, but sometimes the new spawn point is underground, at least it was for the savage divide primal cuts.
---
If it makes u feel any better, i got a 2* bloodied ffr handmade from primal cuts and DCd 2 mins later. Log back in and it wasnt in my inventory.
---
Not that I do this, but there are decent junk drops at some of these events and if you get overburdened you drop your tent, then leave it there until next event and it's just a convenient loot drop at that point
---
I thought the issue with the scrip limit was the machine. Is there an issue with total scrip in inventory? I always spend mine aroujd the 700 or so mark.
---
I guess so😂 Mine spawned the final wave but then we killed everything &amp; it still said finish the final wave or whatever. I ran around so confused😂
---
Welp, I knew the risks when I bought the game, if your fix works as well as you say it does I should be set, thanks a million
---
That’s every players nightmare scenario
---
Hardest for me has been the ressurect a player in NW, nobody talks so I can't coordinate it!
---
There's a few in the training buildings aswell. 2 on the floor in the building which you fight the robots at during the training.
---
Yeaaah that doesn’t sound too good...
---
It might only be a matter of time before it happens to myself I guess lol.
---
Between 3 seconds when they auto complete to 24 hours if they dont.
---
Cap is 1k
---
What aboit the 100 years' war?
---
I've had issues with the auto-completing outside of the reset time. 
---
It's also pretty shitty to be telling someone, with no control over the issues, as was stated when he/she said they have tried all the "fixes".
---
Why are you blaming the consumer for a faulty product? The only way to get something like this fixed is to make noise about it and make a constant nuisance so that someone sees it. The double wall fix was a good example of this, as if it weren't for the spam posting they would have left it.
---
Why do I love this game so much?????
---
Nope
---
It has been data mined that misc brotherhood solders will comment negatively if the player is mutated but I dont think they full out hate mutations yet. A little too early in their timeline.
---
Yes you’re right It can be, unless he skipped the settler quest line. I did the same thing on my main character. Just went straight through the raider quests and never did the settlers. Once you do the vault raid with one side you can’t backtrack, so if I want it on that character I’d have to buy it. By his description (changing to stealth commando) I’m assuming he/she is in the same position.
---
Or any form of effective....
---
I didn’t either. All I saw was their player names/icons go into the downed state on the team menu. It was the same guy for all the toons because his gamer tag was the same for each one with the exception of the suffix alt1, alt2 etc. Regardless I doubt they could have been in any danger because they never left the drums, unless someone led some liberators from 76 over.
---
Ya, it took real restraint to not chuck a controller.
---
Every time I fast travel &amp; I have to click it 6 times i ask myself the same thing man😂 I can’t even get mad anymore I just laugh at this point lol
---
I do care if it's a SBQ fight because there's a risk you get spawned in the nuke zone. Some people have PA and a Chinese suit but I didn't at the time. And if people were nice, they'd revive you so you won't get your junk stolen. It's the the principle of leaving someone there to die.
---
Did people have their tents around?
---
I understand that, but that doesnt sound like an issue when there is no limit to spending them and only a few things to get for them. I have more an issue that machine stops at 150 a day and my stash is full to the point I have to make another alt. Why is the 1k cap an issue exactly?
---
You know, that’s the one I meant, but after I hit send I was like, fuck, googled the 7 years war. It only lasted 6 years 8 months. My unyielding made my luck high enough hahaha
---
Spawns are messed up regardless. No tents and I've still had spawns over 100 ticks away from the center of the event
---
I'm not creating an alt as a work-around
---
A bit
---
Oh you’re totally right I forgot about that. It’s the worst i just start spamming Radaway the second i spawn in😂 yeah I’ll admit some people do revive me &amp; I love those people man but lately I’ve been getting a lot of sitting around spamming help for 30 seconds while people run around me.. that help emote is not hard to notice at all trust me😂
---
The combat text is not to be trusted. There’s MANY situations it doesn’t report accurately. My best guess is it’s client-side predictive and even then is janky AF.
---
300 damage on a sneak attack is 600. Power attack is.. I forget how much more. 50%? So 900? That’s enough to kill even highlevel Supermutants, although armor should reduce that. MA only increases speed, so shouldn’t directly increase your damage.
---
Dear thekosmicfool (and this community),
---
I am not unfamiliar with Bethesda Game Studios' production (see my previous post for qualifications). 
---
My system certainly has sixty GB of free disk space on the regular; however,
---
When I am busy needle-pointing about the viente y dos,
---
I tend to forget about my bio\*relative who hangs out on this very forum
---
That's why I ask of you-all simple patience, and a quick acrostic-read before a ban,
---
blendeverything
---
Lmao, I thought you may have been saying it didnt last quite as long as it says, like a week is only 6 days. The 100 years war was 112 years IIRC. So that would mean a week is 9 days. 
---
Funny either way.
---
I've been trying for 3 days, so don't get your hopes up, but max out your luck IRL :)  
---
I think it was around 1 or 2AM when I could finally progress, the servers should have a low player count at that time in my region (EU).
---
Most of us can oneshoot everything anyway. I agree it is intentional so the creatures are always attacking someone.
---
Fast travel bug?
---
No idea about the mining helmets. Class Freak is working, it's just a visual bug. Sometimes when a meatpile despawns it leaves the loot behind.
---
I declare Fallout 3 non canon!
---
Touche, I’ve met my match
---
You wait untill the cook out to turn them In.
---
Dude? Really?
---
Ok, so the issue is with the machine limit and not the cap for total scrip, right? 
---
I want to be clear,im not being a Dick, i just want to make sure i understand correctly that our ability to get scrip is the issue and not actually the limit of scrip per character. And no, the alt only heads off the issue temporarily, eventually it will be over its head as well.
---
uhh, what and when is that?
---
I need good bullion, not notes. Treasury notes are like Halloween candy.
---
Yeah bro there was a stretch that I would get revived, but lately, I've experienced exactly what you've experienced. It sucks because it's great reviving people and them giving you a thumbs up or heart. But I'm just done reviving, especially high levels. You'd think me being 274, I would get some "love" by other higher levels, guess not.
---
Ha
---
Happened to me before finishing the run, nothing worse than the 3 second limit :(
---
I'm thankful to everyone who glitches Line in the Sand and pops lunch boxes. Even at 180+ I can get a few levels out of that when I have as many xp buffs as possible.
---
You can put down three Aluminum extractors at the Red Rocket Mega Stop.
---
There are fourteen veins at Abandoned Mine Shaft One and eleven veins in Big Bend Tunnel, which adds up fast if using Excavator power armor.
---
Also, there is a safe at Morgantown Airport that always has 11 aluminum scrap in it, which is equivalent to 16 ore and 11 acid, so it's a decent find.  Not exactly huge but dependable if you happen to be passing by.
---
Its a temporary world event, pops every hour on the hour , up near vault 76. There will be an alert that pops up on your screen.
---
I believe so yes.
---
Top of the hour every hour
---
Your on ps4.   add me can you can complete it on my private with no trouble.
---
ahh, thank you
---
Someone bought a clean helmet I had from my stash through a vendor I wasn't sure what had happened. This needs to get fixed
---
No bugs, just horrendous framerate.
---
i thought it was uk? but only because it says uk in the picture
---
I think the watoga vendor sells them. Would have to google it to be sure.
---
I actually had to slap and try defend someones loot. The person just stood there as they died waiting while i was bolting over to revive the down person. They got their stuff back.
---
Yeah don't carry junk to the sbq and yeah it's part of the game but it was at the end and it was laggy and it happens to everyone. Just don't be a dick pls.
---
I get it, you want everyone to perform up to your ideals without taking any consideration into why they are not. 
---
I don’t care that you’re a type a personality. Not everyone on this planet is here for your benefit. 
---
You don’t have control over how other people play and you never will. Being AFK near an event does not have any detrimental effect on the event. It only pisses you off because you feel like you need to be in control and everything needs to fit nicely into the little imaginary compartments that you have concocted.
---
Easily fixed with a vampires heavy gun of your choice.
---
I mean they don’t each double the damage, but yes, they stack.
---
New damage changes coming soon though (they’re on PTS now), that stacking is no longer multiplicative, but it still adds damage)
---
Actually had this happen earlier my game froze for a whole minute i was just too annoyed with the game &amp; put my controller down &amp; when I came back a few minutes later i was unfrozen. Definitely some issues with the game rn
---
No the total scrip is the issue. If you're doing events and scripping weapons and armour you get to 1k too fast. Don't get me wrong, I'm not in love with machine limit either but the issue I have is that I have a back-log of weapons in my stash that I would like to scrip instead of just drop.
---
Apparently random on vendor spawns.

Luckily I haven’t had it happen yet, unsure why though....seems to happen quite often.  I still have yet to finish the run, I think I have 10 spaces left to go.
---
Heres a little guide
---
https://youtu.be/tYy-hC6bl4I
---
Problem is you can have 1500 or 150: you are still limited to 140 a week. And that's if you exchange EVERY DAY WITHOUT MISSING A CHANCE. 
---
Stupid system. At least scout badges gave you unusual things to do.
---
I have done the same 😂
---
I was at 15 spaces left with enough atoms to finish it. The game seems so much better now...again.

I have had that happen before when I lived in Flatwoods and it was the main reason I decided to move. The thought of coming back one time to have all my missile turrets and an alien agro me is slightly terrifying. Plus, I had decided I wanted to move somewhere closer to end game content with water for a large purifier. My first move was to the Whitespring but I learned my mistake when my camp got nuked (had no clue it was such a popular nuke spot). After that, I moved to a pond near foundation and the Whitespring (where I am at now). Thought my problems were over after that but was afk farming water today (mute pc while in stealth staring at water purifier and use gamepad to spam the loot button while I watch tv). So, when I came back to my camp today to find a warzone I was quite shocked/alarmed. The nuke escort choppers and a horde of mirelurks were attacking my camp. The mirelurks are nothing new, they attack my base regularly and my turrets make short work of them but the choppers were a new one (I blamed Beckett at the time because he seems like the trigger happy type but after reading this perhaps they just decided it was time to end me before I became a threat).

Create new character and level them up in less than 10 minutes, delete, and repeat the next day
---
That’s why I removed my vendors, don’t want to take any risks
---
My fav comment on this! I love the positivity
---
I am on PS4 and when I run to revive someone, three people have come to the rescue already. 
---
Hard to roleplay a BoS medic when everyone is a doctor. 
---
I think the new team dynamics are the cause: we are not alone anymore.
---
The "Curse" attribute increases damage and attack rate but reduces durability.  In addition to that it will have the other three attributes, making it essentially a 4\*.
---
I mean, there’s not that other direct damage perks, esp. for a HW build. Really the only other direct damage perk is for stealth builds. Everything else is survival or QoL perks
---
That about sums it up.
---
You need People to play music, meat collectors, put out the brush fire, collect greens, clean up poo, collect wood.
---
insufficent amounts of those will cause the event fail.
---
Feels like it
---
It’s a 1% drop rate
---
My instigating combat shotgun pretty much one shots all high level ads in VATS, great weapon.
---
I just recently got the fancy pump action shotgun from a pleasant valley token and have been using that instead for something different. That also ones shots all ads in VATS.
---
I got it in the last hour actually, although you need Lvl 4 makeshift warrior (I think that's what it's called) to make it!
---
Atleast youre honest lol
---
Interesting. Wondering why they didn't just make it 4 stars in the UI to avoid confusion.
---
On a laser? What mods?
---
Not that that's a problem, but I only currently have the first lvl of the card
---
Because they can and want to, the real question is why havent spawns been fixed since location moving has been happening with line in the sand forever.
---
I play on ps4 and I just completed it, you just have to be super fast in killing the enemies
---
I always stick the shovel in the cash register..
---
Finally, you're awake!
---
What do mean bugged?
---
I’m still trying to script legendaries from faschnaut. I have about 30 more to script.
---
Haven't mods been "on the way" since November 14, 2018?
---
Silo status holotape (not sure the exact name)
---
Yup but it’s not “as” magic as miniguns. The higher the fire rate the better the magic. 
---
I just realized the vampire Gatling laser I have is magic when I had to try and solo ACP and busted it out. I solo’d it all right, in like 2 minutes. (V33%1A gat laser- magic gun that heals you too? Sooooo OP)
---
Why isn't the fixer a 4*?
---
2021
---
I honestly find it bullshit that a half naked guy in a few plates of armor can have a greater carry weight than a walking take with hydraulic joints.
---
Ski poles are aluminum. Got to the top of the world and scrap away.
---
I wouldn't dream of attempting to explain Bethesda "logic" to anyone ;)
---
Thank you, I know its a long list of both what you should keep or what you should get rid of but any little bit helps! Seems Holos are used more often so maybe I should dump my notes first and see if it helps resolve the issue.
---
This needs more upvotes, take mine
---
Nicely made, great art
---
They’ve respond to this issue several times and a a priority to them.
---
I'm on PS4 too. Yes, I do see that as well sometimes. But with the stimpack delay, the stuttering, and the possibility of spawning in the nuke zone, it just angered me how no one just used a Chem to revive me that's so abundant.
---
Sorry. As a high level I go out of my way to help lower levels but really anyone and everyone because we all should just help each other out. Stealing loot is BS as well. This isn’t Lord of the Flies people.
---
Primal cuts started at 11am meat weak started at noon, most likely more people were on during the challenge reset which seems to be a trigger for it.
---
3 star grog axe for me. The rest are 1 star
---
I wasn't, but I could have lost the stable fluxes from the event. Fortunately no one took them, it's just frustrating.
---
Is it hard though? About what he’s asking.
---
This
---
That’s cool. I would never have enough camp budget for that many flamingos.
---
It absolutely does as long as you aren't trying to min-max your build for pure damage. Slap emergency protocols on your torso, spec into dodgy, ricochet, nerd rage, and action boy and you've got yourself something that will tank everything in PVE and all but a min-maxed build in PVP. 
---
As for myself, I've got a [medic's build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d136d8c&amp;d=ic4ii0l71lu2cf1lt2sr2sq2eu0s32sb2eg1ip2s71a72a12ir1s00s11lg2ce0c61cu0pe0co0&amp;w=l90p00lb1i44ik0if2iq2lm2at1i71ag2c52sd2so2sp2im0in0as1&amp;m=c29fegha&amp;wp=w7w2w7&amp;wm=1l2737-142238-1428) going on. It isn't hurting too badly in the damage department, tanks everything I've thrown at it, and more importantly, it is great for keeping lower-level squadmates alive. Daily piloting two different sets of X-01. One with Emergency protocols and one with a jetpack. The latter is coming in handy for a Colossal Problem as I can just throw myself over the wendigo spawns while I reload or stim.
---
Edit: Forgot a perk there. Added nukes and dragons link.
---
I thought the world ended at 12/31/2020 at midnight?
---
It is 4 stars , the main buffs name has just become cursed. That’s an executioners harpoon gun with curse.
---
Honestly the whole thing could be fixed by just tying tamed animals to an object, like they did with allies
---
LoL I got my son to screen shot it at home.
---
It says Plan Meat Tenderizer.
---
I'm hoping it's the same.
---
How do I upload pictures?
---
Fuck hopefully, then we come outta the pods and get told we survived the simulation
---
There’s playing a *co-op* game and not playing how others want you to play, then there’s leeching. AFKing and doing absolutely nothing at all is leeching which should be punished not rewarded.
---
Ohhhhh god lmfaoooo
---
This seems to be the problem with any of them that have failed for me today. Tents being near the event almost always means a no spawn or a very long walk to find the mobs.
---
Fort Defiance. 
---
There are dozens of surgical trays strewn across the whole building. Each is 2 Aluminium.
---
And turn the meat on the spit
---
I haven't seen Grahm there either.
---
I was at one of those events in the Ash Heap, and the damn thing crashed right as I was nearly killing the sheepsquatch. The event failed, yet again, every Primal Cuts I went to on that server failed because things were spawning on the other side of the map. No clue what happened to the other players that just disappeared during the event, they probably had the same crash that I had, there were like 4 other players at the Ash Heap, then suddenly there were just two, then I crashed shortly afterward.
---
Or we wake up in limbo and you find out all the sick fucks who killed the innocent brahmin by the Primal cuts event get sent to hell.
---
I owe my life to my .308 hunting rifle...so many scorched
---
I didn't know that. Thank you for sharing!
---
I don’t think the stealth buff registers in combination with the actual damage , you see 150 and hit for 300 + extra stealth points. Unless you have ninja equipped that will show the ninja stealth numbers but not the added stealth numbers. Melee builds are op.
---
To anyone who got it was it from a fully comepleted meat week event? Or was it like tier 2 or 3?
---
Yes, it's for the UK. Someone posted a link to a camp with the U.S. Veteran's crisis line as well. Pretty cool!
---
THIS! I am so frustrated that I just turned off the console and disconnected for the day
---
Some people genuinely don’t know that they can go on the drums or spits and basically walk away while contributing. 
---
I’m not asking someone to min/max a build. I’m not shooting at people on the fence at SBQ or stealing from locked containers because I don’t like someone’s prices.  I’m not sending messages in game to rage at someone. 
---
It’s a super simple thing that makes events complete for the benefit of everyone who shows up.
---
Edit for clarity: go on the drums/spits and put the controller down and ride out the event.
---
Making it a solid question to ask
---
Not sure but you heal the damage you take, so you still cant fast travel due to taking damage but you also cant die
---
Dammit, that a 4th wall break inside a 4th wall break, thats.....16 walls!
---
Gotta use imgur usually
---
Where is he exactly? Been looking and can't find him?
---
Hey! That's the combo I'm rocking too! The helmet is so cool.
---
Your games, they can be fun to play when everyone is oneshotting stuff at events.
---
I got it from a full meat meter.
---
Would love for them to drop the no mic emote.
---
It’s generally recommended for queen fights to respawn as quickly as possible, it takes longer to revive than to respawn
---
I spent so much time in the subways in FO3. It would be nice to have some stuff that leads to other locations, like Big Bend.
---
Bethesda be like 'It'd be a shame if it vanished on login'
---
Disgusting is what I think. I hate looking at just one.
---
1. The queen died 20 seconds prior to me going down
---
2. For other events, I understand what you're saying, but since there's a risk of you being spawned in the middle of the nuke zone, no. Revive. Not everyone has a PA and Chinese suit.
---
This is one of those fundamental problems that 76 has. Haphazardly launching nukes all over the place other the fun gameplay mechanic, and was intentionally worked into the game. But every fallout game is a testament to the horrors of atomic war, and 76 has plenty of lore, npc’s, etc that actively denounce the war, the nukes, but here we are launching them for goop to make a jet pack
---
It packs it up and puts everything in our stored tab
---
You need to have people on the music and meat spinners to have a good enough flow to not drop down
---
Hes asking those who afk to jump on a instrument then afk. Gives them higher chance of event success when they aren't paying attention to the game
---
Oh man, if the event was over then it IS scummy
---
Is it rare or a garunteed drop
---
It was the first thing I got, I've only done full meter cookouts though.
---
Everything? Even the crops? What happens to the items inside the vending machines and Display cases?
---
Was this on PS4? If it was, I stumbled across this person’s camp a few months back, thought it was a nice gesture also :)
---
To stand on. I did one Prime Meats in the Ash Heap, the best one yet. Two of us got swarmed by Rad Scorpions and Cave Crickets, a legendary Sheepsquatch and even a Super Mutant showed up. Three legendaries. I don't think I would have made it without the tent.
---
I've always made sure to log out before the challenge reset as well as do all the challenges first and NW last. Never had a problem with that.
---
So should I pick a thing and stay on it? I haven't done this event before and the three I've gone to have failed within the first few minutes of it being active.
---
There's already effects for the fourth and fifth star Bethesda just keeps introducing mods that do those effects instead of adding them to the game
---
Very welcome!
---
Yeah bro, it was. I got my rewards, then after a few seconds, the stimpack wouldn't fucking activate after spamming and I go down.
---
You kept those?
---
Cans
---
You move then look at your stored tab and everything will be there as a blueprint. 98% of the time it won’t place so it says something about breaking the blueprint , do that. It gives you every item you had on the stored items tab and you can use or scrap anything you had in the previous camp. 
---
*If you are close to your build limit definitely use stored items before creating new stuff.
---
Yah this would be good to know, I need to do a mass drop bc it’s slowing me down!
---
Everything. 
---
Display cases and vending machines get packed up and when you place from stored tab they keep their contents
---
That’s been happening to me the last couple of queen battles, the steampacks stop working towards the end of the fight and I am left hightailing to the nearest tent to store my flux
---
I'll swap them for the 2 concecutive 3* Beserkers Pool cues I got from SBQs.
---
It really should, but sadly doesn't. Same thing for the marine one and if I am not mistaken the one on the secret service doesn't work either?
---
[Tenderizer](https://i.imgur.com/JarYj6M.jpg)
---
Same server?
---
I’ve had the opposite today, I’ve *lost* radiation, but that’s probably due to a public team’s perk load out.
---
all 1* in all the meat events. Even from 3* prime.........
---
Beam splitter
---
Thank you.
---
Me too. I'm 274. I always revived people.
---
Go to the moonshine shack just south of V76 and then go a little west from there
---
Yeah the first primal cuts I did, the event failed. And the first grahms cookout I did, it failed. It really does need a lot of people paying attention &amp; doing objectives.
---
Right on, will do next time.
---
its the 20's, grahm uses he/his to refer to Chally
---
Nice try, Todd. If you think that suicide hotline is gonna keep\[ me from killing myself because I can't fucking RESPAWN, YOU HAVE ANOTHER THING (and lawsuit) COMING!
---
I think I'm up to six separate events at this point, all of them failures. All of them mostly due to the prime beasts spawning on the other side of the world, I even found time to get a huge crash just as I was about to kill the prime sheepsquatch after the event had already failed, DOUBLE WIN!
---
I was seeing this melee thing in VATS with a tenderizer tonight, it would miss several times in a row.  The server was about to crash though, that could have had something to do with it.
---
That sucks. sorry to hear that dude. I wish they'd screw up less...
---
I’m replying to you because it’s here. 
---
Why is everyone saying to go AFK? I honestly don’t even know how this event works. How do I benefit from just being on a server?
---
No but if you need a few meat cleaver plans, I got u covered.  LOL
---
The bloody chef outfit is rare?
---
Bloodied will still be viable and do the most damage, although it has taken the largest reduction in general, it is still the strongest.
---
Dont sell yourself short, all your stuff is viable.  Unless they decide to nerf unyielding and serendipity  than its still a very beneficial build. its still just a TEST server anyways. 
---
Next best things are junkies and AA. There is less of a performance gap between Junkies and AA on the PTS since AA wasnt actually nerfed due it being a debuff to enemies DR rather than a buff to your damage. But junkies is still doing more damage.
---
I pulled a BSS ski sword off of one of the radrats there tonight. Still gonna call it the Ass Heap tho.
---
Well for your information my parents are both dead. But trust me. They were much smarter then you appear to be.
---
Place a pillow at your feet, it will save your controller.
---
Fast travel bug.
---
They probably don't want to give you more scrip for a four star weapon.
---
Even worse would be if it were a four star that gives you scrip for a three star. That's a week's + worth of complaining on here.
---
Shoot, all I did was make a joke about masturbation using the Vault cleanliness posters.
---
I can help with my private world too, PSN vdub580
---
I got all the tenderiser mod plans in a row and my friend got the tenderiser plan
---
God that’s awful. Haven’t actually done the event yet since Bethesda delayed its release for the third time on console but I’ve heard a lot about it. As someone who has magic and a really good bloodied weapon I hope other people with the same weapons don’t take advantage of that. I want it to actually be a challenge.
---
No
---
I’m already working something out with someone else but still thanks for the offer
---
Yep, the one by the top of the world.  Several times wave 4 would stop spawning enemies and the event eventually failed.
---
Go to Big Bend Tunnel, there's a bunch of ore veins in the tunnel that branches off the center of the tunnel - behind the office, follow it all the way down to the chamber where the excavator is sitting there, ore veins on both sides.
---
If you go afk within the event area you may still get the rewards. 
---
Over the last year there’s usually a wave of rage about people doing the drums and spits because people don’t understand that the drums and spits help the event. 
---
If you do those things and observe what people are doing by panning the camera you can get an idea of what to do. 
---
1 turn in your prime meat on the big fire. 
---
2 clean up after chally (flies over objective)
---
3 put out fires
---
4 kill critters, loot, put items in cart full of meat
---
5 collect greens and put in cooler
---
6 turn spits
---
7 play drums
---
8 turn in wood scraps
---
All of those things help the event.
---
Well they don’t seem to have passed on their intelligence. Fun Fact: Intelligence is scientifically proven to come from the mother’s side of the family. My mum could be dumb as a brick while my dad could be Einstein but I’d never have his level of intelligence.
---
We already have the mirelurk queen and scorchbeast queen as tough enemies. I’d love to see some Kong’s. Rad scorpion king would be cool
---
I wish they would add one of those WW1 era shovels soldiers would use, those things were equally good at being a digging tool and being something you could beat a motherfucker to death with (you sharpen the blade on one of those things and it’s extremely effective at cleaving a bitches skull in half with as well)
---
Yeah, BUT(T):
---
The Script you get from trading in Prime Meat in the Grahm Event is not related to your 150 Script Vendor limit; It gives you 5-15 SCRIPT and not 1-3 Legendary Items.
---
If you cap the 150 daily script exchance at the trading post, you can still get 15 script per hour on top of that.
---
not a thing for gatling lasers.
---
This game was always barley playable I'm surprised the servers still work
---
It's not a joke. Todd actually said it. Now the statement is over a decade old but I doubt their stance has changed much if at all based on how Fallout: BOS was received.
---
&gt;He also elaborated that *Fallout 3* takes place thirty years after *Fallout 2*,  but features a new protagonist in a new setting (Vault 101, a Vault  underneath the ruins of Washington D.C.). He quickly added, "For our  purposes, neither *Fallout Tactics* nor *Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel* happened."
---
[http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/fallout-3/800771p1.html](http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/fallout-3/800771p1.html)
---
The game wont let you drop any holotapes that are necessary for the quests
---
Nah off that shit
---
Get the SS helmet. I bet you’ll love that light
---
It's these dickwads at level 300 or 400 who spray bullets that kill things instantly, just camp out in events and ruin things for everyone else.
---
The advantage of meat week is that it gives scrip directly, allowing you to go over the normal daily allotment. No matter how many easy legendaries Leader of the pack gives you, you can only turn in so many a day.
---
My Unarmed Ninja hits for 12K before Chems, food or Radicool. But he was built for it. This guy wielding the knife is a bloodied archer.
---
Swap servers
---
You can keep a set or two for when needed. I’m a rifle build and I don’t really use it unless I go into a Queen fight or a nuke zone. You should store the pieces on a chassis so they only won’t take up to much space.
---
Doesn’t work
---
Wow you are so edgy
---
For those in the US; 
---
1-800-273-8255
---
I probably know leas about the event than I should. I thought you were just telling me to go back to my camp and play drums instead of logging off.
---
I seen on some servers people placing power armor in front of the spits and drums so you couldn't play.
---
It's weird as Fallout 3 does make reference to the events of Fallout Tactics, so that decision must have happened after they already developed Fallout 3!
---
Eyeroll
---
people don't seem to realise they're different
---
Did you buy them from another player at some point?  I heard of a bug where a couple people said weapons they have sold out their vendors in the past have shown up.
---
Hell yes. My favorite thing to do in this game is kill challenging enemies and this does just that.
---
Why doesn’t this surprise me...
---
Sad man, just sad...
---
I use it for pain train and carry weight bonus
---
Nope traded for them a while ago
---
is the INT bonus from bloodied builds still worthwhile? do you get a lot of extra exp from the extra int?
---
Needs more salt xd
---
Ah, true. But, the magic effect does happen on this weapon. It is affected by ~200 firerate.
---
I’m not clear on how that information is supposed to relate to what I wrote. But cool?
---
Depends on the price, no?
---
Have you tried under the floor? Several times I find that the enemy had spawned 25 feet under the ground!
---
Id imagine the entire board resets and rewards whether they were claimed or not unfortunatley
---
I would display that axe in my camp. I love these rustic designs.
---
So you know when you've got a TV and you buy a DVD player for it and plug it in, then a few months later you get a PS4, and then a Switch and then cable, and the several other things and behind the TV is an absolute mess of tangled cords and wires and the only way to fix it and make it look nice is to spend forever unplugging everything and rewiring it?
---
My guess is that's what the coding of FO76 looks like.
---
I mean if you're a baby with a mostly empty stash, why not?! Don't do more than a couple sets.
---
It only helps you save a little server hopping later on for when/if you want those t51 t45 and t60 sets. There'll be better stuff to grind for when you get higher.
---
I am on Xbox and my friends list wasn't working earlier either.  Seen it happen a time or 2 in the past. Not sure of the cause or fix.
---
2% per intelligence point
---
Nooo... In fact: throw away anything you won't be able to use five levels from now (except your ideal weapon). Truth is, you will find hundreds of fantastic items and stash space is the most valuable thing in the game.
---
There won’t be 4-5 star weapons/armor until the game is at an end. Yes, once upon a time, you could have a 4* weapon. But they nixed that right before the purveyor came out. Why? The machine only takes a max 3* weapon. Probably other reasons too. Either way, they’re not going to introduce 4-5* gear/weapons this ‘early’ in the game. In my opinion, they’re saving it. Until they run out of content, or just give up on 76 and move to something else. That will come out at the END of the game. To give the last players something to grind for, while there’s no new content. As much as I love this game, it can’t last forever.
---
Don’t claim them. Wait till season 2. Find out and tell us what you find out.
---
Bingo. If you grab all of them, you'll probably walk out with over 200 aluminum. Not to mention all the other materials; full clearing Defiance is a great way to stock up on all the most commonly consumed materials (steel, springs, screws, etc).
---
Ironic justice is best justice.
---
Power armor should automatically have a carry weight of 600. Calibrated shocks should add 200, and the Excavator set itself should be 800, so calibrated Excavator can be 1,000. Not so unreasonable if you think about it, since Unyielding plus backpack can crank the carry weight up to about 500 or so, possibly higher.
---
Oh, I know. Even though it’s only 182 fire rate. In my experience it’s just higher fire rate just = more magic. My accelerated magic Minigun is reaaalllly effective. My magic Gatling laser is only somewhat magic, but it’s good enough, and the 1000rd fusion cores plus the fact that it’s a *Vampiric* magic laser makes it really great for ACP
---
No junk is dropped during events so good story
---
I get the opposite feeling. I'm often alone, but never feel lonely. My fellow seven-sixers are the most warm and friendly community I have ever come across in gaming.
---
I get what you are saying about not speaking, but a lot of people will have good reasons for not having mic set to 'Area' chat.
---
If they are in a team, they may have it set to 'Team'. If they are friends then more likely in party chat. If they stream like me, they may have mic off in game so as not to annoy people while they talk to their stream chat. Maybe they have people living with them in close proximity so don't mic up because of that. And some people just don't feel comfortable talking to strangers on mic.
---
However, in 220 hours or so of playing so far, I can count on one hand the amount of times that somebody has completely ignored me when I emote to them. You can actually communicate quite a bit by using them too. 
---
BTW, are you sure you have your chat settings set to 'Area'? I think they reset sometimes when logging off and on again. And if so, then nobody will hear you attempting to converse. :)
---
But with a 90% reduced weight shovel, I don't have to worry if somebody else has already grabbed those two shovel spawns!
---
In the end it only matters what you do. As in life some are just jerks. So keep reviving people. You’ll get it back. I’m level 53O. My vending machine is free with legendaries. Whatever I can do to help.
---
Almost nothing changes since the damage nerfs are proportional across the board. It only impacts bloodied the most because they tend to have the most buffs and synergies stacked, so are the hardest hit. If there was a build with as equally as many buffs, it would be impacted in a similar way.
---
For day to day enemies, nothing really changes. Still about as effective but might take a few extra bullets. It only really matters for bosses. Even then, not really.
---
The only build that MIGHT change is AA as their multiplicative buffs game diminishing returns after the 1st one. Now that it'll be additive, in theory it should improve damage.

Just joined a primal event near the end, almost EVERYONE was just standing there..afk and of course I couldn’t do much anddd first fail, i am disappointed
---
Usually more than one primal cut event spawns at a time. If you go for the one where everyone is, what many are trying to do is rush through it, so they can catch the tail end of later primal cut events.
---
Go to the one no one is at if you want kills. 
---
Does this make sense? 
---
The goal for most isn't to tag stuff, its to get prime meat which is awarded for completing it. Completing it as fast as possible gives potential chance to hit more than 1 event.
---
Username checks out
---
The real benefit of bloodied is Unyielding, which provides the frame. You can be a beast by keeping the same build and just using another weapon. 
---
My bloodied commando sometimes uses instigating weapons, or executioner ones. He still kills.
---
That’s a good point. I will
---
Where do you get formal complaints
---
And the respawn bug! It's happening so often with primal cuts... Dying to the last enemy when my team mates kill it means I have to shut down the game to resume playing...
---
I wish I had seen this like 5 minutes earlier so I could have saved myself 800 atoms on that dumb outfit. Giving away things that are currently for sale in the shop is a real dick move.
---
this event sounds so unappealing and gross in all ways to me

Like i care what you think
---
If you don’t know what to do, you can go do the drums and just watch what people are doing. It’s pretty hectic the first few times.
---
Ok seriously. I was being snarky. I seriously doubt you’ll be able to do this.
---
Better that than pulling a Riflegaming and nuking their camp.
---
If you purely want the prime cuts then it doesn't matter who killed that legendary in one shot then huh?
---
Lol I won’t do all my unlocks. Just one. Hey you’re probably right that we won’t be able to but maybe they’ll let us get away with just one or a few
---
all 1* knuckles.....
---
Son got the tenderizer plan I've gotten one tato salad plan and 2 full moo moo outfits. Luck is not on my side.
---
1. 60th level is not low level.  You have access to the highest level equipment.  You may not have optimized your load out, but you are not fundamentally weaker than someone who is level 400.
---
2. If we wait for everyone with a melee build to hit half the creatures, the event will time out.  Melee builds are simply not going to cut it for horde type events over a wide area.  Not to say melee builds are weak, I’ve seem quite a few Scorchbeast Queens taken super quick by bloodied meleeists.
---
3. There is a lot of junk lying around after these events.  Sure it’s not experience, but you can certainly loot your heart out.
---
4. When I’m using a Gauss Minigun I don’t hit most of the enemies in a Primal Cuts event unless everyone else is useless.  People don’t try to share non-legendary kills because they are focused on the event completing.
---
Ok found it ty brother
---
This is your body on Nuka Shine
---
Ain’t that the truth.
---
Perfect, np bro!
---
Enjoy the cookout!
---
if you store the armor on the chassis and store the chassi in the stash it only weighs 10, which is just the weight of the chassi
---
VATs in PvP broke after Wastelanders dropped. Just fyi
---
I hear ya brotha
---
Enjoy meat week when it works
---
my main concern is after quests when they are technically no longer needed. Sometimes going back to those quest areas can be useful
---
Check the server you're on, if there are two teams of high level players then the event will get max rewards. If not then server hop.
---
Uh ok
---
Actual promised release date by bethesda + 1-2 weeks
---
Thanks! I found a meat cleaner plan!
---
Yeah but it doesn’t really look dirty....
---
Awesome
---
Craft them at the tinker bench
---
There’s also a likely chance this leads to your board not resetting to season 2 at all while simultaneously engaging self destruct mode on your PS4. 
---
Bethesda has a way with things lol.
---
You need to develop the habit of picking up small, lightweight objects which have whatever material you seem to run out of. 
---
Aluminum cans, surgical trays...
---
Aw, I was hoping for a stuffed little brahmin backpack
---
Ash heap has two aluminum spots that yield quite a bit I just remember they are west of where I farm copper ore.  A good spot for alum scrap is harpers at the armory you need high jump the AC unit have coolant caps and getting them all gets you 56 scrap for a few minutes time.   
---
Another option take a workshop it fills pretty quick.
---
https://youtu.be/NvieHUgHTSE
---
If you guys haven’t figured it out, this video is extremely easy and it fixed it for me!
---
Me too. Or at least if there is an issue with floating items, I didn’t actually notice it!
---
So thats why I have a ton of mine that are half filled now!
---
Let's not forget that the meat event happens every 15 mins and the time for Leader of the Pack is considerably longer.
---
I don't think Leader of the Pack is underrated at all. It's fine if you're low level grinding scrip. Kind of a waste of time for high levels unless you just want to get a legendary challenge out of the way.
---
I love seeing Bible Verses on CAMP walls
---
This is the tip of the day for my noob ass.  I've been storing them separately with all the pieces taking up 150lbs.
---
This started for me immediately after the last patch.
---
I’m wondering if we can get a legendary one after learning the plan...
---
My install didn’t even update via Steam. I’m still on the old client for whatever reason 🙄.
---
I haven't played the event yet. anything unique you can earn other than just some scrip?
---
Lol stop assuming I’m on PS4 and let me do my thing. I mean you’re right but think of it as a sacrifice to the community.
---
Lol
---
I have been, and I'm still habitually out of aluminum. I'm aware of what the basics of looting are.
---
LOL "have too" this is Fasnacht 2.0.  If you're not AFKing it you're not doing it right.
---
Want to try something different? Get ALL the scout badges. It starts being boring, but it will make you do things, visit places and try weapons and such.
---
Compared to grinding the run...
---
Lol fine, but don’t say I didn’t warn ya.
---
*insert Todd quote here*
---
Ok cool
---
I wish I was getting head.
---
Just rethought they should have named it barrel pack and had a cow with it's utter zippered and a big fat Cholly head at the top.. Damn I wish their creativity spoke as much of the let down of creative words to describe the barrel.. 😟
---
It's not a bug, it's because the meatpiles pose a greater load on the server.
---
But you are right, unlooted shit will lag the server and some player.
---
It has to be fun. Go for it.
---
True, true. However Angry Turtle tried that strategy and still died.
---
Brahmin outfit and mask. 
---
Tenderizer plans and mod plans.
---
Meat cleaver plans
---
Brahmin grill plans.
---
Brahmin backpack plans.
---
Bloody chef hat and outfit
---
Grill master hat.
---
I believe that's it. Unless you mean prime cuts, than yes just meat for scrip.
---
It's been present since Wastelanders, then the meat pile dragging servers bug came along. So idk if Bethesda tried to fix the de-spawning and fucked it up more?
---
glad to help i was lvl 50 before i found out
---
Same here, no tents and I'm having the same issue private and public servers. I've had the final wave not spawn 2 times on me, and I'm having to solo cause no ones doing the event so irs a huge waste of ammo, dont remember meat week being this buggy and having this many laggy mole rats.
---
I played for about a month straight when it came out. Psyched about the possibilities but after that I was like...well, no more to do here...cya. I love fallout but man, what a miss on this one. Had some real possibilities but.... I keep am eye out but nothing they have done since with 76 makes me want to return. 🙁 Sucks for those with subs, sorry to hear it is still a wasteland (pun intended)
---
I have been trying to sell a troubleshooters fixer for a while, nobody seems to want it. You can have it for free. Add me.
---
“Muh immersion” Argument bought back from the grave lol
---
The environmental hazards in Monongah Mine are a real threat.  Earle has yet to kill me, but falling debris has gotten me at least once in every run.  It can be hard to notice the warning embers in first person, especially when you’re furiously mowing down wendigos everywhere.  Fire is a similar hazard, but Fireproof makes it so you have enough time to use a stim.
---
Pets dont use budget anymore and havnt for many months
---
Have a Snickers.
---
By no means do I intend to offend but they do and i do have evidence of this but I don’t know if they have changed it recently and anyone with pets before is boned but I do know for sure I lost a large surplus of building budget
---
I display mine but this is a fun idea
---
Get ridd of them. What platform are you on.
---
If you're already invested that heavily in strength, try heavy weapons. Otherwise you're probably gonna have a long grind to move your perk points from strength to perception and agility. 
---
You got a link to your current build?
---
No it's been happening to me for a while
---
Pretty sure it's failing cuz someone who has already completed the event has fast traveled to another one trying to get double cuts
---
This was my first time joining in and I thought I noobed something and failed.
---
Glad to know it's not me.
---
Nuts
---
At least since Wastelanders went live.
---
I laughed. I'm ashamed.
---
Turns out some of the spawns are aggroed to some other npcs outside the quest area. They chase after them and never return.
---
Yeah screw the no dailies bug weel just upgrade to the no season bug.
---
The fast travel bug will never be fixed, I dont think people understand that bethesda is aware of the bugs and cannot fix them. This is what happens when you build a game on top of a game that was created on a very old engine that predates both games. They just cant fix bugs, they have to pull magic out there asses and magic isnt real unless your david blaine.
---
If it’s any help, I did the same thing, my first build was a shambles, but I love the main quest, and just started another character.
---
I still think of that character as the father of my people.
---
It's happened to us when we all stand on the tent that the mobs cannot attack us, there are mobs far away from us about over 90 yards, we know that because one of us get down the ground and then saw the mobs coming. So make sure someone stand on the ground.
---
Bethesda still reply to your ticket? I've sent so many they just auto lock mine without a reply anymore!
---
Got a bloodied fixer. 1* but still ya
---
But now he has 2 pieces of paper to pick up the poo
---
No, no unless your holding out hope we can display them one day. But even youd be better of dumping them then getting new ones when the time comes
---
Can you actually equip power armour onto a chassis if you're too low a level to wear it? I feel like that was a thing
---
Delete this.
---
I'd absolutely love a cursed sickle. Lovely work.
---
I was answering to a different comment on melee being overpowered, my mistake.
---
not sure you might be right but i think there was a way around that, cant remeber i was 50 when i found out
---
Magic guns arn't that good, a food buffed unarmed build is though!
---
I feel a case of the Hobby Wobbles coming on
---
Meat Week is a hood opportunity to pick up the metal picnic table which is a rare item he sometimes has. Before meat week it was so rare it used to change hands for like 12000 caps
---
The only notes you’ll want to hang on to, that aren’t ever marked for a quest, are the vigilant citizen notes for the pawn shop in Grafton.  You can hang them on the wall and they’ll be removed from your inventory.
---
Aside from that, I’ve done every quest in the game and never needed the notes or tapes again.  You could hang on to the password for the command center in Camp Venture, but it’s not necessary at all.
---
Dropping all those notes and tapes will make a big difference with stash lag.  I highly recommend it.
---
I bulk it and sell it every day, just to have some space in my stash. Must sell 150 every day. What do you use it for?
---
But female scorpions are larger than males and even eat them too...
---
just another reason why MEAT Week is the best thing ever.. hes stationary the whole time
---
You will just time out working the spits or the drum.  Thats fine if you're around but I can't afk while Im at work doing that
---
Yeah for sure. Tracked him down for a month trying to get the clean picnic table. 😃
---
Fast travel bug, respawn bug, fast travel bug, respawn bug, fast travel bug, respawn bug and also fast travel bug but don't forgot respawn bug. Oh yeah I forgot something, fast travel and respawn bug.
---
I wear full unyielding set with deep pockets, a 60 pounds backpack  with the 90% lowered chems mod and i can walk around  200 more pounds than me in an excavator armor. In fact, walking around in power armor feels like i am nerfing myself, but i have to now, since i went for heavy weapons after level 100
---
That's why i play it safe and just remove the doors lol
---
Haven’t you heard? It’s the new Rocketman perk.
---
How do I get a link?
---
Starting a new one was kind of a bad move, since levelling to lvl50 is like the hardest thing in this game.
---
Just a few wasted materials.
---
I want to create a new character but dont want to go through that effort again. Countless mission fails :(
---
Hey something new from last time: Playing the drums while waiting for the event to start counts towards completion. When the event truly starts it jumps to 1/3 or 1/2 way! You can hear the counter chiming every few seconds while drumming. It may be a bug but it's very useful for making the event end early.
---
Nukesdragons.com
---
Has a very nice build page. I use it all the time. Plug in what you have now and post the link here.
---
Edit: Corrected web address
---
Saying Fallout is buggy is like saying the Pacific Ocean is damp.
---
Turn it in to The fire during the main event for scrip, think you can earn a maximum of 15 scrip each event
---
Noopee, if you know where to look it doesn't take too long to cobble together a full set of the armours you can find (for real there's at least 4 potential spawns in watoga i can think of off the top of my head) and actually the first power armour you're gonna want is likely the Excavator (you find the plans as part of a quest and make it yourself, it's decent defence wise but the real bonus is it has increased carry capacity whichs is great for general usage) and frankly it's so good I kept using it till I upgraded to X01 (also crafted) then eventually T65 (yup, crafted).
---
Joining Uranium Fever provides a ton, from the miner breathers you collect from mole miners.
---
I figured lol,  I just wanted to make sure before I scrapped the only one I have 😆
---
So I can have my secondary account safe while my main account wrecks things?
---
It's the only loot worth something out of SBQ man I'll have to disagree with you on this one(Actually I bought 5 of em thinking it would work as checks worth 25k caps hope nobody reads this)
---
5% drop chance I believe.
---
Nope. You have to be the level of, or higher than, the level of the power armor to actually put it on a chassis.
---
My lips are sealed!
---
They must have furloughed the entire QA department during this pandemic.  70% of their cosmetics and new armors either block a large portion of the screen or have clipping issues.  Even the screaming eagle handmade and thunder pipe skins were a mess.
---
Either too much damage taken or too much rapid fire attacks to take you down while downed. Thats from what I've experienced at least
---
I'm bloodied dual-spec'd into commando/unarmed. But I'll probably go full commando since unarmed has been dumpstered, sadly.
---
Thats dope. I was hoping it would be so it looks more unique
---
Clearly you do.
---
If you say so sir. Whatever makes you feel better bout yourself.
---
PS: my friend said to give you 🔬and 🌭 to help you find yours as someone who needs to promote their male genitalia as you have usually has none to speak of, black or not. Lmao
---
It's too big, obviously. 
---
See: Treasure Hunter Mole Miners for reference
---
I'm sure they'll do a themed variation of it down the line. Maybe won't be like the original or a simple recolor.
---
Oh yeah, there is that. Forgot since I just move legendaries amongst my toons so I effectively turn in 500-750 scrip in a day if I have it.
---
Yes some are being added for gold bullion
---
Im pretty sure they said all that stuff would cycle through the shop at some point
---
Arrows, some gun repairs, occasionally need it to build while I set up my base. I end up having to swap off of my bow entirely for solid periods of time until I can get enough aluminum to make more arrows.
---
You can always craft another one so scrapping it isn't that big of a deal.
---
And customer support doesn't care, they will either say that they will do nothing then lock your ticket, or just lock your ticket with no reply at all!
---
This doesn't matter, auto complete can happen on login even 22 hours after the reset!
---
Yeah high level players should just stop doing events all together. Bunch of a holes.
---
They said maybe early next week now. Some other post had a link to the bethesda forums.
---
There are two types of steins. There are the placeable ones that you're thinking of, which appear as "floor decorations". And then there are the inventory item ones, which are crafted at a tinkers workbench under "souvenirs" - these are the ones that go in the display case.
---
Nope it happens to people who have never played Nuclear Winter or even play during the reset.
---
Can we stop making nukes the default for something a digger, some dynamite or even a few guys in power armor could move.
---
Yeah this seems to be happening quite often - lots of wasted ammo and no treasury notes- THANX!!! Bethesda. Usually happens in the last wave too - so by then you are already invested and you waste 2 minutes watching the timer tick down. GRRR
---
Once again, it is not game breaking
---
Super annoying
---
I agree with this but I also feel that the drop rates should be upped for the modifications as killing hundreds of queens can get old fast. At least for me.
---
Just to add onto this: Please leave Sunnytop Station out of the nuke zone. I want somewhere quick and easy to go to so I can stash my stuff and scrip my legendaries that's out of the nuke zone.
---
The pot next to the yao gaui
---
My gf doesn't play much anymore so shes only about rank 4, hasnt claimed any of them. If I remember to report back on this I will let you know if it lets you claim those or not.
---
Its because ZeniMax Media doesn't care as long as it generates revenue.
---
Oh okay, awesome!
---
*It's about sending a message*
---
I get your point man , but how may hours do I and ppl like me have to spend looking for these mods ? 1000-2000-3000 hours? 
---
I'm just asking for an option : RNG or Gold
---
My main is an archer. Buy the arrows. 
---
Also, if you join scorched earth often, you get loaded with improved repair kits. I only fix things using junk when I need to make room inside the stash.
---
Shouldn't have had that second helping of pork'n'beans.

---
its a big mess
---
I don’t revive people if I catch them fuckin with their jet packs.
---
That sleep emote is... weird. I wish it didn’t pulse 😳
---
This seems to be caused by enemies spawning too far away for quest markers to tag them, or even spawning them underground!
---
If you uninstall the game, you lose all your photos
---
Same, but the scrip is more valuable to me on my characters who can craft gauss weapons and Secret Service armor, which I can’t do on all 5 characters, so being able to grind out extra scrip on my mains via meat week is a welcome change.
---
ps4   
---
 Primal Cuts event multiple fails .
---
issue
---
 animals not spawning fast enough and are to far away from starting point.
---
you have run all over the area to kill them fast enough -
---
this is true of most location after 8 hrs play
---
The feature is allowing visitors to put their chicken on skewers n cook it with the flames
---
Mount blair will dig us in, better XD
---
Do molerats count? The events I had fail didn't have prime scorpions.
---
...isnt it kinda sadustic how he keeps his pet cow around during meat cook?
---
My favorite strategy is to just hoard all the greens, then play drums or spin the spits until its about half way done then boom! I finish it up
---
I've attempted three events so far, and two of them failed because no one bothered to show up to participate.
---
Not gonna lie, I'm already sick of wasting my time logging in to work on the event when no one is running it already (on Xbox, no idea if that experience is similar for anyone else).
---
Each part of the map has different enemy spawns for the event.
---
Might be related, but there's a reload glitch for automatic weapons now. I don't know if its lag where the game doesn't register how many shots you've taken or what, but shooting a lot when there's a lot of NPCs or players around will trigger a reload before your magazine is empty for some odd reason.
---
A privately owned billion dollar company? Do you really have to ask?
---
Lolol I can see why
---
Add me if you want, Black Cringe. I have 2 chars I run afk when I am at work and have another person who is going to join off me everytime and possibly afk as well. Thats 3 people on instruments/spits + whatever you would do. On my last server we had 3-5 people doing this at any one time plus actives and always finished within a minute.
---
How do you get that coat?
---
I don't think you understand how capitalism works.
---
heres an idea, lets not waste a nuke just to open some stupid cave, lets make it so we have to deposite 1 bundle of dynamite instead
---
I'd wait til after the double score weekend tbh, which started today
---
To help you hurry up your screen tabbing, you don't need to stand up and return to playing, just hit esc and go to the map screen and back to play.
---
Thanks for that advice will follow this from now on 👍
---
I have carnivore and whenever i eat something plant based i get absolutely no benefits, not even health iirc. 
---
Eating meat doubles the health gain, food saturation, all benefits, and with no disease chance. Combine this with slow metabolism perk and I eat very rarely, even with speed demon mutation. I eat ionized meat because it doesn't spoil.
---
2.27% if you fully complete the Event.
---
Got it on PS4 on my 10th Event. Honestly pleasantly surprised with how quickly it dropped.
---
Going in knowing the drop rates are so much better than they've been in past Events actually makes me want to participate in the Events MORE, even if I get everything I wanted.
---
How do you spin the meat? There’s no option on the wheel where you turn in the prime meat
---
Hey, I know this is an old thread, but could I add you and give you like 250 for them if you didn't already give them away? If not its fine, I just want it for funnies.
---
Ok. This is what I would do:

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You wouldn't have to move any perk points around out the gate, if you have the cards already you could just swap them out. After that, find a heavy gun and power armor and go to town.
---
so true
---
Edit: Just added you, in case you see a notification or pop-up or anything.
---
I will absolutely do that, thank you! It'd be nice to know going in there was a group working on it. My GT is Revid Cargian, I'll add you shortly.
---
I've seen them in the Groves southwest of Fissure Prime.
---
It’s just cosmetic. Doesn’t do anything different.
---
It's just a skin dosent actually preserve food
---
It’s all about the looks, it’s just a backpack.  I personally think it goes well with a lot of raider theme outfits.
---
I'm for it! As well as a Super Mutant Behemoth event and a giant Deathclaw event.
---
What are the meat sweats?
---
This. Just play normally till the end then but what you lack. Even just dicking around you’ll pick up score that can save you a few atoms
---
Ahhh, I thought it had functionality as well. Glad I asked first. Thanx.
---
How about where I die and can never respawn? You think your shit is annoying? You have to click 2-3x vs once. I can't do Colossal Problem or Daily Opts.
---
AND NEITHER CAN JUICEHEAD!
---
How much contiguous free space do you have on the SSD or hard drive. I make sure to always have a minimum of 100gb free at all times for this game. And I only have ***this*** game installed on a dedicated SSD drive.
---
Note it's not a guarantee spawn
---
just normally spawning or in a blast zone
---
No worries. There is a no-spoil mod you can unlock for backpacks from the pioneer scout quests but honestly the other mods are better
---
note taken
---
Been working for me. Vampires +50DR Ultracite Gatling Laser. As long as you can keep firing you won't down. A jetpack helps with that, just yeet yourself to buy time for a reload.
---
Blast Zone. I think it's a 25% chance or something along those lines.
---
Sometimes you’re dead. 
---
Sometimes you’re REALLY dead.
---
Only got 1 stars out of the cook out so far. Have had a couple two stars during primal cuts. But it’s mostly been 1 star there too.
---
I saw this last night. First nuke was on the mine and second was on prime and the second one triggered colossal problem again. Went straight from the queen fight into colossal problem since everyone went to the queen first.
---
How many posts about this do we need 😑
---
When you are solo, sometime this option is given to you if players are around. I don't how many players must be around or if they need to be in a group, but yes, sometime it's because there is actually someone around you that can actually revive you if you scream for help...
---
And in group or not, you can only be revived once per life. Once revived, you will instantly die if you drop down again.
---
I finished today amazingly got to 100. My level is now 262. I started the season at 131. Crazy! Hang in there you can do it! Now I can meat week all I want.
---
Like others have said it stacks with a bloodied weapon, but even if you don't use a bloodied weapon it's still worth using. With starched genes its only -12 hp, so the extra damage is always worth it.
---
I just get an effect, no scrip??
---
I was wondering what happened. Guess it was a good thing I looted all of it.
---
this man is gonna waste his rewards
---
6 days and 24 hrs
---
You’re missing the Eviction Notice from Bog Town!
---
Had someone do this to me just because he didn't like the fact that I had locked my ally in her own room. It's like oh no how dare I make my ally easy to find and stay put
---
Between the weeklies this week and the double score weekend right now, you'll get really close to finishing without using atoms.  I just think with atoms being rarer now and bought with real world money, it seems a waste to use them.  Save them for more interesting things from the store.
---
These are incredibly cute
---
OH, really? Maybe they changed it. Last year and The year before you got scrip
---
yes i like that idea
---
If I had to guess off hand, I believe there are two. One at Bolton Greens and the other in the church with the wendigo in the Mire.
---
was upped to 10% recently. 
---
if the grove is just outside the blast zone it can still spawn. If it's not there kill everything in the grove and then come back 10 minutes later (no sooner) and there's another chance it may have spawned.
---
Perhaps. Both times I tried I got an effect. Was so confused. :/
---
Maybe someone can help me out.. I got the beer stein for meat week, but where do I find it?
---
I fucking love this community, I know we all pin stuff on Bethesda for bad decisions but I'm unbelievably grateful that they gave us all this platform, best gaming community I've seen in 31 years as a gamer.
---
That's the enclave vs. China
---
Ye, well i dont really know since i can't try it myself right now. Seems wierd tho. Not sure IF its worth grinding the prime events
---
That's a much better, non immersion breaking use of your budget.
---
Can’t argue with that logic.
---
I think you're right. I had a weird bug where I clicked the mine dead center, but it spawned somewhere else. There was still an overlapping nuke, and the event still spawned.
---
Or what neglect means.
---
But there's not a commie faction
---
Ah thank you. That makes sense a little. A random person and I (both of us were public leaders of different teams) were fighting the behemoth from primal cuts. He went down, I revived him. I went down and he revived me. Then I went down again but instantly died.
---
Oooh good idea
---
Pets did initially take up budget but they added to total CAMP budget in the process, this was later exploited so they changed it so pets take up a 0 triangle budget adjustment but there has been reports that if you are above max budget a pet will no longer function or assign to CAMP but that could have been fixed. 
---
If you are having issues with budget, move CAMP to new location and pet should move with.
---
I will add you back when im home from the gym. My account disconnected while i was here so you may not be able to join me, trying to get my gf to set it up again.
---
That Mr Handy robot that is afraid of bees needs to tell us about it and give us rewards.  Also, there needs to a dead woman in a Captain Cosmos costume, a dead delivery boy in a red jacket, a dead Chinese spy, a dead Mirelurk, and a broken Protectron inside.
---
Never played meat week
---
Joined a crap server tonight...soloed it...killed all creatures with 45 secs to spare
---
saw a "Event failed"  after
---
"Did i not beat the drum enough? Did i kill those brahmin?"
---
Nope new but old bug
---
Is this a joke I’m too dumb to understand?
---
Ok I will use this, thank you! also you wouldn't mind building an automatic or non automatic (idk which is better) build or just a general good build that's popular?
---
Is it already gone?
---
Lode Bearing, Breach and Clear, and the big bad beast up at the top of the Ash Heap the excavator.
---
Those three can get you more aluminum ore than you can handle. 
---
Then you’ll be back complaining you don’t have enough acid!
---
EDIT: Obviously, be wearing your excavator suit when you do Lode Bearing.
---
Happens to me to. It feels like a server disconnect lag. For me when it happened, HP and group visuals disappeared on screen followed by “reconnecting to server message”. After reconnecting I could move and I could then use the spits if I tried to use the cooking station first. Otherwise it would not let me.

[Meat Sweats!](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Meat_sweats#:~:text=Meat%20sweats%20is%20a%20condition,to%20August%208%2C%202019\).)
---
But so fun...
---
Maybe we'll get Fire Ants when the Pyroclastic storms come.
---
Last year the icon didn’t pop up but you were indeed awarded scrip. Did you check your total in your pip boy?
---
Welcome!
---
Yeah there are some new ones, the googles has the datamines :)
---
I used atoms to buy the last ten levels because honestly the challenges weren't fun or challenging. And I don't feel bad about it one bit especially with meat week going on now. Trying to do the challenges in between the prime meat events would have caused too much stress lol. Even before meat week though I felt relief every time I long in that I didn't have another chore to do. Just log in, get my scrip, turn in treasury notes and start playing the game the way I find fun without worrying I was missing out on anything.
---
The first one the Mysterious Stranger perk can help.
---
The second one... not even The Mothman can save you from.
---
same
---
Yes, but i'll double check next time i play
---
I dig your analogy, i just call it spaghetti code. When you've been using and reusing expressions for so long you'll replace your light switch with a pull cord and when you pull the cord the light turns on but your pants fall down because that was actually your waistband you just used.

I hate fighting sheepsquatches. I really, really do.

no. the turret earned it.
---
I'm at 97 and only got it once when I played nuclear winter last before the reset. Other than that I've been offline during reset and not done anything other than adventure before and after the reset.
---
I am! Thanks for noticing!!
---
I feel like half the camps I see now are all prefabs between the cabin, rr garage, seedy shed, dome, that weird trailer you can have an entire camp of nothing but prefabs.  Yeah like a proper house though. But would kind of take the creativity out of it, you'd have a bunch of people with the same damn house
---
Beth should add a “Newly Learned” section of C.A.M.P items to make all the recently learned plans/ATX items more easily accessible
---
Actually that's how I did it originally, but I found that if you keep moving a d have escape artist,  adrenaline, covert operative, bloody Mess, and sneak enabled, you pretty much can flow through West Tek and take out everything without stopping or taking much if any damage. My heavy gunner runs were fast, but stealth really is fast. I should make a video as it's hard to describe.

Oh I see.... so that was you....

Well, I've received worse. Gotta look at the bright side of things, right?
---
The Brotherhoods arrival would be far more interesting if we could declare them enemies.  They failed.  The settlers and raiders I cleared the way for may talk tough to each other but other than minor "Trade" disputes there is peace here.  I don't need a bunch of tin can men wandering my hills fucking up the balance.  They are an unwanted disruption.
---
The Shi which were Ex-Chinese sailors and became Monarchists or something weird?
---
Outside of that, I think the Followers of the Apocalypse are the closest things we’ll get to a proper Leftist faction in Fallout
---
I was on a server for three hours tonight and it never once triggered the bog version of the event. All the others triggered at least once each hour and usually twice.
---
Too bad the turrets don’t level up
---
I just don't understand why people care that there's no fireworks and fanfare when you complete it? If you finished you have 100 levels of rewards and stuff unlocked that since you knew all along what you were working towards you should enjoy. If you put effort into finishing and you don't like what you got you only have yourself to blame.
---
No. If turrets gave us xp, it would be very easy to use them as xp exploits.
---
They're crafting components used for crafting bullion-purchased items.
---
Have you purchased any weapons or armor plans using gold bullion yet?
---
Modules are for crafting some vault 94 pieces as well as rolling specific new gear from wastelanders.
---
Vault steel is for crafting solar, thorns, or strangler armor.  You need the plans for those so it has limited uses.
---
Huh now I get it, thank you for the context.
---
Do better
---
I’d really like to see a communist guild from the community
---
I had this happen but I have no idea why.
---
It could have been because I had toilet paper selling for 2020, it could have been because I had plenty of outfits on there making it look like armor, it could have been because my settler wanderer is naked and wearing only a prisoner collar, it could have been because I hide my vendors.... 
---
So, I mean, there are several reasons.... I just don't know which one motivated that person to nuke my camp. I guess that some there we humans are just not meant to know....
---
turn it in during the cookout at the main fires
---
When's that? I've only seen waves of enemies and then event completed
---
every hour on the hour
---

---
This would be a generic stealth commando build, you could also swap the commando cards for rifleman cards and be just as deadly. 
---
It would work great with junkies. Commando cards would be good with Furious or Anti Armor, the rifleman would shine with instigating weapons. 
---
We'd have to change a few things around if you wanted to do bloodied or berserker.
---
True
---
When aren't they crapping out? Consistent disconnects and crashing is par for the course in f76 sadly. The worst part about it is Bethesda knows about this and couldn't care less. Whoever manages Bethesda Austin branch should be kicked in the nuts and fired.
---
those look great i will try to make them in 3d with blender
---
Happened multiple times without a tent...
---
Even telling these assholes who setup a tent and proceed to shoot from it that they're going to make the whole group lose they keep doing it, then do a ? ? ? emote when we fail the event.
---
Awesome.
---
If you really wanna slum it, you can use the Sunkissed perk. Hey, don’t look at me that way, I’ve done it.
---
If you melee as you reload it will cancel the reload
---
pick up Chally's poop. It's key
---
Donate a he cookout at the top of the hour for some scrip
---
Sorry your having such a bad first night of meat week. Hopefully night two will be better. If it helps even veteran players are having problems. I don’t remember it being this bad last year. 
---
So far I missed an event due to a very odd bug earlier. Wouldn’t let me fast travel. Not to grahams cook out. Not to my base or vault 76. Wasn’t overweight either. It just gave me a message of fast travel not available. 
---
And my favorite iv had 3 times. we kill everything during prime cuts and the timer just keeps going until the event fails.
---
Thanks! Other link didn’t work for me
---
Some items are so hard to find after reading the plan. I'm looking at you, colossus heads. They're in the same tab as the taxidermy gorillas.
---
Nope. Not sure what those are. I’ve heard about them.
---
I wish Bethesda did stuff like this. Unique weapons would be so cool if they all had different appearances from the standard versions. This would give us the incentive to keep stuff like All Rise, Last Bastion, etc.
---
Well I'm now 5/5 failing with a tent nearby and morons shooting from it even when I say in Area voice chat to get the F off the tent or we'll lose.
---
Bullion buys new armor/weapons.
---
Modules and/or vault steel craft said armor/weapons. 
---
Don't play fortnite. (Because you're five)
---
There is a grill under the yau gui where you can donate 5 primal meat during the event
---
Except everyone is saying that this time around the event is great.
---
Is there a way to get the plans now that the vault is closed?
---
I’ve seen in the PTS it’s in foundation for GN
---
Why? You can fast travel directly to the event from anywhere
---
Haha fair enough. So is it end game loot (end game as in finishing wastelanders)?
---
Yes. With gold
---
Yep. We’ve been delayed for the second time (4th overall) to early next week.
---
Challenge accepted.
---
* At least I now have some additional papers to put my inventory that I can potentially use later or sell on my vendor. 
---
* At least you had the opportunity to take a look at my camp - most people just buy stuff from the vendor and then fast travel. 
---
* At least it made you feel better to drop off those notes. So ultimately, the act resulted in a net positive outcome.
---
See? Glass half full :)
---
Every hour their is an event called graham cookout up by vault 76. Their is a grill and a giant cauldron at the event. Once the event starts and the initial timer clocks down you can put 15 of those on the grill. Each 5 awards 5 scrips I believe.
---
Is that specific items that I get or should I be saving gold scrap rn?
---
It’s been delayed to early next week. This is their 4th overall delay and 2nd console delay just for this one thing.
---
And BTW If you have a spare one I will gladly buy it for even 30k caps in first dates of September
---
Yeah a standard Wendigo colossus has almost nothing to do with a colossal problem.
---
I've got a map shot

Buddy of mine once got an Assassin's Powered Sentinel heavy combat armor chest piece from the sbq. What'd i get from that same fight? 1* junkies rolling pin. Following fight, he gets something almost as good. I get a 1* nocturnal 10mm smg
---
Smdh...lol
---
Yep. It's good if you want to do a lot of silo runs. You can buy it from the white springs bunker if you got rid of it by mistake, though.
---
Not gold scrap. Gold bullion. Just play the main questlines. You’ll figure it out.
---
its been very solid for me on PC all day.. Ive played several sessions spread throughout the day
---
Update: It’s been delayed AGAIN to early next week. 4th total delay. Link https://bethesda.net/community/topic/424802/update-on-hotfix-timing-for-consoles
---
No, people in other threads have gotten this bug with no regen effects at all.
---
Used atoms to buy the last two levels. Cost 300 atoms. Final reward coughs up 500 so I got 200 on return for it. The fireplace door is cool but doesn’t work on prefab structures, which I pretty much only use now because it makes it easy to move my camps. I don’t run power armor so I don’t care about the dark matter skin. The planetarium light is neat and would probably cost 300 atoms alone if it were in the atom shop. I got a stein and a poster too... there’s no fanfare. There’s no sense of accomplishment whether you buy or grind.
---
Ya. I barely ever have issues but right now I am
---
Yo what did any of this mean
---
Cool cool. Thanks for the help! I’m looking forward to seeing what happens! I was just wondering if I should be investing in modules/steel with my legendary script or try my luck on weapon/armor rolls
---
Has gramm disappeared for anyone else? Been gone for 2 hours now multiple server hops
---
Why September tho
---
Head into the Ash Heap and you should get the mission to save him, might need to be close to the location, not sure, so just head towards the Rock Hound workshop and that should be close enough to prompt it.
---
I would definitely joinn
---
I’ve been having issues the last 2 hours seeing gramm the event starts and everyone shows up but I didn’t get any rewards. Seeing if this second hour goes better
---
Where is the Formal Complaint from?
---
It’s a public event that happens at 5:00/6:00 etc every hour. Go to the main fires in the middle of the event and turn the meat in for script. Then shoot critters to turn in “meat chunks’ at the shopping cart and harvest “greens” to turn in to the cooler. Put out the fires, clean up “chally piles” play the drums or turn a meat spit.
---

---
Yes we should all just work around all of the bugs in this game instead of complaining about them and trying to get them fixed. When will we learn.
---
Exactly. You'll be able to buy plans with bullion, which you get by turning in treasury notes. Those are earned by completing public events (events with an exclamation mark), faction dailies (foundation and crater), or completing "riding shotgun" ( a repeatable event if you hop servers and no one has done it in the past hour). Be ready for an arduous grind..sorry, I forgot about being five...You're gonna do a lot of the same poop over and over...😋
---
Activate the handle on the right side of the spit.
---
Edit: Reread ur comment. The spot where you turn in the prime meats is NOT the spit that needs to be turned. The spits are on an elevated platform opposite the drum barrels.
---
I'm at 97 and I have missed a good amount of score. I don't care about finishing. The rewards were bland and few were worth getting.
---
I ment in general, you build your hopes up to high.. you gunna get let down. Case in point, the reason for his post. He was a good boy all year and waited with anticipation on Christmas night for Santa, only to find Ol Saint Nick given it to Mom through the crack in his parents doorway.
---
Up to 15 total
---
Honestly that's the video I was referencing
---
Not at all. You can find PA all over when you need it. I carried around a set “just in case” for a long time. Only used it in nuke zones. Go through the settler quest line and get the stealth suit for high Rad areas and you’ll never need PA, especially on a sniper.
---
Oh so you already watched it?
---
I'm joining in to your world now, so it seems to be up and running! Still gotta eat dinner, so I'll be doing the Meat Cook run and heading off after that, for at least a bit. But I'll definitely jump in and participate whenever I'm able. Thanks again for the help!
---
700GB remaining. There's PLENTY of space for this crap, yet it always fails. Every. Single. Update. I'm just done with it at this point.
---
Between the failed updates, constant crashes/issues and the utter lack of any end content... feck it, other shit to be played out there.
---
It just works
---
Always been there for me.  In fact I’m looking at him right now on my game.
---
That's amazing.  Fallout76 for whatever reason has the best player base of any online game and I have been online gaming since it was possible to online game through dialup
---
I love all you guys, you make the game great
---
No problem, yeah I just got back and set it up a few minutes ago, I hope around until I find a good server, hopefully this is one
---
Todd Howard here, we at Bethesda hope you are enjoying our new server consolidation initiative. In order to ensure positive investor feedback, we have redirected players to other server regions not currently in high use. We hope the community embraces this new streamlined service, as it will allow us to deliver the same fallout experience for a majority of our users. This is Todd Howard signing out and i hope to see you in the Atomic Wastelands^(tm) soon.
---
Thank you
---
I do 200 a piece and they fly
---
Yeah, a few weeks ago because I was curious about them mainly because it reminded me of the suits in the Sierra Madre
---
YOU are what makes this game great and it seems like everyone I meet is just like you.  
---
Thanks man
---
Lol! I’m pretty sure I still have them. Haven’t been playing 76 much lately. I won’t be on until tomorrow night,around 6pm PST. If I still have them you can gladly have them for free ☺️
---
This would make them truly unique. Unfortunately bethesda prefers to just slap on different legendary effects and a name. Awesome sketches tho mate
---
For sure man! I really appreciate it, I've been looking a bunch for them. Thank you for actually responding too lol. Send me a message whenever you're ready, gt is same as username, but I'm pretty sure I added you already lol.
---
Dude, is your PSN the same as your Reddit username? Then I think I was at your first cook out
---
OK cool thanks!

Each has their own location, and Grahm is in a singular spot.
---
Prime meat goes to the stew/hanging meat near where Grahm often stands, chunks in the cart of meat, greens in the cooler and feed into the hay.
---
Sounds like a plan!! I’ll shoot you a msg when I hop on tomorrow evening
---
Todd Howard here, we at Bethesda would love to redirect you to the subsidiary branch of our corporate offices. There you will be redirected to our customer support division of our consumer relations services. From there You will be redirected to the interactive media section of our support center, fill out the forms provided and wait 4-6 business weeks for a representative to review your complaint. This is Todd Howard signing out and i hope to see you in the Atomic Wastelands^(tm) soon.
---
The board itself is all new. You should be able to find it online called "Armor Ace". 
---
Some items will be available to get via gold bullion (like the ammo converter, chicken coop, lunchboxes, etc.) Other things (probably cosmetics) will end up in the shop. Maybe.
---
He goes on constantly now saying "***Great***. At least it's a nice day."
---
Alright man, I'm available whenever! I'll also probably still give you caps for them because I have like 10k that I've hoarded for like my entire playthrough and don't know what to spend on lol.
---
I can't deposit my prime cuts at the yao guai spitroast, am I doing something wrong? Its just lootable like a regular creature.
---
Press F to p... I mean on PC press F to lock anything that's lockable.
---
Unyielding armor will still be very useful for QOL reasons even after the nerf, specifically because of everything you mentioned. Not sure why you would need to stop using it. It's not like unyielding only benefits you if you're bloody.
---
so tuff
---
Good call

The playlist has actually shrunk over time because some of the licenses have expired.

Dinamites? Too dangerous. Gonna kill all yourselves if I let you touch it. Better to leave it buried - safer that way.
---
It's a rudimentary script pressing space bar over and over - it gets them into games repeatedly without any user input, slowly gaining XP.
---
He told me he was going out to get some smokes.  Sure is taking a while if I'm being honest.
---
Ok but are they crapping our right NOW? I need to know cause our internet’s been weird
---
Personally i want a new radio host. This girl sucks. I know the timeline wouldnt allow it but give me the guy from Fallout 4. "Choice Chops! We have meat... Just meat. Dont ask for anything else"
---
I did it for the perk card packs, free bullion and scrip. Makes it easiest to build a new character.
---
This doesn't mean anything and wasn't worth a post.
---
Use it or lose it
---
How sweet would it be if they did?
---
[EXPLOSIVES 25] I know my way around dinamites.
---
That’s a big oof
---
I'm heavily, and I mean heavily invested in the low health build on my main. If it's nerfed so hard that it's no longer worth it I'll just retire the character.
---
I would love that, then maybe they would actually shoot the scorched that are 5 feet in front of them at my camp. (Only kind of joking, this problem has gotten better over time at least for me and with the addition of spotlights near turrets)
---
You know what I liked in New Vegas? all the different ammo types, especially with shotguns, want a shell that sets shit on fire? sure!
---
That would be awesome.
---
What's the difference between them both? And is this the build that requires the majority of your health bar to be rads affected?
---
I love this. I have a group of friends that I play with that are some of the kindest, most helpful people you can come across. We've been lucky enough to meet people that are really sweet and make the game fun. Like any game, there can be bad apples but I would say the good far outweighs the bad. Thank you for sharing this.
---
I cannot for the life of me deposit my prime cuts. The yao guai doesn't give the option to deposit them, am I just missing something obvious here?
---
Todd Howard here, we at Bethesda are sorry that you feel that your Fallout first subscription did not live up to your expectations. We understand that there will be frustration and anger over certain features in progress, but rest assured that we working towards improving our investor satisfaction. Currently we are working on overhauling the atomic shop as well as introducing quality of life improvements in payment methods. This is Todd Howard signing out and i hope to see you in the Atomic Wastelands^(tm) soon.
---
where do you get that coat i literally need it
---
It can finish real fast. Like the best way to win it to play hard. Best be there before the hour if you don’t want to miss it

All my characters are commies but I never bump into any others!
---
The event will most likely run again as a reward in September too
---
I had this problem in the Forest Region a couple times, but not anywhere else. Small sample size though.
---
No max amount, but if you have enough people there when the event starts and they deliver the items really quick, I've seen the event complete in a few minutes a couple times today
---
so...i gonna fire up my private server then...
---
I just want one. I found a laser rifle on a character I use to store good weapons and armor that I was about scrap for materials. I couldn't understand why a non-legendary was saved but the damage was pretty high. I asked around and was told it was a Nuclear Winter laser rifle and it was glitched. I don't necessarily like energy weapons because I like a stealth attack with a suppressed weapon and laser rifles give your location away, just like explosive weapons. Is it worth anything? Could it be an equal trade for the Bloodied FF Fixer?
---
Bloodied is the build where you want rads, the damage numbers are crazy, but can be a glass cannon build if not done properly. 
---
Berserker is playing the game with as close to 0 DR as possible to get a marginal damage boost. 
---
Junkies is taking enough chems to get 5 addictions to get a 50% damage boost. 
---
Anti Armor doesn't require anything special outside of having an anti armor weapon, lowers the enemies DR rather than buffing your damage.  
---
Instigating does double damage on the first shot if your target is at full health, so good for a sneaky rifleman. 
---
Furious does more damage for consecutive shots on the same target, good for a commando and vats.
---
Same was distracted by meat week

---
I always jump on drums this event, the bar slowly depletes but if you have three players on drums and maybe one on a cooking spit, the bar won’t deplete and that lets other players do the other things to keep the bar rising. Never losing progress but always gaining it.
---
(And having all three drums going sounds pretty banging. Perfect music for a cookout.)
---
Idk I mine failed but I'll go regardless for the crickets and acid
---
I do.
---
I recently converted to bloodied/unyielding, mainly out of curiosity, and because a full UNY set basically fell into my lap from the purveyor (including two pieces with poison resist, which I'm told is pretty valuable).
---
The difference it makes is so outrageous that it honestly feels like cheating.
---
Before, I could certainly kill things. But some enemies were a bit bullet-spongy at times, - and to be fair, so was I, - at full health I never died.  
---
But bullet-spongy enemies plus being bullet-spongy yourself just got boring after a while. Now I'm on the brink of death at all times and I can actually kill things quickly, the game is way more fun.
---
Just my luck though, I change my build like this and they decide to nerf it all in the very next patch, lol.
---
Then why is it also happening on pvt servers with no tents?
---
And Nuclear Winter challenges. Still wickedly unbalanced and not fun, the entire gamemode is basically hiding until near the end, then getting curbstomped by full teams.
---
EDIT: Not to mention basically every lobby chooses Morgantown
---
Yeah I miss a lot of the lapsed songs. Luckily there’s zero reason to hear the game at all so I just run music over it anyway.
---
well, as long as the other account knows the plan of making it. Items should be transferable or allow to be sold on vendors.
---
You will receive treasury notes as rewards, these are traded for script at gold machines in crater and foundation. All after you finish wastelanders of course
---

Could it be an equal trade for the Bloodied FF Fixer? I don't care about explosive weapons and a 2* Bloodied FF would suffice.
---
The explosive weapons are fun, but their durability is absolute trash. I can break my mini nuke mrv in one shot sometimes. It feels bad.

Not in the game yet. You can try them out on the public test server if your on pc.
---
Do you know anyone with a spare?
---
Meat Week
---
Sorry i edited my comment as i see how it could of been misread. To clarify i was backing you up not having a go.  I'm always there to have fun and help.
---
How do you get primal meat? I kill primal mobs , loot their meat but it doesn't count.  Is it just a chance for it to drop?
---
LMAO! If you insist 😂 but I certainly don’t require anything. I’ll see ya tomorrow night!
---
You need to be in a private team, not a public one.
---
I was thinking the same but honestly I’m just here for the quick notes
---
Yup, cya then lol
---
Hi folks, I have added both od Ur IDs. Not sure if you have seen the requests
---
You already know I’m busting out an angry fist emote when someone runs on my yard...
---
Dont think they go live till sept 1st
---
r/Onision is anti-Onision.
---
r/OnisionIsMassiveChad is the pro-Onision subreddit.
---
Damn it’s been so long since I played FO3 and NV I completely forgot about this enemy... That would make a good raid boss.
---
What does playing the drums do for it?
---
IMO if you’re not going to be a regular PA user then the only power armor you will need it the excavator PA. It has 100lbs of extra carry weight and if you add calibrated shocks you get another 100lbs. Its great for farming supplies and it gets you out of overencumbered situations.
---
Bad fps and crashes are normal for f76,  if you have these problems on a different game then it might be your internet.
---
I also didn't see any script awarded, just get the meat sweats or whatever the buff is. Is it being rewarded and I just don't see it happen?
---
I didn’t know I was causing this until I read these posts but I drop my tent in most events for the loot drops, as it’s convenient to quickly break it down. Also fun to hop on top for an elevation advantage. I’ve stopped doing it for this event, but that’s why I and I assume most people that do it. There’s going to be a ton of people that are members that don’t use Reddit or are going to be oblivious to this. Doesn’t mean it’s intentional, I’d just send them a kind message and let them know.
---
I'm more interested in guns that fill in niches the current arsenal misses: like, we don't need another 5.56 assault rifle, especially while the Assault Rifle has no advantage over the Handmade Rifle. But there's room for a .308 AR in the game, or an SMG that uses .38 rounds. For pistols, a revolver with an integrally suppressed barrel would be a cool option for stealth builds. And speaking of revolvers, a revolver shotgun would be cool too. For heavy guns, a heavy sniper like the Bozar would be awesome; or they could just add scope mods to the LMG.
---
Naw, if you’re dressed as Chally you need cargo!
---
My PUNK is the naked one. Seriously, LGBT+ should get why. Upset about shoe stores, is a punk, and doesn't have time for kisses.
---
Plus creatures be glitchy, kill one in VATS and it heals full health again.
---
How do I make a private team? I'm kinda new to fo76
---
Contributes to the activity meter.
---
I think it’s all about the build, there are damage boost cards for certain weapons did you have this applied? the grenade launcher is meta I would say.
---
Again play nuclear winter if you don't want vats. It's not considered cheating because everyone has the ability to use it. It's not like players introduced it themselves. Sure you don't use vats.Then again you're probably too busy roleplaying a "photomode expert" to actually play the game.
---
Man it would be amazing to have someone like you working with the devs. Despite being a fantasy world, it would be incredible to see that level of thought put into the game. Especially being based on real life locations. Thanks for taking the time to write that.
---
Exactly!
---
We should definitely make a discord
---
That would be awesome
---
When you’re level 6 there’s not much room for a build. Yet another example of why it sucks, people who play it more have a massive advantage over people who don’t.
---
Thats what I thought too, but space doesnt do that, its 'E' or the enter key, neither of which trigger jumping.
---
Five runs. One failed, challys full outfit and mask, challys backpack and Stein. So, four decent, one fail.
---
First don’t be on a public team. Then find their name in your friends list and click on on. Choose ‘invite to team’.
---
Same issue for me as well. I have Fallout 1st but this bundle is nowhere in the shop.
---
Naw I'm another dude and on xbox lol
---
Read that last sentence again and think about it for a moment.
---
&gt; people who play it more have a massive advantage over people who don’t.
---
Can you name me a game where that isn’t true?
---
Thank you for the reminder, I couldn't remember how I got the fasnacht one in the display
---
Funny you say that, since I just exited out of another crash at the Primal Cuts Ash Heap event, again!
---
The default SS Underarmor IS Black though.
---
While you are unable to add a mod to the camp underarmor, a black version is already in the game by purchasing it at Vault 79.
---
Where - my meat gonna spoil soon - lol. He’s only near vault 76 at the top of the hour? If I want to be there when it starts go where near vault 76. My meeeaaaat
---
I'm only getting prime meat as a reward?
---
Russian roulette
---
I assume you’re saying I should play it more to get that advantage. Why would I? Why slog through the mud and get my ass handed to me constantly to maybe someday be good at a gamemode I don’t even like? The only reason I play it is for the Score; if I wanted a battle royale, I’d go play Fortnite or something. 
---
So case in point, the gamemode is unbalanced and hands massive advantages to higher level players that results in casual players disliking the mode. You basically admitted it’s unbalanced, so.
---
What?
---
Pm me!!!!
---
It’s designed not to be fair with the perk system and it’s got the smallest line of sights ever. A guy will be 100 feet away from you and the game just won’t render him. There’s also limited running so mobility is trash unless you have frog legs. It’s like 10 minutes between matches etc. this is the most embarrassing br I know of
---
Yeah I think the only prefabs that haven’t been broken were the log cabin and the Red rocket garage lol.
---
I remember when the steel bungalow didn’t have collision so it was basically a floor with fake walls
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Yeah. At least on PC, everyone heads to Sunnytop when the event is over.
---
Sunnytop Station is the new Watoga Station.
---
So any good ideas that we can leave for camps we absolutely love?
---
It's my first rodeo :(
---
I'll be playing the drums from here on out BONGO TIME!
---
In apex everyone has access to the same loot and abilities not specifically tied to characters.
---
I remember when sitting in a corner/bush was called “camping” and was considered one of the lowest playstyles in FPS. 
---
Now there’s an entire gamemode for it.
---
Excellent summation. You'd think with there being literal fireworks rewarded, that there would be some fireworks at the end of the thing, but no, nothing. Not a bang, but a whimper.
---
To be there before the hour I go to vault 76 and then go where?
---
Define them as you like, I just set up the foundation. if I had to define them it would be  people who try to nuke somebodies camp for no reason, exploit some type of glitch to annoy players, keeps on killing others or being hostile to them etc.
---
If ots the machine by the lift in Foundation, or inside at Crater, thats supposed to be there.
---
It also cancels if I get hit at all
---
Bless you, random citizen
---
And they actively encourage it with all the different ghillie suits and general camouflage plaguing the screen and the way xp is given
---
I'm definitely going to use it as a loading screen, great shot
---
"Wholesome community." sure.
---
Gonna try this tonight... on a "clean" server
---
We call that a feature
---
This is pretty much the only correct answer.
---
Actually never been griefed before, I just thought it would be pretty cool to see a world filled with griefers
---
I scoured for far too long for a .308 combat rifle plan only to find out it isn't a thing. It sucks because the combat rifle shares a big resemblance to an M1A/M14. Frankly my current build would love a gun like this.
---
Lol people have begged for some of these for so long.
---
We're getting another one late September
---
It is fixed already on PTS, so **Soon™**
---
I mean, you can buy notes with gold bars
---
This character walked into Grahams cookout tonight.  A glitch obviously but it looks like an alien!
---
tought it was me, but i am not, it has something to do with the items spawning outside bags on the floor. Remember the bug where u could see the legendary items on the ground but cant take them? same happening here. Also, if you are in a butcher event and drop a non full fusion core to the ground you get instant disconect
---
Sometimes, but if you grind the event properly, you can get it!
---
You don't get the prime cuts from the actual creatures, so you don't have to kill anything to get them as long as you are there and the event is successful,and if the high levels wait the event will time out for sure. There is barely enough time to finish it if you don't hand enough people there to help.
---
https://screentimes.net/content/images/2020/04/mythicquestshovel.gif
---
Move your view slightly to the right or left. You can also aim at the cauldron to the right of the bear!
---
Right, I hate when an even is successful. 🤣
---
Well, you're led to believe that there would be something. "Race Zorbo to the finish!" Those are story elements, like there should be a climax to the season, even...much like television, a finale. Instead, you don't get the last scene of the story, you don't get any kind of resolution to why you needed to beat Zorbo to the end of the Run, you get nothing. 
---
In addition to that, there's something that I found a bit annoying, having played a great deal of board games, when you hit the 'last space' in a board game, you don't have to sit on that space and 'earn' the space, that's it, it's the end of the game, you won. But, not with this, you sit on that last space and have to earn the space. It's a poorly executed board-game, poorly executed 'story' - the least that they could've done was to add some of the fireworks that you're rewarded with, or some kind of fanfare to the end.
---
I've done it like 6 times and all failed it's so annoying
---
Great advice will do. This needs more upvotes.
---
Pretty sure the atomic shop version is a clean version
---
When it comes out on console in December I’m going for it
---
Ummm.. He literally stands there and says what you need to do. I've never done it,  and all I did was listrn to him. It's not that hard.
---
I just want my camp radio to stay on after server hopping or restarting the game. Or stay off, if I want.
---
For me, it's a stupid settler just standing there.
---
Mine is “baby” and she makes it to lvl 5 then is ~reborn~
---
Another event happens every hour where you use the meat to get the actual valuable rewards
---
That had to cost a lot of budget
---
If you own the chassis drop it then put all the parts on.  After that it’s just a matter of you letting it be auto-recalled to your inventory and boom!
---
Yes I get that part.
---
I'm saying if you give up on reviving people, I won't give up on reviving you.
---
But I’ve never played Apex before.  So I’ll be just as good as everyone else and no one will have a significant advantage over me.
---
Why is this such a big deal.
---
[How to Meat Week!](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ide6m1/psa_meet_week_for_those_that_have_never_done_it/)
---
Thank you for volunteering! ❤️
---
Why even give a time frame? Just say we’re having issues we’ll get it out asap. We’re sorry here’s 500 atoms free or some shit. Ppl keep getting hyped just to get let down over and over and now ppl are starting to not even care.
---
I didn’t admit it’s unbalanced. 
---
I said that someone that plays a game more will have a big advantage over someone that doesn’t. 
---
Just knowing the spawns for loot bags is a big advantage.
---
No...skill advantage is always going to happen but other other players being able to jump higher than you means they can attack you from ways you can’t and is inherently unfair as it’s not them using any skill to do so they just happen to have the perk and you don’t until the game decides you get it. Also this is the only br people load in at different times so the area you spawn in on is likely to be already looted
---
As long as you’re not being as ass while we carry u then it’s all good
---
Everyone who sees this should post a link to this post on Twitter and # tag to all fallout tags and also Discord. So it can get more upvotes.
---
I do the door skips because this game has robbed me of so much of my time through bugs and disconnects that it is my way of taking some of that time back. Doing silos is not fun at all imo.
---
Pay it forward when the opportunity arises.
---
Isn't that old Longfellows coat?
---
Change your ini files under the pipboy to 1.000 for the 3 color options. You'll get a white pipboy in game and its a real life saver to have a white light.
---
Every smart ass like you dont think about people with 5 characters over lvl 100, ding fucking ding
---
Say what you will but that floor with fake walls was a treasure to me. Dunno what it was about it but I just loved how you could just hop right in from just about any angle and shit.
---
Yes, unlike all the meaningful content posted all day every day.
---
The challenge is satisfying but yeah, they're bastards.
---
Turn right, run past the bus and down the road and then left at the checkpoint. Basically southwest of the vault.
---
Same server. Over the course of about two hours.
---
When his event pops up at the top of every hour, he will be a very short distance Southwest of Vault 76.
---
Silos are not fun. They are a key to the fun.
---
Everything about this comment is really sus, straight down to the profile, this is the first time the account has done anything in over 240 days.
---
It’s a server wide event. It’s simple to contribute to, and the effort to press a button rather than just exist in the space is not difficult. At level 2, right out of the vault it is enough to push toward it succeeding.
---
Oh ok. Haven't played in awhile.
---
I've played the event probably close to 50 times and still haven't gotten it. That's why I'd rather just buy it at this point.
---
Funnily enough, the Fixer plan was easier to get than this.
---
I don't, but I have run into it. To me, the silo is part of the game. I'm not a speed runner. To others, they just wanna launch a nuke so bad. I've seen a guy drop anuke, do scorched earth, drop another, do the event, drop another. The whole thing (3x scorched earth)  took like an hour
---
It also happens at the same time, every hour on the hour, so it’s predictable too.
---
Yes, but the fusion core is still half empty now. And with the firework mine glitch, all mutations and their perks, it aint exactly easy to do that.
---
They dupe with any exploit, how the fuck it related to suffering of all players. I dont give a fuck about duped weapons, i dont buy them. Just mark bullion or other items marked as *account bind*.
---
The mental strain from shooting down the nukes over Vegas put House into a coma for 61 years. Dude is asleep in his tower right now in the lore.
---
Barrel McBarrelface
---
I understand the system, however I’ve noticed it doesn’t happen while you’re in an event. Maybe extend the event until 30sec after you’ve exited the mine? If you die during that grace period you don’t drop any junk.
---
Oh thank God it's not just me that's see something's like that now
---
I was a little worries
---
No but they teleport
---
If the robots gave full XP per kill i would totally do the silo the right way.
---
The silos are a joke, rather u skip doors or not. No one, on any platform, does the silos properly anyways.
---
Even with the perks it's still easy to catch if you're paying attention. Could also remove the firework mine to slow things down.
---
I want it how do u get it and if someone has it I’ll give u 15k caps for it coz I fkn love chally the moo moo
---
Techinically he's in the game 👀

APPALACHIAN MUSIC. MORE COUNTRY. MORE SONGS OF THE OPEN RANGE. 40s SWING AND DC ACCENTS IN MY APPALACHIA? NO
---
That's fine, im just trying to keep people out of one area and was curious. Thanks
---
Is Colossal Problem live on consoles as well now?
---
Thanks, Ran in circles and found it! Didn’t show as event on map but I’ve done my first cook out
---
Easy... breathe... repeat after me, ‘goosfraba’...

We do not know when they are going live.

---
This happened to me when some mole rats decided not to come out.
---
You can buy perks in NW. I have a level 6 character that has Frog Legs. 
---
As far as ‘load time lag’, that’s client side, not server side.
---
I read that the meatpiles were causing lag and this was a solution that only helped a bit
---
Yea, but i usually end up pressing the wrong arrow and open the fav menu in my panic. This is manageable, but really annoying,
---
As for the mine, the 50 cal and mg40 take a bit to reload.
---
I was honestly just ranting since it happened to me as i was launching a nuke and it made me die, so i went to reddit lol
---
Hm, alright. Well idea crushed. Still would be fun battling these guys again.
---
Same here, happened couple times during the event too...
---
Even my escavator is 10lbs or so less than my deep pocketed armor and modded backpack
---
How do you glitch it I was at one today but didn’t know how they did it
---
It is similiar but idk if related and its a bitch when im using my 50 cal and i randomly reload out of nowhere.
---
Space bar can be used to hit enter on the game mode screen. So the script is normally:
---
return
---
afk:
---
Send {Space DOWN}
---
Sleep 100
---
Send {Space UP}
---
Sleep 1000
---
Send {Z DOWN}
---
Send {Z UP}
---
With Z being needed to hit to exit the game once dead.
---
BGS suits sitting around a table:  "...and then we'll make sure the daily quests never let them finish the legendary run.  We'll tell them it's a bug!"
---
&lt;sound of evil laughter&gt;
---
You have to put a survival tent on the road in a certain spot which I'm not sure to glitch the spawns.
---
I can pick specific perks I want to buy? I’ve only seen where I’ve been able to open packs at random(and rushed) and just I get whatever the game spits at me. And every other br has some form of pregame lobby where everyone loads in and then the match starts. NW kinda has that buts it’s completely pointless as it doesn’t do that at all.
---
Hard to pin down what is grieving and what is just playing the game.
---
I actually found it hilarious when I was in my house and a guy walked in and dropped off a gift then walked out and closed my door behind him.
---
There is no “fun” when it comes to launching a nuke. The silos are the exact same every time. I mean granted they only take like 15-20 minutes without glitches. It’s still a waste of time and annoying to repeat over and over every time you wanna drop a nuke.
---
Buy them. I’m annoyed with the grinding and have purchased around 14 ranks in the last few weeks.  I think the next season will be the same.  I may not even bother.
---
Also the clean version that holds drinks is an atom shop version, in case that is what you hadn't seen.

Nuclear Winter isn't based primarily on pvp its a pve battle royale that rewards you for surviving the elements and animals and yes other players. The closet game I've played that similar to it is Darwin's Project, where you have to survive the elements more so than just trying to kill everyone to be the last one alive as in that game not being able to find a fire on a ice map will kill you from hypothermia just as fast if not faster then facing another player which I quite enjoy compared to games like fortnite and Apex where is based on nothing but pure PVP elements.
---
I dont think any of us higher level people really care.🙂 I know I dont, just do what ya can and stay out of the way and youre good.👍
---
Not even the last night's storm could wake you...
---
Ok. My phone is being stupid. Cant delete cant edit, so I’m sorry😂
---
And I have absolutely no idea why it keeps duplicating my damn comment and changing it. Keyboard goes down and then I start again and it doubles it. Any help would be alpreciated....
---
Lol you on Xbox I’ll do it for 6k
---
I've had something similar. The event quest starts, shows in the top right, I cash in some critter meat to move the needle, then the quest in the top right disappears. I jump on a drum to see if the event is still up, see the Grahm character ping to prove the event is up, still nothing in the top right quest area, nor on the map anymore. I stayed on the drum, while seeing others gather. Then the event fails. Probably saw about 5-7 people so I'm surprised to get the failure notice, but without the top right progress bar I can't know if it's a real failure or a bugged one!
---
Noooooooooooo I’m on PS4
---
is good man thanks
---
all i do is shoot a few enemies with my hunting rifle and stimpak anyone who gets downed
---
noted
---
It says it on the pop-up at the start of the event. Each time. Please read it.
---
I skip the laser grids and take a shortcut through locked doors for a couple of reasons.
---
I don't enjoy the silo run and the xp for killing robots it's more or less 0.
---
And I don't always have 45 mins just to launch a nuke to gain access to the content the other side of it.
---
I think once you've ran the silos once properly you should gain access to a special key that let's you skip right to the launch prep so the run is intentionally 10 mins max long.
---
People don’t realize that the damage from bloodied isn’t even the biggest benefit of a bloodied build. Unyielding armor is the biggest chest code in this game. Having 15+ to every single SPECIAL is kind of cheesy. You can sprint way longer, carry a lot more, do more melee damage, pick locks/hack terminals easier, more AP for VATs, faster critical fill, more XP gain, and a few other things of course. I personally don’t think unyielding armor belongs in this game. It’s a huge advantage that isn’t properly balanced with the downside.
---
👍 But yeah, just do what ya can hoss. We were all in the ***exact*** same place at one point.
---
OK if you asking for it, gladly gonna help you with downvotes 😁 (taunt activated)
---
you get it as a reward for completeing primal cuts
---
Yes.
---
Meat week event
---
I love the "..." one considering a lot of weird stuff happens in-game, so instead of using the ??? one you just simply ...
---
You'll find is a creature hiding behind a tree or wandered off near the edges,  [u/ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/ladydevann/)
---
My understanding is that if you or your team wins, you receive some amount of Overseer Tickets. Said tickets can be exchanged for perks within the perk menu for varying amounts; some perks are worth 1 ticket, some can be worth up to 10
---
Random drop from completing the Meat Cookout event. Just have to cross your fingers and complete a lot of cookouts.
---
Do I just do the get the meat part or the every hour help gram mission
---
Hmmm...I'll have to give it a shot.
---
Realistic terms in nuclear lazer pew pew everywhere GAME, got it. Games meant to bring joy, but bethesda wants us to suffer it seems
---
I'll help with one part of your rant.
---
Stick Dense on your chest and use the perk fireproof (I think it's called)
---
I sacrificed some perk points and my ultra light chest for these and I can now, literally...... Stand on top of cars exploding and take zero damage. Same for robots etc I am invincible to explosions as far as I am aware. 
---
And the Scorch beast sonic attack also does nothing to me too it seems.
---
50-200 depending on how rare. I kept my masks as they didn't bring them all back the next year and it's fun to show up with a mask that you can't even get, and my rares are in a display in my house.
---
Every hour part has a 9.09% drop rate so theoretically it should drop 1 in 10 but dont count on that
---
You never rank up pick lock perks.... You have to quip 1 2 or 3 of them as required for the lock.
---
Edit: unless you mean you've selected the same version you already had? In which case.... Yes that's silly.
---
Being in p.a shouldn’t matter. I can repair the pipe and turn the wheel during the event  Feed the People at mama dolche’s.
---
    P.a is also broken trying to use The ammo converter. It makes you kneel too far, and you can’t see the computer screen.
---
I've been doing this when I finish my score for the day but still want to keep playing
---
Ok thanks but do I have to have to get to a certain part cuz ik theirs like chicken ham and sum other thing?
---
The Ellipsis reminds me of the still loading bar. It could be useful with all the bugs in-game. Like when it takes a day for the loot to appear on The Dead Queen. lol
---
But so is prime cuts its kinda stupid
---
No the whole group has to complete the event its given as a reward if the event is completed no matter how much or little you do during the event. Its justnluck of you get it or not
---
Everyone hears Unyielding and thinks bloodied, when infact the Unyielding effect is (to me) far more useful than the damage my bloodied weapons do.
---
I'll still be using my same armor after the patch and no doubt the same weapons.
---
i didn’t mean it by that, i meant it because you guys think that two separate characters can have the exact knowledge as each other, plus it does make sense for all the “nuclear lazar pew pew” because this is way into the future, jesus i feel like 85% of this sub don’t have common sense when they complain
---
and how the hell do they want us to suffer, just because you actually have to play the game doesn’t mean they want you to suffer
---
I thought this post was sarcasm until I saw the picture the man is a legend
---
good point!
---
After unlocking the plan I was disappointed to see it’s just a barrel and some rope, I was hoping for cow pattern print or like a plush Chally on it or something
---
I think it is because the player base are single players from earlier Beth games.
---
There's also water by mama dolces and around that side of Morgantown that has spots deep enough to hide, as you still have to stop in the circle
---
Are they not, in your experience?
---
The tenderizer plan works the same as the fixer plan so no worries.
---
Tell me this joke because currently I don’t understand how those two things relate
---
With an optimized build and buffs it's not a problem to level up in less than half an hour even at lvl 600+ (I'm at 640 atm). Moreso next season we will most likely have lunchboxes sold for gold boullion (it is so on pts right now) and level 100 mobs everywhere, which will yield even more xp for almost the same low effort as current highest level trash mob does.
---
When’s it end?
---
Got any recommended videos or printed guides on speed running silos? I always thought they took an hour if you don't know what to do, 30 mins if you do.
---
No they actually buffed them for some reason
---
I don' know what he means by lag but I know you can play Apex always above 60FPS but in NW you cannot unless you have a computer valued at more than $700.
---
Congrats!  That’s a great roll!
---
Don’t let that go from your hands unless you decide you want a legacy weapon or equivalent.
---
Yeah youre right but I was thinking something less legendary dependent, we dont have skills on the game so having this option for normal stuff would be nice and that one guy was right, theres no taunt mechanic in this game to control aggro.
---
Just south of Vault 76 every hour on the hour is Grahms Cookout, get there quick cause it can finish fast and deposit your meat in the center fire pit. Grahms Cookout is the main event of meat week where you can unlock special items at the end at random like we did with Fasnacht
---
They are already nerfed in that they break WAY too quickly, making their use limited to specific situations instead of being the default weapon.
---
Yea I selected the same one again (the base version for 1) not knowing any better since I am a new player. I thought it works like other perk cards and I can just rank them up. They should say it doesn't work that way.
---
cant seem to find graham in the event, did 2 event already but cant seem to find him. server jump and still no graham but the cow was there? i went to the event place near vault76
---
They meant leaving only the weekly one and switching the daily with something else that requires less effort, I guess.
---
I agree the draw distance is shit. Yet some players know how to increase it through ini hacks. I can be sniped from 300 units away but if you look at where they are shooting from the building or whatever they are on isn't rendered properly and you can't see them, only their red carrot.
---
*Okay, these ad bots are getting sneaky.*
---
IIRC, Fred’s is an electronics store up in Canada. That’s just a bit creepy.
---
You have no common sense, when bring realistic terms to a game, where ANYTHING is possible. To much mobile shit in this game, daily caps and scrip, not being able to transfer item between characters on the same account. And about plans, if remember well, there is several THOUSANDS of plans, isn't it to much, in your opinion? This game is unfriendly to alts, end of discussion (i didn't downvote you in the end btw, just trolling)
---
How so?
---
I slept in it and my head clipped through my headboard. Like all I could see was shoulders and down on my bed
---
Yep, that would come in handy a lot
---
"The only things they did better than us is suck and die!"
---
Lol today i got a "you have been insulted". Like if I will lose sleep because someone didn't like MY camp. I found that and say "thanks for the toilet paper"
---
Are you talking about the ghillie skins from the Legendary Run?
---
Yeah it's a poor system unfortunately, you'll only do it once though. So I guess no real harm done.
---
I run it normally.
---
But that's because I hate intentionally breaking games.  It just takes the fun out of it and removes me from the experience.
---
Iunno.  Blah.
---
This is the proper way to be carried. 
---
Feel free to use whatever gun you want and shoot all the enemies, as long as it's not a gun that's graphically spammy like chain firing mini nukes xd
---
It often will spawn if someone is near the high school. I've had it spawn while farming plastic
---
Let me know if you are successful 👍
---
Not fallout 76 at least
---
Well specifically one you could get as a reward in nw before the season started
---
Yea, it just sucks and I wanted to vent/ make sure that I did just waste a perk
---
That's allowed?
---
Robots exploding had a sound effect in the other games.
---
It's broken in this game unless they're alive and limbless.  If they just fixed it I would have like 85% fewer deaths.
---
Also, legendary robots seem to -always- explode, if that helps a little.  But without the sound effect there's no way to know which of the normal ones will.  It does need to be fixed.
---
Not sure what u are on about mate. I can easily put 200 (400 if im only doing automatic) rounds through my BE laser. Considering each round does ~1200 damage without having to sneak and at any range that is not bad at all.
---
I don't mean to piss on your fixer.. As it is a nice one. But in reality 33% vats hits major effect is not as good as many people think. It doesn't add 33% to your hit chance directly. Meaning 50% hit chance doesn't jump to 83%. But instead it increases the hit chance you already have by that 33%, meaning if you had 10% it would become 13%. If you had 50% it would become 66%. So it is not that good. Especially since as a rifleman/commando you already have very high perception which increases you hit chance. And most likely concentrated fire, which gives you 95% hit chance in couple hits/misses. 25% faster fire rate, explosive or even limb damage would be better.
---
EDIT: And to all you downvoters i say this. Please go ahead and try it out. It has been tested over and over again since launch. Craft a non-legendary version of the weapon you have with 33% hit chance, go in vats and target some immobile like a turret. Move back until you have some specific hit chance like 10%. Use the weapon without 33% hit chance and then swap to the one that has it. And you will see how the hit chance actually changes.
---
EDIT2: here is some pictures as a proof   [https://imgur.com/a/K3qo91I](https://imgur.com/a/K3qo91I)
---
It's just running a bunch of background stuff to own your computer down.  I don't think they would he able to know.  I don't use it, just heard of others.
---
Which you got by playing a *lot*. 
---
And to be honest, you can Bush Wookiee exceptionally well without that. I’ve had people come within a meter of me and not realize I’m there. I’ve even had someone bump into me. Select your darkest possible clothes on the Atomic Shop, find some nice thick brush, and crouch down. 
---
Using the Ghillie Suit also means you can’t equip armor at all, which makes you very vulnerable if you do get spotted. 
---
It’s not the best BR but it has its quirks. Once you learn them, you can do pretty well.
---
Play the meet week event. It's not too hard to get.
---
Regs, a fellow so nicknamed due to his love of rules and regulations.
---
i honestly don’t see the point of alt characters
---
You can change the color at the armor bench from urban to forest if thats what you mean.  It wont exactly say the color but it will change it
---
Can you provide any more detail? Location/situation, etc.
---
lol good luck doing it solo
---
Works well for me...
---
Tips to being a good medic: Anyone on your team that has too much red needs you to take all the anti rad perks you can and share them. Lol
---
Nope not missing anything. Some people are just Ass Hats! Plain and simple...
---
Meaning as does it help with the event or not? I’m pretty sure they shoot off as intended
---
if you finish it real fast you can server hop and often catch the end of another one
---
Need the “your the dumbass” note from Sludgeworks.
---
It could be the beam splitter, but my JE laser gets about 40 shots before breaking (after an Improved Repair Kit), and the TSE laser gets maybe 20. All non-auto. Might be extra damage from the explosions with my maxed out Demo Expert? Not sure how they calculate "breakage", but I'd like to know if there's something I can do to fix that.
---
Looking at the wikia, only 1* are given
---
They do? It says max rank at the bottom...
---
You only get 1\*'s from this event
---
Its usually the guy that didnt kill any ghouls
---
I have 2 of em and can't merge them together to rank up
---
I freeze about every 3rd Primal Cuts event and have to dashboard.
---
I would love the songs of New Vegas!
---
Right!! I also got the plan. And was super excited for a baby Chally only to get a lame barrel. 😒 I mean, I  get it. Ur supposed to wear the moo moo outfit with it and replicate Chally. But I wanted it to wear it other outfits too dang it. 😭 Also, I expected when I got the dirty verson of the outfit, that it would be tattered like the Mr Fuzzy. But it's just a slightly dimmer pink version of the atomic shop outfit. Ugh.
---
Mods, have a look at which ones give you greater durability. I also get hundreds of shots before breaking my BE Laser.
---
&gt;and if they said they fixed it there's a 50/50 chance it's still a problem.
---
I laughed at this because its true. Then I got sad because its true.
---
Both lazy, greedy and evil? ;-)
---
Pretty much. we got an extra as a community event reward I believe and another repeat as a dev apology for a disastrous patch iirc, so three times in a fairly short span. We'll be getting it twice this year if we hit the stretch goal.
---
well its more for turning in the meat.  you def cant do it solo
---
Grahms begins the event after 1 or 2 minutes of wait. If you quick travel to the place as soon as you see the pop-up, you will be ok. Just plan ahead and do not begin an event right before the top of the hour.
---
No no 'they do' as in they do tell you it can't rank up. Before taking lvl 1 lockpick again the card says max rank
---
It's definitely gotten worse lately. The night stalker used to spawn closer and everyone stayed in the bar, now it marks them on your map at the fence and the ass hats run for the marked target and one shot it almost every time.
---
While it does get repeated by every single player, I think the idea is that the enclave was crippled and cut off until YOU came along and provided critical help to re-establish conact with kovac-muldoon. 
---
I agree its I'll defined, but it doesnt make sense that everyone restored the comms system over and over. That only happened once, when you did it. 
---
Note that in this odd reality everyone thinks they did it and no one else did.
---
Would someone like to hint what this skip entails
---
It certainly could be a great one but just like the base game the engine limitations hurt it.
---
[Cameron Mitchell said it best](https://youtu.be/77acOyoT-d8)
---
I am a DM and avid TTRPG'er. I've put a lot of effort into making immersive and realistic camps.
---
I tried it out with my two shot faster shooting Cryolator.  Not bad. You don't seem to get the frozen look but he seemed slower.
---
I pretty sure u being a minority in that case, people like to test other build, but tiny stash space and current perk system didn't allow that much, or u create jack of all trades, master of none
---
Thank you for your reply!
---
Same for me 4 times today. Do not fast travel to the event location. Drop in nearby and hoof it in. Hopefully that will work.
---
Either be heavy weapons or sneak melee depending on your agility. If those 2 aren't your style then it would be faster for you to start over if you want rifles
---
if people just played the game without builds or anything, i’m pretty sure everybody would enjoy the game much more because they won’t have to go through the stress of finding the right weapons and unlocking perks
---
I told you not to eat that canned dog food, Bob! I warned you!
---
First off, sorry for the hostility in my comment. Was a bit pissed off at other reasons and it “leaked out” on to you. Second, try using a forceful stock that should bump you to ~80 and then ~120 at full 100% additional repair. Also, in general, guns with a higher numerical fire rate seen in stats list for some reason degrade slower, much slower when actually automatically firing. So add automatic barrel on it. Only issue is single shots have a bit of delay to it because of the nature of automatic lasers in fallout operating by a rotating barrel, but you’ll get used to it easily.
---
Yeah, it's quite strange for some of them to not be implemented at all, even though they've been around since launch.
---
Why not play some call of duty then????? Just pick a gun and pew pew.  Its an RPG you know, fps rpg
---
I would settle for just getting rid of the beach boys 🙄
---
Another reason not to nuke dead on: please stop blowing  up my camp please im begging
---
At the residents' home, I just sent it to the house. I turned on the machine and found that there were gold bar notes in the box on the right, which could be purchased
---
Kinda missing the point. This, like fifa has a game which isn’t about playing other people. Where u can become very very good. You then have a mode like NW or on Fifa the legend team bit where u can be far more skilled than your opposition but they’ve played that mode to death and have weapons and armour perks that make your skills redundant. In Fifa it’s players being faster stronger better ability to hit the target etc. It’s a nonsense and for people like me who want to play and learn how to play alone and not jump straight into vs modes without a clue it’s a system which activity discourages me playing. Played a few NW with the score and more often then not I get the drop on a player. Flank them and get the first shots in. And lose because their build makes any skill advantage I may have utterly pointless .
---
I believe its one of the worst boss fights ive ever played in a video game, it feels like its balanced for modded weapons. Instead of making a smart ai and an interesting fight, they just made him a massive bullet sponge that even 10 high level players in their 300's run out of ammo fighting, and they made him deal lots of damage with annoying "scare the players away" scream that takes away control from the player. The little windigos that spawn all around are just more crap to spend ammo and stimpacks fighting. It makes no sense how an enemy half my level can one hit kill me, and sometimes they do. on top of that its a timed mission in which you get NOTHING if you fail, which really burns if you spent 3000 caps worth of ammo during the fight. If you think this is a good fight, you probably have not ever played any other rpg or fallout game in your life. I can see why people cheat and mod guns or use trainers or exploits in this game, this game is just a horrible grind with little to no story to it. The only time ive succeded in this mission was when we had a few players using questionable guns, like a minigun with a jacked up looking model that shoots like a shotgun blast of exploding rounds at like 100 rounds per second and even they took a few minutes to kill the guy, thats why i said it feels like its balanced for modded weapons. And when you do succeed you get little chance to loot anything unless you spam grab everything you can and run out before everything collapses, the only thing that makes it worth attempting if there are alot of players doing it, is the 8 bullion tickets you get. Other then that, waste of time. Even then, its much easier just to do 4 any other events to get the same amount of bullion.
---
Only solution is if you’re in the event area you just get the drop in your inventory. Sure people will abuse this but idc legendary enemies are a joke to kill.
---
Ideal: NONE. I already seeing people nuking queen again, taking less time and you not gonna suffer from loading screen occasional errors. But 150-250 screws per boss is nice for sure, sadly only cursed pickaxe is fine, i wish there was cursed handmade or fixer, or any cursed heavy gun
---
There are a lot of factors involved there.  Just getting the ‘flank’ on someone doesn’t give you an insurmountable advantage. 
---
Want to get your build up the way you want it?  Keep playing, *just like they did*.
---
Going to country house for 2 weeks. Want to spend some time outside of town, and i missed fishing so much
---
Well, it does indicate that there were members of the enclave who had a hand in creating the scorchbeasts. However, Modus tells us that the original members of the enclave had disagreements regarding 'vision' and that resulted in their downfall. Perhaps this was what Modus was referring to? Maybe the rest of the enclave did not want the scorchbeasts to be created? Maybe Modus (with his super creepy smile) is actually the 'good guy'?
---
No need to be rude lol I'm asking a question. Im aware but I couldn't find where it goes
---
If legendary loot worked like destiny where you get it regardless if you loot it it would fix like 90% of the loot problems.
---
Isn’t there always a window in which you can buyback anything? Notes included
---
If there are enough high lvs for some reason i find the wendigo sometimes has lower health than the legendary ghouls, that might be one reason.
---
I mean there are jerks, but waiting for that whole event to snipe one legendary when there are better ways to get them doesnt make sense for most scenarios. 
---
I think many times are probably accidents from trigger happy people who are blasting at ghouls running at them.
---
Not I, did about 11 times today so pretty much it started.  I have gotten the Brahmin grill, Chally outfit and hat, several of the Tenderizer mods, a Tenderizer itself, but no plan for it yet. Just need that and the Chally backpack and I have everything on one character.
---
I missed those days when everyone stayed in the bar haha. Nowadays if I notice someone leave the bar to be a jerk, I leave the bar too. There's no point to stay
---
It is what it is. If it’s not someone’s cup of tea, they shouldn’t play it. There’s no need to play it just for the SCORE. You can miss at least 15% of the challenges and still finish the season at Rank 100. And that’s before factoring in the bonus weekends and the repeatable XP.
---
To receive minimal exp because I can’t beat them even if I have the drop and a decent weapon and armour because their perk loadout negates my damage and buffs theirs to the point of 1-2 shotting me?  Nah that’s not fun at all. If it was like fortnite where u just play and it’s based on luck of finding a great weapon and the skills to use it and survive. Then it’s fun. NW is like a lightweight fighting a heavyweight in boxing. No matter how good u are they advantages are just to huge to overcome
---
My B3325 fixer gets used way more than my 2525. I don’t think this is true. I think it actually gives you a 33% increased vats chance. Haven’t compared the actually display numbers. I’ll test this out soon though. Still shouldn’t crap on dudes parade, this is a great fixer. 
---
If 33 vats is still broken, it’s excellent.
---
Glad to hear it!
---
Anything that incentivizes you to constantly create and delete new characters to accomplish is fucking stupid.
---
whoa, if this is true you just saved me so many trips to Deathclaw Island.
---
and of course when i go to test this is one of the few times the shovel is still there.....
---
But it's not mine
---
Mothman hates fireflies, you are doing his bidding!
---
You don’t get most of your XP in NW from kills. You get it from surviving. 
---
This isn’t the BR for you. So don’t play it. 
---
Problem solved. No one is going to be bothered by you choosing not to play NW. None of us will get our feelings hurt if you choose to play something else. 
---
Don’t play something you don’t enjoy or you’re not good at. That’s just ridiculous.
---
Thanks! I just got it to work finally on the third one.
---
I think both times I showed up right as it ended, and I thought you could just deposit them at anytime.
---
Ok now strawmanning. We’re FORCED into playing a mode we have little interest in because of the huge advantages leveled against us. So we ply to get the score. So don’t bitch that players aren’t helping log out. Don’t do anything. Don’t play as a team. We’re just there for the score.
---
Oof, yeah I noticed this too on my sneak build. Not working. Definitely ammo consuming. Sheepsquatch on my casual heavy guy took two cores from his gatling laser to take down, was surprised by that. Seems they buffed hp a touch on meat week sheepsquatch.
---
Genuinely unhappy about this. With every single event, everyone just rushes the legendary leaving nothing for the rest. 
---
Honestly, if people wants to be an asshole and one shot legendaries . I don't think I want to hold back for the rest of the event or any event even.
---
upvoted.
---
The travelling Robot vendor.  He has spawn points, Charleston station is one.  Run across the bridge than run back and it'll spawn something.  About 5% of the time it's the vendor, (I'm pulling that number out of my ass).  There's  a chance he'll have the coat.  Google it - there's lots of info.
---
(Also, if you're with someone and he doesn't have it you can get buddy to hold him in the trading menu, you leave the world and rejoin and it spawns new inventory.)
---
Good luck.
---
All my characters eventually got the coat.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
I'm not crapping on it. I said it is a nice weapon. But there is so much misinformation floating around since wastelanders hit that someone needs to guide these newer players. You can see all the proof you need on the imgur link i provided. And feel free to test it out yourself.
---
Haha I know the pain dude, learned that the hard way on beta
---
Definitely need the teabag and poo emojis.
---
What are they telling the new guys?
---
Legit forgot I could scrip my legendaries at train stations until just now... I’ve been traveling down to the ash heap for... I don’t want to say. Smh.
---
I remember this being a bug last year too
---
I'm still stuck on this
---
It’s not bloodied being nerfed. How many times do people have to say it. It’s ALL builds damage output that’s being reduced. Bloodied and low health builds will still be the meta. And your shotgunner will also be nerfed so instead of 1-2 shots it’s gonna take u 2-4.
---
exact same issue. did you find a workaround?
---
You’re not forced to play for SCORE. NW challenges account for less than 7% of all available score. You can miss at least 15% of the standard SCORE and still complete the season. And that’s not counting the double SCORE weekends or the repeatable weekly and double XP weekends. 
---
Trust me, you can complete the ENTIRE SEASON and never set foot in NW. My wife doesn’t really like to play that mode and has only done maybe two of the challenges and she’s only two ranks behind me. She’s on 91 and I’m on 93. 
---
Stop thinking you ***have*** to play that mode. 
---
**You don’t.**
---
Is this only for pc or ? Is it on other platforms as well
---
Hooray! Hope you had fun!
---
I don't even own a Fat Man, but I would if it wasn't useless.   Hell, the Auto Grenade Launcher is even better than the Fat Man.  And don't get me started on the hapless broadsider.
---
I'm putting my bet on that your not getting downvoted for your data, but that you commented it on a post that isnt about nor needs your findings
---
This is about OP's luck on getting a pretty fantastic weapon. Even if 33 isnt as useful as its made out to be, it's still a spectacular weapon that has a high value on it.
---
There is no reason you had to comment this, at all. Not the time or place. OP didnt ask, no other user asked.
---
"Event End: The final Meat-Cook event will take place at 12:00 p.m. ET on August 26." :D
---
That's me at every Camp I visit
---
Much appreciated, know any websites or links for the drop rates?
---
It's okay. She's not here you can drop the act..... ;)
---
It's not wrong, I've lost 3 in a month that I knew personally. :(
---
Of course you can jetpack while you are sleeping!
---
Haven't you ever watched a dog when they are sleeping? They tend to start moving their legs as if they are running in their dreams. You are doing the same thing except you are using your jetpack because you are too lazy to run!
---
I do a jetpack/dense on chest and deep pockets/ultralight on my limbs. Carry weight/ap is handy. Nothing worse than running out of ap when In melee mode and going between mobs
---
This. Bloodied and unyielding synergies because of low hp requirement so it makes sense to use bloodied weapon along with unyielding armour pieces. It will still be the meta after the PTS nerf/balance/changes. 
---
But I think that vampire might see more use for low hp builds.
---
call of duty and fallout aren’t the same
---
There's a large fire in the middle of the event. Should have meat on it, part slow cooker too. Hover over the grill part and it should give you the option to turn in 5 prime for some scrip
---
I drop it on their bed
---
This kind of has been the thing since I first started playing one violent night, I normally just stand outside on the roof and tag the legendaries as they funnel through the doorways
---
Because dickheads.  I wish we had a slap vote.  More than 50% of the players in the area vote to slap someone, they drop their junk and move at .01% speed for 1 minute.
---
I literally just bought it 2 days ago and after trying to fix it for a couple hours, I gave up and it just ruined it for me. This is the entire reason I never bought it, but of course I buy it anyways and its still too buggy to play.
---
Yes u can. If u play every day and don’t get the glitch. And use the repeatable a lot. That’s not an argument. To gain score every day there’s a NW quest. Mission. Whatever. People, especially on the build a camp 3 times. Log in. Build 3 camps. And either hide and do nothing. Log out.  The majority of posts say the same thing as yourself. Bitching and moaning about people not helping out in nw. I’m trying to explain why. It’s not a fun mode because of the huge disadvantages low levels face. Regardless of skill set. I’m almost level 300 in the adventure mode. I have very little issue dealing with anything in the game. I’m adept at free aiming. Yet I can’t win because even if I find a top end weapon and combat armour. I die to a guy with a  bow because he’s spent 3 months just playing that mode. Discouraged from playing, which I would if it was even remotely fair
---
Was the reward and primal cuts always 1 star legendaries? I could have sworn they used to be 3 star...
---
Or at least the daily one.
---
The 3 a week is doable for me at 270+ but every day is rough.  Makes the game feel like a job and no one wants that.
---
The forums are gutter trash. So many people who don't know how to hold the controller.
---
I... do not believe they ever did.
---
No he’s not
---
The whole explosive weapon category needs a buff
---
They already have some big downsides, for barley any damage output or general DPS
---
This happens all of the time at Uranium Fever.  Best plan is to be on a team with people who are at the event.  As long as one of your team members gets a shot and you are close enough you can loot the body.
---
The main reasons for all of the one-shots and quick kills are:  a) There was a dupe exploit that went viral and a lot of legacy (i.e. explosive laser and plasma) and god tier (Bloodied/Junkies 25/25) weapons got released into the wild.  b) There is a glitch in the game were "magic" weapons can melt everything.   c) some players are selfish jerks who never learned how to share.
---
Mine is G.
---
Deletion is faster that way(PS4).
---
I turned in 5 and didn’t get any scrip lol. Just the bonus of not having food decay
---
Fucking hell i would pay all my existing atoms for teabag emote, it looks hilarious
---
Place the chassis, don't drop it.
---
Dropping removes your "ownership"
---
Huh, I did 3 this morning and I don't recall seeing any spit, is it close to the drum? Also do u only need to do the drum to start the waves or does it help to continue to beat on it through out?
---
That's cool... I deliberately put the Slocum Joe's "Have a Good Day" sign and the thumbs up Vault Boy statue facing my little 'diner' so it'd be the first thing a player sees when they step out the door to leave, it's not much but hopefully some people notice and it makes them smile.  Stuff like this is really great.  :)
---
Xbox keyboard doesn’t like to load the keyboard to delete half the time anyways 🙃
---
Sure you found what you were looking for but just incase - [Great Video about the Cookout from last Year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kfEji_i7NY)
---
So I'm confused. You will quit if the weapons damage is nerfed and enemies buffed. Yet you continously restart the game, with a low level, no HP, no good weapons. For the fun of it all. For the challenge. 
---
Bethesda is doing to you what you have been doing to yourself all along and you want to quit. Seems you would love this.
---
Yeah lemme just go put ultralight on my ss limb pieces oh wait..........
---
Or dont touch the lights just because you can.
---
If it is one of the level 5's with a range of 701, it's worth a lot.  Not sure if you can trade for a fixer, but it is possible if you find the right person.
---
You are wisest to travel to the vault and make your way to the event area shortly before the event, so you are there when it actually starts. 
---
This event can finish very quickly if it goes well, so you can miss it if you hesitate to join from elsewhere and have to factor the fast travel loading time.
---
The large fire is at the main event that happens every hour right by Vault 76. Called: Grahm's Meat Cook
---
Only need to hit the barrel once to start the prime creature waves. Subsequent drumming has no effect as far as I'm aware
---
Not using legendary weapons and armor and creating your build = same as some kind of call of duty.
---
Not me I'm almost level 200 and have seen him maybe 4 times.
---
They don’t need a nerf, they need the bug fixed.
---
You need forceful stock.
---
Ok i feel like you are stupid, just because you don’t have a build doesn’t mean you can’t use any legendary things, i have my entire inventory of legendary shit but don’t have a build, so stop wherever you are going with this
---
Is this a new event like where you have to nuke the town to get into the underground mine ?
---
Or he knew exactly what he was doing and did it anyway...hubby and I have run into a few of those players lately. 
---
But I’d rather think along your lines, too...we all make mistakes. I’ve been saying for a long time we needed an ‘oops’ emote- glad it’s here finally!
---
Seems like Bethesda is hitting sneak and bloodied builds hard with future content. You won’t even be able to sneak in the daily ops
---
Yes and no. The weapons. All weapons. Are not being nerfed. No prefixes are being nerfed. It’s the way damage perks stack that’s being changed so depending on your build and how many multipliers and what multipliers u have will dictate how much of a damage nerf you’ll take.
---
In the lower level go to the north side of the cave
---
You're right! The primal spawn point near the top of the world has them lost and spawning every where, leading to splitting up and running around to try to tag. Last time the mobbing was great.
---
When you launch as many as some of us do, there’s no fun at all in taking the scenic route. As much buggy shit that we have to deal with, I’m taking full advantage of any glitch that benefits me time wise.
---
And then you swap it out for nukagirl posters....
---
Well I mean if u ever wanna give any extras to me I'm on xbox and I might be able to get some caps 4 u
---
The helmet gives almost nothing the bodysuit doesn't appear at the scap window for me (which I love, so I don't accidentally scrap it)
---
Thanks for helping the rest of us out OP
---
You can do that on the drums, so you can still help out.
---
Around 36 degrees Celsius. I’ve done my research.
---
Ok. So. 1.  It’s not finished and there’s a dbl weekend coming up so why would u buy the last ten levels now?  2.  If the skins etc don’t work. Why would u buy the last ten levels?  3.  If your not going to play very much so don’t complete the daily’s or weeklys. why would u care about cosmetics and why would u buy levels?  The ONLY reason to buy tiers is it’s the last day of score. Your desperate to have .....insert tier reward....and u buy whatever tiers u need to achieve that.
---
Like i said two times already it is a nice weapon. The reason for my comment was to inform newer player(s) that the effect does not work like alot of the players seem to think it does. Nothing wrong with that. If you feel like i was attacking OP somehow then i really suggest you take a long look at my comment again.
---
I stayed on the drums for 2 hours today and took a nap. 
---
The rewards in my inventory were trash, but at least I helped!
---
Yeah I guess what I mean is will that multiplier fix that bug where the splitter makes the explosive effect ridiculous
---
Its a Combat Rifle at its core. Scrap those to get the mods!
---
I tend to enjoy watching some guy with a rifle just plinking away at mobs of high level baddies.  I'll let him get as many shots in as possible and then I'll kill the enemies if they begin to overwhelm him.
---
Props to the low levels with no fear.
---
What. This is how building is in 76. You can't just put down thing when theirs a 2nd floor above lol. Gotta do things in steps like furnish the 1st floor and then move to the next floor. If you don't then this happens.
---
Find graham at the cookout
---
I wouldn’t think so. If u had no perks and used the plasma gat/rifle before and after the nerf I don’t think you would see any difference at all. It’s the way the damage multipliers stack via the perk system not the actual weapon that’s changing
---
Also Reginald Stone
---
As in Reginald S
---
Reg S
---
Regs
---
It's been out for days, and I dont think people are going to stop doing it anytime soon. You'll get one!
---
Holy crap thanks! If I buy combat rifle plans will it go to my fixer?? And I just bought a lever action plan, if I make level 45 lever actions and scrap them can I upgrade my level 45? Or can I craft a low level one and still get the mod I need? Thanks bro
---
Never had this problem before and I've had stuff there in the past this just started tonight and it's only in this area I can place stuff down anywhere else under my second floor
---
I wonder if it’s considered cannibalism
---
Better than not having it though
---
Stealth Pistoleer feels man. Even fully built with 'good' gear I'm at best a cheerleader in the tougher events on my main. That said, there are other ways to contribute; get people up if they go down, do the repairs if something breaks in an event, and if the enemy somehow decides you look yummy kite it around so the heavies can go to town.
---
I’ve had to make ammo twice today
---
I am sorry that happened to you. It really sucks when you have a bad night like that. 
---
My first experience with the collosus: We fought him for 25min during which I used up around 2000+ ammo and repaired two weapons 3 times. In the end, we brought him down to 2% health before the timer expired and we failed. To top things off, I died in the end and got the bug where I had to respawn at vault 76 and ended up dropping my loot in the nuked area. Fortunately, another player was nice enough to stand on top the dropped loot to hide it from other players until I returned. This was very frustrating to me. I actually told myself that I would never fight that boss again...
---
However, that turned out to be a lie, I fought him a couple more times since then and have done alot better. So it worked out in the end - but that initial experience really pissed me off.
---
Usually if they do this they're targeting someone that's standing on something out of reach for the Prime Beasts so they run away. Survival Tent or the raider scrap tower next to the steel drum to start the event.
---
Of course.
---
Meanwhile at my camp I hung the “did you forget to take your meds” poster next to my market
---
I'm rank 92 currently, I check the atomic shop first thing every day I play before joining a server, and so far I've never been hit by the autocomplete bug.
---
I skip everything I can.  Once you've run the silo hundreds of times, the appeal of fixing pipes and mainframe cores dims considerably.  Can I easily do it the hard way?  sure.  But, I just want to launch the nuke and move along.
---
This.
---
I didn't know you could do this. How is it done? Xan I learn it as a mod or do I have to find plans or buy them?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/idcq6o/meat_week_2020_reward_list_datamined/
---
Since it doesn't affect anyone at all this will be removed with the next hotfix.
---
U can’t upgrade a level of a weapon but u can learn mods. Make and scrap combat rifles for the fixer  and you’ll get the mods for it, better receivers for more damage. Better barrel for more accuracy and range. Silencer. Larger magazine etc etc. Same for the lever.  Get plan. Make levers. Scrap for the mods. You’ll see a counter I think too right telling u how many u know. 2/41.
---
Is meat week active?
---
Thank you so much!
---
I have 33% Vats hit lever gun and it’s like never miss
---
I have 5 people on my server who have been akfing for hours on the drums and spits. 
---
The event completes pretty fast.
---
Is that happening on the test servers? I’ll quit playing. It’s my go to play style for all fallout or even elder scrolls
---
It’s a bbq cookout that pops up every hour (on the hour) just south of vault 76.
---
Building near the wayward was buggy for me in the past.  I was able to place my camp in a spot one time, then on subsequent tries it would not let me (in the exact same spot).  Since then, I have elected not to build there.  It's a lot easier to focus on things I can control than to get mad about things out of my control.
---
I honestly just hit the areas with a bunch of scorched. Wavy Willards and the Tyler county fairgroundsbare close to my base and usually supply a decent amount.
---
It's okay, the Random Number God will rise again.
---
Come my brothers and sisters, let us pray and wait...
---
For an indeterminate amount of time.
---
:/
---
Is life pipe?
---
Pmed you my dude
---
This game is not difficult. Just like any game there's a learning curve. 1.2k hours in game and I feel like I've more than got my moneys worth out of it
---
It really does seem like this event goes excellently or it goes HORRIBLY. No inbetween lol
---
What is the reference(s)?
---
Oh no no no haha my bad I dint mean difficult in that way I meant the game was being difficult
---
I can VATS-snipe with my handmade, which has this effect. I cannot do the same thing with my Fixer, which doesn't have this effect. So I still find it beneficial.
---
That said, if you have a FFR and Concentrated Fire 3, you probably don't even need 33%VHC. Because after a couple of bullets (*quick* bullets, due to FFR) you have 95% hit chance anyway, although at the cost of using slightly more ammo.
---
" excuse my english.. It's my third language." 
---
Dude, you command the English language 1000% better than Donald Trump. I know it's not a very high bar but congrats anyway.
---
Thx :D
---
Well, if you see falloutwiki, there is all notes,holotapes and terminals that someone find during vault 94 raid. It's a really good story, tragic but one of the few experiments that went well! very well, except at the end, you'll see
---
It's cause of the stairs are too close to it. I've had this happen to me plenty of times and what I had to do in my case, my stairs was in the way so I had to build another staircase so the upper floor is still accessible and then remove the original, then remove the floor that was connected to the original staircase and then I could put down what I wanted near the staircase. After that I put the upper floor back and then the original staircase and remove the dummy staircase. It's alot of extra steps to put a rug beneath a staircase or anything under a staircase or even near it.
---
Thank you for this!
---
Do you mean at Foundation or at Vault 79?
---
Absolutely and correct.
---
LOL if he can one hit bash a lvl 90 or whatever it was legendary Yao Guai, I'm letting him have the legendary and calling him sir.
---
This seems to be a major factor. I'm going to mess around with the mods and test some more, would be nice to actually use it more often. Considering luck of the draw, but I'm drowning in Repair kits, so maybe not.
---
Ok thanks for that. The only thing that's confusing to me is that the stair case has always been there and ive had other things in the same area that work fine. You can even see a terminal right under the stairs in the video.
---
Foundation
---
Oh man thanks so much!!! I’m doing that right now!!! I’m so excited! I have a TS fixer and a INST lever I wanted to upgrade for the longest and didn’t know how! Appreciate you guys
---
Nobody knows more about English than Donald Trump. He’s got a tremendous grasp of the language. The Queen calls him for help with her speeches and people say, he’s not saying it, but people all around the world are saying it should be renamed the AmericanTrump. That’s what they’re saying.
---
It doesn't bother me that people are getting tons of ammo from this it bothers me that it lags the already potato servers into full on dog shit mode.
---
But why do you need to inform newer players on this post? OP is definitely not a newer player just by reading the first few words of the title and it's not like this post is popular (sorry OP, nice weapon though enjoy it). 
---
Why dont you post this or comment it somewhere where it makes sense and reaches the people it needs too? Because as you alluded to in your orginal comment: you are pissing on OP's fixer. A casual player that's just happy to get something good after a months grind, and your here just shitting on it. Saying it's not as useful/powerful/etc as it's made out to be. Which may or may not be true, but is not needed on this.
---
It's op on a shotgun, because all the little shots that usually miss the target actually hit in VATS and it does incredible damage, i oneshot pretty much anything
---
Oh and I didn’t mean upgrade the level I’m not sure what I tried to say there lol, thanks man!
---
You rock! Thank you again!
---
They weigh nothing, throw all that in your box and go through it sometime.
---
Op didnt ask but dude
---
this is a forum...wouldnt it be helpful to let someone know...hey not bad but you might want something slightly better?
---
This is an open forum  "there is no reason you had to comment this"
---
Yea there was....whats *your* reason for replying to him...they didnt ask for your commentary did they?
---
I'm down, gt Bl00dyMaria.
---
Even if they made it a world or combat challenge where you had to launch.. say 50 nukes to be awarded a master key, I'd love it.
---
One of Rose's quests is to go make friends with a deathclaw.  Try it.
---
Somewhere he has a very angry terminal entry whicb is a letter written to Hubris comics writers about continuity errors. Or something along those lines.
---
here here.
---
I was doing campfire tales...NOONE showed up...some finally appears at the end when im clearing the last mob...i use my weak .44 for shits n giggles since im alone.
---
I fire and hit the new player
---
He breaks out an explosive gat plasma
---
and im melted and they teabag
---
Get a fucking life
---
Dupers/Bought of Ebay weapons need to go for sure
---
You could always give them a nice 3* legendary or something or buy more of their stuff and then send them a note. I dunno how much it is worth, but I have had people put can of dog food for thousands of dollars to help out. Could try that as well. 
---
I gave a guy I was playing with who was trying to trade for a vampires something or other a 3* handmade to add to his trading pile.
---
A damn shame they didn’t make unique models. These are beautiful.
---
Sounds like that random encounter in F76 where two (broken) robots have a disjointed conversation.
---
I’d trade OP a B2525 fixer for the B3325 if he’s willing
---
So you can do a bit of magic. Am I supposed to be impressed?
---
Yeah, the new daily ops will have stealth disabled. You can still crouch, but it won't hide you from the enemies.
---
I don't like it either, but I get why they did it. With the right build, stealth becomes really cheesy and an easy way to beat otherwise tough encounters.  
---
Also, they added the stealth suit with Wastelanders, and that trivializes - among other things - the nuke silos, which were originally supposed to be a tough end-game dungeon crawl.
---
So yeah, I'm not surprised the devs want to try and rein that in a bit.
---
Cool, thanks for the info
---
Ooooo u little monster!
---
Well they were locked in a moist filled cave for 25 years so the rusty look whould even make sense.
---
Here is a little trick I've been doing to combat this problem.   When the event is about 75% finished I leave the bar and plant myself in the trailer across from it.  I load up my handmade with ok damage and then tag things just as they reach the door, that way I still get XP from the kills.  As the event is about to end I keep clicking the VATS button and as soon as the Wendigo spawns it locks and I can get a hit on it.  Gotta be quick though, there always seems to be some asshole eager to one shot it.
---
You're upset because you shot him and he killed you? Turn on pacifist mode, problem solved.
---
Yeah I could see that, I thought you put that there originally an the TV was a new addition to it. The upper floor pieces sometimes won't carry the bottom floor items up to it but the stairs could cause it cause they are super glitchy in every way possible. I've always built in layers so items don't automatically get posted to the next floor or even the roof. Had that happen a few times. Bed or chair disappears from 2nd floor once I put it down an it teleports to the roof. Delete the roof and I can put down stuff where they are supposed to be again.
---
True. I'm usually playing the mouth harp and get up when the lights go down, but even then it's usually too late
---
I believe the phrase "ignorance is bliss" should be thought when purchasing items from vendors
---
That's correct. This is an open forum where you can criticize, be criticized, and state your own opinions 
---
This commenter has his right to comment this, as long as it's related to fallout/76. As others have their right to criticize and or downvote. And same to our differing opinions on this thread
---
As for OP, his " :/ " comment pretty much shows his opinion on this. As long as my interpretation of emoticons is not jaded. I doubt OP cares, and I'm guessing the comment was more of annoyance for him as it seems like the commenter is just pissing on the fixer
---
Correct me if I'm wrong OP
---
If you toggle POV, that will address that bug
---
Shit his punctuation is perfect too "btw I had to Google voice punctuation just to spell it" dam I'm just a bad spellin poor gramarfacation havin hillabilly. One upvote do you how hard I had to fight auto correct to write that
---
I did like 12 Primal Cuts events tonight and only 1 failed in the way you are describing. We had like 2 minutes left and had killed the Alpha boss and all the other spawns but the event just timed out and we failed. All of my attempts at completing it solo, on a private server, were successful. It's a great feeling to one shot kill a Fog Crawler at a full sprint at full health and time it just right so that you kill it before it can attack you.
---
It’s not like I can take on encryptid or sbq on my own though. It’s not ridiculously overpowered. Kinda weak sauce if this is intentional.
---
Mines a J3325 sorry dawg
---
Yea i gave him some nice guns, few rifles, but I just still feel like shit
---
Uh no...im not "upset"
---
You know how events end right? When theres mobs spawning and all of a sudden theres crossfire?  i didnt shoot them...i shot an enemy near them and accidentally got them
---
Well AOE is a thing...so yea if i accidentally nick you AND you decide to switch to your legacy explosive and THEN teabag
---
yea youre an asshole
---
Im level 400 dude..i know about pacificst mode
---
edit: childish downvote  "durr problem solved"
---
Yeah no I built up the entire second floor first actually and this is the first time Ive had this issue. But thanks Ill try what you said
---
I can just imagine how many times I would trip or slip on those rugs irl.
---
A few points that may improve your outlook.
---
The negative effects of hunger and thirst are going away soon.
---
Repair of weapons and armor can be cheaper with the right perk cards. And "Fix it Good" and "Weapon Artisan" will let you double heal the item for the same material cost, effectively making repair costs even cheaper.  And scrap is *everywhere.*
---
If an enemy falls into the ground that you really want to loot, just wait a while and come back.  Usually within 5 minutes a meat pile will appear at the spot where the enemy fell into the ground.  You can subsequently loot it.   If you have trouble finding meat piles, you can turn off grass and there is a mod if you are interested that turns meat piles into bright blue mutagenic waste.  You can see it from a mile away.
---
I don't have a lot of trouble with lights, but I just use a different light if one of them is being a pain.  Things just tend not to attach well to roofs for whatever reason.  The black pedestal street lamps seem a good substitute.
---
Oops didn’t open it the whole way. If I had J2525 I’d still trade. And so will a lot of people.
---
I use a forceful stock on one character and a pistol grip on the other, huge difference, but even so you need weapon artisan 3 for both to be less annoying.
---
I can give u some of mine, I have 3, looking to down grade to 0
---
I tried reporting it but nothing has come of it.
---
Well, you can do that in Fallout 4 with a deathclaw cage and beta wave emitter...
---
It's failed twice tonight with seven or eight people all doing what we're supposed to do. Something is broken.
---
My +40% bash minigun with the shredder mod, while in nerd rage territory, one hit kills many enemies with bash damage. If I maxed out the bash damage perk card...it would be a bit ridiculous. Also, I should try running around with 0 ammo and just shredding stuff.
---
Really! Well hey thanks haha I wasn’t aware of those things
---
Nice
---
Well atleast you can do the opposite of that and let a deathclaw pet you.
---
Spoiler alert: he will pet you by sticking his largest claw in your asshole
---
Put a small rug under any camp object and then move the rug with the object attached to it to any spot you like. Let's you put stuff to many places you normally couldn't.
---
What do you mean by spits
---
Shout out for JerryKiller. He is the GOAT for getting me the helmet
---
Here's hoping they add that as a feature if they ever continue with the pets idea that leaked in the atomic shop
---
Just happy I could help!
---
You know... if ya put out fires and picked up poop, the bar wouldnt deplete as well.
---
I'll try it thanks
---
When I was low level I just waited for someone to get downed sprint as fast as I could to give a res and eagerly await the big thumbs up and if your lucky the occasional heart
---
Sometimes as a high-level character, not Super Saiyan optimized, but more than enough damage. I sit back when i see things getting handled if things aren't looking good i step in. The Prime Meat event, all these overpowered build players, just trying to kill everything flying from one end to the other, im just by the drum chilling until something approaches me or its the final kill, so far out of the 10+ times I've done the event we only fail once and that was because the event didn't trigger that the killed the final creature.
---
No problem
---
What he doesn’t know won’t hurt him. Enjoy your find.
---
I found a tattered field jacket in a machine for like 200 caps. I messaged the guy and asked him if he knew what it was, he didn’t. He said he got it from heart of the swamp or something, and that it was ugly 🤣. I told him it was rare, and I let him pick a few things from my inventory that he really wanted. I know I gave some rare stuff away early on without realizing what I had, so I feel like I’m taking advantage if I know something is rare and I don’t pay a fair price for it.
---
Imagine playing that event without using a magic weapon to win in 48 seconds.
---
reminds me of Karl Ruprect Kroenen, a villain from Hellboy
---
That's what happens if you don't contribute. Are you playing with high ping or server lag?
---
I just dont get why everyone is arguing over it, i just wanted to show mf’s i finally got a fixer drop
---
Only downside is that you can't get rid of the rug afterwards, so try to put the rug so it doesn't show too much from underneath. Or be ready to cover it with something, like a bigger rug.
---
Chally Milk
---
My philosophy on the whole run was spend no atoms on it. I only was interested in items up to the blood eagle paint. Anything else was a bonus (albeit a bonus I had no use or desire for). I'd just plod on and see how far I got.
---
If i got to the end of the run with the final 3 levels unfinished and no time to earn them then I spend the atoms to finish - thats just too close not to. 
---
If i got to the end with 10 levels to go? I probably would still buy it. But that is my limit. I wouldn't buy any more than 10 levels and I'd only buy that at the last minute.
---
So this travelling leather coat is very rare? Damn, I got one two days ago after completing the mission Irrational Fear and I scrapped it in order to get the "scrap 76 clothes" for 20 atoms. 🙃
---
Will do man thanks
---
It would be super helpful if the game didn't have me do all the work and instead actually remembered the setting across play sessions. As it is, I am only slightly less forgetful than the game itself...
---
I'll give you 50 for it.  Easy money.
---
He obviously didn't like it or he wouldn't have put it in the vendor.  If you hadn't bought it, someone else would have.  No harm done.  Next time, just leave a gift if you feel guilty.
---
Sorry OP
---
Cant really speak on anyone else's part but I should of just left it at the one comment
---
People just find a way to argue, and insert stuff that dont always make the most sense. Fuck man, look at all those weird kpop people on Twitter that just spam that stupid stuff
---
Congrats! That's an awesome combo. I use an instigating lever and cross bow with VATS effects and it's a monster. The stealth bonus the fixer has makes me jealous!
---
I really want to move my camp somewhere near there, but when it finally comes to Xbox I know people will always try to hit my camp even though it's out of the way.
---
They almost always did it with my whitespring, even though I was a decent amount south of good spots to get in the nuke.
---
Sure the person might be a jerk but you set yourself up for it. You play with that mode enabled you know the risk. It has nothing to do with which weapon they used.
---
People downvoting you I'm sure has more to do with your immature language and attitude then anything else.
---
I even used a phantom device in one and that didn’t put me back in sneak
---
Yeah before this i was using an I ffr fr lever and that was really fun.
---
Poor piñata
---
I wondered why there was the chimes going when I was sitting on the drums waiting!
---
Upvoted even though you forgot the /s that some seem to have needed.
---
Can I buy a combat rifle plan from a prevayor?
---
From train stations. Watoga usually has it
---
Craft and scrap the lowest level you can. This saves on materials. You will need a LOT, but you will get there. Combat rifle plans will only allow you to craft a combat rifle but the mods you learn can be applied to both the combat rifle and the Fixer. Confusing but, Bethesda. You can only craft higher levels of a gun if you are at or above the level as far as I remember. Welcome!
---
Message him or her and pay a fair price. It's the right thing to do
---
Till he reads this thread lmao.  I got a be combat shot gun the other day for 250.  Contemplated telling him still contemplating........
---
Nope. SS is not military.
---
If you don't think that is what the BOS would do, you must have little understanding of your faction.
---
Wow thanks man I would have never known this! I’m about to go see if that train station has the plan rn!!
---
I had a Bloatfly open a on me once.
---
This has happened to me multiple times on my private server no tent anywhere around, all enemies killed, yet the timer keeps on a ticking.
---
Why would behesda fix such a trademark *FEATURE*
---
Blueprint the single item you want under the stairs. It will place when done as a blueprint for some dumb reason.
---
Welcome and good luck!
---
Oh God yes like its so obvious this should have been done from the start. This goes for any game with a plethora of items for inventory management
---
Immature language...dude its reddit. who cares
---
attitude? dude ive been dropped legendaries for newbies free stuff out of my stash...gtfo outta here w that. Even what i comment on this sub is nothing but helpful shit
---
im replying to a "get rid of duped exp energy weapons" post and YOU replied to my comment.
---
and didnt understand it
---
"you play with those risks"
---
most people dont have pacifist on anymore becase this is a garbage pvp game because it isnt meant for it
---
read again
---
i did the entire event alone.
---
someone shows up after it ends as im spraying a mob
---
they in turn use a LEGACY weapon to melt me
---
yes it DOES matter which weapon they use
---
because if they used a POS non legendary weapon as i was using (also meaning they took ZERO damage at all) they wouldnt have one shotted me
---
also i was using emotes to say im sorry while im melted
---
sorry MY shit experience upsets YOU with how i explained it
---
also your reply added NOTHING of substance
---
edit: also dude its only us two in this thread...noone cares about this post
---
so youre the only one downvoting me
---
If you have trouble soloing these events, please share your build so we can help you.
---
I've had issue where the critters just run off so they're nowhere near the event area. thats usually what fails it for the groups I'm joining. Check your maps to see where the enemies are
---
Goodbye ammo
---
Old board is inaccessible on the PTS. It gets replaced by the new one.
---
I for one, welcome our new insect overlords
---
Playing since BETA, and I didn't know that. So thanks for the tip.
---
I got all 3 in a row at one point today, it is possible if unlikely. Triple dipped.
---
Explosive doubles the freeze rate
---
if not that, even if it just stood for "give me a damn second" would be nice
---
That's facts
---
Weapon damage perks are a blight upon this game
---
Asking the real questions here.
---
Question is, would you pay for this privilege? I imagine copyright for songs aren't cheap to maintain long term.
---
I'm unreasonably bothered by peoples houses just being a square box that floats off the side of a mountain.
---
Worth 50-74k caps, congrats
---
They're called "The Responders"
---
&gt;The reason why people don't talk about it openly on reddit is because the minute someone try to plead his case, he/she's instantly shamed, accused of being a liar, a cheater and so on,
---
I think part of the reason why this happens is because a lot of the time when people make posts about them being wrongfully banned, somewhere further down in the comments they end up admitting that they duped at some point.
---
Dang I can only find combat rifle mod plans! Not the plan for the combat rifle itself :/
---
- Cave Fungus Soup
---
- Glowing Fungus Soup
---
- Glowing Fungus Puree
---
- Silt Bean Puree
---
- Sweet Tato Stew
---
Most of the basic soups are shitty, you're better off going for bigger buffs. Herbivore will get more mileage off bigger buffs.
---
I had this today during a primal cuts event and couldn't even fast travel away before they would find me at spawn and kill me all over again. Absolutely unacceptable bug.
---
Funny enough I haven’t seen a single fire during meat week... Where do they happen?
---
Keep quiet about the magic!
---
Just bought that today!
---
They didn't hear you. They were afk...
---
I don't feel like promoting the use of bugs and exploits. This post was about the effect itself.
---
Make sure you are running a Pulse Capacitor Flamer Barrel mod loadout with BE Plasmagun.
---
Can't we just add like all the songs in every fallout game into 76?
---
Build mode is a fucking nightmare.
---
Not sure what platform you're on but I'm on PS4, had to go afk on the drums as I was getting ready to go to work, event worked fine for me
---
I'm just hoping it wont brick my TV
---
Other then what you did there is not much else to do. At least you paid him something. Did you tell him what it is worth for next time?
---
Seems since they added the grace period before the rads kick in when spawning into rad zones a few patches back even if you're dumped deep in the rad zone at the end of with no rad protection you can just run out and not take any rads, or just fast travel out.
---
I haven't downvoted one thing so save your tears for the next time you die to pvp.
---
Whoops, should've mentioned that, sorry. I'm on PC. I can see maybe why it'd cause issues using an event item for a long period but then again there's a ton of older threads too where no one seems to have encountered a problem.
---
I think NW would be better if people could pick perks cards when leveling up instead of receiving a random perk card. People would then be able to have a complete build by around level 8. This would allow newer players to enjoy the game more instead of being disadvantaged for a long time.
---
Apparently there used to be a way to earn perk cards in adventure mode, because when I started NW I had hundreds of cards to open; I had a good build from the start. I’ve recently started trying to level an alt, and it’s so much harder to kill people.
---
How.. how did you know? 
---
The clean double bed with a flat head board, I learned you could attach the sitting Nuka Girl wall deco(from the atom shop) to the head board so it looks like she's sitting on it.
---
Sorry for your loss man. Your best bet would be to make a support ticket and hope something good comes out if it
---
If you weren't able to find your Tesla its probably gone by now. I'd say check your stash box just in case, but I dont want to give you false hope
---
Lootbags are immune to physics.
---
Unless you're on PC and explicitly installed a physic enabled lootbag, this will never work
---
Love me some grog
---
I have had the best success when solo using a 1 star bloodied flamer and a melee weapon ( vampire prefix helps) 
---
And for fuel I have been exchanging 2mm EC ammo for fuel as it's so cheap in the ammo converter.
---
Atoms? That is bird brained.
---
Caps? Fine by me.
---
Honestly, I'd rather have proper text chat than spend 30m prepping my "message".
---
 I'll be 114. Stay off my lawn ya little mutant.
---
Fill it with nukashine and spread the *joy* to all who want a pint
---
Keep checking train stations and Whitespring vendors. Hop servers. You'll find it!
---
Oh it’s for sure sold at one of them if I look hard enough? I went to 3, I’m gonna hop the server and check some stations! Thanks again!

Perked autos will down someone in marine in a couple bullets or in half a second time wise.  Gauss is the same time and shots as autos so is even but has self damage potential although I think it’s reach is too long and it’s shooting speed should be toned down to a combat shotgun speed or pump speed, while 40mm is 2-3 shots unless meds and other buffs involved so a couple seconds at least usually.  Vats grenades should go away absolutely.  Perked QS is a 1 shot down in full marine for example with a good shot so faster than all.  
---
Gausses are not easy to find and rare ammo.  M79 is as rare as a 45 subby which isn’t rare but mildly challenging to find.
---
This is a tough area to balance which seems like the main reason it hasn’t been touched as otherwise it will just be everyone shooting autos which can get stale.
---
Melee should be perked more to make it much more a threat and useful build. 
---
Just add fire proof perk card to greatly reduce explosives damage at cost of a perk slot; that seems most fair to balance this whole situation while keeping gun play more interesting.  But yea vats nades needs to go away.
---
I mean they already have a list of high level variants of bugs in the game that they introduced in Vault 94: Washout quest. I'd be down for a giant underground bug nest, hell it could be a repeatable mission like the daily ops later down the line. I miss using my flamer to clear out vault 94. :(
---
I keep exavator armor on me all times but only use it to gather lead ore (get way more ore with that p.a.), boost carry weight if over encumbered, or in a nuked area to mitigate the rads. Otherwise my stealth sniper never uses the armor. I'd dump the p.a. now, but get the excavator's p.a. at lvl 25 for ore gathering. Frames are easy to find.
---
This is the unfortunate realities of music licencing.  There aren't many multiplayer games that even have music in.  Well, apart from an original score.
---
ZoS be a bigger band of cunts than anyone I ever met.
---
If anyone thinks the damage balances going on are bad, play ESO for 3yrs. I'll stick with Bethesda thanks. They're like a chain smoking relative with a poor police history whereas ZoS are the true evil. Wearing blazers to dinner and shit and trading in human souls.
---
You can't change an urban scout piece of armor (blue) to a forest one (brown) in a work bench
---
In all fairness it does tell you how many of each card you own under each card on the " pick a perk" page.
---
For meat week? 
---
Otherwise generally I make my player sit, play instruments, or sleep if I'm AFK...
---
I did submit a ticket.  I'll check the stash, but i think that would be a long shot.
---
Ouch! Yeah. I carry the p.a. on my person at all times and just take the 10 lb hit as you never know when it will come in handy.
---
Would also be handy for when people visit your camp and steal your crops or don't shut your damn door!
---
We already have some past history to go off for reference, namely Fallout 76 coming to Steam and launch of Wastelanders.
---
In my mind, there will be an initial burst, especially if Bethesda is smart enough to a marketing campaign around the TV show for the game. After that, it'll either return to normal or have a slightly higher average player count.
---
Sadly Bethesda doesn't have the depth of talent and competent management to keep decent content, not even great content, just decent content flowing to keep the interest of the new blood.
---
Ill add you my mic isnt working rn tho, My gt is Denon Channy
---
Whats the turn pits? And why does this benefit all ?
---
New player asking
---
Looks like a BAR to me
---
Now youre coming off as toxic my guy.
---
Just saying you didnt really come off as someone offering advice since you didnt get it.
---
For the record I downvoted you both but you seem to have gotten more than they did from other people
---
maybe ask yourself why
---
Had 2 legendary sheepsquatch and 3 or 4 legendary radscorpions in the ash heap earlier all at once. We weren’t expecting that, plus 2 assaultrons wandered in as well I guess from the nearby area. It was just 2 of us so it was a hell of a fight. Not sure if something bugged or what but I don’t recall seeing that many legendaries at once except during radiation rumble. 
---
There was loose sheep and scorpion meat laying all over the ground. I think I picked up 20 sheepsquatch meat. It was weird but funny.
---
Sorry guys but if you haven’t tagged the bears before it melees me to the otherside of the Map then it’s dead I’m not dying because you’re all too slow. 
---
Probably getting a pipe wrench anyway 👍🏿
---
Preach it!!!
---
Being downed just deprioritizes you for monster targeting. But if you’re already, say, poisoned, or on fire, or in an environmental hazard, or there’s just multiple incoming attacks at once, a hit will down you, and then the next damage source will kill you
---
the fallout ip sank a long time ago, this is just another nail in its coffin
---
What can I say I'm a sheeple
---
Don’t squish it. Put it outside 😊
---
Thanks man you are a real dude
---
I had some massive server hiccups last night, particularly when taking part in the primal events.
---
Same here, made a new toon just to try my first bloodied build just to find that out, I still think bloodied is gonna be the best even after the nerf tho
---
Gave up on the ammo converter in it's current  state. Not worth the hassle and I use semi auto weapons on my snipers and ballistic gat 5mm ammo is cheap to make. When the converter menu is fixed, I'll start using my light machine guns again.
---
You should it's fun. But even at 200%repair and full gunsmith it breaks in a couple minutes.
---
He means 7 standard days or 7 business days....
---
Yep! Just keep looking!
---
But most other cards you can rank up when you get a second one
---
Love it with the scientist scribe uniform
---
On a side note, you look like the vilains in modern Wolfenstein games
---
How do I get these letters? I'd like to do something of my own.
---
In my experience the goo piles don't cause framerate issues but the ashpiles definitely do.
---
It's infuriating.
---
It just works... sometimes.
---
😭
---
Most people who use 33 know this, but the 50% example makes it look weak.
---
If you would use 72% base hit chance in your example, it would rise over 95%.
---
And thats the effect people are looking for, when they want one bullet headshot kills from a distance.
---
😩 yeah I guess the 20 year old engine doesn’t help!
---
It sucks when you don't have the good perk cards. Once you get them it's pretty fun.
---
Had trouble finishing the last wave just now. Boss spawned, team downed it np, then the timer just counted down the last 2 minutes in failure. Why even have this event if it's going to fail over and over again each time they bring it back?
---
What? You mean Travis Miles? He isn't even born yet.
---
Ugh. I’ve not done much of the event and tbf I don’t die often so not experiencing this.
---
I’m kinda all in on rifleman, sneak. Most of my skill point go directly to perception and agility. I have a bunch of mutations that are neg strength. I own no armor except the stealth suit. I’m gonna keep going at meat week but it’s gonna be a grind instead of fun. Gonna go through way more stimpacks than normal.
---
😬
---
Never seen that,  let’s hope it’s true!
---
Ugh!
---
Characters that die in the show will either:
---
1) Start spinning violently before launching into the air and ragdoll into the next season.
---
2) Fall backwards and phase through the ground.
---
3) Explode into bloody mess, rise a foot off the ground and T-pose.
---
.... well as their quality has gone down the shitter so have our expectations. Im sure it will do fine except for being a prime exclusive.
---
Some people don’t care about outfits. I have scrapped every one I’ve ever got...
---
Sounds fun. More bosses would definitely be welcome. I’d like to see the bee swarms be the size of fireflies or stingwings though. Maybe honey could be used kind of like the pylons from the encryptid event in some way. Like players need to steal and eat x amount of honey or royal jelly to distract/attract the swarms to make the queen vulnerable.
---
No its the meat piles
---
Someone stayed in the nuke zone for a bit too long
---
They don't wanna be food?
---
Uh... ok... I dont see how that is gonna help tho
---
Aaaaaaand banned for duping haha
---
I know, it's weird, I was expecting at least one in the brotherhood questline or from brotherhood quests as a whole
---
Frame rates been terrible lately I played another game the other day I couldn't believe how smooth and well it ran, been playing this shit show so long got used to how bad it was.
---
I saw a camp with a mounted gorilla head with a racially charged message written under it😎
---
What platform u on gestorter?
---
Ifs a different color dingy and worn. Its pretty close though
---
Oh Ill get it done. Im nto worried. At this point I could even skip the level up one and it wont matter too much. I only have 4 squares to go and have double daily weekend etc. I can take my foot off now
---
Thats Targeted advertising at a different level haha
---
Some one sent me a pic of actually the same glitch but it was me 😆
---
I got a 1* mutants tenderizer from the event so I think it could be possible??
---
Oh hell yea thats sounds possible!
---
Frankly, every time I arrive at the event I immediately go to one of the spits and spend the entire event turning it. Nobody else ever does so, so while I acknowledge that this is certainly the most boring way for me to play it, it also means I'm continuously contributing to success of the group no matter what.
---
“All the a**holes in Appalachia” I have never been so offended by something I 100% agree with
---
True. But the effect is still rather weak when compared to 25%ffr and Explosive for example, as they increase your damage/dps. If you are using vats, you will most likely have high perception and concentrated fire perk. Making your vats hit chance extremely high already (especially with one or two miss/hits from concentrated fire). Even more so if you are using unyielding set. The loss of 1-2 extra bullets is very negligible in a game like this where you will never run out of ammo.
---
EDIT: And also, you will already miss first shots with the never ending vats bug we have been having for months and months.
---
Black ss armor been in game files for a long time
---
I still havent found my BOS standing post lol
---
Yep yep
---
I Salute the man
---
Yeah I noticed that too, not cool
---
Every time im in danger while doing the event, couple hours ago i did one at the cranberry bog so fog crawlers and a behemoth, solo.. and I actually had to SWEAT to complete it with 11 seconds left used ALOT of ammo 🙄, I don’t understand why is this happening and I sure do hope it’s a bug that’ll get fixed soon (lol right!) and not a “feature”
---
Basically the goal of the event is to fill a gauge which appears at the top of the screen before the event timer ends. There's like a dozen different things which contribute to it being filled, such as gathering and contributing meats, greens and such, taking part in grilling meat, playing music, etc. It's all about providing a great party and a great meal. 
---
Playing music and turning the spits produces a tiny but constant boost to that gauge, as compared to larger-but-more-intermittent boosts for contributing meat.
---
It's worthwhile to have a few people keeping the drums beating and the spits turning just so that no matter what else is going on and whatever success anyone else is having, there's constant progress happening towards the success of the event overall.
---
Definitely need one with swing speed though, the standard ones take an age to swing
---
Hmm
---
Stop reading secondhand panic posts. They aren't pushing this live anytime soon without the remainder of the balance pass
---
Had this happen the other day, although I was only at the SBQ nuke, not the 1st one on the Mine. I had just walked into the server so missed out. I'm on Xbox. 
---
This is great tho! It was nice having the 2 fights back to back. The whole of the server just about was there for it. Hopefully this is intended, but I'm gonna go ahead and cast doubt here.
---
Except when you get the fast travel bug,  not able to travel and end up going else where.
---
The odds though, the odds...
---
If you delete your mule won't you lose all it's carrying?
---
Instructions unclear nuked atlas observatory
---
A headshot deals + 100% damage. An Explosion deals plus 20% damage. FFR deals +25% damage per second.
---
So the one shot player will always prefer 33.
---
And concentrated fire is bugged. Thats the only reason why you can compensate 33 with it. Concentrated Fire Rank 1 and 2 add correct values (+2%, +4%), Rank 3 adds +20% on auto rifles and thats a bug which will be fixed someday.
---
Concentrated Fire has another problem, our clips have 25 or 20 bullets. We waste 2 of them to get to the VATS hit chance of the first shot of 33.
---
Seeing what ive seen in bethesda games it would make sence that staying on anything with some type of animation would cause a server to slow down. Especially with multiple people doing it. I know this probably defeats the purpose but if you could manage to server hop after each event that would probably help avoid any lagginess
---
It might actually have had that much value to him. I like the outfit a lot but to some they hate the backpack. If someone puts something for sale it's on them if they under-price it. Don't feel bad just buy it and flip it!
---
All that mule wanted was a bit of love and support....
---
I am on Xbox, my camp is on the station near one of the event sites so I think that’s it.
---
Yeah buy the plan from the raider vendor at stations
---
Some attacks have explosions, or multi stage attacks.
---
Ghoul swipes 3 times..if he downs you on the first swipe, he still performs the combo and the next hit kills you.
---
Behemoth and SB attacks do splash damage that double dips on direct hits.
---
Poison and fire damage keep ticking, even if you go down
---
That's why I can't do that haha. Have 2 chars and 3 mules. They are all carrying something important lol. So I just struggle to level up either my 367 or 105 haha
---
Uhh well..some people just don’t care about others. I just hope this system get reworked for the better somehow, im bloodied sneak and what i do when he spawns is stand up to lose sneak damage and tag him on the leg and let him go for others to kill him, and honestly sometimes I don’t care about him and just tag the gouls for the xp 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
I mean this is pretty easy to fix folks... and we told them how to do the shit months ago... AUTO SHUT DOORS! Should have an option similar to LOCK feature... toggle on auto shut doors after 5 seconds... pretty damn simple.   
---
But with a dev team this incompetent... we get Meat Week 2.0 with the same f'ing bugs it had last year... I.E. the entire quest shits the bed and doesn't complete "primal meat" events... same bugs... new year. NOT SURPRISED.   
---
Some very EASY QoL changes would have been made by now if this was a fan run mod... no shit. Fans could do 100x better by now with 76.
---
Be nice bit don't think I could deal.with another grind. But unyeilding PA would be awesome 👍 .
---
Big Blue Brahmin
---
Yes. But this one is just an expendable one. Nothing of value. Run him out of the vault to the overseers craft a weapon and an armor piece go inside the wayward skip the dialogs and claim my easy 500 SCORE points
---
Yes
---
I gave it to each of them for the approximate 8 minutes they lived for
---
Same. I had a great time with it on PS4 until the Seasons started. It doesn't even function properly anymore. Things don't render, sound is out of sync, constant crashes. Freezes on fast travels, structures and walls not rendering, etc. I uninstalled it and finally gave up. 
---
After playing it on PC for a couple months I became sort of bored with the whole thing and decided to give New Vegas a run since I never finished it.
---
Sound interesting and creepy at the same time
---
So every hour grams cook out event happens then?
---
Ah thing is though I’m getting it everywhere, my camp in Helvetia, the Ohio River raider place, the wilderness out near site alpha, Whitesprings, especially during the meat cook. It’s very odd.
---
I've done this at least four times so far. Along with buying from a vendor, claiming a workshop, completing an event, and killing 10-20 enemies, you can complete a few dailies in ten minutes.
---
You can make headshots with explosive and 25%ffr too you know.. Not having 33% vats hit chance major effect does not make it impossible to get them.
---
Headshot with explosive damage will do more damage than headshot with 33% vats hit.
---
25%ffr is for bosses. You gain nothing from 33% vats hit chance when you are fighting one.
---
I never said 33 is a bad effect, i just said it is worse than explo/25%ffr.
---
With all the weapon rebalancing going on, I really hope they make the fatman, missile launcher and broadsider viable. For the love of Graham make them good!
---
Could just be another typical Bethesda bug. They tried to take out meat piles this week but just resulted in all the loot being dropped which I think probably causes the server to glitch out also. It is odd, I agree
---
&gt; it will allow us to deliver the same fallout experience for a majority of our users.
---
Brilliant.
---
That's a good point I didn't think about, knowing bethesda it'd have some obscenely small drop chance and the pool would be heavily padded with one star pipe pistols and wrenches.
---
Yeah but, just because it isn't *difficult*, doesn't mean it's *good*.
---
I haven't done it myself but you need to link your bethesda and steam account from bethesda's site. Also there is an area to change your name after you've done that ingame, in one of the settings.
---
very wholesome. 10/10 would carry without any gripes.
---
Were you wearing the new cow costume when this happened? You probably scared the poor beasts!
---
I mean think about it - a two headed cow standing on two legs and carrying an automatic weapon... that would terrify anyone!
---
Yes it was, down at the Whitespring!
---
Ive tried linking them and i wont let me, ill look for the setting now
---
I'm pretty familiar with the notes and such in Vaulr 94 as I spent basically January through to the end of March in there almost nightly.
---
Most of them are still there, it's really just the chief engineer and the pump room control terminals that are full on gone now, and bunch of others have been altered.
---
The note about the guest welcoming potluck is still in the Atrium though.
---
And yeah 94 is a tragedy, for a great many reasons.
---
Holstering works sometimes, if crouching try standing up that also works sometimes and it almost work every time if i run a little bit further from whatever location im in..yea weird but it works
---
I know, but it's less likely to hit if you dont get close. And the explosion is uselsess on headshots, it doesnt scale its damage with the headshot damage. 25 FFR is great on bosses of course, if you've shot yourself to 95% VATS Hit chance with concentrated fire and continue with FFR its great, no doubt about it, but this only works because Concentrated Fire rank 3 is bugged.
---
I call them C.H.O.R.E. points.
---
A vpn
---
There were 10+ players there every time I saw it pop when I was on today.  Although everyone was over level 100, so I didn't see any new players there.  The turnout was so great, I thought about doing an Encryptid between roasts, but decided to wait.
---
I think everything is transitory, but most items cycle back around eventually.
---
So while you're doing that... i'm actually advancing my main at the same pace... it's called West-Tek + Whitespring speedrun, and all it takes is some cranberry relish, a good nights rest and a team. I'm assuming everyone already has the Inspirational perk card maxed out.
---
It's really that simple, 2 runs and done. Oh and don't bring the team, simply join one and do your runs.
---
Yeh it was breaking my morale last night, trying to do  all the prime event amongst other so I took a minute and messed about to see what would work, holstering my gun before travelling worked everytime.
---
Haha, thought I was the only one doing this. Hard trying to level up after 400. Great minds and all that. 😉👍
---
What setting? It still wont let me link my steam
---
Nice roll Congrats!!
---
Ahh is that why I’m seeing tons of shite on the ground at the prime meat sites? Getting loot for stuff that died before I got there is nice but not when it lags the server...
---
(Always thought it was neat when the stuff appeared on the ground after clearing a dungeon though.)
---
Yep, easy as pie. Idk why people complain about actually playing the game... i get 2 lvls a day not even trying. If i focus on a speed run i can get a lvl in under 20 minutes... these people would have loved the old challenges lol.
---
I moved mine away from that area as soon as I heard about the new event.
---
I been having the same thoughts
---
Explosive is not useless on headshot. Go try it out. It will still do the extra 20% damage as it is supposed to. Which will be 20% damage the 33 effect doesn't have. Making explosive superior in damage.
---
And also, concentrated fire is not bugged. It works as it is supposed to. Not once have i seen a post about it, or experienced anything of the sorts myself during my 2000+ hours.
---
why can't you link them? what does it say? and sorry after checking I was wrong it only displays your name, doesn't allow you to change it.
---
Or they'll get the respawn bug and will be forced to spawn at Vault 76
---
Country...no thanks. I modded my radio to have alot of 50-60 rock'n'roll, suits very well
---
Mine is jim and I'm just playing him like a speedrun account but I need starched genes because I somehow got marsupial healing factor and adrenal reaction from radiation with no other trash mutation
---
It happens to me sometimes but I usually just try it again and it works
---
No no no... you run West-Tek AND Whitespring. 2 runs and you're done, those damn assaultrons are worth 800-1200 exp depending on your buffs. There are 3 of them at the Whitespring and several Ghouls of high lvl.
---
It says account linking failed please retry or contact customer support
---
Maybe, i would say it's more annoying because screw PvP.
---
Haha same. I'm at the raider roadblock riiiight next to the mine. 
---
When I launch the nuke myself, I place it so my camp is just outside and I get sooooo much vendor traffic being the closest fast travel to the event
---
Had multiple game freezes in the last half hour. Hasnt even kicked me its just froze mid Primal Cuts so i have to restart... sigh
---
Fast traveling issue has been a long time thing, lately that issue is also happening when I'm trying to go to an event.
---
Back when I started playing nw we had to level up to get a new perk card and everyone was wanting frog legs. Some people were lucky and was awarded frog legs and some of us never got that perk until they close to lvl 100. Then they decided to pretty much give everyone whatever card they wanted instead of earning it like we were forced to do. I would always get melted when I was a low level as well, everyone does when they first start and are acquainted to playing adv mode where u are encouraged to use v.a.t.s. and not ever have to worry about aiming on your on. I am lvl 378 in nw and I personally think that adv mode is boring af. Usually the only time I go in to adv is to spend my 30k I earned in nw on the first players vendor I come across on things I already have or on things that I dont need. I didn't start getting better at nw till I started playing in 3rd person. I know that 3rd person is the devil to some people but I helped alot. I suggest practicing 3rd person in adv before playing in nw though. I can always spot players that still play in 1st because I can pretty much walk up behind them or stand beside them without them knowing. I love nw and would really love for bethesda to add another map or something to the mode and to not let it die. I play on xbox btw
---
I did this once, even had a sign saying "For new players, don't be a dick". 
---
Still had a level 80 try to take all of it.
---
I mean i haven't noticed a difference in time to lvl from 50 to 220... so i doubt it scales up.
---
If you get the plan you get acces to that item in legendary drop pool
---
Longshot perk card. No hacks on consoles thank god
---
This isn’t supposed to “help” it providing insight as to why someone was selling a rare item super cheap. Maybe they don’t care...
---
sorry, its common knowledge that the 20% boost of rank 3 concentrated fire on auto rifles is a bug, you find posts on this sub, just google it.
---
Other than moving camp as the post entails
---
Yeh, I always had the issue but then took a break from 76. Recently it just seems worse, taking 5+ time just to fast travel.
---
There goes at least 45k lol
---
Do we have to launch the nuke ourselves or can we enter after someone else has launched one? I've looked a few times after a nuke has been launched and the rubble is still there.
---
We actually reached out to them on a couple of occasions asking if we could do one pro-bono. Didn’t even get a courtesy decline back. I don’t suspect this game will get such a thing, but it’s worth advocating for!
---
It's only doing 55 dam? My Gauss shotgun is doing 1157 dam...?
---
I think the fallout tv show will likely appeal to a different type of fan than 76 does.
---
It never worked in the regular fallout games. They would be breaking lore and tradition if they fixed it now lol
---
Probably better you just contact support then, you have to link the accounts to get a real name. I don't know what could be preventing it.
---
Works perfectly fine for me, on all characters. I use excavator only, due to 200 extra weight. With pepperoni roll, deathclaw steak, 5 str from radiation, and marsupial and SIN, im up to 600 carry weight in PA
---
Alright, thanks
---
And all because the people of Harpers Ferry think that it was a trap ahahaha, one of the few vault good, humanity never changes
---
I bought a Forest Camo Jumpsuit from a rando camp, shortly after player vending was implemented, for 95 caps. I didn't feel bad at all. I also had no idea it was a rare item until several weeks later.
---
I have never used ranks 1 or 2 so can't say anything about them. But this game uses same numbers (mostly) as  fallout 4. And in fallout 4 rank1 is 10% accuracy, rank2 is 15%, and rank3 is 20% which is the value as in fallout 76. So if anything the first ranks are bugged. It is not common knowledge as it's the first time i have ever heard such a claim. And i am extremely active on this sub, and been so from launch of the game.
---
I agree on any solution for more weight, but better give me 2k stash 😁,
---
Oh yeah, Forceful Stock made a ton of difference. Even upgraded my handmades with it. Thanks.
---
You don’t have to comment to vote on posts, my dude. 
---
As for you being obviously upset because you got your shit rocked, what if it wasn’t a legacy weapon? What if he melted you with a bloodied plasma flamer? Or a bloodied explosive shotgun? What would you say then? That bloodied weapons need to go too? 
---
&gt;it’s a garbage pvp game
---
If it’s a garbage PvP game, then why take the risk of having pacifist turned on? Judging from your comments, it’s obvious that you’re pissed off because of “broken duped legacy weapons.” But the problem with that is there’s other weapons that can still tear through you that aren’t legacy. That aren’t even widely duped. You don’t need a B2525 and an explosive energy weapon to win fights. If PvP is **really** trash in this game, why wouldn’t you just take away the risk of ever being pulled into it?
---
Sums the state of the game up.
---
Thats true for semu auto, but not on auto rifles. On Auto Rifles its supposed to do +2% +3% +4% but it does +2% +4% + 20% and thats bug and it will be fixed someday.
---
Not upgraded excavator? With basic gear and foos buffs my weight around 540, with excavator its close to 600
---
I had a camp neighbor price TP for 30000 caps.  Everything else was decently priced, except for the TP.
---
I wouldn't sweat it too hard. Prime meat just gives you scrip and the meat sweats. It doesn't effect your loot from the Meat Cook.
---
It was never an issue in early stages of character progress, while I didn't have any mutations. Now it's annoying part of "new normal".
---
Leveled mine to 50 have them fixer plans and now they are scrip machines.
---
You absolutely can. Theres 2 "no paint" options, and one is the forest skin
---
You get it as a reward for completing The Motherlode quest. Hornright building in Charleston.
---
Thank you! Is that the only way to get it? It’s not hard right?
---
Some player bodies remain in the event, it's a bug that also occurred in Fasnacht
---
Xp for nw should be awarded to either kils per game or distance traveled on the map during a game. Placement xp encourages way too much afk'ery or bushcamping.
---
Queen Black Widow Beast that lives in the mire.
---
Mods integration will add some QoL only. Unlike Fo4 or any other Beth games, in Fo76 modders won't be able to fix bugs.
---
Not sure if it's the only way, but the quest is pretty easy to complete.
---
Thanks man appreciate it! I’m gonna try it Tomarrow for sure!
---
Man. I took a level 5 character to a queen fight. Fired enough to get credit and stimmed everyone who got downed and I earned almost four levels for it.
---
Depends on the legendary effects. 
---
PA Full Sentinels + Emergency Protocols + Dodgy = Unkillable
---
Bonus points if you can get your hans on a automatic weapon with the Vampire legendary effect. It can keep you alive in a pinch
---
Just mute the game music and put on Pandora/Spotify in the background.
---
Yeah
---
I would say just give it time and the awesome modder community would fix the game but that does not work in this case...
---
The effect itself is awesome. If most of the legendary effects worked as intended on enemies that'd be awesome too
---
It's just added to your Dr and er stats
---
Aw a lot was removed? That's a shame! I wonder why they would do that...
---
 I was looking forward to getting to explore the vault since I missed out but it looks like I'll still have to look up pictures and terminal entries online.
---
Or give us the option at the menu to play a battle royale nw, where u grab weapons and try to shoot other players, or a pacifist royale nw, where everyone just farms xp for 25mins. On the last circle in pacifist royale everyone comes together to do their little fo1st dance and hold hands.
---
That's very sad considering all the backlash
---
I'll try it un about an hour. I remember trying a while ago because I was confused with the two no paint options but there was no result
---
When this happens in nuclear winter the person running in place game has crashed.
---
Primal cuts has been a complete disaster for me today.  We finally got on the same server (every time either my husband or I would load in the other would server drop) and any time we fast traveled it kicked us out.  It's so frustrating because loading back in means you miss waves, or you may miss the whole event.  We played 4 hours, back to back primal cuts, then the big event and probably had the fast travel fail 80% of the time.  He also had the special fail, so nothing was new for him today.  🙄
---
That’s the other guy in good neighbor, memory den, not Travis.
---
Fallout has the best community tbh 👍
---
To me, the SPECIAL ones are the best. I can always make use of extra points in my build--I added 13 points to my build on the PTS and that was at level 311. With my Ammosmith and a temporarily swapped-in Rank 1 ammo card, I can crank out 32 .45 rounds in one go, not including the bonus Super Duper procs, so I don't feel any need to spend precious coins to rank that one up for a while. I am sitting on thousands of lead, steel, and acid, so I am good there.
---
Also one with 90% weight reduction, I can't wait to free 18 lbs of my stash just to display the thing.
---
Are you sure about this? 
---
As i have never seen the drums/meatspin raise the meter, only slow down the amount it drops. Even if you have 3 people playing drums, and 3 people on spins, the meter will not more ahead / gain. And this is the third meat week for me in this game..
---
Only way to have the head start you describe is to have people donate prime meats at the instant the 2min wait period is over, making it look like the event started mid way already.
---
Yes please. My buddy has a really cool camp near the train line and it keeps getting destroyed. I thought camps only got destroyed when hit by the nuke, not when spawned into an existing blast zone? Unless Bethesda changed something. His camp gets destroyed when he loads into an existing one.
---
Yeah spawns are completely fucked right now.  Any time I take a work shop I have over half the spawns out in nowhereland I have to leave the area, even with vats and a sniper, which means sometimes you aren't in the circle at the end of the defend. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I'm talking spawns down past the golf store at hemlock holes.  Spawns past the mini camp by gorge junkyard, spawns in the big open area past Poseidon
---
It's a plan that you can craft in your Camp or at a workbench to add to the display case 🍻
---
too much canned dog food?
---
Bloodied and two shot are two different things.....
---
You on XBONE? I've had this issue with some workshops since I started playing in June last year.
---
I think since completing more, that some enemies spawn so far away you cant see then and they are beyond compass range. After event failed earlier I found  Prime fog crawler fighting with blood eagles about 300 to 400m from the event.
---
I like the enthusiasm, though.
---
Westworld creators, so it will most likely suck real bad.
---
I just did it a couple of days ago. I know you can't change forest to urban though for some reason
---
I think you're missing the point, theres a reason you get more XP by using guerilla tactics and living as long as possible. ZAX is looking for a strategic mind not JUST an efficient killer.
---
Some guy sayed to me a while ago, depending on which platform you are, try the Playstation remote play app via smartphone. So he is via phone online and afk events, made trades or just inventory management via phone at work for example. I didn't have enough free space on my phone to to it but if you play on ps4 I would give it a try.
---
I always carry dirty water to kill me, then you can spawn wherever you want xD
---
The real reward is at the end of the event. In fact you have to rush the event and people instakilling things in not bad at all
---
Yep.  The funny thing is we have all 3 Xboxes,one, one s, one x and they all have the issue, my friends on PC have it too, just less because they are always private.  It wasn't this bad a month ago, but I also was excited to get back into it with the SCORE event.  I'm just salty I guess, sometimes I need that last defend XP to level and log out.
---
And no
---
There is a goddamn flashlight on it, so yes it should
---
But it didn't in FO4, so no it shouldn't?
---
Personally, in 4, I had a mod that "fixed" that.
---
There are worse things in life.
---
Sounds like OP is trying to melee them.
---
You do realize that faster the event gets done, faster you get the prime meat, and faster you can hop to the next event. Giving you more events / hour. Work on your reaction time and be ready to shoot at the beasties.
---
Now this but also backpacks
---
Haven't been able to complete this part for a week and still unable to on PS4 :.^(.
---
We'd still like some xp along the way though.
---
I keep having super low FPS drops when outside. Kinda strange that it’s been rather recent since it’s started....
---
Yes, I have confirmed this as well. If you play it yourself you can hear the chimes as the progress advances.
---
Yes - I have been trying to spread the word on this as well. In Angry Turtle's latest video you can see it happen but he didn't seem to notice but the event started at 50% complete.
---
Very interresting if this is actually a thing. Have to give it a go on my private server and two accounts.
---
Yeah that's true. But at the same time it's making some people settle for 2nd place instead of fighting for 1st. And also we sometimes have someone waiting to join our team at the menu but can't until we look for the last guy for 7 mins that is hiding in a bush while he farms a couple more xp
---
I dunno, I've done some where we got to tag, and got the XP. Got the meat to cook and eat to sell to vendors, and still completed the event and got the primal meat. 
---
Its not even the quick kills, it's the quick kills at max range, 90% its dead before I can even see it over the terrain. 
---
I'm not melee, I have crappy aim for medical reasons. Shit I have a hard time with chow line some days.
---
Thank you for the 100% correct and factual comment that has 0 to do with the issue. They are not mutually exclusive. I doubt 10000 dmg is an accurate number either.
---
I'd just like that option to not pop up when no one is in my spot, or even near it. 
---
BTW, this happens with nukes too. Load into a nuke zone? You're going to keep loading into it unless you restart.
---
Run Xp farming events or just get better mate
---
as someone who sat on the totem pole several times: these events are about speed, the faster it goes, the more rewards, more time to do other stuff that brings you real xp.  
---
  
---
also, i always waited what people around me did. lvl 12 guy was picking up every flower, running around in strange ellipses and a lvl 170ish afk next to the pole. dont feel bad about what i did.
---
Red rockket had a broken door... something about would looked closed when open and vice versa.
---
If the timer runs out and the meter isn’t full the drop % decreases but you still have a slight chance.
---
Thank you for the obligatory couched "git gud" comment, you can pick up your bag at the door.
---
The cookout starts on the hour every hour and is over in 2 minutes or less. So you have to be there on time.
---
PREACH-COOK
---
I would love fewer loading screens so this would be a great addition
---
Giving away a free game? Naa we Bethesda we ain't doing that here. Plus I doubt there servers would survive this....
---
When trying to make an argument it is important to have your facts straight. Other wise you just come across as a bigot
---
Prime meat doesn't help, it only gives you scrip.  It's been datamined.
---
Sadly thats most likely true
---
I love that its a mini version of whats on chally, even the mattress padding between the barrel is there and a lamp. Chally has the same thing, gets me everytime hahaha
---
I would buy fo1st if I had the option for custom lobbies in nw and be able to host my own melee only match, no explosive match, pistol only match, etc.
---
Even if legendary PA had additional slots. I'd love to have protocols and jetpack on the same set
---
I'm really mad at myself for beeing such a pessimist but after I replayed a bit of F76 after it came to gamepass I lost pretty much all hope in Bethesda :s
---
Thats actually a really cool idea! All though that should already be in the game for no charge
---
Ah.. Then i must be wrong.
---
Or join a friend in that region from the social menu.
---
The reason it works is because the Drums/Spits DO raise the bar, but only ever enough to ALMOST counteract the decay of the bar.
---
Since the bar isn't decaying during the 2 Minutes of Waiting, you're just increasing the bar, ever so slightly.
---
I have high hopes for the game but we all do. And sometimes i dont think Bethesda does their part in making it a reality!
---
Yeah, it seems like every time Primal Cuts starts or the mine is nuked I get more drops and crap.
---

In all seriousness though, I'm really sorry that you've been put into this position. It's such a disappointment to have your positivity and faith not met. Not even unrealistic expectations. Just for stuff to work as expected.
---
A lot of us understand because we've all been there once. 
---
Maybe don't give up on Fallout just yet. You'd be missing out with all that is great with Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Especially with their modding scene. Maybe even Fallout 4 too with all its flaws. There are some great stories and gameplay to be had.
---
Nope. I stand by what I said. You are being intolerant towards who believe they have the right to kill things quickly, using the build of there choice. Bigot.
---
I was in the mole miner event a couple of nights ago, and three times in the one event, I stabbed a legendary with a level 5 cultist dagger for the drop, right as some arse hole with a blue-electric-laser thing hits it. All three times I was standing next to the miner as it died, and all three times everyone seemed to think it was me. The downthumbs, the agony of saying on mic "it wasn't me," and knowing nobody has voice on. The absolute brass chaps of blue-shooty-laser guy. 
---
Sigh. 
---
Crab nabbit!
---
I’m really torn between this and the raider BP with the skull. Both are super great for pirates :s
---
Same, reported it, they had me recheck files which does nothing because the deal isn't in the damn shop.
---
Serious question. Where does bethesda get their feedback and suggestions from? Everytime I send in feedback I get an automated response email.
---
This is my 1st meat week and I did it 3 times and 3 times it failed as  people and high levels just stood and did fuck all..........least to say I wont be wasting my time on that event again.
---
I mean I WANT this to be good. The gun play is so satisfying to me, I like the crafting and the building when it works correctly. I appreciate the advice:)
---
good bye, have fun.
---
Can we get your stuff?
---
Fallout 76 isnt really all that much more buggy than any main Fallout or TES title, it's just that it lacks console, has far fewer mods, and bugs stand out more because the gameplay is so repetitive.
---
I'd use my extra character for three days before deleting him/her. 
---
Day 1: Level 3
---
Day 2: Level 4
---
Day 3: Level 5
---
Then delete. Poor guy/girl would never make it out of Flatwoods.
---
I'm a bigot because I denouce the actions of the selfish?
---
M'Kay...
---
Atoms aren't cheap either, i"m sure they can afford it.
---
Tell us how you really feel :) yes a minority of selfish pricks can wreck the game &amp; unfortunately its seen time &amp; time again.
---
I dont get anything
---
I'm glad I don't know what you're talking about
---
I just wondered as I was fast travelling there in seconds and it never happened. 
---
And these other people seemed to really be mad at the guy playing the drums. 
---
I just wondered if the two were connected. 
---
I ended up server hopping and found one almost immediately.

You are putting all people with a decent build in the same boat. You are coming across hateful with your comments. Instead of making a coherent statement and starting a healthy discussion you lead with ignorance and insulates. Hence, you're a bigot
---
Part of this game is weight management. Many of the suggestions here are spot on. Really look at things like ammo (without the ammo weight reduction perks) and gunpowder. You might have picked up hundreds of gunpowder and it weighs a lot. Best bet is to have the ammo weight reduction perks on and then make ammo from gunpowder when you can, it will affect weight a lot. Also chems weigh a lot, the game throws them at us and before you know it you can have 50+ stims, which weigh a tonne. I run a heavy power armour toon and shocks are a necessity. I find if I can have around 100-120 free in carry weight then I can loot most areas effectively.
---
An event made to accommodate AFK folks. I love this.
---
Nuclear winter turned it around for me when it came out. But due to the lack of nw related updates, I have been slowing down on playing as well. Adv has always been boring to me. I have been trying to play adv for the last few days but it's still boring. My adv character is lvl 409 and nw char is 378. I haven't even started the wastelanders quest yet
---
What I'd like is a challenge which can be completed in multiple ways (like the robots one having options in terms of which robots you can kill): either level up once, or gain as much experience as it takes to level up at level 50.
---
Very hard to do as Sony and Microsoft charges per update so when trying to maintain and update a pts it can be a bit annoying.
---
Why are you so mad about a harmless glitch lol
---
It really is a lot of fun. Basically just a walking blender. It was my favourite playstyle in Fallout 4 and I was crushed to find it barely survives a group of enemies in 76.
---
It can be cocked up, twice I have been there 5 mins before and Grahm is stuck in a death gaze doing nothing, never starts. Both those occasions a leach was on the drums or spits.
---
If its atomshop related or if it involves a new dupe method they jump right on it. I think that if we include those 2 things in a nw suggestion post that they might read it
---
It's definitely the same because it happens to any heavy or rifle automatic weapon
---
there is one simple solution: nuclear revenge
---
\*Johny Guitar enters the chat\*
---
I'll finish with this double score. I'm really looking forward to not needing to worry about leveling up every day
---
Got to get this one now...
---
I disagree. It really wouldn't be nice to get rid of those.
---
You can't solo it? Lol
---
That's sad but it fits the game's valors...
---
Having used a lever action with this effect I can say it’s a snipers’ best friend: it basically guarantees head shots at mid range fighting, so it’s an indirect damage boost.
---
the real reward was realizing you could have done this from the start
---
I might actually do Photo Opportunity if they made this change.
---
I've been having it too. My guess is it's all the extra meat, weapons, armour, and junk all the unlooted enemies decay to. It's hard to see a lot of them due to the grass and foliage, hell in the Bog it's hard to even see the meat piles sometimes. They blend in or get hidden by scrub brush
---
Yeah they wait til the 5 second mark on the countdown then switch servers. Plus you'd just be fucking over anyone else wanting to do meatweek ok that server.
---
Yeah, even bloodbugs and stingwings can. It's kinda weird...
---
there is another
---
I've had a lot of event fail for no reason and the event for grahm isn't even showing up
---
Had a level 205 with FFR explosive minigun at every event. killing everything and having bodies fly all over the place. 
---
Then shooting people to get pvp.
---
No thumbs down or messages changed his behavour. People just ignored the event after or left the server..
---
At the 3rd event most players just gave up, some left during the event. I just switched off. Not interested in meat week anymore,
---
And they'll somehow fuck it up and remove jetpacks from the game instead.
---
I have almost never even seen the wendigo on either of my lv 200+ characters bc I'm always playing an instrument or defending someone else who is and someone one shots it before I can even see the damn thing. One of the very few times I saw it I was the asshole who accidentally one shotted it. I felt so bad.
---
I don't know. I wish we could have some. They could even be different effects from normal armor, so they can be balanced separately.
---
It's being displayed without modifiers it appears.
---
Also keep in mind that shotguns work differently in general.
---
You don't get the point at all.
---
See you during Steel Dawn :-)
---
That sucks I'm so sorry. If you're on ps4 I can keep an eye out for another Tesla for you?
---
I was carrying a fatman for the sorched queen event at the beginning... Just for the fun to hit her in the air...  
---
Hope they are really rebalancing the game.
---
I disconnect or freeze about every 3rd Primal Cut
---
I'm like level 255 and I just did my first event. I was completely clueless, but I tried to watch what others were doing and copy them. Then I saw all the crap and trash everywhere and got to scooping. We finished it and my next event I was better prepared to actually help. I'd say let's try to be a little patient because even high level players may not have been around last year. We all have a first time. 😉
---
I love democracy.
---
How is it fucking over? Nuking events is great, with mobs spawning every new event, its a great source of high rad fluids, for example
---
I mean... I didn't look it up before hand and found it pretty self explanatory 😂
---
Congrats!!!
---
That is a decent use of the bug, but a certain sense of accomplishment would be lost if I personally used this particular bug. A bit like the out of bounds glitch on skyrim to take all the items from the blacksmith chest.
---
So maybe now all the players moaning about people on the drums and spit will stop. Lol probably not.
---
Does anyone know if Tato Salad is the same as Tato Salad Surprise?
---
Only need the 3 clever mods, grill master hat and tenderizer plan if so...
---
I can confirm it starts on the hour I always arrive at say 10.55
---
You put it in the breach of the wall where there are those petrified corpses. I think it's the second breach from the right if you are standing on the asylum yard looking towards the street. Place the tent as close to the wall as possible. (usually the stairs of the tent clip into the petrified corpses when you do that, if this happens you're probably good to go).
---
Keep in mind that the tent has to be placed before the event starts in order to work.
---
Bethesda should add a sign or letters that you can type out instead of placing them One by one
---
Some rework could do a lot good to this game.
---
Most build has max damage around lvl75 so basically being higher than that gives no more advantage.
---
Caps, scrip and bullion reset 20 hours after you first purchase/sell. Daily faction and photo quests reset at a fixed time depending on your timezone. For me it's 3.00 in the morning (in Finland).
---
Seriously, these shovels haven't always been there.
---
Who made you the nice camp police? I don't recognize your authority.
---
Also how do I get my hands on a formal complaint?
---
Right now unarmed damage is bugged in the PTS, and is way lower than it should be even with the new calculations. But I'll say that I'm still one-shotting everything up to high-level Super Mutants with my Instigating Grognak's Axe; and a build more optimized for damage like Bloodied is still going to outperform what I'm down. So make of that what you will.
---
With the down side of not being able to earn any Atoms at all. 
---
I miss the old daily and weekly challenges for Atoms, it made me play everyday and not feel like a chore ( as the season pass did) 
---
But it's gone as it was impacting sales or lack of.
---
And now we are stuck with a crappy season pass model that is boring as in every game that has one. Destiny and The Division 2 come to mind.
---
Tried calling them the other night, nobody answered for 10 minutes.
---
In my experience it's not people hanging around the totem pole that get the most kills, it's those who run off towards the prime enemies as soon as they spawn. So, you could try doing that. Obviously the location of the event has an effect - the cranberry bog one is pretty good for doing this as the enemies tend to spawn in copses so you can't see them from the totem pole.
---
(In fact it's helpful that people run towards the spawn locations as some enemies don't seem to come toward the totem pole, which can cause the clock to run down &amp; the event to fail.)
---
Bullshit, they drop no problem during sbq event
---
Tried. People just turn up there and one shot those too.
---
Oh well guess they're having fun.
---
Only if we can get a special Radium Rifle that does poison damage called “Honey, I’m home!” 
---
Not flexible on this one. Either it comes, or we riot.
---
I can save some time and give you the reply now - "Sorry, we cannot return lost items, but we have passed this onto the devs. Thanks for your understanding!" That is assuming you don't get a copy/paste from a completely unrelated issue which could also happen.
---
I love helping new players through events and I'll actively wait for them to tag enemies to get that xp! Don't worry about it! My first character / playthrough I played alone and it took almost 8 months to get to level 80. Second character I played w friends and got to 236 since this past April haha. Piggy backing off higher level players is the best way to level up.
---
I got a pipe gun i named "legendary pincher" with the Berserker attribute that also lower its damage output when you have good resistance so it deals not that much damage and it explodes too in case of i would miss.
---
Have you completed the event at least once?  
---
If so, you'll be able to join it like a regular event.  
---
If not, when you see the Death From Above quest pop up or get a nuke launch notification, fast travel to either the nearby station or Mon Overlook and wait for the drop. The entrance only remains open for a few minutes after the nuke strike.
---
Useless perk imo
---
I think you are putting more thought into this game than the developers and you aren't getting paid
---
I carry 1 holotape (nuclear silo) and zero notes.
---
Fast traveling to a event and then back fixes this bug. It must be a event. Just some random map location does not work.
---
I do... you're wasting your time, you think you're not but you are. In the end you're tossing away the levels you think you're gaining quickly, but i can very easily demonstrate that even at 220, i can level at that same pace lol. WITHOUT tossing it in the trash but i mean, do you.
---
Or at least make her talks about the current limited event like Atlas, Prime Meat, Fasnacht
---
Third delay for colossal actually
---
do you know how much songs cost? do you think bethesda is in this for the fun or for the fallout 1st?
---
Need to be powered up also.
---
Are you using the camp skin from the legendary run?
---
the best i've ever gotten was "I LIKE HENTAI" on top of a guy's front door
---
How tf did this get downvoted so hard? This song sucks and sticks out like a sore thumb to the rest of the soundtrack.  🙄
---
It's no big deal, you missed out in exp from a few monsters. Not the end of the world. Go hit up Whitesprings or something when the events over.
---
I didn't get a chance to play last night as the servers reset / event start was about 1.30am my time and I had work all day. But I'm headed home from work, loaded up on snacks and ready to rumble!!
---
They've delayed it until "early next week" guessing they won't specify a day yet because they may not have it ready by tuesday. I wonder what the issues are on console vs PC, has to be performance. There are alot of wendigo spawns and alot of effects flying around, add in 8 players with explosive weapons and gatling lasers etc. and it gets pretty hairy.
---
I actually came back to play b/c of this news of a TV show; so there are most likely people like me.
---
On PTS, pistols have become completely useless junk. The damage is low, the rate of fire for the automatic variants is comparable to that of assault rifles, and there is less ammunition. What is the point in a pistol then, if you can take a fixer and get more damage?
---
For pistols to be playable, I see two ways.
---
The first is dual weaponry. Two pistols will increase the ammunition and rate of fire, which will compensate for the low damage of the shot. I think the agility perk would be just right. Of course, the pistols must be the same.
---
The second option is to decrease the range of the pistol, but increase the damage from stealth. It is logical that the carbine is noisier (because it is powerful), but the pistol can hit the target at the most vulnerable points. And it makes sense for pistols without a silencer to increase the damage - watch how powerful revolvers shoot. They are often as powerful as sniper rifles!
---
And transfer the adrenaline perk to endurance already!
---
That's actually a really good idea
---
They patched that apparently
---
Ah I wasnt aware
---
It does. From 200 to 300 I could easily do 1 a day, no buffs. From 300 to 400 I've needed to eat tasty squirrel stew and only run with a mutant crew for that sweet carnivore+strange in numbers bonus of 25% XP.
---
I see what you did there, EARLEy next week 😉
---
That's why we have meat week this week. Because once the brotherhood hood comes there will be no more meat week.
---
Yeah, think it must have been the server I was on. One of the times I was there at around 2 minutes to and waited until 5 past. Nothing happened. It was weird.
---
You're initial comment: &gt;Bloodied and two shot are two different things.....
---
Then you switched to "you're a bigot" when I said it made no difference. You're simply moving the argument to convince yourself that you have the moral high ground. 
---
Am I "obstinately or intolerantly devoted" to an opinion of hatred toward people who selfishly claim all the rewards for themselves?
---
You bet your ass I am. 
---
Does that mean every bloodied build and or player with a TSE weapon is a selfish asshat?
---
No, nor did I say that.
---
He was a scrawny calf, who looked rather woozy  
---
No one suspected he was packing an Uzi
---
All
---
So four delays? Cool
---
True. I had horrible glitches the first two times I did it but the last three have gone well. I felt good last night because I got into it late and there were mostly lower level people in there having trouble with him and I was able to run in and bail them out. I feel like this event is a microcosm of the game. When it works well it's really fun and great, but with it isn't working it's incredibly frustrating.
---
It just adds +10 to your dr and er. I wouldn’t use ironclad unless your low level it might help a little bit but to max it is 5 perk points for 50 dr and er just isn’t worth it imo, especially if you have half decent armor the diminished returns over 350-400 isn’t even noticeable
---
I've spent far too much time getting to level 91 of this legendary run so I'm going to finish it, but definitely this. I'm not worrying about next season at all.
---
That was my first time. The rules are simple, they are just not so handy except for the loading screen while entering the event. That offers more clues.
---
One company that they got music licenses from was bought out shortly after the game came out. So any music from previous fallout games that Bethesda didn't use yet from that company, they can't use. Unless that new company eventually decides to start licensing music again.
---
Another source of their music was a government archive that was defunded, also shorty after the game came out, so who knows what they can do with those songs. 
---
Bethesda is probably going to have to pay more money to reuse old songs and also find new ones.
---
I'm not mad haha. Like a lot of players I would like this bug disabled because it gives an unfair advantage, there are some who use this for good, but on the whole if there is a possibility it would get you banned id rather destroy them than let Beth ban your account.
---
I love that in theory but I can see it being easily abused.
---
You cant nuke the actual meat week event. Its in the safe zone.
---
Yes you can nuke most of the prime cuts events but thats no big deal - there is more than one prime cuts event on at a time, and they are so regular that nuking one makes little difference.
---
Video please 🤣
---
Junkie's Fixer, nice man!
---
Mine were even called 'Delete'! Thank you guys.
---
This would be actually pretty awesome. Have my up vote for something worth while, rather than the "I wAnT tO mAkE mY cAmP pReTtIeR" posts.
---
I just go afk since nobody plays the instruments and runs out to kill the Ghouls.
---
Happened on a couple servers for me on Xbox and eventually lost the connection, also all of the loot that the dead creatures drop is just laying on the ground not in meat piles or anything, just meat, armor, and glowing blood all over the dance floor lol
---
I enjoy having lower levels around. I'm doing the event anyways so it's not like they're a detriment most times.
---
Thanks for thie infos - still kinda new to the game.   
---
Does one player have to keep playing the drum at Primeal Cuts or is it just to start the event ?
---
Nice! As a fellow rifle build I also had a good rng day. I got a bloodied, ffr, faster reload radium rifle.
---
 I hope you go back to reviving.  Otherwise, it perpetuates the selfish behavior these other people enjoy.   I always revive people unless the situation is so desperate I've barely got my head above water myself and it's a pitched battle.   Even then, if you're close, I'll still try.    
---
I guess I might not in this situation:  pitched battle, I go down, no one stims me, I revive back in and....someone else goes down.   Probably going to return that nonfavor.
---
Lot of Downvotes for speaking the truth lmao.
---
Ooh very nice, I have a B3325 handmade and I love it. Congrats mate.
---
I get that some items are rare, but you have to take into account that most people who aren't into collecting (for whatever reason) don't give a damn about that. I had various rare drops and outfits, i choose only based on what i like. Since making caps is a joke nowadays (and not like the launch day/first year) i don't care to sell them at high price, i just put them at a fair price (between 100 and 500 caps, based on what they are) or leave them in the stations (like rare plans).  
---
That's about it, at least for me.
---
Brings a tear to my eye
---
Same here , over 2000 hours and never knew . Thanks for the heads up
---
If you don't destroyed ammo itself (which you didn't said) you benefitted from this exploit. Now who's the bad guy too?
---
Right I understand the camp thing, that’s a totally dick move, I’d hop server if that happened 
---
But people must understand that this event timer is very quick, I’ve waited around for people to get a shot in on everything and the event fails, completing the event is much more important
---
I got the plan but didn’t see what it looked like yet, I was kind of hoping it was a pink Brahmin plushie like the moth man backpack
---
it would be really good when there would be possible cooperation with existing music systems like spotify or JUST MOD for spotify etc. playlists on pipboy ingame. At least now we can use any music software on the background.
---
well right now try and do as many of the prime cuts events as possible. tag as many enemies as possible for loot and xps
---
and sell the drops and you'll be rolling in caps in no time
---
There's a really cool 24/7 live stream of fallout music on youtube that I usually always have running im the background while playing. They even have their own custom DJ's. Like cadillac Jack, shoddycast' story teller, utobitha, and a seriously edgy ghoul that I can't remember the name of. They also play all the DJ's of previous games like Travis(confident and anxious) three dog and mr new vegas. Its brilliant to have running while adventuring the wastes 
---

---
I got it but never got the atoms for gaining every disease once
---
Where do you get them from? It's still the only one that is missing for me!
---
Still no whoopsies after 2k hours,  how did you get it ?
---
It doesn't seem so. Yesterday a friend had the LR skin on his camp and the vendor icon wouldn't appear on screen. Until he removed that, of curse.   
---
Also OP the vendors needs to be attached to a power source.
---
Take the SCORE and change your pants.
---
Get all 3 ranks of the inspirational perk and join a public team, preferably a building one. If a team isn’t available then create one. Even if you’re on the team alone, you’ll still get an extra point for intelligence and the 15% xp bonus. 
---
Do all of that first, then either do public events or keep following the main quest line.
---
i have a 3\* Junkies Fatman, and a 3\* bloodied Grenade Launcher taking up space in my stash for last few months.
---
Every time play I look at it, and say...'one day is one day, but not today''
---
Till then you stay all warm and snug in my stash.
---
I really hope this is part of the reason they're returning. They heard about the abominations in Appalachia with scaly skin, plague aura's and jumping over buildings and decided they had to purify the gene pool. 
---
If this doesn't end with the BOS trying to nuke Appalachia in an attempt to start over I'm going to be disappointed.
---
I agree
---
Its meh. The Light is awkward. Dont know if my game is broken or what? But in 3rd Person the Light points pretty much straight down, and in 1st Person its also sub optimal. Cant Put my Finger on it, but I prefer a mining helmet tbh
---
Yes I dumped it in a pond
---
Yes, four of them yesterday on xbox.   One each in Savage Divide and Mire, two in the Forest.
---
Diluted radaway don't take away your mutations. Try this next time
---
With the right weapons ( eg Handmade, Lever) it is an amazing effect. Coupled with concentrated fire Vat's just pwns.
---
If you have high perception it's even better. Wouldn't change it on my guns if I could.
---
Now I'd pay to see that!
---
 **Meat Week PSA: If the small game aren't spawning, look around the BBQ site. They may be bunched up in a corner together.** 
---
\*in fear
---
xD
---
yea, its an mmo.  as soon as u leVe vault its just a mAtter of joining same world
---
We will gladly carry you. Just don't become a POS player later that bring OP magic weapons to events, ruining fun and XP for everyone else.
---
happened to me twice this week :(   both times everything complete except a group task and one for NW
---
That's why I said apparently. Bethesda said they fixed it but that doesn't mean it's actually fixed
---
Great, thanks for the reply, was having trouble  finding the answer searching the sub.
---
There was a mod to make it work in Fallout 4. 
---
Since there was a light on the model, it was just laziness not to activate it. Modders to the rescue again!
---
Not op but just a little Southeast of foundation there is a creek that runs down towards Charlie. Halfway down the hill there is a little pond/puddle that seems to reliably have mirelurk spawn.  Just keep checking it every time you go there for something and eventually you will get some diseased ones.  Then just let it nibble on ya!
---
Hi mate, I just tried to switch a chest urban scout armor color from urban to scout switching from one "no paint" option to the other and nothing happened
---
Yea I actually got past it eventually
---
I've failed a few can't seem to get in a server with enough people on. I know its a public event but surely, it should scale for how many people are there. I think they need to spawn more critters too.
---
Youve got the right idea, as does the other reply.  Most of the legendary stuff is going to be garbage.  In part, this is from necessity as if every legendary drop or reward you find is something awesome, all of the players would wuickly have their ideal weps and armor sets and there would be no incentive to procuring legendary gear.  The other option is to make legendary gear ultra-rare, which adds frustration and a much shorter lifespan on new content. 
---
The way it stands, with fairly commonly available legendary equipment, you've got that extra gambler's benefit of potentially getting something awesome.  If not, you can still get stuff thats serviceable until something better is available, or suits a niche purpose like having a friend that can use it, or giving them away to lower level players or your own alt characters.  Scriping is the recycling system for the garbage tier and not personally useful items.
---
Take your unwanted legendaries to a train station or (as already mentioned), the Pick and feed them to the scrip machine.  You can trade for 150 scrip per day (just like the 1400 cap vendor, uh, cap.  Scrip also comes as faction quest rewards and such, usually in smaller numbers.  I usually wait until i have 360 scrip (3 ☆☆☆ weps and an armor), with at least 100 scrip remaining in the machine before i go to the Rusty Pick.  You buy random legendary gear from the friendly, well spoken mole miner there.  I leave the 100 scrip of trade value in the machine so i can immediately trade somethinh in and not waste the storage space for the extremely rare occassions when she might give me a Nocturnal Boxing Glove with +10% VATS accuracy, and faster reload speed.  Its just not best for my build.  Have fun!
---
How do you know where these events are? I get a notification in the corner that events are starting but the map is so big I can’t find the events. They also don’t show in my Pip Boy. Is there a way to make them easier to find?
---
Very weird.   I started to ask if you were actually "registered" for the event.  I've spawned in on V9 instead of the event marker twice and not received any credit for the event despite damage on the queen.   I now just jump to the event marker while wearing PA
---
Yep. But not far in the story yet
---
But my house is in the blast zone :(
---
Just because the game is non canon doesn’t mean there couldn’t be elements/details remaining in canon
---
Kind of like star wars
---
So let me guess:   they've now nerfed this event so that we only get some of the rewards we used to get.
---
Maybe they should bring back the karma system. And stick all the ass hats together.
---
The only thing is, your teammate thats helping you doesnt get your quest markers anymore since wastelanders update i think. Which i find quite annoying.
---
You just need a break bro. I quited like 2 weeks after the Wastelanders release ( 1300+ hours veteran ). The grind for gold bullions eventualy killed me. I was just finding it rediculous and i needed to do something else of my time. I didn't get too exited when i first heard of the season pass system. I mean i would still need to do do the same boring content. I came back and immediatly quited...there's no way i'm grinding gold bullions back, fuck this, i'm going back on Destiny 2 or the Forest...anything but this !
---
I came back again, 4 days ago, im a lil bit drained by Destiny 2 now lol. I eventualy realised that this season pass system and public team system actually changed my perspective, it totally changed the way i play the game. I've found my self absolutly enjoying going through    my dailies &amp; weeklies to try to unlock season pass ranks.
---
Everybody is doing events together, there's ppl everywhere, every lvls are playing together, i absolutly love it ! I can now do my wasteland repeatable quests between those public or no public events because they no more feel like they are the central point of the game.
---
I'm gaining xp relatively fast now, grinding xp is also now fun. I'm just not even paying attention to it anymore ! 
---
Fallout One is soon coming live and will also finaly refresh the way we apporoch combat to finally allows us to have a more constant and hard gaming experience over all the Appalachia map ! 
---
If you aren't hyped for this, my man...you just need a break. Just take a break, but don't kill the Fallout out fan in you ! I really hope my comment is what you was looking for.
---
( And sorry for the misspellings ✌ )
---
Beta player with only 600 hours?  LuL
---
Define "properly" please.
---
Let it nibble on ya! Hahahaha why did that make me laugh for?!
---
(whispers) I actually love those guys and am very happy when I run into a server with them.   Knocking out three SE in an hour is fantastic.
---
The "big" event is every full hour in the south of vault 76
---
Yeah it does work but as I found out if you had it prior to the patch you still need to move camp and start alllll over again.
---
was a problem for about an hour on Xb as well yesterday.
---
was resolved shortly after
---
1800 hours and I'm pretty sure I've never seen it in player vending
---
Exactly. It might've been a little easier if anyone would use a mic to communicate. Even though we succeeded both events I joined there were several players running around in all directions. I feel like we should each have certain roles, but it looks more like everyone tries to do a little of everything. But hey, I got a couple of cool plans. 
---
Speaking of which, any idea how rare the Tato Salad recipe and Moo Moo Backpack plan are? My first two event rewards. I assume at least one of them is common, right?
---
Right? I wasted 3 stims kiting a legendary to the drums and come to find out Bethesda's F'd up spawning points had everyone fighting across the lake on top of that I now have two more bear aggro and afraid I'm gonna kill the legendary so don't shoot at any of them. Bethesda just needs to fix their S and make group loot like every other MMO(Why do I "see" moo instead of MMO during meat week?).
---
Thanks , gonna try it today 👍
---
Same, It fixed itself after a while
---
Wait you can have multiple character for the s.c.o.r.e system and it builds to that single run?
---
You can but with the way the game is structured, it's annoying as hell to do any of the main quest line.
---
It's pretty much one person is the protagonist and the other is a sidekick. Then you have to switch roles. You do that for every main story quest. It gets really slow and really old real quick.
---
The game plays much better if only one person plays the main quest or you both finish it individually and then play the end game stuff together, like doing silo runs, public events, that kind of stuff.
---
My junkies lever has it, coupled with gun fu and concentrated fire it kicks ass.
---
Just don't power level. You're basically rushing to an end game that comes to a grinding halt.
---
To get the most out of the game, take it slow, explore everything in each area and do all the quests before moving onto the next main area.
---
There is also what looks like a seat cushion.
---
I agree, however I'm trying to decide which basic recipe to go for as it is much easier to craft those without needing to leave your C.A.M.P.
---
I am running Speed Demon as well, so really just want something I can easily craft in bulk fairly regularly, and hotkey.
---
No word on colossal,  tenderizer is added to the legendary pool n once you learn the plan.
---
Iron ic...
---
It is open, but the post OP made this post about his joy about getting this weapon.
---
The OP of the 33 comment can make his own damn post, as that is the point of Reddit.
---
Agreed
---
It’s the Wastelands! We can be who we always dreamed we are!
---
Sorry my dude, I've lost some good Marines because they didn't get the help they needed after coming home.
---
Need commie salut
---
I'm hopeful that when the next season starts there'll be a bug where all the SCORE from the challenges I'm still completing will be applied :)
---
Why would I make that up?
---
Rings a bell. Was that because he was too dim to realise the toilet paper price was satirical?
---
You've always been able to do this. Why does this sub cry about 'Legendary Run has turned this game into a job' or '1 level up a day is too much'. Bro you're the only person making you do these things if you don't like it stop doing it.
---
He calls me tiger! It’s cute!
---
All builds will still be viable.
---
I think you meant to ask "which build will be most powerful?"
---
Probabky still bloodied, tbh.
---
Because people would wear the PA all the time and stop buying cosmetic outfits.
---
I too have been running Corn Soup forever, but am wondering if another soup isn't better suited since AP regen isn't too neccasary for me as I am already runnig Action Boy. 
---
Which is why I'm leaning towards Razorgrain lately. 
---
Agree, crafting perks are essential - especially Green Thumb, as you say.
---
Yea I can carry more wearing my undies and backpack than in my fusion powered exo skeleton.
---
But Liberty Prime won't let me!
---
It usually works for me if I leave the "confirm travel" bit on screen for a second or two before pressing ok. If that doesn't work then usually spamming A or enter really quickly through it works
---
Pretty sure he's refering to the fact that before, you could earn atoms and buy your own rewards but now if you want the "new content" you have to do the legendary run. You could opt out but then you'd. E opting out of basically the only end game.
---
Are you stupid? It isj't like duped weapons have a giant red flag on them saying "THIS IS DUPED" A LOT of stuff gets duped and you can buy it without knowing. Also may i add, there is going to also be a lot more people selling items for irl currency. These are all problems whether you want to ignore them or not.
---
Oh. I hadn’t thought of that... so seldom come across camps I love! 
---
Id leave something nice! Like a selection of non spoiling foods. But then anyone could take it
---
Heavy gunner with junkie's is devastating and fun. If you want to play as a tank that has high dps, go for it
---
Im at tier 92 in the Run and Ive never opened the challenge screen once. They're easy enough that just playing the game a bit will complete them.
---
I don’t think they are going to ever do this. 
---
Especially when people insult them. Even mildly.
---
Isn't +33% Vats hit chance one of the magic effects?  IIRC, this could be an excellent weapon for a commando build.
---
If I spawn in and the circle just happens to close on my position I shouldn’t have to arbitrarily run around to get travel xp.
---
Amen to this.
---
The 80% nerf on explosives was ridiculous, and they haven’t revisited it since. I picked up a two-shot missile launcher last night, which hits for 1000 damage a shot, and decided to see how bad these things still are. Hit a lvl70 floater from sneak, applying a 2.1x sneak attack bonus, with demolition expert, and it still only took half of their health bar. Near any other of my guns would’ve been an instant kill.
---
Many of the mods you can give power armor mirror some legendary effects, and aren’t anything you can put on regular armor. For example, you can get +INT on PA, that’s like a legendary effect. You get to choose it, which is a small bonus.
---
I know most people don’t care about the bonuses you can get, they want things like unyielding power armor, but I think the inherent damage reduction and rad resistance are compensation
---
In that case I shall launch a formal complaint with the relevant authority over this blatant misuse of power. As soon as you tell me where to get one.
---
I went down to Ohio River Adventures, broken open the eggs till a disease baby came out and let it attack me.
---
Also a fun fact. The eggs you can collect are always the same two when there are 4. The outside two.
---
How do you reject daily quests?
---
Which ones aren't obtainable anymore?
---
Why did they nerf that anyway
---
That happened to me yesterday aslo.it's a turn off.so how do we stop this.i have unyielding and wwr perks do I just need to carry less shit?
---
Hello welcome to the Appalachia Complaints Department. Did you you have you official ID? If not please go to the DMV in Charleston and get one.
---
I don't believe you've never opened the challenge screen, but cool. 👍 They are pretty easy, takes less than 30 mins. It's the fact that you have to do them every day, making them more like a job or a chore than fun. A fun game lets you play whenever you want and still participate in the content you paid for.
---
I'll remind you I'm not the one complaining, I'm at rank 91 right now, just adding context to your original post.
---
I'm only level 15 is this out of scope for me? Thanks for all the info :)
---
Where can I get recipe for mystery meat pie? Anyone know if it is from the event or from Grahm himself?
---
It’s server lag. They left the game but their image still appears there. They aren’t actually there. Hold on... let me find a video from meat week last year
---
Ah you know whats good. Enjoy!
---
I mean, I appreciated it. I was so over encumbered after the first one. It was easy to just stay put.
---
eventually got past it as well. Thanks!
---
Thats the thing though: You don't *have* to do them everyday. Not doing them doesn't prevent you from playing the game in any way.
---
That may be the case when there has been a tent there. Last night failed outside of Flatwood and no tents.
---
It fails quite often with no tents or camps there though, so it's not only this.
---
Or maybe add night vision when sneaking on the ranger helmet - like the ranger armor helmet (or what it was called) had in lonesome road
---
(1300+ Hours veteran here with 5 characters )
---
If you want the most decent gaming experience, go for "events". They always have been the deal and still are because they have multiple enemies to kill and rewards you of a decent amount of xp too upon completion ! As you are constantly busy, it just adds up quicker than just running after your main and secondary quests. Think to also do the events poping on the public workshops. They also reward you of housing plans. It always fun get them "at the beginning" ( when you are low lvl 😅 ).
---
This is the most decent way to farm your xp without draining yourself and this is how i still do on my 2 other low lvl characters (...when i find the time to play with them). ✌
---
Been tested multiple times- it isn't the tents it is just Bethesda and their bad Developers.
---
For example I had one fail, only 2 of us there, nothing else there at all.
---
Failed and when we left about 300m away (maybe more) some Blood Eagles were fighting a Prime Fog Crawler. That's why it failed, it didn't show up on the compass and was so far away you couldn't see it. NPCs/creatures can agro them away basically
---
It can be hard to find until you get used to it but if its an event that pops up in the corner, it shows on the map as a hexagon (may be wrong on shape..away from game atm) with an exclamation mark in the center of it. I don't believe there is any way to make it larger/more noticeable though, unfortunately.
---
They do it to read posts like this unfortunately. I think that’s what gets them off. Could also be boredom or simply because they can. FO 1st if you can afford eliminates it. Never found workshops to be of any real benefit. I just take whatever ones I need for SCORE daily and leave it once captured and never been attacked.
---
I've only had fails where there's been a tent
---
Really? This is what I am paying you for? Are that many of you going broke going between the two places? Holy shit you’re all insufferable.
---
Workshops are the only last real place for pvp to happen. It's a shame that people abuse them to hunt other down, since pvp can be quite fun in this game.
---
Some people think if your doing something that has a PvP aspect, you want PvP. I've seen it in other games and I absolutely hate it.
---
The only reason I would sit around the event like that is if I'm AFK farming the event, chances are they are busy with work but still want the limited time rewards.
---
You will get more resources and quicker by just farming whatever you want in junk runs, no PVP and you tend to get legendary spawns/interesting random events etc while you are out and about, it's win win.
---
That depends entirely on your level and play style. Ignore the legendary run and for me there’s no point in claiming workshops, or doing events as I mostly find them tedious with crap rewards. So that’s a fair wedge cut out right away. I seldom make alterations to my camp; mod weapons; mod armor; or bother hacking terminals and picking locks anymore. Certainly some of those are easier to go ‘out of my way’ to do than others, but the fact remains that few line up with the natural way I play, and I highly doubt I’m the only one. Saying that everyone can just complete the run organically is a fallacy.
---
They are called griefers. They get their fun from ruining other peoples game. They use every thing the can to remove all the risk of PvP.
---
First, they spot someone at a workshop and if the player is actually there. They put you on block for session, so you can't see them on the map. 
---
Fast travel to you, sneak up on you, and attack from behind with a weapon that just sprays bullets everywhere. 
---
I've had it happen several times. It used to be gangs of them. It used to be if you engaged in PvP with someone outside of the workshop, they would set a trap.
---
They would send in a low level, who would attack with a knife or some other piddly weapon. And if you fought back, PvP, then the rest of the group would come and mow you down. 
---
Now PvP is just between two players, rather than a player and a group.
---
And in both cases, it's almost always a person running a bloodied build. 
---
I don't like PvP. But I was interested in it a little in this game with how it you had to accept it, by attacking back. But like all things, players quickly found a way to make it so that they could remove any risk.
---
Lol same!
---
Lucky you, I guess everyone else is lying then :-)
---
There’s  3 “spinning grills” at the event that you can spin. Do that and it contributes to the event-meter
---
bro wtf do you do then
---
They were only patched on PC since the hotfix that enables A Colossal Probles still hasn't been released on consoles, so that might be the case here.
---
We play on PC and the problem still arises.
---
Off topic. but...How do you sell something for that much caps anyway? Also...what do you do with caps in this game? I have been running around with maxed out caps for weeks now. All the caps I get for selling is lost immediately upon sale :D
---
You might have been really unlucky... I haven’t failed a single one yet!
---
I have 1st and it's great if you just want to farm, but I prefer to be in a public server so I can do things like events, boost exp via public teams, help other players farm things or just generally have that social feeling. And I don't always have this problem. I love to build Workshops up and just give stuff to players who need it. 
---
It just really sucks that most people just ignore this feature in public worlds. If workshops ever got reworked to a more cooperative state then I would be much more pleased. I always thought it would be cool that if a workshop was taken and defended it would give bonuses to all players in the world. Like taking the waste dump would increase scrap yield etc.
---
Yeah them bears do NOT fuck about eh 😂
---
It makes me wish there were a perma death way to kill a character &amp; subsequently  be able to place a urn in another character's camp which lets the dead character haunt late at night....it all sounds vaguely familiar
---
Yes sorry for meat week. How did I forget to type that lol. 
---
Oh well haha
---
This is Pre Fallout 1, the BoS havent fought the Master's army yet, their hatred for Mutants isn't really there at this point
---
How is placing a tent our fault and not Bethesdas?  It shouldn't be happening in the first place.
---
Right after i reach ally with both factions lmao wow
---
Indeed is
---
YES. PLEASE. I have a near-constant loop of Pistol Packin’ Mama in my head, and I quite frankly cannot take it much longer.
---
“You” placed the tent.
---
Oh I totally forgot about the fires. Don’t think I even noticed them while being there. 
---
Thanks you
---
When you click on a workshop you click a button that says you want to PvP...
---
Good tip. Thanks!
---
Leedil?
---
The angry one would be so useful. So many people instakilling legendaries
---
Bethesda designed the game, S player is playing within its limits.
---
Canonically the Enclave never stop pretending to be the heroes
---
He's saying it's an in game item designed to be placed for our convenience, it shouldn't effect the progress of scripted events, it should have been accounted for or restricted if it causes issues that can't be fixed.
---
I get that and I agree that workshops are not the most optimal way of farming, It's just what I like to do. Plus you can farm things like brand new packaged food at the industrial farm. Can't do that as easily without that.
---
I think both are to
---
Blame here. If a tent messes up pathing, AI needs to be improved.
---
You missed the original point lol, you can opt out yes, but then you miss out on the new content. Where as before, you could just casually do weekly and daily challenges to save up atoms and buy whatever you wanted. If the new score system worked as points you could save and spend then maybe people wouldn't be complaining.
---
&gt; It’s not BGS’ fault 
---
Actually, I contest this. I've had at least three of the last ten Primal Cuts I've attended just time out because something didn't spawn. No markers, nothing, just a fail we had no control over. Then there was the time some guy put his tent on the drum so no one could even start it. Then there are the countless times no one else has turned up. Plenty of times where they have failed without it being my fault.
---
It's really a combination of these Tents, and sometimes the Prime Cut creatures getting in fights with other creatures. 
---
And there's also that it just fails because people aren't participating. You've got 7 minutes to kill 4 waves of creatures. Waves 2-4 only start once the previous waves start. If you only have 30 seconds left when the 4th wave starts, chances are you aren't going to finish. Which of the ones that have failed for me, that was the biggest cause. Though twice in a row it seemed to have failed because the last wave, with over a minute left never spawned. When it happens, I jump servers. I think sometimes it has to do with all the random items left behind lagging down the server. 
---
If that's the case, then it means we are doing it to yourselves. I've seen radscorpian eggs rolling around the Ash Heap by the dozen. 
---
Someone jumps on the posts near the drum, and never comes down. They just want to sit and shoot. That doesn't work, because the creatures spawn farther away each time. You have to actually participate in the Prime Cuts.
---
And the game goes for Grahm's Meat Cook. People love running around killing things. They don't have the patience to just stand and turn spits and play drums. Or clean. 
---
Personally, I'm not bothered. People will hopefully get it, and start doing better.
---
i think it was meamt to be a balancing tradeoff.
---
regular armor - legendary bonuses
---
power armor - higher resistances
---
but some builds make the PA's higher damage resistance barely matter.
---
What’s the issue with people keeping their character crouched during the event?
---
Zoom in on the map.
---
So... I should just give up then? No workshops for me since it has a PvP warning? I don't understand this point. I obviously know that it says this. I don't care if someone comes over and kills me. It's being hunted all over the server is what got me.
---
I got like 15 yesterday from sqb
---
I believe this is the case too.
---
Make multiple characters to distribute the excess caps to. When you see people referring to "mules" it means they made one or more character(s) that is entirely dedicated to holding caps and/or items so they can get around weight/inventory limits and the cap on caps on the character they actually play the game with. 
---
Not much. The very low value of caps in trading communities is why the prices for most things are inflated to the extreme and why many people won't even want to trade with caps at all.
---
Ok, that was always allowed.
---
Potato is the name of my sacrifices to Mothman. I mean Zorbo.
---
LMAO when you do manage to finally find a place to click and you just get the fast travel bug and have to do it again.....and again...and again.
---
This! Omg yes! I completed the season on Wednesday and yesterday felt soooooo freeing not having to log in and check the challenges and start looking for a team.  Finally got to put my lone wanderer perk back on and drop inspirational... it was glorious.  Wander around the map doing whatever with no real sense of urgency or time crunch to make sure I level up.  Not looking forward to season 2 and beyond ugh
---
It's a CAMP plan, called Small Letters Set, sadly it's one of the plans that people sell for a lot of caps
---
This is the way. Like 2 minutes day 3.
---
And the world looks much better imo. That greenish pipboy doesn't reflect some cool details.
---
There are stars on the right side of the card showing you if that card can be ranked up and what rank it currently is. If a card can be upgraded, there will be black stars. All the lock picking and hacking mods only have one gold star and no black ones meaning it can't be upgraded.
---
Yeah like Marxism
---
I want to do the “first time?” Meme
---
Excellent explanation.  Thanks for the info.
---
You can make the feed and give it to Cally for script instead, much easier to manage.
---
I've got this problem too, and I'm pretty sure this happened during the past Meat Weeks too. I could swear that during the Meat Week event they ramp up npc detection on all npcs, rather than just Prime npcs
---
I’m a sneaky sniper, my main gun is a hunting rifle and my backup gun is a Fixer, helps me deal with trash like this quickly.
---
To infinity and beyond.
---
Thank you , sir !
---
Can do perk in luck and walk around white springs looking in trash cans
---
I’m really low levelled rn so I don’t think my pipe pistol will be much help but I do use the drums and the spits but no one else joins me
---
You are not wrong. Everything youve said is valid but i don't see any thoughts about improving the core game. Quitting threads are lame. I've quit this game tons of times but i always return. 
---
Fallout would instantly become fun if the developers increased the gear and monster lvl cap. Double damage and resistance and make gear go to lvl100. Then all the duped shit is useless. 
---
Fallout just needs to work on its recycling. Better systems. Work on creating more nuke zone events/playable high level areas.   
---
I have 1500+ hours. This isn't really the end. You just gotta wait for them to realize nobody wan'ts to play a game without a health economy, pve and pvp.   
---
Also side not wait for AoC.
---
Sure.  If a player is aware of this bug then placing it is an asshole move.  But the games design shouldn't allow this in the first place.  If you give the player a green light to place it, then that suggests it's ok.  Can't blame this on the players man.
---
All they are doing is making outgoing damage weaker.  If anything, these weapons will be even weaker than they are now.
---
But if I don't center it on it how am I supposed to get the free scrap loot from the people who go in with bloodied builds with 10hp and then come out without power armor.
---
Side note who does an event like that with like 31 ballistic fiber and a shitload of flux on their person....it's like they've never emptied their junk or something
---
No mods or perks on, my gauss fully buffed on my shotgun character does 1818
---
thats kent connely from the Silver Shroud questline in 4. not Travis the Diamond City Radio dj.
---
very nice. I use an instigating myself.
---
Two failed events out of 3 tries &amp; no tents or camps, I’m even using Berry Mentats to make sure there’s no creatures suck somewhere, The problem is clearly not tent or camp related.
---
Kind of is. In Fallout, just like real life, China is a communist state. While they could have a Russian communist faction or a general communist faction, it would make more lore sense just to use China.
---
Hey, I have no love lost for BGS....still waiting on my deep pockets mods for SS armor.
---
I am merely stating that, within the confines of the game, if you want a better chance to succeed, move your tent,
---
Can Do gives different foods than the Industrial Farm, I know this because I do this too. It's only canned foods while the Industrial Farm can get you Sugar Bombs, Salisbury Steak, etc. Watoga is a good place for trash cans too.
---
Well, the Scip Lady Mole Miner is lonely so I'm sure she appreciates the company.
---
I just had a horrible thought....given that this is the internet  "Scrip Lady Mole Miner Rule34"
---
Try herbivore and cran relish as well. Might be easier to manage.
---
Opphhh good to know, thank you! Now I can improve my lazy vendor roleplay lol
---
neah. most of the ones i failed had zero tents or camps anywhere near it. 
---
The one in the bog and the mire failed several times despite zero tents being there. Ash heap a couple of times. There was a tent at the first ash heap i did and it worked. 
---
My camp is right near the event at pleasant valley and that has only failed like 2 times out of about 10
---
I think they gonna make a list of currently running event on the map screen in the future. They already did that for daily ops on the PTS...
---

---
Really? I've had those events active at the same time, on more than one occasion.
---
I was just frustrated by those digging bastards and I wanted to stay with stealth snipers,thanks btw
---
I use critical hit when i get in such situations
---
Is the radium good? I got a jffr one the other day but i never see anyone use them.
---
Actually I got chinese stealth suit already and I don't get how they found me
---
Don't know or care, but it's not what I said
---
People think I'm a little off because I keep saying the game is a mirror to life but here it is again. Where I work I run into selfish nut jobs that scream bad science and privilege about not wearing a mask (greifers) but 80% of the people I meet nice, civil, decent human beings. 
---
That remaining 20% would break down into 
---
* 1% asshats, 
---
* 5% mental or emotional issues that make them too inward focused to be social or pleasant. They might be rude but it's not done in a cruel or mean way, they are just not seeing you. 
---
* Maybe another 5% who are just not social or they are shy or just not chatty for whatever reason. They are the ones who nod hello and keep moving. 
---
* There's at least 5% who are social butterflies. They laugh a lot, chat your ear off and are so friendly they can brighten your whole day. 
---
* that leaves 4% of the people who are like this person. They are the care givers who make the effort to actively search out people who need help. They can influence a good portion of the 80% nice to do something although it's usually short term stuff but they will lead people into doing good consistently on their own.
---
I could only find super mutant stuff so... maybe you’re onto something?
---
Yeah, since corona I've seen that joke a lot. TP going for tens of thousands of caps. It was funny at first but now its getting old.
---
My issue is that like 3/4 of the prime cuts that I go to seem to fail.
---
It's like big bad meanie guy coming, better get rea....
---
EVENT FAILED.
---
Did you try using your camera?
---
Same 😒
---
Favourite part of this is teleporting somewhere and paying caps for the privilege, starting a quest and shelling out a load of ammo in an instance, only to be disconnected and dropped back at your CAMP. Perfect. Thanks.
---
Bet that goes away.  That seems too generous for Todd to not be "not intended"
---
Took me about 10 stubborn minutes of looking for my new Piano, before having to ask a friend who said it was in Chairs...
---
Sounds good!
---
Imagine being stuck in an instanced interior with butt loads of her bee swarms coming at you from holes in the walls!  Sticky 'honey' on the floor slowing you down.  Random Yao Guai's running in trying to get to the honey!  Pooh Bear's butt, blocking the exit.
---
See you next season.
---
So....like, you reach over and WASD your way around.  Stop moving then move your hand to your mouse and try and shoot?
---
F in the chat
---
They dont have friends and dont know how to talk to people so hunting you and killing you is the closest they can get to having a social interaction.
---
Deep inside, you know the answer ! They are just looking to make life difficult for some players. They aren't doing this for pvp, pvp in adventure mode is really boring. The meta in adventure mode is pushing you to use the most toxic weapons and devices to end fights as quickly as possible.
---
Personally when i wanna pvp, i just jump in the Nuclear Winter mode. There's no point to harass poeple. Whatever is their excuse...they lie...the wanna make life difficult for someone. They will often contact you to brag, so yeah...
---
I just want the ability to fast travel on the first try to save on the extra waiting time
---
Yea but they could do the same with PA, you'd just have to be a little more creative with it
---
In a private server I’ve failed it because some stupid scorpion decided to freeze and become invincible.
---
I’m nearly there. I’ll make it in time. I’m fairly new to the game having started playing at the end of June. I can imagine if you’ve played since launch the grind may be very old by now lol.
---
I'll probably take a little break after I'm done with the season because I'm currently hooked on Satisfactory. Remember taking breaks from a game is a good thing! Doesn't mean the game is dead or bad.
---
no, not completed event because i haven't launched a nuke .. I get so lost in there lol
---
I meant in terms of priority.....not whether you’re telling the truth.
---
U being stupid here, why 99% of players should suffer without basic qol, like transfering items between chars, because 1% decided to dupe items in a non competitive game, im not voting for duping, but if i have to chose between transfering items and duping, ofc im gonna choose QOL, most people dont give a shit about duped items, who cares if there is morons buying it for IRL money. Hacked items is another problem tho, like . 50 cal machine gun with splitter, they causing problems in public events
---
You forgot to mention the entire breed of pathetic tesla spamming scrubs. I was atleast impressed when one guy tried doing this to me with a bow. At least he tried to make it fun for himself instead of just holding a button and spinning in a circle.
---
Yep
---
Can't, I'd lose the +100 Carry Weight I get from Deathclaw Steak + Pepperoni Rolls. I'd rather take regular farming trips through fissure sites and squirrel spawns. 
---
Besides, with Meat Week going on there's an easy supply of squirrel meat.
---
I play on xbox and mine were doing that so I kept them plugged in and they stayed on.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/424802/update-on-hotfix-timing-for-consoles?language%5B%5D=en
---
I do this when I come across a camp that has been totally locked up I find a way to phase in (hasn't been many that have kept me out) then drop a you have been insulted note on the bed
---
Regardless of how you feel. If you take the workshops be prepared for people try take them from you. Maybe thats what you like to do. Well, most pvp is dead because of Bethesda changing things so its much harder to pvp. Now the easiest way to get a fight, is to pick one. And every workshop thats taken is a chance to pvp. If you want to farm workshops in piece get fo 1st.
---
You all ever think that instead of complaining every day about every little thing, that you should just take a break for a little bit if you aren’t enjoying the game? If the game is becoming like a job, then that’s on YOU not the game. Take a break and stop making these pitty post.
---
Don't worry you're not causing this with tents. As others mentioned, in all of these threads, it happens on public and private servers no matter if theres a tent or not.
---
I have about 1200 hours in the game. I finnished the run about 2 weeks ago and yes, together with The reputation grind, gold grind and everyrhing else im pretty burnt out. Really dont feel like grinding meat week now
---
Oh noooo, you can't cheat the game to get both settler and raider awards by making a transfer system. A transfer system that would also help a major problem that you seem to be downplaying. The problem of people getting duped items and even getting them deleted, or people selling stuff online for irl money. Let's make these problems worse cause I want to have a chinese stealth suit AND a gauss minigun on the same character!
---
U just gotta be sneaky, like a coyote
---
Yes me and the wife crossed the finish line last night and it's an amazing feeling
---
No don't feel bad. How much does this item usually go for anyways?
---
The main problem with Radium rifle is the droprate of plans when you scrap one. 
---
I have been running a J3325 Radium rifle (I mean, it'd like godroll and I should have been happy, amaryte ?) for months until I finally was able to do a trade for a J Fixer. During that time, I have been busy buying, crafting, trading dozens of Radium rifles just to scrap them and get the plans for mods. In more than 3 months I had a poor 14 mods available... And I did scrap. To a point I was constantly out of screws and steel.
---
I do not know what is the problem, if it is intended or anything, but that was ridiculous... 
---
This weapon looks great, nice design, really post-apo. It has nice damages too. But the recoil OMG. !! The recoil was always getting my char out of VATS as firing multiple times would make the rifle crazy and aiming to the sky in 3 shots... So yeah I do not even know if, with mods, it would stay longer in VATS, but I am sorry to tell you that this weapon is, at this moment, useless...
---
I finished a few weeks ago with no bought levels. Most of the score came from weekends where friends and i would drop loads of nukes and hit up all the high level events.
---
It was a relief to get it finished, but getting nothing for dailies and weeklies after completion is a bit annoying. If it's the same next time I'll take it a bit slower so I'm not left with such a gap at the end.
---
Think in what you enjoy better mate, not in what makes you more powerful
---
Technically doable but you only need one queen not landing to f timing up. We nuke a lot with our group and usually only do two at the same time. The first person launches, the second leaves at min 50% launch prep. 3 nukes preps with 3 people is doable but also soletiles leads to the third getting back to late. It all depends a bit too much on how much she lands.
---
Feeling the same, having just finished.  Yesterday I was even logged on at reset for meat week, Challenges bugged right out, first time it happened for me.  now im nervous it will "follow" me to next season.  
---
My regular playtime is only about 2 hours before reset, so for the whole season, I had to "wait" 2 hours before logging on, and lost 2 hours of playtime.  So I was actually playing much less.
---
Comes from playing NW.  If you don't want to hear it then you need to close and relaunch the game after playing that mode, on PC anyways.
---
Huh. I shit you not, i had someone on my public team last week using the angry fist emote a few times. Is it present on PTS already and he maybe got to use it in public somehow?
---
got this bug every single death. Im bloodied so when the strength stats goes off when your hp is more than 20% u ll get encumbered with this bug and u cant even fast travel to vault76 the only thing u can do is leave the server
---
Because you were there.
---
Seems like they could check through the FO76 forums and here and see when the first complaints of it happening were and then audit which changes were made during the patch before that report.
---
Thanks
---
It's weird to me because this is a thread about daily limitations in the game and my argument was about why removing them is a stupid idea considering the present state of the game and most of your argument has been about "Oh but the promises they made about FO1st and adding content to the game, etc..." which has little to nothing to do with whether or not removing daily limitations is good for the game.
---
Keeping in mind that they're working on content and have released content since making that promise, ergo maintaining the notion that they're putting forth the effort to try and do what they said they'd do but for some reason you're still arguing from the position that they aren't doing that, at all.
---
Those FO1st complaints seem incredibly selfish, too.  I'm going to argue that maybe they realized they'd get a lot MORE blowback from the community if they implemented any of those changes and decided to do something more reasonable.  I can't begin to imagine how many "Pay-to-win!" threads there'd be on this subreddit had they done what they said they'd do.
---
Whether or not a lot of people like an idea, has nothing to do with that idea being good or bad.  You should never argue from the position that because something you say or parrot is popular, it must have value.  This will inevitably lead you to say things because you think others share that sentiment instead of being scrupulous in determining if that idea has any merit.
---
This subreddit is littered with horrible ideas that constantly get upvoted on the frong page.
---
This is one of them.
---
Possibly had you recommended passing it off to another team immediately after 76's horrendous launch, ( maybe you had, I wasn't here ), it'd make more sense.
---
But considering we're in the process of them re-vitalizing the game and trying to infuse it with more content, content that the community has asked for, I don't see why we would just slam on the brakes and pass it off to someone else.
---
I'd say give them a chance to redeem themselves, first.
---
I’m saying you told the server you want to PvP and now are upset people want to PvP you. Workshops have to be contested. You aren’t entitled to uncontested resources just because you got their first.
---
I failed 4 yesterday, I only recall there being a tent at 1. With all the other posts about this, it may not be factual.
---
Not remove... “Replace”. 
---
If there’s 6 daily challenges and the level up one in one of them, it would be way better replace it with another doable challenge so we’ll still get 6 daily challenges worth of points instead of the 5 if they just remove it.
---
(Got be specific when asking stuff of Bethesda... It’s like a genie. Ask them for one thing and they’ll take the worst possible way of doing it and use that as a “fix”.)
---
I'm playing this game for like 3 months or so, yeah it's grindy as hell, but honestly I don't feel that burned out, it gave me some purpose what to do in game, because after farming the hell out of Raiders rep I was like.. okay now what? xD A lot of challenges were way too easy, so I didn't do them on purpose. If my challenges didn't autocomplete yesterday I'd be there in 2 days, now it's gonna be three which doesn't really bother me. It was okay, I enjoyed rewards and even the process. I feel sorry for people who got autocompleted challenges more than just once tho. I hope they'll make it.
---
I liked to do that in FO4 as well, but I found that after a while it would stop spinning if I had no ammo loaded. Does that happen in FO76 or can you go nuts?
---
After you applied the paint did you back out and put it on to see what color it was?
---
Well thus explains why sometimes I show up late, the 5 min mark, and itx already complete. Keep that in mind as well
---
I've been lacking, can I finish before it's over?  Currently at tier 52
---
I love pa and I dont pvp unless peeps press my buttons and I'm a full tank/heavy gunner build, I'm kinda glad pa is not flavour of the month, all I see is boring bloodied builds everywhere
---
Yup. I get it every time after NW. But before I got another weird bug, where I didn't get any messages at all. For example someone bought something from my vendor and out of nowhere I got +1050 caps with the sound that plays when people buy from your vendor but no message.. Usually when the musical notifications happen it's a bit annoying but I was kinda glad to hear it because they fixed my notifications xD
---
I killed one of them and the other noticed me and slashed me like cutting paper(I was at low health and i only get 140 defense
---
Because it's one of the major content additions to the game this year, as well as the only way to earn atoms, and it was intentionally designed to pressure people into daily log ins, rather than at their own pace.    
---
It could be a much better, more player friendly system with a few minor tweaks, and it's good to let them know if we are not enjoying the system as it's currently implemented.
---
You could do 50% bloodied, you'd get +2 Special and 50% damage just like junkies but be a lot tankier than 20%. Only problem is you lose some radicool, all nerd rage and adrenal reaction.
---
I stick my rifleman teammate up on the meat drum posts so he can hopefully spot those far away spawns and direct me towards it for a sprint and kill. Seems to work pretty well. The key seems to be to kill things as fast as you can, and sometimes enemies do just start running away. The meat piles are probably causing issues too, and I think the mobs shouldn’t drop anything, just the occasional random legendary and the prime beast itself. Not that I trust Bethesda to change that without causing issues at other events and spawns lol
---
I know a lot of people run around grabbing critter chunks but don’t forget the Chally poo, spoiled leftovers, brush fires and greens! They’re important too.
---
My game crashes 3 or 4 times a day lmao
---
Chinese stealth suit is not works on them lol
---
I feel you. Totally.
---
This is my thinking.i wish I sold the rare stuff early on...I mostly scrapped,dropped or unloaded at a vendorbot. Ignorance is bliss.felt like a ass once I learned all the rare stuff I let go...scout masks
---
Jumpsuits etc
---
It's a thing
---
Fact - Fallout 1st tents affect spawn points.
---
It is a contributing factor.
---
I was wondering why the same name xD
---
Been doing fine this entire Legendary Run about taking over the Workshop for the daily, never had the workshop pvp experience cause the workshop resources are not worth it at all. I took over the workshop and forgot to go back to camp after taking it over to avoid this issue. I come back from getting a Bang and there he is, mr.player level 300+ plus, took screenshot and video of it. He 1 shotted me with some sort of explosive weapon and proceeded to tbag me. I was like okay, not mad, thankfully i had stored my junk to fast travel near the workshop. I spent the next minute or so looking for his CAMP he had nothing but ammo for sale. it was like a couple hundred of a few ammo types, so i purchased it all, he gives me the thumbs down and leaves the server. I have my DMs on Playstation set to friends only, but im sure he tried to send me a typical troll message.
---
Im not even mad and i usually don't reply about situations like this, but right now i felt like typing. At the end of the day, i feel bad for these people man, its a mental issue that leads to a troubled adult life.
---
\*Lag server intensifies\*
---
What's the ammo maker doing? I want to avoid any and all exploits if I can help it, is it that free thing you get from the atomic shop?
---
3 levels away and I'm looking forward to being done. Nothings to hard about it, other than leveling up every day. It takes a fair amount to level when your 367a and your alt is 106.
---
Screen shot?
---
No its a glitch were you can place an ammo maker from the abandoned muntions factory in your own camp.
---
I pretty enjoyed my build,except when my sneaking status become "Danger" and surrounded by tons of enemies
---
Well, it would be awesome and hilarious at even parts. 500 weight means I have one of a hell backpack.
---
It's because of all the bloody tents
---
Wow! These look awesome!! Imagine the effects! Could be super fun!
---
Nice fixer, I rolled almost the exact same one earlier this week. I’m using an instigating fixer at them moment but I’ll probably chug a bunch of chems and booze this weekend and switch over to the junkies
---
Yes! Thank you for this! Brand new player trying to figure it out!
---
Exactly. I once killed a wanted player who didn't wanna be killed, but I was curious if I could do it. I felt bad and it was boring. It's much more fun in Nuclear Winter and it's fair, if you don't come across a cheater ofc.
---
I've finished it that way almost a month ago. July 24th to be exact. No cheat, exploits or shit like that. Bloodied power armor build (solo) without extra INT from unyielding... and yes I was burned out also.
---
At first I was happy I can finally play the game whatever I like without worrying about challenges but a week later I realized it is kinda boring and almost nothing to do without them...
---
I can't wait for season 2 tbh...

Full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Been running this build for 200 odd levels now and love it

Autogrenade launchers aren't half bad tbh.

On the dot?

Does anyone have a date when they will put COLOSSAL problem on console. So far we got the even yesterday for Meat Week so that's good.

That's how I got mine after 1k hours in game haha

Bingo.

I mean no one does workshops, ever, unless some quest asks for it.  They are pointless.  Only a few quests are worth doing if you are done with the bullion grind.  Once you have a suit of armor and a weapon set for your build you should never have to mod them again.  Picking locks and hacking terminals require perk shifts for useless rewards, or worse, no rewards.  Not everyone is into camp building, or they have a nice camp built up, and are at max budget so they can't add anything more.    
---
Really all there is for a high level player to do is 1) intentionally do score challenges 2) run the few quests with worthwhile rewards 3) hunt for legendarily till your daily scrip max is hit.  Maybe kill the queen... but eh, why?    
---
That's really all there is to do between seasonal events for high level players.  I would never do more than half the seasons challenges if I weren't doing them intentionally.
---
I keep making posts about changing the way seasons work but I get flamed every time I try.
---
If you want change, you have to ask for it, right?
---
You do know that there are many different  3-headed monsters scattered throughout mythology...right?
---
I’m pretty sure the angry fist is in the game with the Blood Eagle pack, if not it’s very very similar.
---
Southwest would be more exactly. But you ll see it in that area when the event pops up
---
The “nerf” is in the PTS
---
*"Do, or do not. There is no try."*
---
Yoda
---
Haha no I know, I'm a stealth too and as soon as the wave starts it goes straight to danger mouse
---
Agreed.
---
It can be but the down side is that the super optimised builds make it next to impossible to handle them with a general purpose or pve build, they take no damage and basically oneshot you
---
I really hope this isn’t the case, that or they reconsider. It’s not like being a sneak build gives godlike powers, and I can’t remember a time where I’ve pissed off an entire group of players. It seems they’re hitting any bit of diversity in character building and shrugging shoulders at hacked and magic weapons. 
---
I can’t speak to bloodied, it’s not a build I’ve used, but as far as stealth is concerned, are they really gonna be salty because I can choose not to engage in combat to accomplish a goal? As I recall, it’s kind of a core mechanic in fallout games. If they want us all to play the exact same with the same builds, they should just issue them to us. This passive aggressive “bug” system is getting old.
---
Amen
---
Be great if they didn't add challenges that require workarounds like this.
---
I’ll be done within a week. 
---
Didn’t burn me out, but I also did not enjoy it. Would rather play the game the way I want to play it.
---
pick up the Chally poop
---
Sorry, I meant on the hour?
---
I burned through 5 new characters this season for leveling
---
Private worlds don’t do too much for the legendary run, actually makes it harder if you don’t have people to buy/sell from
---
But I‘m at rank 98, overall I didn’t mind it too much, for a couple of weeks I was really annoyed because I felt I had to log on, and often I wouldn’t do all the challenges becuase of this, but once I got my commando’s bloodied Build going and I was working on quests it was fine.  
---
I am burnt out though, I have zero interest in doing Meat Week right now, even though I missed it before.  Honestly, I just want to play something else, I’ve started to have the “JRPG“ bug again, and may go over to playing some of those for the meantime, since nothing pressing on 76 will make me log in
---
or not cave in the entrance until the timer runs out. So even if you die you still have a chance on heading in there and loot the boss and wendigo's
---
First time playing through and I'm stuck here too.  Tried some of the suggestions here and I couldn't get it to work. My checkpoint is after already putting the blood sample in. I tried going to the computer first, or replacing the fuse first neither worked.
---
Someone should make one like destiny 2 which you don’t need to be in game to switch items out and so on.
---
the rewards i got but was unable to loot the boss and the wendigo's. Doesn't help either that i needed the acid they dropped :/
---
There is such little time to work with on primal cuts, I just kill everything regardless of it being legendary or not. Don’t have time to wait for all the other dingleberries on the other side of the event area to tag it.
---
I always ft on a teammate there or just go to 76 and walk down.
---
Someone's needs to tell him about Chimeras, that's three completely different heads in one.
---
Yawn
---
All my slots are full of mules holding stuff haha. I have to stick with my 2 that can still move
---
You can move the map around, but you knew this, right?
---
That little creek works good. Just walk up to the eggs and they should come out. I also get a legendary mirelurk there every so often too
---
the nerf is in the pts but this has nothing to do with bloodied weapons. some legendary weapons are bugged and can kill bosses in a few seconds.
---
Congrats bud. I'm close to finishing myself. I'm at level 94 or so. I haven't done any grinding per se, I just play a lot (too much) and ranked up without much extra effort. I played NW enough to get to Overseer rank 16 but that was more for the accidental holiday rewards than the Run score, and I haven't played since they patched it. I generally complete all the dailies except NW now and ofc the weeklies as well. 
---
I am starting to feel burned out for the first time since starting this game but that has more to do with being overwhelmed by legendaries I can't get rid of and maintaining multiple characters in an effort to maximize scrip. I am burning myself out. I love looting and rolling for better weapons and armor, but having nothing to do with the duds other than toss em on an alt for however many days or weeks til I can scrip is getting tiresome. I could sell them for caps, I know, but caps are meaningless and I'd rather have scrip. Meh.
---
After i respawned outside the cave i just waited for the rewards and went off from fallout. It killed my motivation to play the game for the rest of the night.
---
Oh yeah, major agreement -   
---
I got curious about the new Collossus event when I saw it pop up on my low level character. A bunch of people were doing it so I figured I'd hop in and kind just pick up the lore notes to see what the deal was. Long story short, I fell in the shaft and spent ages just sitting on the platform waiting for the team to kill Earle. When they finally did, I got the rewards for it as well despite hiding the whole time. &gt;\_&gt;
---
Well, when most of the level 100 items don’t owe properly (*cough cough* the board game board)  I can understand why some are disappointed
---
I agree, I can't wait to finish so I can spend more time wandering around collecting scrap like I used to do.
---
If there's a bug it's 100% game devs fault because they designed the game like this, players might not know and put tents, that doesn't mean it's their fault, it's poor game design. The game shouldn't break because a player performed a simple action.
---
Man Beth has me feeling like dad. I'm not mad anymore, just disappointed.
---
The level up issue was fixed for me a week into the event, just create a new character literally takes less than 10 minutes to level up. Also last week i notice another method, you can level up three times with the same character, once after crafting the weapon and armor, again after boiling the water and another after baking the steaks. Now i don't need to make a new character every day. I can easily earn the other 4 level ups with my normal character though the week.
---
I think it's because it happens so much that they feel that if they don't do that they won't get anything themselves, it ended up being like that at fasnacht
---
Nah he's not really, even if I know what you mean ! You can build and farm ressources in their. I mean public workshops arent made specificly for pvp, amd yoy know it bro, you guys need to stop speaking like it is... 
---
We both know workshops don't worth to fight for, their's plenty other way to farm your material more efficiently. Players that go in there are mostly relatively new to the game and actually need a place to gather ressources and practice their building skills.
---
To make it short, players like you dude are asking to these players to not attempt to invest ressources in the workshops as soon or later someone will come to test their defense.
---
It's not right to reduce these locations to a simple pvp area !
---
I’ll take the guass from you. I’ll trade whatever you want from what I have
---
I'd like a "wait a minute" emote
---
Im at rank 89, missed alot of days, never farmed the repeatable. didn't do half the NW unless it was super easy like place your camp down. Mostly played around 45 minutes to complete the daily on the days that i wanted to continue Ghost of Tsushima. Never really felt rushed or scared of not completing it, I've been playing the game at the pace that I've always played it, yeah sure i didn't complete it 3 weeks earlier, im still going to earn all of the rewards and even if i don't make it, I'll just buy the last ranks.
---
I burned out for 2 weeks. I only just got back into the game 2 days ago. I'm not even sure if I'll finish the run but I don't care anymore.
---
If I can get all the atoms from the run, I'll consider that a win.
---
With the bonus daily SCORE, I'll be done on Sunday and glad of it, having skipped six days due to a short vacation and having played an average of 3 hours every day during the Legendary Run. And yeah, this is not a sustainable way for me to play the game.
---
From what I've seen of the rewards for season 2 from players on the PTS, the only thing I'd love to have is the glass house building set, and I will categorically not grind three whole months for that. So either it'll eventually come to the ATOM store, or I'll simply have to go without.
---
TL;DR: I'm within days of finishing season 1 and I plan to skip season 2.
---
Mine does, too. It usually crashes RIGHT BEFORE the event ends that I’m in. So, no rewards for me. Boooooooothesda
---
Thanks for the explanation!! And doesn't even matter which country it is it's just great that people do their best to help in any way possible.. it was just totally foreign to me in terms of how the message was set.
---
All my slots are full. 2 play able chars. 3 mules, I can't just make a new char haha
---
Damn that sucks
---
Mess with Grahm, mess with fam
---
I have that one in my camp too within eye sight of my bed and workbenches... maybe I should swap those out now
---
The Junkies weapons are all very nice.
---
Don't kon of I'm just lucky, but since I put away my bloodied gear I haven't had the FT bug.
---
Done Primal Cuts about 15 times so far. Only the last one I just did at Savage Divide had a problem and failed - there was no tents or camps anywhere near. For about 8 of them yesterday (I kept going back the same place) someone had a camp right there and the enemies would just spawn inside the camp. So in general through my experience so far I'd say I disagree with this post.
---
I'm not on console but I think the same, not cool :(
---
none of them is particularly valuable and some and really bad (like the EE25 lever), you can get some decent trades (JE gatling gun, TSE handmade) or in some cases a handful caps at most (TSE 10mm).
---
depends on your platform, too.
---
the fixer, gauss and shotgun are most notable ones.
---
Every hour, on the hour
---
Gauss rifle is worth a lot.
---
I guess your right about the private worlds not making much of a difference. I was thinking for the daily leveling up and that measly 100 SCORE per 10,000 XP. I imagine those XP heavy events like Radiation Rumble, Line in the Sand, Guided Meditation, etc are awesome for XP farming in a private world.
---
Im at rank 89, forgot to log in a few days, never farmed the repeatable. didn't do half the NW unless it was super easy like place your camp down. Mostly played around 45 minutes to complete the daily on the days that i wanted to continue Ghost of Tsushima. Never really felt rushed or scared of not completing it, I've been playing the game at the pace that I've always played it, yeah sure i didn't complete it 3 weeks earlier, im still going to earn all of the rewards and even if i don't make it, I'll just buy the last ranks.
---
You sure can - create a new character, run down to the wayward and talk through the hold up scene, build a weapon and armour at the overseers camp and bam - level 3 and score gained.
---
You do need to be on your main character for selecting the consumable rewards however!
---
If you think about it, it is a fault of BGS as they haven't moved the perimeter in which you can place a camp or tent near events, despite a well known bug that has been here for a while and involves placing a tent. It's not like people will know this is happening too. I don't place a tent and expect a bug to occur, my crystal ball isn't that good.
---
I can see what you're saying though. I've had it fail with no tents around, more so than with tents. Most of the playerbase don't have Reddit and are probably unaware of this, you can't move a tent that belongs to someone else so it's really down to Bethesda to fix this issue
---
You got a lot of decent stuff, hold on to that TSE Gauss, it no longer drops.
---
When i get home from work I can take one.
---
Thanks I see a lot of them traded and knew they would be solid. My main is a 223 melee build but has cards for heavy weapons.
---
Don't think you need to go all New Vegas here and having two new variants of the lever action in the Repeater and Brush is a little unnecessary. Personally? My picks are...   
---
**Rifles:** M1 Garand (Fallout NV Battle Rifle), DKS-501 (Fallout 3 Sniper Rifle), R91 (Fallout 3 Assault Rifle)  
---
**Shotguns:** Lever Action Shotgun (NV)  
---
**Pistols:** .45 Pistol (NV), Chinese Pistol (F3), Deliverer (F4)  
---
**Heavy:** Shoulder Mounted Machine Gun (NV), Heavy Incinerator (F3)  
---
**Honorable Mentions:** BB Gun (Bring it back, you cowards! You're afraid of the BB meta!), Classic skins for applicable weapons (ie. F3 Hunting Rifle, F3 Sawn off Shotgun, F3 10mm, etc)
---
I am rerolling a new stealth alt right now because i didn't check the forums before doing the campaign on my 77 stealth char... and missed the chinese stealth suit.
---
I am trying not to make that mistake again hence this post. Thanks.
---
TSE was heavily nerfed. Their still good though if you don’t have anything better. The highest damage weapons in the game currently are bloodied then junkies.
---
maybe, i’d rather just do my typical legendary mob run
---
You're assuming everyone runs bloodied stealth commando. 
---
I'm a full health commando, and if I don't get my stealth damage modifiers, I can't kill the bullet sponge enemies before they run up and one shot me.
---
The trade-off with stealth is you are a glass cannon. You sacrifice survivability for high damage and the ability to remain hidden.
---
showing my age....
---
Why in the unholy fuck would I want an app?   The game is an escape for me, not another job to track everything.
---
I’m already on my phone and computer for work 10 hours a day.
---
Lol, ok here’s the real reason it’s not going to happen:  dev resources already two thin.  The pro bono folks would need clear and open comms with dev team also not going to happen.
---
I’m already keeping a long wish list of what MY dev team could do if we had more resources (different industry, not gaming).  Most of it revolves around the little QOL things for clients that never make it to the top of the Agile/DevOps treadmill we operate under.
---
Just sharing my thoughts as an older IT dev mgr for many years.
---
That answers if it is any good in the current meta.
---
Because you took a damn workshop and agreed to PvP by doing so dumb dumb.
---
I think this game has a lot of Minecraft elements. I joke all the time that’s it’s Minecraft for adults. I still enjoy it immensely.
---
This would be great but they definitely need to polish it up a bit. Getting rid of hackers should be their top priority.
---
They’re just listening to the portion of their playerbase that likes being angry about high dmg counters. For whatever reason, a lot of people on here celebrate the meeting of any build but theirs. Have had multiple people tell me my build shouldn’t even be allowed to exist...
---
It’s the same reason Junkie, berserker, and bloodied players are so ticked at this nerf. Bethesda didn’t reduce the cost of the penalties we have to take(addictions, low armor, low hp) they just destroyed our dmg advantage. As someone who runs bloodied and a tank build, while bloodied is definitely better it was by a small margin. I can’t even run at less than 30-35%hp usually which is less than half the dmg I do at &lt;20%. Just a shame BGS doesn’t know the difference my between nerfing and balancing.
---
the shotgun, really? Nice and thank you. Do people use shotguns still? I remember when tse got nerfed everyone stashed their shotguns.
---
Is this event from PTS? or  was it already in the game?  I never know it
---
The super sledge is a really good farming weapon for saving ammo, dont know what it would be worth tho. You should wait and see what happens with The upcoming nerf. The value might change.
---
thank you
---
I have suggested how to use maths to factor the edge geometry so that the AI could have another metric and make stealth actually viable. Not that they read this stuff. Stealth needs another metric to make it more skillful.
---
I use them for two days to complete thirst things first also and try to get the fireman outfit.
---
I think I traded a good bloodied melee weapon for the Fixer. It was the one gun I really wanted.
---
This is the main reason i'm not going to complain about the AFKers sitting on the drums. The only problem is that if you don't show up right away, you can miss the event. I was finishing a Prime Meat and they overlapped and i didn't make it to the cookout in time.
---
I was thinking this was a thing as noticed it was more full when using the drums
---
Good to have it confirmed
---
Put out the fires......scoop up the poop.....clean up the intestines....collect wood.....collect greens.....
---
Don't just stand there doing sweet FA people.....
---
Magic/hacked weapons Will probably forever be OP
---
it's been my main weapon on my 223 melee character since I started playing the market when the game released (shortly after). I have a few furious and vampire melees, but traded or sold most of the bloodies.
---
like people saying that bloodied is 'op' and 'invincible', your take on sneak is just as misguided.
---
for one because it doesn't work in groups. the multiplier doesn't trigger if your target is in combat with anything else, including players. so unless the entire server is sneaking around in scorched earth for example, you won't be seeing that 3X multiplier on the queen. or even the critters, really.
---
and two because sneaking *properly* does require a lot of investment. people think sneaking around the golf house and getting spotted half a dozen times, but still in time to kill the ghouls, is proper sneak. it's not. go inside the resort and start shooting robots, see how long you can remain hidden. ***that's*** actual stealth.
---
Looks dope with the dirty Mr Fuzzy costume too
---
I’m in a similar situation too, I used to at least be helpful at events, but my guns might as well be toys now that I’m insta-danger. And I used to love sneaking around to revive downed players, as I felt that was a contribution as well (can’t blow the enemies to hell but can keep you alive while you do). It’s so depressing. So, in your experience, where do I go now? How do I respec my sneaky sniper?
---
Yes it’s prob a great gun. Idk I got rid of all legacies I had back when game first came out and before they removed them from game. So I just am trying to get one. But hey if you don’t want to trade it’s cool. Shoot me a message if you did. I think it’s against the rules to trade on here anyways
---
Ye, ive been looking for one exactly like that for what feels like ages
---
I made a 2nd character just to be a mule but never followed through with it. Basically rockin' the 1 character and all the inventory struggles that come with it. All my 12 strength points are devoted to weight reduction cards (also batteries included and thru-hiker). For certain boss fights I'll swap cards to increase damage and fight over-encumbered.
---
Hopefully you will continue to level up at least once a day and randomly chew 5 pieces of bubblegum on certain days even after you finish it. I'm looking forward to being done, but until then I will continue playing without my 2 favorite weapons just in case that repair weapons challenge comes back, as I would hate to miss getting credit for it.
---
Same here.
---
They are made for PVP. They are pretty much the only dedicated place in the game for PvP. 
---
And why is anyone investing resources in a workshop? They come with their own set of resources for building up if that’s something you want to do.
---
yeap, exactly. It has always been a mod that adds it to the combat helmet.  Maybe when/if they finally add support for mods we'll be able to port something over. i doubt we'll ever get enough support for something like armorsmith extended though :P
---
some people do. they're making a comeback thanks to some glitches. the nerf, if it comes to pass, might shake things up a bit, too.
---
TSEs are not particularly good but a TSE15r is probably the best roll you can get (in its class) for a pump. someone might pay a pretty penny for it.
---
At the very least I will shoot you a message if I end up posting a trade thread on the other subreddit
---
Hard.Core.
---
Just get an armor piece with The "15% chance to aviod damage while blocking" effect and use it in vats. It Will demolish anything
---
Are instigating 1 handed weapons any good or sought? I have 2 of those with 3\* as well but I didn't post them
---
it's also how I was able to make "gun" alts or off specs, playing melee for a year and saving ammo, lol
---
unfortunately the timer is against you. the creatures seem to spawn much farther away from the central location than they did last year, so i've had to do a lot of running around. you can't wait for them to come to you, you've got to go to them.
---
I'm sorry if this sounds rude but did you read the post? Or am I bad at explaining it?
---
This was never about PvP itself. If I just got contested and killed at the workshop I would have never made this post. It was about being chased to multiple locations. If someone wants a workshop from me I'd just let them take it. I tend to share resources with anyone who needs them and I frankly think it's insane that you got the idea that I want to be selfishly free from risk while hoarding all these resources. 
---
I like to build and farm things, if someone wants to take a workshop I've built up to actually use it then I'm 100% fine with that. But in cases like this the only thing they wanted out of it was a target.
---
This was never "I should have no risk while I farm all these resources and I am entitled to all the stuff and no one can have any but me".
---
This was made because I know players like this don't need any resources and also don't need workshops to farm them if they do.
---
Just because PvP is enabled does not mean you have to shoot at everyone you see.
---
that shotgun is a "magic" shotgun?
---
with one wasteland, my 2 shot fatman goes from 3304 damage to 4000+ damage, and it still feels like shit. sadly the 2 shot fat man is the only usable fatman that I have found
---
Part of me is hoping they have plans to access these points in the future in some way.  
---
The Vault's been moved around heavily, and with the Pump section completely removed, it makes you wonder why they'd leave in doors to Residential, the Generators, and Vault Control, only to have them blocked by Strangler vines.  
---
If you're not going to use them, you've shown you can take them out, so it feels like there'll be more there in long run.  
---
You're not missing much, terminal-wise. Some of the emergency protocols, stuff on the engineer's terminal, technically one seed bank terminal but it's just a repeat anyway.  
---
The meat and bones of 94's data is still there, and still interesting.
---
One handed is not very popular. 2 handed or unarmed is what People want for melee. Its not useless tho, i use a bss assultron blade on my heavy gunner and it works pretty well. It's just the worst of the 3
---
What a dumbass idea, I'm glad I totally don't share a server with you or anything! That would be awful!
---
Any explosive energy weapons are worth more than any amount of caps, people sell them on eBay for around $50 to $100
---
Vault-Tec was banking on humanity's failings; that was the experiment after all.  
---
"How long will it take these pacifists to go murderous after we open the door?"  
---
Evidently, almost forever, as they'll be killed by crazed Wastelanders.  
---
To add a bit of salt to that, consider that most of the Vault Dweller corpses we find are the ambassadors they'd sent out, unarmed and unknowing, in the Wasteland.  
---
I always take a moment when I come across them now.
---
Nerf is no live, also won't be much of a nerf when magic guns are around.  
---
Stalkers FFR 90 LMG. Broken magic gun hit one point only and boom dead, whatever it is doubt you would even need to reload.  Want to see it die faster Junkie/instigating/stalkers FFR minigun with accelerated barrel. Oh yeah you need to be close but does it matter if it dies in 3 seconds?    
---
Personally have found stalkers to be the most consistent(bashing if using the 2nd star for magic), the real trick is having great hip aim so the more steady your hip fire is the higher the output. It is all about focusing on one point with as little deviation as possible.
---
No, but IF you use that armor piece any shotgun becomes magic. So IF you add the explosive and two shot it Will work very well
---
OP bash damage... new meta
---
Great to know I will be able to get something good if I want to trade it. Thanks. That seems a bit extreme! But maybe I can get a couple things for it.
---
Maybe you just got lucky ;)
---
I understand and that makes sense based on what I was watching on youtube. Thanks!
---
Total relief not having to log in every day to do S.c.o.r.e.... Bethesda got me on that one, I wish it was  a week full of challenges instead of daily.
---
I have a second Xbox and just have my second guy playing while my main is running around.
---
It's happened to me a bunch of times, I submitted a ticket but never got an answer.
---
The only solution I found is be be logged out and have the game completely shut down while the new challenges update.
---
Yeah that is what I thought / also why they are just sitting on my vendor.
---
This has always irritated me about PA. Where does the game think my backpack went? I can see it clipping through my x-01 so I KNOW I’m still wearing it.
---
There's some very good and very long fallout playlists on Spotify. Some of them have like 300 songs from all fallout titles + songs that sound like they belong in fallout. Yes, it would be nice if Bethesda did something to increase variety themselves, but this is a very easy solution.
---
It is a legacy but sadly one of the least sought after legacys, its above dragons. But not many folk want the Tse gauss (from my time on the xbox market)
---
Underground critters that pop up always get stuck. I had critters spawn into trees.
---
;)
---
Sounds like no ones heard of Cerberus lol
---
Look at the udders and the mouths on the heads.
---
Those areas are much darker than the clean one. 
---
Personally I prefer the moo moo outfit over the atom shop outfit.
---
I hope you enjoy New Vegas. I just finished another playthrough a few weeks ago and had a wonderful time. What a good game!
---
Preach
---
Nope.
---
I feel like the same thing happened to me once... Are we going crazy here?
---
A bit off topic but are you supposed to get legendary scrip everytime you hand in 5 primal meat? I didn't notice receiving any and I'm not maxed out on scrip either.
---
In your pip boy under data/ quests / daily, select the quest you do not want.  On Xbox, you can hit X for reject on most, maybe all, of the daily quests.  I have only seen this option for the dailies.
---
I think and actually hope they fixed it. I got jelly fingers tonight (or in our house wobbly phalanges) and it actually registered
---
Server wide crash twice yesterday, that I experienced. Both of these happened a minute or two after Primal Cuts became active.
---
&gt; it was intentionally designed to pressure people into daily log ins
---
The entire problem summed up neatly.
---
I have a mule account with 5 characters maxed on caps. On my main account, I have a mule character maxed on caps. Decided I wasn't going to create any more mules. So, I buy mutation serum plans, gold bullion from Smiley, ammo from player vendors, recall cards for Encryptid, power armor plans that I don't really need, etc. If I start getting picky about an item or price I remind myself that the alternative is creating another mule.
---
Ummm, I looked at my inventory?  If that gets you banned, there will be literally zero players.
---
They've all been spawning up on the spit platform on my servers for whatever reason. Last year they were on the grass.
---
That does sound doable but I was thinking more solo. But thank you for our response.
---
”all my workshops” how many did YOU take? If you take more than one you are asking for trouble.
---
Both times it happened to me I was in the savage divide, near foundation. Both failed without very showing the dangerous prime beast.
---
Then your not just being carried, you are contributing. Imo anyway.
---
I saw on another post that someone said the scrip is added for every 5 pieces turned in, but doesn't always pop up to tell you. I didn't pay enough attention last night but when I get on tonight I'll be watching to make sure
---
Thanks, but I'm on Xbox.  I have another Tesla, but it's not a vampire Tesla.  I really love that gun.
---
Treasury notes
---
When you take a workshop, the signal you are telling everyone is “hey, I want to PvP! Does anyone else want to PvP”. 
---
Someone shows up, and kills you. 
---
When you go to another workshop and take it, you are saying. 
---
“Hey that was fun, I still want to PvP! Does anyone want to PvP?”
---
Said player comes back and fights you. 
---
I read your post. I’m explaining how workshops work in this game.
---
No you should not feel bad!  We have all sold stuff dirt cheap before we knew what we had.  You could always message him/her but I would be happy with your find.
---
Did you buy any ammo?
---
I’ve played through twice and my recommendation is to wait to do any story-based quests until lvl 50 to get max rewards. You can do events and dailies and grind to 50 pretty quick just exploring while in a public “building” team. Claiming workshops have decent xp provided you leave the area after claiming to avoid PvP. Killing ghouls at white springs is still a great place to get Xp.
---
I built a level 25 crossbow to replace my level 25 bow, and the xbow does less damage?? Then what’s the point lol
---
No, everything there is trash. Let me take them off your hands. You don’t need that junk taking up space.
---
good to know
---
Just tried this and it worked - twice now.
---
Nuked Monongah Mine and did the Colossal Problem Event then Nuked Prime Site and slightly just after the Scorch Beast Event started the Colossal Problem Event popped up too. 
---
Had enough time to take the Queen down and then port into CP.
---
Graham literally tells you what to do lol.
---
You can use it in power armor. That’s the only benefit.
---
That’s actually good to know, thanks for that
---
Hey, lay off the broadsider. He's trying his hardest to be cool and unique.
---
If they have a diner camp be sure to leave them a slocums woe note. 
---
Found at the original slocums joe
---
Everyone clamoring for the bloodied nerf to make it off the PTS still doesn’t understand that it’s magic weapons that are responsible for massively fast kill times.
---
Your English is better than mine and that's the only language I know:)
---
Also a fair stance as well. As for me I could care less regarding the sense of accomplishment surrounding the amount of ammo I am forced to craft on a daily basis because my Armco ammo constructor is too slow to pump out 5.56 at a rate comparable to my rate of use.
---
Pretty sure he mentions the drums,spits and the bonus if you fill all spits or drums respectively. Its a good video if anyone needs an overview of the different aspects of the event.
---
I figured that's what Bethesda will say, but there's no harm in reporting it.
---
I know its has a timer...it won't complete AFTER we've killed everything...
---
Nope. I did buy 1 Halloween candy though and it was 1 cap each and only 70 total so even if I accidentally got all of them I'd only lose 70, not 10k
---
Feed chally.
---
I thought I was the only one rocking the pirate costume. I've never seen anyone else wearing it. Now I need this barrel.
---
Which ones lapsed, if you remember?
---
I was hanging out on a spit ahead of time, not prepping just getting a good spot and the drums were all full.. we started with half a bar and were done with over 6 minutes left on the clock.
---
I know there's some bugs but conceptually meat week really works; it encourages public play, low levels can participate, has related events (primal cuts), direct deposit for your legendary drop.
---
Is it just my luck, or has Grahm completely stopped carrying rare items? I see a cuckoo clock once in a while, that's about it. It would make sense for him to have plans from meat week, another chance at some rare drops would be nice.
---
So what everyone gets the loot from the Legendary enemy then people complain they can't find the corpse to loot it, so they have to make it stand out so at that point why not just give the legendary item as a reward to the event. So then you have people just join AFK collect the reward and leave not helping the event at all. 
---
The reason the lvl 468 guy gets the leg enemy is not really about gun size its because he has done the event probably 30 times and knows exactly where they spawn from. Once you learn the events getting tags on the legendary is not that hard to do even as a lvl 30-50. Yeah sometimes you wont have a shot but that happens. 
---
And there are plenty of legendary enemies out there in the wild not associated with events . The whole basis of the fallout game is to go out there explore and find things to loot. Not get it hand out on a platter.
---
It kinda does.
---
If everyone is guaranteed loot in an event, nobody will waste their ammo, just wait for others to do the job and enjoy their free rewards. It’s gonna be lose-lose for everyone. Just level up, try to shoot fast and tag everything especially the legendaries, and you’ll be rewarded, it works fine. A guaranteed reward system will not do any good to encourage low level players, much like socialism, it’s gonna kill the motivation for the capable players. Some events such as Radiation Rumble are very unforgiving, you wait for everyone to tag a level 40 legendary, and some scavenger is guaranteed to die, this happens every time I do it. There goes the chance for any rare drops. Especially when the low levels are also melee, it’s just suicidal.
---
I love the prefabs but trying to get them to sink in the ground is ridiculous. 
---
They need to extend the foundations and allow them to go deeper into the ground
---
Get on the drums and smoke a spliff 🙏
---
Add actual appalachian music. Stringbean, the stanley brothers, mearle treavis. Dark as a dungeon and 16 tons are great, lets get more like it.
---
Scrap it and remake it?  I just built mine two days ago and it worked fine.
---
Ahh I found em, you’re right. Get a good chunk of the bar every time I put out a fire or picked up a pile.
---
If you find yourself a little over-encumbered after the event, there’s a crate of beer on the picnic table between the drums and the cooking station. I live mostly at my carry weight limit and these beers often allow me to fast travel back to my camp.
---
Those are people who haven't realized the drums and spit keep the progress bar from falling. Trying without is like pumping air into a leaky bicycle tire.
---
I always thought the big barns would be awesome. Kinda like the one at Dane Rogers compound.
---
At least they became or were good people, killed by people that had fear of everything after the bombs dropped, that's cruel world. Even after that, we succeeded to save vault 94 and avoid another change by the G.E.C.K! Well vault 94 is one of the most interesting place in fallout 76. But maybe Bethesda could have some time to add again residential room. Just another question,   where did you find that tag next to your name that says vault 94?  I want it!
---
Doing a few primal cuts this morning, there was one guy on the server who turned up to each one, and ganked every single legendary almost (sometimes other people got to tag it, but he'd kill it so fast that even if it looked like you got a few shots in, it was probably already dead by the time your shots registered). From the thumbs down emotes I know it wasn't just me being crap, and everyone knew who it was killing them because he had a gatling plasma and every legendary was reduced to a pile of goo.
---
There is a special place in hell for him. I hope you got yourself a one-star wooden arm-piece
---
For my part I did accidentally kill a legendary mole rat before I think anyone else had a chance to notice it. There were just so many mole rats around me and this legendary one was dead before I'd even noticed it was legendary.
---
Tried that already 😕
---
" -We now have a chance to get the Meat Tenderizer plan. Learning this plan will allow it to drop legendary from the Purveyor, her mystery picks, and random legendary enemies. The weapon itself is still in the drop list as well. "
---
Fuck yeah, baby!
---
I begun the game a week ago , and im not even trying , i play Fallout's to get away from the online crap and season pass , and just because this fallout has it, doesnt mean i will care about it
---
Having alot of fun exploring and running from shit 20 level's above me
---
Though the non clean version isnt listed in the reward list. Only the hat
---
Might give it a try.
---
Thanks.
---
Would be really cool. I hope they make human npcs more difficult because the story ones I’ve torn through them in like a second when robots and creatures can take quite awhile depending on what you’re fighting .
---
I finished it today but the legandary run doesnt open to get my last price:-(
---
Was not aware. Thanks for letting me know 😁
---
Restart game? Sorry I’m not being helpful. Trying to throw whatever help I can what little I’m giving. Lol.
---
*Chuckles in doing just that* I’m not putting hours that are similar to working a full time job every week for this game to win some prizes. I wouldn’t for F3, FNV, or F4. Sucks they took all the Atom and put it into the seasons permanently. 
---
I still have the game downloaded but I haven’t played it since beginning of June. If the score points didn’t compound on itself, it wouldn’t have been too bad or have a cap. 
---
I find no enjoyment with how limited they’re making things. So many currencies, time, and space limits. With each content addition being made, it seems they are adding more and more.
---
Lol it’s fine, I appreciate it anyway.
---
Fast Travel means you have a 25% chance to instantly go to some known locations, everything is RNG now to keep you in the game longer.
---
well not if you're in hardcore map mode
---
Oh maybe different location.  Mine was roughly east of the top of the world.
---
Also had to fight 1 today for a quest that kept instantly refilling health
---
How about full health commando??
---
You can get the Solar armor set, and use a vampires rifle while solo, and a medics when teamed up.
---
Then try tracking down some stimpack diffusers and  equip some medical perks.
---
Lmao 😂🤣😂🤣
---
Be fun if it added a sneak multiplier. So people had an alternative for sneak rifleman over unyielding. Like “ does 3x sneak damage with a fully equipt set “
---
She's trying to hide from the synth upstairs who keeps incessantly talking about her.
---
Maybe check if certain items you bought are stacked? I’ve bought plans before and accidentally bought a whole stack once
---
He probably was just bored
---
Last night I actually had success going from the Mire/Bog to Savage-Divide/Ash-Heap.
---
The easier events seemed to be crewed by less experienced people so they tended to still be active when we finished.
---
I turned 2 of my mules into playable builds thanks to a month of Fallout 1st
---
or the camp's owner could log off without returning
---
About having a camp at max budget
---
Isnt possible to just , scrap and replace something several times to get the challenge?
---
I understand, thanks for all informations
---
All the spawns are jacked this year for whatever reason. I don't really question it anymore honestly lol
---
Thats not what a mule is.
---
I'm 2900 SCORE from level 100. Figure I'll finish it up tonight, then take a break from 76 for a couple weeks.
---
Sadly with covid and having a 6 month old even a month if fo1st is off the table haha. Most of its for caps anyway, don't have the time to invest in another char, love my main a lot anyway. Heavy guns for life
---
Where did i mention bullion rewards in my PREVIOUS answer? But if you want to talk about them, they should be account bound. And *problem* is not relevant for 90% of people, most players dont even use reddit and you can hear rants about duping here only. You overestimating it much. And btw, you can have BOTH Chinese suit and minigun on the same character if you do quests in right order and farm rep afterwards, my character have all rewards
---
Just because they're low level doesn't mean they are new. It could be an alt account someone uses to pay it forward by giving shit away. Or they just want to get rid of it. What would I do? I'd move on.
---
Snitches get stitches. /s
---
Just report them. Exploits do harm other players experience whether or not they think they do.
---
Yeah a heavy gunner has been my most recent build, they are very fun but not the most efficient killers.
---

---
The auto complete bug has been hell and Bethesda hasn't done a single thing to help us!
---
I've seen this happen where a distant Molerat just keeps surfacing and digging in the same spot over and over until the timer ran out.  When I finally found him the event ended.
---
I thought the same thing about destiny 2. I was very wrong. The app (and the apps made by fans that are better) are really a great way to speed things up. It makes the "tracking" you mentioned way less of a chore and something you can easily do between load screens.
---
That said, I just don't think 76 really warrants an app. There's not enough useful loot to switch around where being able to do it while on the toilet would really save that much time. End game typically locks you into one or two builds based on your perk cards so there's really not that much to switch around... A general ui overhaul so that things don't load like garbage would be a lot better.
---
As well as a huge variety in game play. So many different weapons that function differently. There is no beat heavy like there's a best rifle. Throw on bear arms and carry as many guns as you want
---
I thought Arktos Pharma were the originators of the scorched plague... another reason to blame the OG raiders since David Thorpe was CEO of Arktos.
---
I keep hearing one with explosive rounds is like one of the rarest things ever.
---
It’s hard to say, as I think there’s still a lot of fun and useful parts of your build, but without perk loadouts or legendaries there probably aren’t a lot of ways you can hold onto your build and go for another. I don’t think it needs to be immediate as long as you’re still enjoying the build, but probably your best bet to go for a stealth commando or lean more heavily into vats or one of the better optimized builds that don’t sacrifice your def/hp like Junkie’s. You can always take it slow though. Find yourself a good weapon and some armor that may favor that build a bit more. Then once the update comes and you’re sure you don’t wanna stay stealth sniper you can just spend all your lvls at once
---
Yeah gattling gun/plasma Caster for sniping, minigun for clearing out excess ammo, Gattling Plasma for a surprisingly ammo efficient weapon, and a Gauss Minigun for an incredibly expensive overkill win button.
---
But that means less time for chicken thighs and rabbit legs to jump right into my inventory!
---
I only had a few pvp encounters but I think I'm ready for the next one.Recently traded for a quad tesla and a explosive cryolater.if I cant kill them with the tesla at least I can slow them down for a few seconds with the cryolater .I blow at pvp
---
Loot! Loot! Loot!
---
I'm ok with balances.but will a bloodied rifle still be the same at 50% health as a junkies rifle same specks at 50%health?There is alot of info going both ways kinda confusing honestly.
---
And fixed, thanks for the update Bethesda
---
I'm 1-2 spaces ahead of the alien. I've played every day and completed almost every challenge except for Nw and I missed a few gain a level challenges. I just don't have a lot of time to play so I haven't grinded out that much experience. I hope to get done before the season ends, but, I am pretty burned out even so.
---
I saw few days ago a player selling 3 for barely even 200 caps each, I snatched them all
---
Im saving Atoms cause I known I wont max out on my own, so when the pass is gonna go away ima cash out with my saved atoms
---
Collecting Greens, putting out fires, picking up Chally’s poop, throwing down Chally’s feed and donating wood that you are carrying on your toon are all things you can do if/when there are few critters.
---
It's delayed again.
---
I wish they would add a new boss every month or so.  Even more short encounters like heart of the swamp.  Or even epic encounters that don't involve fighting.  A naked race against a ghoul horde in a cave.  A resteraunt where you have to cook certain meals in under x time.
---
That u get hit with haha
---
Don’t get fooled by owner’s level, many are alts either leveling up or just managing their vending. I’ve even run into low levels (1-20) that runs trap camps.
---
I love the “aiming for end of the week”. Apparently their aim is terrible.
---
Last night I did this.  Found a few one stars, nothing special.  Lots of junk and meat.  Free stuff.
---
Then I went to the main event, hardly anyone shows up and we fail.  Irritating, but that’s life.
---
Then I check Bubba Gump meat man for a couple plans I didn’t have.  (He had them).  The real find though was the VE90 minigun he was selling.
---
Ild like to thank the duper who put that on him to make someone’s day.  (I don’t know if it was duped or an accidental sell, but I’m keeping it.)
---
Loading screen 76 :) add the fast travel bug and it's a complete package!
---
Imagine if Bethesda put this much work into it
---
With the cluster fuck that is know as legendary perks I've learned not to hold my breath
---
Any source for this? I’ve been looking for posts, but nothing addressing this.
---
Yeah there are 3 categories:
---
- Legacies (prob duped, legit)
---
- Magic (game glitch, legit)
---
- Hacked (not legit, welcome to PC)
---
Are you talking about the feature that was supposed to come in May? You know, the one that keeps getting pushed back to oblivion?
---
Yes! I am level 95 and almost there! i can’t wait!
---
Erm. Double that and add some. Trade only for top end gear or legacy
---
Shit luck. Theyre a rarish roll for him. Same with Mirror ball plan and Radiation Emitter etc (still havent got that one yet myself). They arent plan he always carries, only ones he has a chance to carry. What the actual percentage of chance is I dont know
---
End of the week, but which week?? 😂
---
Must be using VATs.
---
One more time; you can miss 15% of the challenges and still finish the season. That’s  whether you’re skip NW every day (which accounts for only 7% of the standard SCORE points) or you skip some days completely. 
---
That doesn’t factor in the eight double SCORE days. It also doesn’t factor in the repeatable AT ALL.  It also doesn’t factor in using Atoms AT ALL. 
---
And finally, if you don’t complete the SEASON... *so what?*
---
Not an event but you do have Jessy the cook or whatever I Berkely, sometimes she appears as legendary for me.
---
The lag on my Xbox1X is so bad it's unplayable.
---
If they're giving stuff away they are probably not new. I have a lvl 23 alt that sells serums, legenarys, high lvl plans and basically anything in between. This player probably just has a full stash on his/her main
---
I used them alot at release. I see you didn't, well i presume you didn't, or you just took some workshops around the forest idk. Defenses and generators can eventualy be costy. I'm not gonna go further, as i read, you probably never really hanged their alot to test some shit. I mean it looks like it is just not your thing.
---
As i told you...they're absolutly not "dedicated " to PvP. Unless you are rich or a dupper, their is no point to pvp there. You gain nothing out of those workshops. 
---
Again...Nuclear Winter is there. Pvpers in the Adventure mode are mostly trollers running around saying that workshops are "dedicated" pvp areas with hope to provoc something...you know what i mean lol !?
---
Its not possible to list an item at 0 by accident really. That price still needs to be enetered same as any other price. So Id say it was intentional
---
A B3325 handmade with explosive would *definitely* be ***exceptionally rare***. 
---
I tried the event yesterday. Spawned next to a guy started event then his camp is built over me...stuck in the foundation...went to private server got killed and respawn bug.tried it 3 more times I just cant die due to that bug r.n.so am I just too heavy?unyeilding and wwr armor?
---
It would make too much sense, sorry
---
They're super fun to use in pvp. My friends and I stock up with 50+ and see who can kill each other first lmao
---
For God’s sakes.... thanks for sharing, especially since they didn’t bother to broadcast this past their safe space...
---
Thiss is the only thing I can’t figure out.  How do we feed chalky moo moo?
---
Ok! I can see the fun in that! but otherwise they are a waste of space?
---
If it didn't exist before, it probably does now.
---
Yeah I'm at level 89 so figured I'll be finished next week and I'll take a break for a bit as I have most of the things I really want from the bullion for now as well.  Season 2 will have to have some really neat rewards for the grind or have it be a bit shorter so it doesn't get superbly tedious.  I was pretty content with it until like level 50 before it really became more of a slog but I really want the secret door and the captain cosmos stuff so I pushed on through.
---
I’m waiting to see how bad the nerf is once it leaves the PTS. I need the multiplicative damage to use the weapons I like (lasers) which are absolutely unusable without it. The team behind the game is so inept they still haven’t fixed energy weapons properly, and if this nerf takes away my ability to play with weapons I like, there’s no point to staying and playing and hoping it somehow gets better.
---
They need 4 or 5  endgame bosses, with one wasteland they need one per region. Each place needs to be nukable for something like queen or collasus.
---
It’s free scrap, essentially. Once you get the plan you can make them yourself if you want.
---
I'm close! At 94. No atoms spent.
---
I kept Daisycutter just because of the very low weight and as a way to use up all the mini nukes I collect without throwing them away, since people never buy them no matter what price I offer.
---
Unfortunately... They're okay for tagging mobs, but a grenade is definitely better. They're a novelty item honestly.
---
And if people want to catch up or complete the season. They do the daily’s which include NW. where they do what needs doing. And then leave. Because as a low level with no way of winning it’s not fun at all. They should never have included it in the score or made certain challenges build a camp x 3 in Nw/adventure. They’re forcing people who WANT to compete score to go to NW and piss off NW players. It’s got nothing to do with. Can complete. Want to complete. Don’t need to complete. All totally irrelevant.
---
Mumbles can eat a bag of d*cks and I'm pretty sure she killed a companion and stuffed them in a hole in the wall in the basement.
---
thx
---
This!  Or click on the Moonshiner's Shack or even 76 itself!  If you have a 1st tent, place that nearby.
---
How does it stack now?I know it adds but I'm on console and read alot of craziness.some say you get better damage w junkies at low health etc.etc
---
Menawhile I'm at level 39 started a week or 2 ago xD
---
They were supposed to be introduced in 2019 man. Its been a hell of a wait
---
Technically Earle is human.
---
Cool story, bro. Awful lot of effort for something you dislike, but you do you.
---
Oh of course, but he was saying he gets all the challenges done incidentally without looking at them and I would infer suggesting that such a thing should be simple, I was just trying to lay out how increeeedibly unlikely that is for an advanced character.
---
Thanks man, I've been seeing the mirror ball and the rad emitter loads, which is why I thought the clock might be different.
---
I actually picked up a spare rad emitter if you're on PS4 and want it!
---
Which brings us back to: *don’t play NW if you don’t enjoy it.*
---
Have you checked your vendors? I’ve seen my icon suddenly change to hidden. Usually if the main power source has been destroyed they shut off.
---
Or you got the bug that moves all vendor/items to stash. That one is a big pain because you have to restock the vendors yourself. And make sure to re display anything that got taken down. You may gain camp budget and build stuff before you realize where it came from.
---
I really am surpassed the game still runs at all on the consoles. I played since launch on a Xbox One X, quickly getting to level 232. In my time I ran into so many issues that are not present over the course of two level 200+ characters. I’d regularly get less than 10fps on my One X- sometimes even going into single digits for several minutes. I simply don’t understand how Microsoft could have allowed something like this to launch in such bad shape.
---
Sort of like using the commie whacker? fun but essentially useless!
---
My apologies, there have been so many features that have been pushed back that it’s hard to keep track of when which feature was originally introduced.
---
There’s a spot just west of foundation that I used bit easier with just three normal works.
---
I had that drop last year not sure if it was on my main but also had it drop again a week ago from uranium fever. 2 masks 3 jumpsuits
---
It's a bit of a joke lol got to love it
---
Nice attempt to put me down. But to no effect.
---
Nothing
---
Nothing it’s worthless
---
Man, Beth can't even make sorting options and hiding non-learned recipes persistent across play sessions. Don't try to make them run before they can walk, they trip over too easily and too often as it is....
---
I don't know why someone downvoted you for not understanding something, but have an upvote for "foreign." I lol'd.
---
Which brings us back to people being forced to play to get the score lol. Bethesda have done it simply to encourage more into nw. Because the mechanics are totally against a new player. It’s not fun. And all the vast majority of new players are dojng is what score says and then quitting out. Annoying NW players who want a full team to compete.
---
Meet week is broke too apparently, can't find any posts on it. Guess its back to Ghost Of Ts
---
Yeah, we don't have him on consoles though
---
If I don't experience at least 3 disconnects in a 5hr period on my xbox from playing fallout 76, the rest of my day is just ruined.
---
Hmm...your VATS hit chance when in range would go from 95% to 95% :-|
---
I have an experimental mirv that I found randomly and I keep it on me (I have heavy guns perk so it weighs less than the mini nukes ha) and use it for nostalgic purposes or giving people a little fright in their camps
---
&gt;a deranged Clark Kent with his tighty whities
---
TAKE MY UPVOTE GDI X'D
---
can confirm, i did this yesterday. got there with 1:25 before it started, instantly hit the drums and by the time the event started it was already 1/2 to the first marker
---
Thats sweet of you but Im sure Ill be able to grab it myself over the meat week festivities. Most of the reason I dont already have it is I hardly ever see Grahm anywhere. While the event is on he will be staying put in that spot so Ill be able to check him out far more frequently
---
Yeah a youtuber i follow Digi does gaming said this saying he's only seen two.
---
I play on a PS4 Pro - upgraded the hard drive to an SSD. To be frank, since the upgrade the game runs relatively fine. It’s quite simply the lack of updates and features - while consistently delaying them - that gets to me more than anything. 
---
I might add, it isn’t like the content is that deep like some other MMO’s that manage to add so much, consistently, without a hitch. I’m not a programmer, and I get COVID is mucking everything up for everyone, but DAMN.
---
Abusers are losers ?. You talk in many tongues.
---
The thing is if someone is destroying the game for themselves I don't care but if someone is destroying the game for all then I do care and I don't know the impact this exploit had on the game ..
---
Because Bethesda keeps making their game worse and I take it out on the rest of the playerbase
---
96 and a half right now, hoping to finish it by the end of this weekend or during the week. Missed a few days during it all but it’s been an alright grind I guess.
---
There's are some big plants called Greens around the area you can pick. You can also buy a Chally's Feed recipe from Grahm and craft extras yourself.
---
As above, however I think I saw someone discuss a proposed legendary perk that might make it useful??
---
Would people who play music really understand that? I think that kind of people are a special breed
---
In what way useful?
---
I ran meat week on xbox a number of times last night without any issues, apart from a few spawn problems due to people parking their camps and tents on top of the event site.
---
Was doing all those things but only 4 of us at event.
---
There were only 2 of the fat man plans so if I got them all it would be 240. I bought 1 out of 70 Halloween candy and there were no stacked magazines. My own inventory didn't have it stacked when I went to put it in the magazine rack either. Same with stashing spare blueprints.
---
1. After learning the plan, 3
---
2. Extremely rare. A B/40S/1S has not been duped(yet) and might be the rarest possible drop(currently)
---
3. yes
---
Those are a good source of vendor bot caps if you're doing this each hour.
---
Already platinumed that, along with Kingdom Hearts II, Sims 4, and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture. I was kind of looking forward to getting back after my gaming vacation, but...well... you know lol
---
I think it's a reward from one of the workshop defense events. I usually take Gorge and Charleston Junkyards, Hemlock Holes, and Grafton Steel, so that might help you with where to look.
---
If you're on PS4, I think I still have the plan for sale for 50c. PSN is Joshhatesfun if you want to add me and have a look
---
To bad Bethesda is the laziest company in the gaming industry
---
A nuclear winter battle royale is different than people being able to have fast paced PvP using their own weapons and gear. 
---
I’m not really into PvP, been playing over 900 hours, but know these are dedicated pvp. Zones. They game warns you that before you take the workshop. Sure you *could* spend your own resources building them up, but that really would be a waste since there is no workshop persistence in this game.
---
The new Daily Ops (in the PTS) has one of the enemy types listed as a Blood Eagle. I imagine they would have a tough mother effer to fight at the end. My hope would be a level 100 legendary Blood Eagle badass in Power Armor with a explosive minigun or something of the sort.
---
Also, isn't there a gauranteed legendary Blood Eagle miniboss at the end of Riding Shotgun?
---
So you will get a tenderizer plan and after that you can get it from the event only?
---
You can get an angry fist shaking emote from the Blood Eagles bundle.
---
Give it a few years and I'm sure you'll be a bit more mature!
---
Then how did I get all these rewards from meat week?!?? This bloody chefs outfit! These Chally the moo moo outfit? These plans?!?!
---
Tbh can't remember - I think I was watching an Angry Turtle vid about them, but even then it's probably too limited a situation to justify it I suppose.
---
One on the drums, one on the spit, and two collecting.  If the four of you are on mics the one on the spit can go into photomode and point out things to do/collect.
---
Grahm sells the recipe and you craft it ahead of time to bring with you.
---
Hacks! /s
---
Events been fine for me as well.
---
I can kill Earl in ~10 seconds with a Junkie's Explosive minigun. No chess, alcohol, or food buffs. I don't do it anymore on Adventure but I'll probably try to solo it on a private server sometime.
---
Greens aren’t the same as the feed - greens are the big green plants and there are only a fixed number of them. Once picked up they are deposited in the cooler. Chally feed is crafted once you learn the recipe and requires razorgrain, carrots and tatos, and you put that on the pile of hay at the event once every 30s to boost the meeter
---
Some of us just don't need caps and want somebody to get use out of good rolls that our characters aren't going to use. 
---
If something is "too good to scrip" I'll put it in my machine for a fraction of the market price.   Hopefully someone that is still trying to find a good weapon will benefit from it.
---
Yeah, I only took a 76 break just now after only the PC got Colossal Problem so I got ghost this week. meet week yesterday as much as I could, now the event wont start on the hour.....And this another delay till "Tuesday". Siiiiiiigh 😆
---
No event uses the same lost as the purveyor mystery pick which is the whole pool.
---
The tenderizer is now part of that pool so you could get it from purveyor roll, events and as far as I'm away a creature drop as well.
---
It's a fallout 1st exclusive!!!
---
Really its just finding those critter spawns. Sometimes it may seem like they're not spawning but check behind drums and the turn in station for meat and greens, theyre usually there
---
lol yeah all 3 people who downvoted, what a majority.
---
No one is forced to play for the SCORE.  I’m not the only one that’s done the math. 
---
In very simple terms. 
---
If you don’t play the NW challenge you can skip about seven days and still meet the goal. 
---
If you play the NW challenges you can skip seven extra days. 
---
That’s the only difference. 
---
Play the NW challenges and you can be finished approximately by end of Week 8. 
---
Don’t play them and you’ll be finished approximately by end of Week 9. 
---
And once again, that doesn’t factor in the eight **BONUS SCORE** days. That’s another 8 (different) days you could miss.
---
You could miss 15 days (as long as those weren’t double score days), never get a single weekly repeatable for the bonus 100 score, **never play a single NW challenge**, never spend a single Atom, and still complete the season. 
---
15 out of 70 days is 21%. 
---
You could miss over one-fifth of the days and still complete the Season and never log into Nuclear Winter *once*. 
---
You are not being forced to play NW. You are choosing to do so in order to finish early or have more flexibility with the days you don’t play or how much grinding you do. 
---
It’s one of ***MANY*** options. It’s not forced. 
---
Math wins versus emotionalism.
---
Yeah. I bet they were running fine for him.
---
im at 93/100 most of my weeklys still undone, so ill be done by the time 2x score is over i think
---
I finished the run a few days ago.   It feels nice not haven’t to do my daily grind . I long on for meat week and that’s it . It’s been nice
---
Then, I will answer more simply, no - there isn't but we're all pretty sure you're mistaken or confused about the problem anyway so likely moving for no reason.
---
upvote for visibility. this is a great drop
---
Mine are all called Tempy - but then I had to roll Tempy2 because I used Tempy to get a level in NW once and she’s a hair away from another level. If that challenge ever returns then she’s ready!
---
Guess I'll keep trying, worked fine 10-12 hours ago.
---
I have it and seldom use it... there is always a puddle of water somewhere...
---
That’s curious. How has he seen a legendary with *two* secondary effects?
---
From the sounds of it, they were good people before they went. Part of the suffering of Vault 94 is some people were late and the door is automatic. Evidently they could hear them trying in vain to get in, and despite being the Overseer, the engineer had no way to override it.
---
I think if we hadn't fixed the GECK we wouldn't get the same amount of rapid change in the Mire that we did before. It'd just become a progressively worse radiation leak, probably turning that area into a sort of "glowing sea" like south Boston became.
---
Not a great option in any case.
---
I'm hoping so. Again, it's weird to leave their doors in but block them, while pulling the pumps entirely.
---
Go r/fo76 and on the right hand side you should see a drop down menu, beneath create post, that says "Community Options."
---
Click the little arrow and you should see "User Flair Preview."
---
Click on that and you'll see the different flair options.
---
I've thought about this so many times. How good would it be to able to a quick inventory check while you're at work/on a train so you can start planning your next session.
---
I finished a few weeks ago no cheats or exploits or atoms and im 1000 % burnt out.
---
Lol I didnt even know there was a Sraeon completion thing. Im just playing like it is Fallout 4
---
Sorry man! I dont think there is much to do. Bethesda has Come out and said that they cannot replace lost score. 
---
and tickets are not being addressed if i assume the posts on this sub is The norm
---
Im not sure myself.
---
Shit luck, I haven't been looking for it as my common meat week grabs are the rad emitter, metal picnic table, and mirror ball. I hoard them for a few months then I have a steady income at 1500 caps for the picnic and 3500 for the mirror and rad emitter. Though the tool chest being  a hard to find on him has netted me a 7k sale, still haven't gotten another one yet to replace that as I wanted it on another character.     
---
Guess I need to add domestic and starburst to my list though.
---
It's the easiest to get. This would be purely to keep your food/water meters full easier. I don't have a list on me right but I'm sure both of us can find Herbivore based foods for our own playstyle.  
---
Considering how that stuff is so easy to find, it's the ones with Carry Weight and other effecs that we want.
---
Yeah, this happened to me once.  I died after Earle was killed (side note: they really need to stop with the damn ceiling drops when Earle dies) and, for some unknown reason, was respawned back in the Forest.  With a teammate, no less.  The game promptly booted me from the event because I was no longer "near" it, and denied me the rewards, or even the opportunity to fast travel back.
---
So it will be the “mele fixer” but exclusive to a set amount of players?
---
They asked how to feed Chally. Who do you think is eating those greens?
---
If I don’t see it myself, I won’t believe it. If he just *said* he saw one, I’m more than a little skeptical.
---
It dont mean one triggers the other.
---
Manhunt is about arresting and returning mad  dog to jail.
---
Jail break is about his buddies trying to break him out of jail.
---
Well.. To be fair it is cursed..
---
Somebody drown too many sims in their life time? 🤣
---
I was on the Spit yesterday and getting shot at, I may not be running around like a crazy looking for an opossum but it all adds to the status bar.
---
I posted this knowing full well someone would say this lol
---
I would just like my display weapons to be shown...how will anyone know that cryolater I have for trade is quad explosive?
---
Here here!
---
As someone who's not participated in the score system and legendary run at all, it has been interesting watching people have a go at it. It really does seem like a cheap way of extending times between content patches by making people grind endlessly for cosmetics. I wonder if they'll ever have an atom shop sale that bundles together all of the items from the legendary run? Sell it for 3000 atoms or some shit, I'll bet they do, and I'd bet people buy it in droves.
---
:D
---
This fuckin guy! OP knows his meat!
---
He mentions the drums and spits but he doesn't take notice of the extra progress made during the waiting period before it starts.
---
Ahh, ok. I misunderstood you then.
---
I think I've heard it suggested in the past that Stalkers on melee should basically increase the range of VATS, similar to the Blitz perk in Fallout 4.
---
Right now, it doesn't do anything and really has no business even spawning on melee weapons, which are either 95% or nothing already.
---
Cooked glowing meat and blood!
---
Care to explain? Or some context? It was a simple post, I'd of thought you'd have better things to do than post completely unrelated comments on a Fo76 Subreddit.
---
Aye. So much meat.
---
I'm ODing on food buffs.
---
WUT!?!
---
"Mele fixer"
---
I have no idea what you're asking.
---
&gt; meater
---
Nice.
---
Last month I think
---
Us, Grahm specifically mentions that the cookout isnt for Chally.
---
Why do you play an instrument when you can just turn the jukebox on?
---
Turning the spit is VERY useful, keep doing it. ;)
---
Its an interesting and cool idea. 
---
I for one am sick of a 270 carry weight with a backpack that drops to 220 in PA.
---
Damn
---
Again he calls it an explosive 2 shot Handmade rifle he uses it in pretty much all of his early videos Digi does gaming is the youtuber i might be interpreting him wrong but thats what he says in the video.
---
The greens are for people. Grahm even says something about it, iirc. Something about how some humans don't eat meat.
---
I been saying the same shit about GTA5.
---
It's gotten one or two updates to the radio in like 6 years?
---
At least that is two more updates than Fallout has.
---
04 August, 2020.  It was to be released within patch 21.
---
I'm sorry to see that this event has been upsetting you. What problem are you dealing with right now?
---
Try a few server hops, things in general seem a bit more laggy then usual overall.
---
Sucks they are not starting for you.
---
Or just put them on the naughty list and make them play with similar minded people for a week
---
Just turn off the in-game music and turn on a Spotify playlist. I have one ready to go if you want. It's not a straight copy of 76, instead it has a bunch of songs from the previous games + songs from the 640-1240 ConelRad mod from 3/NV. It also lacks some songs I hated. 
---
I never know if linking is allowed, but whatever here it is if anyone wants it. https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2RjzDCv3sdpdWTnhDCsOCU?si=zb-KPQOmS1e4aWLTTqvzzA
---
So, just a Two-Shot Explosive Handmade?
---
That’s uncommon, but not as rare as this. Just the fact that this has three effects compared to two makes this more rare.
---
It's just fun, I even break out my bloodied death tambo. For me the event is super fun when a bunch of people do it the "right" way - playing instruments, using instrument weapons, etc. I get that most people want to just blow through it with guns like any other event, but I don't really need the reward. I just like the event because it's fun.
---
Fallout is my favorite series.
---
Spent around 800 hours on Fallout 3 and that was just with the PS3 and 360 versions.
---
Ahhh...mods.
---
I’m at 92 right now but been kind of lax the last couple days. Ever since I became allies with the Raiders I haven’t been playing a ton for some reason. I get on and try to do the daily score but if I don’t level up it doesn’t bother me.
---
Leveling up is the toughest one for me. I just need to stock up on the right foods and drinks and actually sleep in game.
---
The pirate costume should have had a peg leg. They have the ability to do stuff like that. Modders put synth arms on as a cosmetic in fo4. Would be awesome to have stuff like that.
---
Pretty much yeah. The only people that can get one are people that have the plans. I got one and just learned it. Didn't realize the rarity. Probably should've traded it
---
lol
---
Yes this is what is said in his video again i dont know much about guns in this game i'm just going off what people say.
---
Mine don't hit my machine I just wait till somebody comes along who needs it.
---
just the whiplash of it being slated to release then delayed then slated to release then delayed then slated to release then delayed
---
And it makes his head hurt.
---
Sounds dumb, battle royales are about surviving first and foremost.
---
The backpack plan is on of the rarest from the event I think actually. Together with the tenderizer plan.
---
No, this tato salad is a meat week exclusive recipe.
---
totally possible tbh
---
Melee*
---
it means it's time to grind for gold again, feel like I need that T65 taking up stash space
---
YES! Please, people!
---
I like!
---
Not really. That's just what the list is called. Rare is relative.
---
Damnnnnn haha! That’s wild
---
It's possible.  The highest level player I am aware of with no exploits is the twitch streamer Alrex who is around 2230+  
---
Normal?  Not really.
---
1. I've been a fan of the series since FO3.
---
2. I actually like to play events with other players.
---
3. I have depression quite often and video games help me escape and keep my mind occupied instead of doing drugs and drinking.
---
Yeah... That's not very professional on their part, and it undermines a lot of confidence. This is definitely effecting a lot of us and it does suck that we can't do anything :-/
---
Some people are expecting a bloodied version to be the strongest 2h melee in the game.
---
You think that's crazy, I think there's at least one lv2000 out there.
---
I think you may be missing the joke or not completely familiar with the weapon stat system. To be fair it's a lot to remember so no worries. 
---
Each gun can have a total of 3 perks. Each of of the slots can only contain certain perks. So a Two shot Explosive 25%less vats handmade would be a real gun. A bloodied 33 vats critical fill 25 less vats could not also be explosive (that's the joke comment) as that would be 4 perks. Explosive goes in the second tier perk replacing 33vats. Yes they are rare, but just as rare as this roll. Explosives have up side and down sides, so they are not always the best for some builds. And explosive doesn't do Jack to some creatures.
---
Not sure if you've seen anything from the pts but it's filled with crap. It actually 'rewards' you with radaway, radx, stims and super stims
---
Here I am, impressed by every lvl 400... lmao
---
I think it’s every hour on the hour
---
They just need to overlap event over people.
---
"Magic" (read: damage exploit) weapons.
---
thats a metric shit ton of can traps..
---
I noticed that last night on the only one I ha time to do, me and 2 other guys jumped on the drums just messing around waiting for it to start, and by the time it started we were already at halfway.
---
Very cool.
---
I wasn't playing last year, but I can see why folks were hyped about it coming back. I love the primal cuts events and the cookout was like one big party with everyone running around derping out. 
---
Just wish the rewards were a little better.
---
Just love the world
---
Shit be spoilers for 2/3 of Fo76 population lol
---
Not really. I should have tried that :p
---
It what capacity does it exist in PTS?  Because I've still seen bosses get utterly melted in PTS, not unlike in live, always with the same kind of rapid-fire spam.
---
every hour on the dot.
---
there's many different ways to boost xp gain and some people have played a LOT. During the last double xp weekend people were getting like 100+ levels easily. I'm only 309 or something but i hardly ever use boosts and a lot of the time i'm only in game to sell/give things to people or i'm helping lower levels. (i also have a level 120, 2 50s and a 59). f i'd just focused on one character and tried i'd probably be up around near the 1000 mark i recon.
---
I love it so much. It’s the setting for me - being in the woods of Appalachia. It’s an escape for sure. I also love the ease of just logging in and banging out some challenges or quests quickly without getting super invested in a big story. It works with my hectic schedule.
---
After doing primal cuts all day yesterday I’m kinda tired now. I think score grinding made me have less fun with this one.
---
Block them and move on. I do the same with Tesla users these days too. Eventually you'll end up either with no ass hats or on a public server on your own :)
---
Imagine being this salty.
---
When you want to commit to getting all these mods for radium (cringe) there are two things that help. Science expert perk makes the gun with way less materials. And the scout (I think it's scout) makes weapons with less materials too. I have still gone through about 2,500 screws but it would have been 7,000 if not for those two things.
---
That recipe only drops from the quest: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/A\_Perfect\_Getaway](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/A_Perfect_Getaway)
---
I haven’t really been playing the seasons too much or worrying about reaching level 100. I just play in my own terms I’m only on level 20 because I don’t care about getting a high level
---
I picked up the season a week and a half ago I’m pretty happy with being level 30 in the pass already and I’ve just been playing
---
Ran it this morning on PS4. Worked like a charm.
---
Yes so much this, they embody the greatest and interesting personalities just to be killed in 3 hits. They should kind of feel like an actual Player doing pvp with you, would tell the tale much better
---
Okay? I've been playing since day one, 1000 hours, play every single day, do multiple SBQ a day, I have not received a repair kit from the event in a few months. Probably a bug or something.
---
It's gone.
---
Happened to me this past Tuesday. Almost all weakly and daily gone. I lost a total of 7500. Daily is bad enough but weekly...
---
Submitted a ticket to Bethesda. Sent screenshots. They said they'd fixed this problem and if you are still affected you have to essentially prove it. I'm not sure what more proof we can offer from our side other than screenshots.
---
clownshoe
---
Ok. You really don’t get it do u. I don’t disagree. At all. But there’s many many players who don’t play every day. Who when they do complete all the score they can. I’ve missed lots of nw. Done maybe 50%. The very simple fact u can’t get your head around is people who want to complete the score with limited time. Maybe some who were banned for 14 days. Are forced to play NW if they want to complete the full daily. I said from the start of score when every other post was whining about it was impossible that it really wasn’t.
---
I’ve played about 1500 hours, level 280 :|
---
Been loving switching to a heavy gunner plasma caster build.. from sniper rifle its similar but more varied and I just enjoy the plasma caster.
---
Ahhhhh.  Thanks for the perspective.  Agree on the UI overhaul needed.
---
Don't be in game when the challenges update. For me in the UK it's 5 pm.
---
The one time I didn't do that, I got hit by the auto complete.
---
no, that's what I meant. even with the nerfed damaged in the PTS right now, these boss-shredding magic weapons remain unaffected because they don't rely on their base damage to down the colossus in 10 seconds flat.
---
and Bethesda still hasn't fixed the pseudo-furious bug that causes magic weapons to behave like this, not even in the PTS.
---
Exactly
---
Would be heaven, though adding content monthly could be difficult. But I thought once that oncw they have a lot of events and bosses, maybe they could rotate them randomly and weekly or daily just to keep the feel of the game fresher and with a bit more surprise
---
Got no beef w/ you dawg, have a good one.
---
Well, don't be xD
---
The leveling up doesn't really become a grind to 700+.  900-1000 is an absolute slog.  After that.. Despair.
---
Xbox was bad at one time with afk'ers. I would always try to take them out asap. Just about everyone of them left team fill turned on also. That's crazy
---
I feel you. Then you should improve your stealth. Unyielding is the best option for that because boosts you agility and makes you almost impossible to spot unless you use explosive guns and such.
---
There are other armor options (and guns as The Fixer) that help you being less detectable. Thorn Armor is pretty sweet. You can get the plans with gold
---
huh?
---
It came with a power armor helmet
---
No. It’s a normal two handed weapon. Honestly, a pretty trash one (in terms of damage) at that. 
---
Unless you want it for collection reasons, I wouldn’t go out of your way to get it.
---
Welp, there goes my neighborhood. Assuming this event ever comes to consoles. Better start house hunting ....
---
You're on PS4? If so, I got you.
---
You do whatever you want bud, nobody stoping you.
---
starts on the hour the event to do things happens at :02 on the hour.
---
Those Greenhouse Walls thoooo
---
Yea first one of the day....deposit prime meat....server not responding......nevermind.
---
PS4
---
Last night I was disconnected twice during Prime Meat and during the BBQ event it was like watching a flip book. 
---
I’m not sure if it’s going to get better or worse over the weekend as more people join in.
---
He has became one with his couch
---
when the event pops up, go to the temple.
---
Throwing weapons as a whole are useless. I wish they weren’t... But they are. Maybe we’ll get a perk for them someday, and give melee a ranged option.
---
Same love fallout.3 and nv...wasn't going to buy f76 due to all the bashing but my buddy loved it so I joined.he since moved onto borderlands 3 but guess who kept his legacies!
---
Meh, the rug is ugly and the combover is as creepy as a high school music teacher’s
---
So there’s no way to start it manually?
---
Haha tell me about it, the first time I've done meat week so I didn't know u didn't have to keep beating on the drum, I ended up going Down and when I was revived I was stuck in the drum and unable to move
---
Thanks.  
---
Me too.  I switch from normal armor set-up to PA and become over encomboured most of the time.  And I have both PA lighter and normal armor lighter perks active.
---
I'll phase out my gattling gun entirely as soon as I can get a bloodied Plasma Caster to drop.
---
The event pops up automatically and can not be started by players.
---
When it's up, fast travel there, go down into the courtyard and light the fire.
---
Not for free anyways. You can still grind indefinitely with the exp bonus to get really far, but you can't finish the run with solely daily and weekly challenges
---
No. You have to wait for the event to pop up.
---
I know they are "community dedicated" pvp zones, like the Whitespring Station as exemple. But we both know that Public Workshops aren't dedicated to PvP. We both know man that the "warning" message insinuats that we are supposed to fight for the ressources there...which is not happening. Never the less...Bethesda really needs to rework them.
---
Ok thanks
---
&gt;3. I have depression quite often and video games help me escape and keep my mind occupied instead of doing drugs and drinking.
---
Amen brother
---
probably an isolated incident. Ran 3 of them this morning, no problems.
---
Honestly I love to play games that are controversial in gaming communities so later on i can look back and be like yea I remember when fallout 76 was out and it had all this stuff fucked up at launch and here’s how they changed it over it’s lifetime etc.
---
Music is expensive.
---
Every game with a radio would love to have hundreds of songs, but it's not affordable.
---
Well could be an old schooler that used the int/str stacking glitch where you killed one thing and level up 1-20 times, though around the 600 mark it would take two scorchbeats to level.   
---
Could also be an everyday player that has been gain 5+ levels a day. Int stacking plus boosts makes it stupidly simple. I have gained 121 levels in the last month alone on my new main.  I know for a fact if we had a double exp weekend right now I could pump out 50-60 levels with ease for my build and play style.
---
1. A fan of the hole franchise
---
2. A hugh fan of building new awesome camps every week.
---
It's better now, there is only a few places where frames drop on the X. The S however... Oh vault boy.
---
All they need to do is make the event marker appear above player markers. It’s that simple, and why they haven’t changed this for all of the events yet is beyond me.
---
100 bucks says alrex is a virgin. 
---
There just isn't enough legit hours in the day for level  2k and any sort of life outside F76 😂
---
He will spend an entire work day scrapping perk cards for coins 🤭
---
When its below max level I'll find someone around that level and just drop it for them.  Other than that I'm not going around and asking people if they need a gun.  Don't really care if someone who doesn't need it buys it and scrips it, but I set the price high enough where it doesn't make sense to so there is less chance of someone clearing me out completely just to scrip it all when it could really help someone out that needs it.
---
Only really bother with stuff that would make for powerful end game gear for someone. Currently have a couple damn near God rolls in my machine.....but I haven't turned it on in weeks because I'm constantly maxed out on caps with nothing really left to spend it on.
---
Spotify is going to be your best, theres multitudes of playlist with all the games music or similar music. Music licensing for games is complicated and expensive, its part of the reason you see so many sports and racing games disappear from online marketplaces (car licensing as well).
---
#1 I love sneaking and looting
---
And if they don’t complete the season?  So what?  
---
Are you trying to make me feel sympathetic for someone that got banned for two weeks?  Sorry, not going to happen. That’s called ‘consequences to actions’. Deal with it. 
---
Tell me, how many days out of 70 should a player have to play to get *full* season completion?  50?  5?  Give me an exact number of how much partial participation should result in full rewards.
---
👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻
---
This is why Roadmaps are bad. Only tell us about something that’s already done and coming within the month at MOST.
---
Public events cannot be started manually, AFAIK.
---
It has to be a diseased mirelurk spawn. Also make sure you don’t have disease resistance as an effect.
---
It’s an escape for me, and I love open world games.   
---
I can do what I feel like when I feel like it, unlike my real life which is filled with responsibility at home and work.
---
Sometimes I just continue to explore, finding new things even after two years and 4 characters.  Lately I’ve been on the legendary run treadmill, and absolutely love the public teams.
---
Peace
---
JrArevalo956 I only get on 2 hours a night though. Usually on private world just to be a tad greedy on farming
---
You know that would be great and all but recomending the game when its unfinished is rather rude.
---
They are aware and investigating why this is happening.
---
This whole game is a festival of console crashes and freezes.
---
Obviously this is not my main account, but gaming and people like all of you have kept me from
---
eating a bullet many times. Between therapy and the players I’ve met, I’ve been able to strike a balance which is hard sometimes given work. 
---
I’m rambling, just wanted to say thank you all. You’re appreciated. I’m a new player to FO76 having only been playing for a week and I’ve enjoyed all the pugs so far.
---
Beautiful, thanks for catching that. I wear my pirate outfit most of the time and had to go with the standard backpack to match.
---
(With a Raider eyepatch and a skull bandana of course)

This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

No not at all. And I totally agree. Yet the simple fact u cannot seem to get your head around is score makes u go to NW. this u get players who don’t want to participate joining. Dojng the score and leaving because for a low level NW player it not fun and u can’t win. Why is this so difficult to understand. Wether the math makes it possible in 5 days or 50 days is irrelevant. If someone wants to complete it early or not is irrelevant. Score is linked. Every single day. To a game mode that’s not fun or winnable at level 5. And the posts bitching about players joining and not participating this is the explanation.
---
Can confirm. Last night I got there before the event started so I could hop on the drums and go afk for a quick second and not miss anything, and when I got back, the event had started and was at the halfway point in seconds.
---
Yeah I haven’t run into any issues other than people not participating at primal cuts - on Xbox
---
I know, and I think bsg knows. just curious as to why they keep giving us so many during Meat week?
---
What's the combover?
---
Damn, that IS nice to see. That just made my heart a little happier this morning!
---
They’re just a guaranteed drop. I’d scrap them or try to crash the game by throwing them at slopes.
---
with the exception of Scorched Earth, Encryptid, and A Collosal Problem. i think Riding Shotgun is also a public event, but i cant remember. regardless, that one can also be triggered manually.
---
I finished the other week and holy crap you’re right. It’s so liberating being able to log on whenever and do whatever I want
---
A race against that new man eating random spawn chicken...
---
if you want to make it easy kill the dudes at the inside hub before you start it and then when you start it kill the 2 that attack the bridge but do NOT go close to it. This usually stops the hordes attacking. they just stand around at the back.
---
You can do that anytime.
---
I've had a shitty year, far beyond the standard "Covid" shitty... It's been my refuge in my downtime and it's definitely been healthier than substance abuse!
---
I am insulting you.
---
Imagine being so excited to play the game just for its CONTENT... *GASP*
---
go to his camp around five minutes before the hour just to be safe. for example, if the next cookout is at 12:00, go there around 11:55.
---
Thx i was looking for this also
---
Can’t wait, though I’m still grinding for faction points as often as I can.
---
I know a guy who's level 3380+
---
he also has an alt who's level 500 by now.
---
I'm done with the season and i still play 76 every day
---
TBH, I'm proud of the people that AFK on the drums or spits...everybody wins! They really are doing the Lord's work.
---
Oh no! Yeah, 1 quick bash is the super polite way of handling legendaries in big groups, so the poor dude was trying to be considerate and it backfired in a big way! Poor guy! He probably felt like an ass for a minute after that! I remember accidentally killing a legendary in some group event without meaning to, (I hit the button to change to a weaker gun, but the game didn't register it, of course) and of course this was pre I'm sorry emote, so I just kept kicking myself in the butt about it for the next 20 minutes feeling like an idiot.
---
Switched characters worked this time
---
Only thing it would be considered 'magic' on shotguns
---
Never heard of it really affecting anything else like the other magic effects
---
They launched the game right on schedule. Didn't that just go swimmingly.
---
haha right, we'll I got no beef w/ you man and aren't in the mood to throw insults at people on the internet. Have a good one.
---
These waves have spawns underground,  100 + feet away, The event in the middle of the divide has stuff spawn up hill to left, uphill to right downhill across lake/river you are from one extreme to the other. The spawn in the ash heap are up on the cliff, down the RR track 50 - 100 feet its nuts. I am also seeing mobs run away.
---
I gave up on it and experienced the same relief.  I think in the future all time gates content is a no go for me.
---
they may be useless but they're damn fun to use. i figure if i got free meat cleavers and i dont need the steel scrap, i'll just chuck em into low level enemies lol
---
Had a similar issue not long ago, basically just sell what I have "cap"acity for and leave the rest in the stash
---
Hi! This looks like a typo in the dates. That outfit bundle will be available Aug 24 - 25, not 18 - 25. We'll get the article fixed up.
---
Thanks for letting us know
---
I'm really looking forward to the day people stop complaining about free shit.
---
Sucks.
---
I always spend caps on bullion, plans, serum recipes etc when I get closer to max caps.
---
What happened to you happened to me once and that was enough. 😂
---
I dont even play GTA 5 - but there's your prime example of an MMO game well executed!!! 
---
Fan boys make excuses for this shit show. But tell me why GTA 5 runs si smooth &amp; has literally constant updates which don't break the game?! 
---
Its gotten to the stage I lie about still playing this game to my buddies!!! 
---
"Watching netflix" while in incognito mode on PS4 
---
🙄🤦‍♂️ I feel like I have more shame for this game than todd.

---
 &gt;Thanks for le...
---
I wanted to be an explosive build so bad, but it just pissed everyone else off and did no damage. I picked up a bloodied 1* spear and it did 1,200 sneak damage with no melee perks. How is that better than a Fatman. How is that even remotely balanced.
---
Excellent, thanks for replying.
---
They'd only break the game again trying.
---
Would rather have something than nothing at all. And the point to this is more of the back and forth between a supposed release only to be crushed by a delay. Would rather be told it's not coming or that they only give a release date once they are certain they can fulfill it. Instead we get "Hey look forward to this next week!" Followed by "sorry but not happening" in repetition.
---
There's a picture of a +10k
---
Really? That would be amazing man! I'm still going at it with no luck
---
Chipper!Recognized your name.xbox might have done a trade before. Would you consider a quad ex cryolater a decent anti pvp or pvp gun?I hear its annoying as hell to get froze
---
Glad to see I’m not the only one who did this
---
Yeah, I really should’ve been more on top of that. Still though. Feels just awful seeing all that go to waste.
---
Yea not too isolated.  Lag has been bad and been kicked out of 2 of 7 I have done
---
bethesda: "here's a new feature we're making, please test it for us and see if you like it"
---
pts players: "we hate it"
---
bethesda: "oh. okay. we'll try revamping it then."
---
i agree it's been 'pushed back into oblivion' at this point, but i feel at least ONE of the delays is on us for, you know, giving feedback? or would you rather they released the crap version they first came up with?
---
Yeah, those. Good call. I always think of them differently. They should be called "Boss Events" or something.
---
Riding Shotgun isn't public.
---
There have also been several XP glitches in the past, so while it *could* theoretically be possible, it most likely isn't.
---
Yeah, I guess it could’ve been prevented. But it really shouldn’t be something we have to always keep in the back of our minds. 
---
Just feels pretty bad lol.
---
There’s nothing like when I click fast travel and I pick up my phone to look at for the “loading screen” and I look up a couple minutes later and I haven’t moved :c
---
IMO it’s hardly worth it to run those. I think it’s like 5 scrip per 5 meat...
---
For me its just about slowing decay. Its not that I'm activly contributing its about slowing down decay so they can.
---
Most of the time on the drums everyone just groups up in front and looks at me :/
---
Ma'am, this is not an airport - you do not have to announce your departure.
---
I don’t pvp at all tbh. Pacifist on all the way. All
---
I know is the pvp players do love to buy a quad gamma gun and a Tesla with ffr on the gamma and ffr or limb damage on a Tesla. Add in faster reload and it’s like curry to a pisshead
---
I'd say 25 25 but some people rate the crit. Maybe hold off as the PTS changes to damage could benefit the 50.
---
I have only played the event three times and I got all these rewards already. Kinda thinking they maybe aren’t all that rare. You should be able to get them in no time.
---
SCORE does not make you got to NW.
---
Haha sorry guys... did I hit a nerve? Go get some sunlight👍
---
How do you finish Prime Cuts without it failing?
---
The event can be completed in four minutes or less if there’s a lot of players participating. So I wouldn’t wait around too long.
---
Ugh. I hope it’s not as simple as that!
---
To me it’s just like 
---
Open world, post war, shooting, scrapping, role playing builds, and just the MMO feeling of many items, events, and customizations
---
It's pretty laggy but it's working. Just got the tenderizer to drop but not the plan noooooooo!
---
This is good advice.  Right now, the B2525 is a tiny fraction better, but after the update that will likely change.
---
I think you should get 100 atoms everytime you level up after Lvl 100
---
I got it yesterday. It's rare keep trying.
---
Ok. Answer one simple question. Yes or no. Forget all your pointless irrelevant rantings. Here it is. Ready. If a player wants to complete all of their daily’s do they have to go to NW. yes or no
---
Happy to relieve you of the burden if you’re looking to unload
---
So maybe to prep i should go for the 50
---
It would be nice to add those in and add power armor perks to double up accessory slots, that type of thing.
---
While a few of those reasons make you a sh#ty player, none feel worth the effort to nuke you. If you have a countless amount of mounted heads that were priced anywhere above 0 caps. Then a nuke is warranted.
---
I’ve seen a lot of flack for the legendary perks - whether it’s the coins/perks required to rank up or the perks themselves. I don’t run the meta - I actually do AAE with Vanguard set, so I was actually excited for the armor cards that were removed, and I’m still excited for “What Rads?” so ghouls sneezing on me don’t turn me into a nuke zone.
---
I’d almost suggest release them as is now, and continue to modify as we notice any pros or cons. Unpopular opinion I’m sure, but this system feels like a fairy tale at this point.
---
And, frankly, you can’t please everyone. This isn’t a game meant to be completed in a week - so the folks upset that it takes time (a lot) to rank these perks up haven’t played a true MMO, in my opinion.
---
I have not heard any rumors about that
---
It's like a kick to the nuts.
---
I hear you.i had pacifist on since they added it but turned it off when I couldn't kill a guy that was wanted...really felt like a ass finding him sneaking up just to fail at taking him out.
---
Maybe but also depends if you're pc or console and how much effort you want to put into optimum DPS -- I find crits is a pain on console to do in rapid succession, but it seems on pc it's super easy to achieve. Might just be me. For a full auto gun (if you are planning to do that) you need to think about how easy it is to spam crits than just 25% more dps from fast fire with no need to keep pushing a button.
---
Are you asking: If a player wants to complete **ALL** their dailies, do they have to go into NW?  ***Yes.***
---
Now, Yes or No time for you. 
---
*Does a player have to complete* ***all*** *of their dailies to reach Rank 100 in the Season?*
---
Yes or No?
---
Lol my sledgehammer does more damage than any mini nuke you can use. The fallout universe is a strange one.
---
I don't know that explosive guns affect sneaking,Thank you,i think i will go try to get unyielding and junkie fixer
---
I have a 90% reduced weight shovel and a 90% reduced weight bowie knife for backup melee weapons.
---
The prime bosses are not always legendaries, but I believe when they are, they are only 1*.
---
I've already seen multiple 3* prime animals though. 
---
Yes, the prize at the end of the cookout is only a 1* reward.
---
Below max I script and to hell with chasing people around if someone is in my camp and I can see they actually new  and it's not just a mule account I'll just give it away. Max Caps I don't think I have ever hit that I'm a bit of a junkie with out the whole junkie build part lol
---
Hate those people. Should just mind their own business and do what they’re doing.
---
Take a rad-x to lower your disease resistance to help get it too.
---
Their game probably crashed, got teleported outside or stuck in the no respawn bug.
---
no. you can get them as drops without knowing the plan.
---
Oh okay so it’s just a scrip and plan event. Well thanks for clearing that up
---
You don’t need to know the plan
---
And that all the items will be common after the second helping.
---
I know. I lost about the same amount when it happened to me.
---
It's easy to lose track. Don't beat yourself up over it. 👍
---
Until you shoot 20 rounds and it breaks. The durability is terribad
---
It fits my play style; I like the lore and game play.  
---
It's not full hard-core , it's a nice easy FPS and RPG game.
---
Angry Turtle had it listed on one of his vids, I'll have to rewatch tonight to be sure.  I've got a troubleshooters handmade with +33% vatsbuit that I use for silo runs that's very ammo friendly.  3 hits and everything dies.
---
That was my experience yesterday first one I completed, second glitched out in the final wave, third one kick from the server as I was killing the mirelurk Queen. Turned the game off watched Netflix instead.
---
Heck ya
---
They would announce that if it was the case. Honestly, I cannot see them doing that. I hope that add more rewards so people over 100 have something to do, or a prestige system.
---
Are you using the CAMP skin?
---
I've heard that causes it but also heard it's been fixed?
---
who is out there buying 10mm ammo?
---
I want a skin for the meat hook that gives you a hook for a hand
---
I definitely misunderstood then. Thanks for clearing it up. This includes drops from the purveyor also?
---
Bethesda lied to us again. Like always.
---
Well to me it’s hella easy and fun, just sad that I can’t do it with AP problems cause i have a HM
---
yeah the only reason i don't do that is that all five of my slots are being used until they finally let me turn them into perk coins, at least i'm finally leveling up my main character now been playing off and on since beta and just broke level 150 on a character.
---
But thanks for the tip man, I think I’ll get the 50 crit
---
As infuriating as it may be, this is an online multiplayer game subject to the whims of other people and their actions. The games does warn you about Workshop PvP but with regard the this person stalking/hunting/griefing you, AFAIK, you can block other players. You can switch servers. You can join a friend's Private server. And lastly, for those that are okay with it, a person can fork over the money to get Fallout 1st and farm to your heart's content.
---
I used Fallout 1st and claimed all 20 workshops at the same time. There was a glorious, albeit brief, period where I owned them all and none of them were under attack (PvE).
---
I claimed the Poseiden Power Plant once on Adventure and wasn't thing it through clearly. I had Pacifist on. I say the tell tale red blip above a shimmering invisible crouched object on top of one of the red trucks. I ran over to them quickly to sort of say "Hi, I see you cheeky boy." And blammo, they killed me with a BE Handmade rite quick. When I came back they killed me again. I was soooooo pissed. But, over time, I've gotten over it.
---
Yes. You only need the plans for the fixer, sheep staff/club/crook, bear arm, and bullion weapons
---
I didn't realize Chally's feed also gave you scrip! I had delivered a tonne of it last Meat Week. The razorgrain is no problem, i just wish there was a source for large quantities of tatos and carrots that didn't involve so much fast travelling.
---
Purveyor uses the same pool. AFAIK.
---
It’s gonna blow your mind to learn that you could have been playing that way the entire time.
---
I do!😂
---
I have the explosive 10mm machine gun and a explosive 10mm handgun. The ammo producing machine also quickly produces 10mm ammo.
---
I had just put it on before changing location, and had thought this and so removed it...but nah nothing changed.
---
Yeah. If you have a camp skin from the atom store. It's a bug. You almost have to unequip the skin and redo your Camp to get rid of it.
---
Even more so than a burning barbed sheep staff?
---
It does CTD for many people and unless they're in a team they can't get back in...
---
Yah, if you have the future-tec camp skin applied you can’t see your camp. Fun little easter egg
---
And the stone benches, I find rare, but yeah just have to keep trying. He should have them consistently, total BS he doesn't.
---
Oh, and COD, Warframe, Gears, Rainbow. Etc..
---
&gt;I have not heard any rumors about that
---

---
Note the "Season 2" graphic... there is an NW icon for "SEASON 2 REFRESH" as well as "SEASON 3 REFRESH" as well. 
---
I've been in parties on XBL with people who have rumored that in 6-14 days when this "refresh" goes through, we will lose the ability to get things that are currently in NW.
---
Yes but right during the reset is when people usually get it. I have been fortunate never to encounter it and I never am on between 1130 and 1230
---
After learning the plan the best thing would be to spam the purveyor 2\* or 3\* melee and then I guess it's about a 1/100,000 chance to get a good one!
---
That's really stupid how it does that
---
Noob question inc: what do you mean by mule?
---
Weird.
---
I know this is obvious but have you tried restarting?
---
Fixed thanks.
---
Still broken for me too. Any update on a fix?
---
I'd say gunslinger cowboy, pistols and one handed melee maybe a hunting rifle. Difficult but themed and not to crippling.
---
He also had the neon letters (forgot the actual plan name) for over 9000. Was tempted but didn’t want to leave myself broke.  I’ve also seen that plan  at the pleasant valley vendor...
---
Because a lot of people doesn't level up charisma more, than 4 points for lone wolf. They just can't do that. Duh.
---
'not some crazy challenge'
---
next sentence proposes crazy challenge
---
I have no feedback on your accent having not heard it, but like luke I don't have a good feeling about this
---
Yeah i did removed the skin...but didnt replace the camp...
---
So in essence i was one step shy of the figuring it out myself...
---
Oh well
---
Just fought a prime behemoth and it was 3 stars.
---
There’s a twitch player I’ve seen that’s in the 900s, he plays the game for 8 hours daily for this twitch channel. he’s been doing that for some time, so I can easily see it.
---
Shoot, I got a character from level 50 to level 110 in about a week with Just a couple of hours of playing (except for weekend where I got to relax with some beer for a whole Saturday) constantly stacking bonus XP and INT with the updates to Herbivore/Carnivore are massive, and since I’ve started playing in groups constantly getting 15% bonus XP from Inspirational is pretty major.
---
What kind of legendary war drum you looking for?
---
A cowboy character might not be too bad. Western revolver and a lever action.
---
The skewers through meat that are turned over a fire are called spits.
---
I haven't had any problems (On ps4)
---
I hear you. I took a week off in the middle of this and when I came back, I’ve literally just logged in, did the challenges as fast as possible and then logged off. Don’t even care about meat week. And not to mention I have three characters over burdened with legendaries to sell constantly so I’ve just had a weight management build for like 4 months now. Cannot wait until I get to u load that so I can go back to my hybrid bloodied/tank build again that I love so much hahaha
---
My husband swears this (special changes) happened to a couple of his weapons last week.
---
Happened to me once but I logged out very quickly so I think I only lost a few thousand.  Then I dumped a lot of stuff out of my vendor until after my shopping spree
---
I still have an explosive alt, and use my flaming longbow chainsaw for 70% of the fights and my 2 shot m79 for everything else. ML and Fatmans are pretty much worthless.
---
Ah what i mean is like those "no hit challenges" or "can you beat this by only using X weapon" and the accent is terrible.
---
The point of everything in the game, from entertaining content to grinding content, is to keep you playing longer.
---
Longer playing = more active game/servers = more draw for new players (and more opportunities to show of cool camps/skins) = more whales to buy atoms
---
Thanks for confirming. Your question is irrelevant. Does a player need to complete any daily’s to achieve score 100 or can they do it simply by the repeatable. To complete. All your daily’s you are forced into NW. that’s the end.  Thanks x
---
A character that was made to just hold excess junk, ammo or weapons.
---
The world loot doesn’t reset on a timer mate it resets after you pick up a certain amount of other items. I’m not too sure on the exact number, sorry
---
Not OP but a mule in MMO terms means a character used to hold unessential loot so your main character isn't encumbered/in inventory management hell.
---
Love that channel. If I'm meeting with a few friends for a session on the weekend,I'll have that playing in the morning to get me in the mood. Lol.
---
I'm not quite done yet, though I'm not sure if I will finish it I started a couple of weeks late. Since then however I've been on everyday completing the dailies and weeklies, and honestly speaking it hasn't burnt me out yet, I go to this game to get away from my grind in other games like WOTC and WOWL that are a right nightmare for the grind. Despite them all being very grindy games FO76 and the legendary run are positively laid back for me
---
Only seasons that I know about are in season pass, which also works for the timeline.
---
Why do you guys complain so fucking much? If you dont like the game the fucking delete it, that way the people who actually enjoy the game dont have to read about some little bitches complaining. Delete the fucking game!
---
Not sure about that. Meat Week has been pretty empty if you compared it to Fasnacht’s attendance.
---
Finnished mine yesterday too only had to do 3 challenges pretty easy overall. Can't wait for season 2.
---
How long a break do we get until next season?
---
Or it could be 1 of the many new or old bugs acting up.  Im sure they didn't enjoy wasting their stimpaks and ammo either.
---
I posted the TSE Gauss on a different trade board. I don’t know if I’m allowed to link it. If interested you can message me for the link or go look for it.
---
Its one of the things us min/maxxed bloody deal with too.  I just drop some rads if I am going to an event that has known and regular legendary spawns.
---
Three in a row this morning with me being the only one at all events.
---
Ooooo that looks nice!
---
Packs definitely.  
---
I used some on my main and the rest on an alt who is a Shotgun build which I'm not liking that much. I'm 98 and the last two still aren't all that. They don't fit into the Wasteland IMO.
---
This event is just absolutely the perfect example of something that doesn't appeal to me.  It has all the fallout 76 problems like teamwork required that never happens and not synchronizing with the other events that support it.  not to mention these pop up in the middle of other events and people just leave to go to them.  not sure why we stacked these so that we can be in the middle of radiation rumble or something similar and all of a sudden everyone's gone as a prime hunt started.  Then I get to the part with Graham and no one will do any of the "boring jobs" and we fail. This just doesn't seem fun to me.  it feels like it was thrown in without much planning and just derails other parts of the game without adding anything I'm interested in or can complete properly.
---
9 percent drop rate on rare items and 2 separate weeks of it.  Doesn't exactly get you tattered rags level trading loot.  The ones I have done have had plenty of people.
---
This is a gamechanger, finally being able to beat the event with a full bar!
---
I've been thinking about a hobo with a shotgun build
---
Rad away for less disease resistance, Rad-X to suppress Plague Walker, Electrically Charged and Unstable Isotope which could kill the spawn before you get the disease
---
😂 still a 3 to 1 lol.
---
unofficial sources said 180 things (containers count as one) and youtube sources said 255. I have tried to test this myself and effed up 3 times. BUT i do know it is not 180 items. And angryturtle who did the respawn video seems to know what he is talked about so i'm gonna say it's 255 items. 
---
OP if you want to get the items quick go somewhere like the golf club and while killing the ghouls inside just pick up everything. There's more than 255 items in there.
---
I did notice it not popping up for me a few times, but its a small enough amount that if you already have a decent amount of scrip you could just not be noticing it.
---
Not bad could use some of those perks like junk shield that arent usually used.
---
I think it must be pretty rare, I’ve been playing over 1500 hrs and only saw the starburst clock on Graham 2 days ago at hemlock holes workshop, still searching for the metal picnic table, that one is still eluding me even after all this time
---
I think there’s also a house near Helvetia that has an abundance of burnt books that can be used to speed up the reset too!
---
Had a 3 star mirelurk queen last night accompanied by a 2 star prime gulper.  So yes, they can be 3 star but just like the last meat week its rare and almost every other primal cuts event I ran last night was a no star.  Exception is the sheepsquatch in the ash heap which appears to always be a legendary.  Come to think of it I've never actually seen a non legendary sheepsquatch anywhere in the game.
---
It’s a known bug. Just keep retrying and it should eventually work.
---
Its a common bug, mostly if u moove around u will be able to fast travel
---
Just gonna say the same.
---
8 serums hopefully.
---
Oh so it is possible that makes the event better. Much appreciated
---
my camp is near a prime cuts event and since 6pm yesterday i've made about 60k caps from the traffic there. Just today i was on about 20k when someone started buying every serum i had. (which rustles my jimmies) and i quickly looked around the map for a camp to spend caps at. i got up to 29k before i started buying ammo. And it went down to 24k and then they bought some more things and it went back up. And i bought more ammo. And they bought more stuff. And i bought more stuff. I then had to find another camp. This went on for like 5 mins.
---
The bug that is currently causing issues is that if you die during Collosal Problem you have to choose where to respawn and that puts you OUTSIDE the mine with no way to re-enter. There are several Reddit posts about it and also YouTube videos. Hopefully it will be sorted quickly.
---
Yeah I didn’t even notice so I’m curious. A lot of times now I just turn down all in game music and play a fallout playlist on Spotify anyway. I need BIIIIIIIGGGG IRRRROOON in my life even if I’m not playing New Vegas.
---
Nice! 
---
I never check challenges anyway and am maybe 20 or so away. 
---
I dont like games feeling like jobs. ESO was awful with that. Idk why people do anymore. Free stuff is cool, but not important.
---
You may have missed another one.
---
When I finally decided to go do the challenge, I had whoopsies and swamp itch left. Swamp itch is only obtained by sleeping in an unowned sleeping bag and the like, which the game immediately tells you not to do. I used the one at the top of the church in flatwoods to obtain it.
---
I agree with this person's advice. Stealth has always been broken (by design I expect) for the Primal Cuts events. It is what caused me to swap from a bloodied stealth unarmed build to a non-sneak unarmed Junkie's build with lots of AP for running around. With this setup I easily solo the Primal Cuts events with ~2 minutes remaining.  For the Alpha boss I bust out an OP (magic) minigun.
---
You *could* try getting into power armor for survivability but it has its downsides for an event like Primal Cuts.
---
For scorpions and mole rats I use VATS and a swing speed deathclaw gauntlet. To auto-lock on dem dirty bastards.
---
I’m just about done, didn’t spend any atoms or use any cheats. I really wanted one of the power armor skins, so I had something to look forward too. But now that I have it I’m finding it hard to get excited about finishing it. I will finish it, the grind is just now starting to burn me out. Meet week is helping, and I’m sure a colossal problem will too, if they ever release it on console.
---
One of them was tumbling tumble weeds which was my favorite. The other was swinging on a star by Bill Crosby
---
And while they’re at it, make Julie comment on more than Gauley mine.
---
Missed out on a SBQ event the other day cause I was in a vertical interior space and couldn’t find a spot where fast travel would work
---
Wow. Must be rare. Half the behemoths I've seen haven't even been 1*.
---
What is my purpose
---
You gain a level and die
---
Oh, my god
---
It works at any of enemy spawn points, but yes it has to be done before you start.
---
The fact that you refuse to reciprocate and answer *my* direct yes or no question simply shows your bias and refusal to have a fair and rational discussion. 
---
Your logic is like saying that you need to have a full carton of eggs to make scrambled eggs for two people. 
---
You can do just fine with ten eggs instead of twelve. 
---
You are not forced to play NW. You are ***rewarded*** if you do so, ***not required***. That’s it. Nothing more. Your inability to see that doesn’t change simple math. 
---
No matter how much you dig in your heels, 2+2=4. ***That’s*** *the end.*
---
I will be playing later tonight. I am on PS4 as well. I am on Central time us. I usually play from like 9:30 p.m. to 1 AM. If that works.
---
One wasteland update may fix this, I'm high level so what I do is just lay splash damage on everything rather that directly shooting them. Explosive automatics work well for it.
---
The majority of players are cool but there are some turds that show off one shotting shit, thinking lower levels will be in awe when in reality they spoil the game for noobs.
---
Can't remember what it's call but the place you buy legendary weapons, I don't buy anyone fast travels there without wanting to go inside, think that every time I go and sit looking at a second loading screen
---
I carry a 3\* deathclaw gauntlet all the time but I might as well ditch it since whats the point.  Even when someone instigates a fight pacifist mode keeps you from doing any damage.  So yes, make them useful if only in a devious way.
---
I have a B2525 Handmade and love it to bits, it really depends whether you use critical shots a lot or not.
---
I’m in the uk how many hours from now will that be
---
Thr sneaking and looting and murder in eso is great too ;)
---
Frankly, they should drop the pvp aspect of it and make it work like the other enemy type based affects. The only time I ever do pvp in adventure is when me and a friend are screwing around (and ends in my death, because vats really doesn’t damaging players).
---
In addition to trying again, it’s also been found to be linked to the Healing Factor mutation. So if you have that, maybe getting rid of it will help.
---
Is his ass permanently fused to his gaming chair? God damn lol. Love to know his playtime.
---
I enjoyed it the first time was something new but if I can't do it on me own if no one turns up what's the point should of been more like fashnact where the little mini games are needed before maybe defending grahm while he cooks
---
A rapid firing 10mm submachine gun that fits your build can be surprisingly fun.
---
I stopped at about level 76 because honestly, f that s. If I happen to get score, great, otherwise I'll just play however I want to play and not worry about not having a gazillion ghillie suit armor variants since I wear outfits over my damn armor anyway. I hate the feeling of FOMO driving players, it's just gross.
---
+1
---
When is the next double score event?
---
r/unexpectedcallmekevin
---
His play-time isn't anything outrageous compared to other streamers.  He is just extremely meticulous about keeping up all xp buffs 100% of the time and using time wisely.
---
They said early next week. What ever that means.
---
Should be done between Sunday and Monday. 
---
I’m a little tired of constant daily shit.
---
Depends on your spec.
---
B2525 is better for commando.
---
B5025 is better for rifleman.
---
Honestly though either is really nice for either spec and personally I think they are very close.
---
There's one that started yesterday. Pretty sure it's the last one of the season
---
They’re six hours behind I think
---
Figures, my cable was out yesterday when I got home, and is out all weekend.  FML.
---
"How sure are you that you'll release the update on time?"
---
"95%."
---
I would guess that a refresh would likely mean a weapon and perk rebalance if anything. Replacing the rewards for the ranks up to 100 is frankly too much work for this team and changing those rewards would potentially anger both the people who didn't get them yet and the people who did but would prefer the better new rewards. A far more likely scenario is that they add rewards for ranks 100+ or that they do another limited time set of unlockable content for NW.
---
o god.   I think this time of year you are 5 hours ahead so it may not work.  will be like 2 or 3 am
---
I hope so, i just want them deep pockets
---
Fallout's radio tracks made sense until 76.  Thankfully I prefer the ambient background music anyway.
---
Because of broken stealth in Primal cuts, I switched from bloodied unarmed to Junkie's non-stealth full health unarmed (I use bolstering armor mostly). I use this setup to solo the Primal Cuts events with 1-2 minutes to spare.
---
ok, that's quite some info, thx for that
---
I might have to do that
---
This is what makes Meat Week suck.  I've been keeping a list of my drops and yesterday my daily script earnings took a serious decline in numbers.  Because the prime events spawn so often other events which have potential for more rewards don't.  I had the day off and played for a long time, never once saw Project Paradise or AWOL, Rumble and Violent Night only came up once.   Hell even Leader of the Pack was spawning way less often.  Whereas Fasnacht kept you interested because of what legendary you might get, it's very hard to get excited about another 1* nocturnal pool cue.  You at least get a better 2* drop from just participating in Scorched Earth.  I think waiting for events to spawn, and didn't, made yesterday the most boring day since i started playing F76.
---
Need a formal complaint for how stupid your character looks imagine your camps not much better
---
Or not playing at all is my reward
---
Yeah probably not then thanks anyway
---
I got a B2525 Fixer from Mama Murg but as a heavy guns build I find it hard to switch the cards to commando to sue it.  I will of course keep it stashed in case something changes.
---
I feel like I'm in the minority where I just don't give a shit about SCORE and have just been playing the same as I always have. I'm like 4 places into the second run and just enjoying the game as always.
---
Exists : Google.
---
The last time I played it the other three players stood outside the back door the entire time while I kept getting attacked while playing the drums.
---
Seeing comments that seem contradictory to past meat event strategy. I usually play drums, as I thought this was needed to keep the influx of critters spawning. Pretty sure I've noticed that if no one is playing drums, there is an obvious lack of critters. Most of the group at the event is running around killing critters, so I usually sit on the drums or go to a spit. Those still run credit, since I get a \*ding\* every few seconds. I noticed the stat bar had time on it as well, since I started playing the drums before the event started. Wondered why.
---
My problem is finding people that will go to the Primal Cuts and the Meat Week event itself. Did four Meat Week yesterday, two failed because only a couple more people showed up.
---
Is CP on xbox yet?
---
I got a lot of 1* bloodied and junkies but it’s only 1* but yeah I didn’t see much other event spawn
---
....wow...I haven't paid much mind on the PTS stuff here lately.  I *really* hope that is just some placeholder stuff because that would basically kill off any enthusiasm for that moving forward.  Season 1, to me, had roughly 30 things that were nice including the atoms/caps/bullion/lunchboxes and they were sprinkled throughout so you'd get something useful amid some less than great stuff, but if it's just easily collected junk while exploring / questing, that's just a waste.
---
Thanks for the answer, another noob question inc: how do you do that in f76?
---
I guess a question I would have is why something like this didn't get caught on the test servers?  It seems like this would be something people noticed.  Are the test servers so different than the rest of them?
---
Oh no! I’ve been insulted on the internet from a moms basement dweller! 
---
Oh lament! What ever shall I do?!?!
---
Sorry your right I had to take both because of electrically charged. Also keep your food and drink down as that also lowers disease resistance.
---
I think women have been wanting them longer so I can wait a little bit more.
---
You are completely correct that it has been bugged forever.   But just do yourself a favor and get the shielded SS under-armor if you just want STR.  No clipping issues I have encountered yet and no waiting around for some pencil pusher over and Bethesda to fix this.
---
Yeah Bethesda cant fix their game so it just looks like ppl quit.
---
My underarmor was clipping through my forest scout chest piece yesterday :/
---
If you ever decide to get rid of it i would buy it off ya( if your on xbox that is) idk how much its worth but i got max caps on all my chars
---
It's rough. We need a trusted friend to hold our stuff while we swap characters. I've heard that FO1 subscribers can *usually* drop their stuff on a private world, swap characters, and come back to the same world to pick it up - but it seems recently there's been some instability with that and people are losing items.
---
Maybe try not insulting other people when you yourself look so stupid but thats real slick you know where I live
---
That's incredibly dumb.
---
**Morning Before Work**
---
Every morning, I wake up 2-3 hours before I have to go to work (remote thanks to Covid), and I start by resetting my daily timers for gold, vendor caps, and scrip.  From there, I will complete Photo Opportunity, Vital Equipment, and Retirement Plan if undone from day before.
---
I then go back to my camp and do maintenance on weapons, pick melons, clean up stash and inventory, and create ammo if I am under 2-3K 2mm EC.  During Meat Week, I then start doing Primal Cuts so I can farm the 2 treasury notes (8/hr).  I know it happens every 15 minutes, so I have a clock next to me I can glance at.  Same with cook off.  I have 3-5 Chally Greens on inventory, or I make them.  Otherwise, I will do random events, farm lead at the Lucky Hole Mine, or other resource farming.
---
**Lunch**
---
During lunch hour, I go back to my play room and plan for an hour.  Again Meat Week now, but normally it's a time to do random events or resource farming.  I prioritize Treasury Notes until I have the last grind done (T-65).  This is timed just after daily resets, so if I need to get score, this is also a focus outside of special events.
---
**Early Evening**
---
This time is after work but before 7PM CST.  I make sure my dailies are done.  I then start prepping for 4-6hrs of game play.
---
**Evening to Early Morning**
---
7PM CST to 1-2AM.  This is my my main play session with friends.  Mainly doing big events like SBQ and ACP.  If I don't have a buffer of 20 notes, I then shift to prioritizing that so I can max out trade in the next day.
---
Mine were called G on PS4 so its easier to delete (first letter to Pop up)
---
Same thing happened to me last night. Amazingly finished the event with 1 second to spare - had to pull out my magic minigun to do it though.
---
What you need is a bloodied Mr Handy buzz blade.
---
Yeah I am seeing the same. Or primal cuts happens happens as Graham’s cookout starts and so no one shows up to the cookout until it’s about fail because they have to get those 2 more prime meats
---
there are usually only 2-3 Big Events happening at a time on a server, so just scroll around until you see yellow hexagon with a "!" in the middle of it, click it and the information about the event will pop up on screen, then fast travel to it and viola!
---
Not throwing any hate your way bud, take care ❤
---
First day on reddit?
---
I really, really hated Travis tbh.
---
Maybe had no scrap. Took the shop to complete score and couldn’t be arsed with pvp
---
Can you put the Chally Feed in a display??
---
Try using melee weapons to save ammo, some times there better than guns too! Also if you focus on your daily challenges you should be able to complete them all within a hour. Try to multi-task
---
Gotta get there early 😉
---
Start doing workshop events and normal events with other people. You’ll have a shit ton of ammo and level up in no time
---
I do, I have a b2515 pistol I absolutely love.
---
Same here, gotten every disease, never got the atoms for it. Ga-litch! Same goes for discovered locations, leaving the vault, and a couple of other achievements. I could do it with another character I know, but I'm way to lazy.
---
What if I find most of the prizes are pointles..
---
Apparently it wasn't happening on the PTS, which seems strange to me too. I believe this event is the first to be in an "instance" like this, so the mechanics are different and they obviously haven't got it right yet.
---
100+ level players wouldn't fast travel to a Cuts event to AFK. More likely they had server/connectivity issues.
---
It's possible.  But I've seen it happen so many times now that I thought there might be something else to it.  I'm always amazed at how much junk people carry around.  Workshop pvp is my preferred way to farm junk now.
---
Damn bro you got some nasty scoliosis.
---
Lol. Get out of that basement
---
Enclave underarmor: Strength +3, Perception +2, clipping issues.
---
SS underarmor: strength +4, perception +2, endurance +4, no clipping issues.
---
I do these on my own.  Should be no issue with two people.  You gotta go to the creatures which buys a lot of time.
---
I saw a lvl 4300 during fasghnat
---
Have you submitted a ticket? You are the first person, saying they dont drop. I was stupid enough to preorder too 😑
---
BSS90RW Tenderizer come to pappa!
---
same ways
---
all my deep pocketed armor and backpack i have 430 carry wieght. with my excavator armor it goes down to 420
---
Probably this. I tried to run it four times yesterday and only completed it once. The event completes too damn fast to rejoin a server and get rewards.
---
lol. Only time I take a shop is for score and building score ones. Two birds one stone. And o never take scrap with me
---
I’m not saying for certain that they weren’t afk, but I’ve noticed the primal cuts in the ash heap tends to bug out. Some of those people aren’t actually there. They may have been dc’d but their avatars are still in the game, alternatively they have fast traveled away a while ago but their avatars are still there. Personally I’ve dc’d at that one a few times already.
---
On another note, two players your levels shouldn’t have a problem with that one. I’ve soloed the ash heap primal cuts several times with my level 140.
---
The unwarranted frustration they are putting themselves through is punishment enough, but for everyone's sake I think Bethesda should make that mechanic a frequent loading screen tip.
---
And apparently the tenderizer from meat week.
---
You're playing it right, it's a slow game, tolk me like a month of grinding out 8 hours every other day to get to level 35, then I got a doue xp event and started grinding whitesprings 12 hours a day for a while and hit 50, just enjoy the experience cause it doesn't change that much until level 31 when you get starched genes perk
---
The only camps I hate are the ones where people seem to intentionally hide their vendors.  If I cant find your vending machines in less than a minute I bounce.
---
Good to another person saying it works. The only hard thing is killing the queen in time before the colossal event ends. But with all the magic damage around it should be pretty easy for now.
---
My thought exactly.
---
The photos of my gagged and bound family Todd keeps sending me.
---
If someone is buying from my camp and I get close to max caps, I just leave the server asap
---
My GF Jetpacks me while we're sleeping all the time.
---
And lvl 289? Is that possible?
---
Make the lowest level to scrap them for mods.  Same chance to learn mods whether it's level 1 or 50.   Lower level guns take less materials to build as well.
---
It is truly puzzling indeed.
---
I have the Fireplace Door now; nothing else matters.
---
If they hadn't shown up at all you still would have failed it though, yeah?!
---
I play maybe 8-12hrs a workday and 16+ one weekend days since COVID lockdowns, and I've gained 200 levels since Wastelanders, but I only had 80 levels since launch.  Granted I took a 6-8 month break previously and never played so seriously.
---
If they didn't exploit the god mode glitch, they are likely min/maxxing like me for combined XP stacks, Unyielding max rank (below 20% health), high initial intelligence, INT (Brain fungus soup) and XP boosting foods (Cranberry Relish), and leveraging Build/Event team INT boosts.
---
Finishing the event &gt; killing a few mobs. Unless it’s a legendary then just kill it as quickly as possible. Because you have one timer for all waves you never know if the few seconds you have to wait for other people to tag stuff is gonna cost you the whole event
---
I think legendaries are the only ones where it's good form to try to give everyone a tag. Non-legendaries are first come, first serve within reason.
---
It doesn't appear to do anything. Tried it with a Q2590 Cryolator, he just kept sauntering around even after 200 rounds. If he slows down, I haven't noticed.
---
It's in the middle actually but he is just like any other legendary. I 1 shot him on private server
---
Add me on PSN messenger XxQuarantinaxX
---
Now while I do play FO76 everyday, I don't find the challenges very bothersome since I quit trying to complete the "level up" ones. I am currently sitting at Rank 90 and I actually enjoy finishing the daily and weekly challenges.
---
Are you kidding? The moat recent event has been 2-3months in the making (testing) and it still isn't ready and is all messed up. Can we all imagine them trying to do this monthly???
---
Murder! I forgot murder, and I have no idea y that font is so big
---
100% agree. Unfortunately this is the mechanic Bethesda wants, so they indirectly force you to play the game. They’ve setup the score challenge in such a way that you don’t HAVE to complete it, but if you don’t, the work you have already started when it came out is a total waste. 
---
So you eagerly start the newly added content to see what it’s about, then halfway through realize the life sucking grind it is, and don’t want to continue. But hey, you’re already halfway through, and if you quit, all the work is out the window. So like me, you continue, maybe buy a few spaces with any accumulated atoms and vow to not  get sucked into the next score challenge.
---
i would like to think of it that way, but they showed up a few seconds after i started the event and never moved. once the event was done i went back to my camp went AFK myself for about 10 mins, came back and sure enough they were still there in the same spot so i dunno. i was just really cheesed about the whole thing
---
As a low level I can say that I dont care too much abour resources but Im always super glad if I can get the exp from those big things
---
Fire off a bullet or two, crouch and turn off pipboy, and try again. Usually fixes it for me
---
You can help this a bit by just zooming in on your map.
---
It’s fine I’ve done it now but thanks anyway
---
50 to 110 is pretty much the same xp from 600 to 610 tho.
---
If you have or can get the perk Super Duper in luck then equip it before making guns.  You'll sometimes get 2 guns for the same amount of materials.
---
Thanks for the info! But isn't the SS underarmor an ATX item?
---
i ended up getting that medics mini-gun after the primal cuts event in the savage divide
---
Nope gold bullion and it's cheap
---
God that just sounds brutal.  I love it.
---
Whenever I get to 25k I just turn off my vendors. Don’t ever want that to happen to me - feels like you gave something away for free.
---
Urgh so much loading.
---
Goes to Overseers House

---
I just had some guys shooting and telling me to stop. I explained it to the guy and he just goes on saying the spits do more, yet I didn’t see him rotating them...
---
It makes me laugh when both events are active.
---
this time around i have noticed that with all the events, they are spawing so bloody far away. the ash heap and savage divide ones are horrible for that.
---
This is happening to me as well idk what it is and it only sometimes does it
---
Mine is working fine. No disconnects.
---
Still wouldn’t get a max legendary perk!
---
Sunlight? Haha jokes on u, I live in the Northwest
---
Armor and weapons should usually scale to your level so maybe try higher level areas like the cranberry bog and/or Ash Heap.
---
I thought those domes were shut down/contents removed? I checked the alien and nuka ones recently and my keys no longer worked. I glitched inside and they were wiped clean?
---
Thats a pretty cool idea
---
Uranium fever I've noticed doesn't give max level loot
---
I like this idea, but like every idea someone has about changes to the game I have to stick with the same response. Instead of adding things to camp and building up the new collections to make us grind for, how about they start just take 6 months and do nonstop bug hotfixes? 6 months, no new content, everyday a new hotfix is applied until we get to the point the game is mostly bug free. Afterward adding and allowing things in the game I would fully support.
---
Primal Cuts is on a very unforgiving timer. Resources are ok, but Prime meat and Treasury Notes are better. Kill away, guilt free.
---
Yep I always wore Enclave shielded on my melee character. Saw that the SS underarmour now had the shielded plan so grabbed it and put it in...and it was then I realised that the treasure hunters outfit was actually short sleeved and didn't have brown long sleeves.
---
tis true we prolly would have. but when i see people show up to something like this i figured it would have been a cake walk. again i don't know the whole story behind what happened with them, i just got really cheesed but the whole thing
---
Thats kind of annoying going around killing people with the sole reason to take their junk i can get if u just wanna do some pvp I do that as well but kind of dumb to do it to just take their junk they worked for
---
Sounds good! I'll try Ash Heap first.
---
My 10 mm Bloody SMG is starving.
---
Kill and move on. There's plenty of opportunities for ppl to get resources when you're not on a timer.
---
Ya I hated how they time gated this. Xp score should be 5x as much with actual tasks being just bonus
---
As a bloodied unyielding it changes for me all the time, sometimes for reasons I can't explain. Gave up trying to figure it out 🤷
---
We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.
---
Huuuggeee bug. I'm a bloodied build so what works for me is I eat, drink and use a stim (even if I'm at full health, if I am one won't be used) and that works
---
Clips through leather armor though... No biggie but it's annoying lol.
---
Legendary door that has a mechanism to close itself when your ally never bothers to.
---
I'll pay 1000 scrip for that
---
I have to agree with most here, only legendaries are required. If you spot a low level, try to get him to take high ground and plunk away at the enemies as possible. A little more difficult on them, but wont cause an event failure either.
---
resets every Monday.
---
Yeah same
---
They are venting real-world stress in game as their only method of doing so.  Not that that is a good excuse.  I just nuke their camp if it get's problematic, but I'm dealing 2K damage in my current build and can VATS snipe them with a Gauss Shotgun.  If they are bloody, they don't last long.  Your level doesn't really matter after 50 and building your perks/gear.
---
Wouldn’t that mean our mutant characters would be in danger to? Imagine having to lose your mutations in order to work with the BoS.
---
Same but xbox.
---
I'm pretty sure that venders still work even when powered off.  They (and by extension your camp) don't show up on the map but if someone stumbles upon your camp they can still buy.
---
This. Perfect event for level 40.
---
Tried this as well. Maybe it's the cord in using? It's a Samsung phone cable.
---
How much longer on this season? I still need 11 more ranks and was hoping for some "time off" before season 2
---
I'm pretty sure some extra drum playing is required on the Prime Meat sub-events to keep the later waves spawning, so it wouldn't surprise me if it helps at the cookout.
---
Umm.  You can just do that anyway.
---
Is there someone holding a gun to your head telling you, "You must complete this before you play the game how you want!"
---
No.  So just play it however you want whenever you want.
---
Break down your own walls man.
---
I'm buying the whole next season board. I'll try to get as high as I can the first two weeks, but after I'm buying it all. I've got almost 40k atoms just sitting and nothing to use it on.
---
Playing on my own terms is just so much more enjoyable and I've actually enjoyed playing the last two weeks since I finished the run
---
I’m like five levels away and can’t wait. I’m so burnt out
---
Convincing stats, thanks! I'll visit Regs soon. Do you know wich shielded plan I need to max it out? Like casual shielded?
---
...but what about the other two stars?
---
Commie salute will probably come out with the next season, mothman emote is gonna be in another mothman bundle more than likely.
---
I was down there last night and there's two characters just standing still, not moving at all, and not appearing on the map. Must have been glitched or something. Very strange! One was just in their underwear and called Skidmark69 or something similar. HaHa!
---
I do this.  Complete one then fast travel fast enough to get the next one just before it completes.
---
Oh yeah I take a hit every time I come across it but I was wondering if there was a quest or any story behind it that I missed
---
I wouldn't feel bad or belittle them.  It's not constructive.  Grab it and try to make it more worth their while.  If you have a good stash of caps, just buy up random shit from their vendor until you've hit what you think is appropriate.
---
Well, I had annoying as hell fast travel issues. That one that boots me out of the map. The issue that does absolutely nothing when I click or press enter. I was seriously about to stop playing FO, because I was so fed up. I could stand the other wacky glitches, but this bug was affecting me actually playing the game. I rage posted on Reddit out of frustration: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hxok1v/fix_the_fcking_fast_traveling/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
A couple kind folk told me about the health regen issue, since taking health damage keeps you from fast traveling, it works the other way, as well. Makes sense to my coding mind. So I tried it, and it worked. I removed my mutations and added them back, apart from healing factor. 
---
I have had 0 fast travel issues since then. May not be the case for everyone, but damn well worth the try, I’d say.
---
That’s related to the legendary run, not nuclear winter. 
---
They wouldn’t just take away the ability to earn level based NW awards without telling people. Those people are mistaken.
---
I will be done around next Tuesday I think, lvl 215 now and an all vanilla run (no bought rank-ups, no new character, etc.). 
---
I am looking forward finally going back to do the Wastelanders quests and begins the spacewoman quest. And maybe do my first silo run! 
---
Meat Week is a real pleasure through the grinding fortunately. I am sure (ok I hope lol) Bethesda read all the comments about the grinding and will readjust next season.
---
I'm running a bloodied build but the AR/SD health regen is no longer working for me.
---
Protip here.
---
It is. The title wasn't long enough and I panicked and hit ? Instead of ! or .
---
Yea I'm gonna ask Regs for help instead of Beth, thank you
---
Oooohhhh! Nice
---
At least it was 10mm ammo and not a really excellent weapon.   (Still, horrible to lose that much, I know.)
---
We have always assumed it has to be a "public event", and that does seem to work ... It is unclear sometimes which of you needs to do this when you cannot respond to a trade request. It's infuriating, especially when the other player has no idea what's going on with that.
---
Everyone gets a bit gassy at night
---
A year.
---
It’s a post apocalyptic setting where it’s every man for himself, and there’s even an active faction dedicated to doing what you just described.  I’d argue that what’s dumb is walking around with value things that can be taken from you.
---
-I love fallout, couldn’t resist it.
---
-setting is very similar to me, I live pretty damn close to WV.
---
-knew there was more to the game beneath all the early criticism.
---
-76 is a cool number
---
It seems so but then randomly it’ll get thrown a bone here and there.  It’s a fun mode, and there were rumors of some datamined new maps after wastelanders but that obviously hasn’t materialized.
---
&gt;	we've only had one Nuclear Winter update in the past seven months.
---
That’s not true. If you mean we’ve only gotten 1 new map, yes. But they have added a lot of new weapons and rebalanced several times.
---
...also it does not run horrible on console. Don’t know what you are talking about there. At least runs fine on my console.
---
This game is a marathon, not a sprint.  
---
Its going to take time to gain the experience and weaponry that you see in the hands of long time and high level players. (Took me 6 months to make L50)
---
You said you are doing quests and exploring - thats exactly what you should be doing,
---
   As a new, low level player, you should be working on building your character - stay in the forest until about L20, do events - work on the major quest lines - Join the responders, do recruitment Blues (camp mclontock), start the mysteries questline 9riverside manor).  Follow the overseers main quest.
---
At L20, go N to the big alligator, join the pioneer scouts.  
---
At 30, go to the ash heap (S), start the miner miracles quest.  
---
At 40, head to the center strip (Divide), work on Roses quest, freesatates quest, and enclave quest.
---
At 50, go points east (Bog and Mire).  
---
TL:DR hang in there - it gets easier past L30.
---
I somewhat agree, but doing the grind on 5 characters will feel bad. Hopefully we get some quality of life additions for alts in the near future and then I will fully support max rep as requirement.  
---
PS: I know a lot of players used the glitches and got max rep within a hour. They even complained that it took another hour for each character.
---
I like the look of the [camo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EeoRZiQWsAEMV_8?format=jpg) one.  Not a huge fan of [black](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EeoR3XMXkAAkgsI?format=jpg&amp;name=large).
---
That’s scary as fuck, can’t wait for the event to come out on Xbox.
---
Yeah same experience.
---
I see these types a posts all the time and the first thing that comes to mind is "this is really a you problem."  I mean I get the fact that getting atoms and other pixelated items is what drives someone to play a game, but if you enjoy playing it without the seasons, just play it and ignore them.   As a wise man said, "focus on what you can control."
---
Are you by any chance on XBox?
---
Edit: crappy english
---
They need to just make  it free regardless of player choices, I don’t waste my time traveling to the creator for instance, my rep is maxed and I have all the plans that they offer. In fact I kill the raiders out in the wasteland when I come across them ( god forbid one mouthes off to me in the bog). How about they move the gold bullion machine outside? Maybe then I would care to travel up there. Hell just give me a dolly I’ll move the machine outside myself, and put it in front of the bridge so spawning players don’t have to listen to the raiders wanna be tough guy acts.
---
We've had one update since Janurary.
---
You need SS shielded plan, also from Regs (no need to buy the lower tiers linning plans, just under armor+shielded plans).
---
What content?
---
Still resets on Saturdays for me.
---
This. Take your time. Enjoy the ride.
---
I got a 1\* AA Fixer yesterday, so I can’t complain too much :)
---
Source for the datamine? I know there was a datamine of 3 NW maps before NW was even announced. Flatwoods, Morgantown and Harper's Ferry. That might be what you're talking about.
---
They added new weapons 3 months ago.
---
Cheers, thanks!
---
Yeah, I’m taking a break, too. It has worn me out.
---
What is the way?
---
Hit me three times last night.
---
I bet you only go after people under ur level too? Don't say its even after level 50 its not.
---
I got the Chally the Moo-Moo Outfit and will be pissed if I don't get the mask to go with it.
---
I joined this event yesterday.
---
Everyone was cooking stuff.I was running around like a mad man.
---
Then the event was completed.
---
No idea what happened.
---
Thats what I'm using plugged strait into the xbox not an external charger?
---
I have over 600 NW levels on console. I play with all of the high levels and you're the first person I've met that thinks it runs smooth.
---
I’m usually on the opposite side of what I’m about to say but.... before you even let others get a tag on the legendary take a look at the timer. Often there just isn’t enough time in this event to try and share loot. If there’s under a minute left kill anything you can see including the legendary. I got yelled at yesterday because there was 20 seconds left and people were waiting for everyone to kill the legendary hermit crab, I ran up and blasted him 8 seconds left before failure. It’s an event and I’d rather complete it than get hits on enemies.
---
Treasure Notes, Vendors, Bullion Exchange Machine, I am at max rep (finally) and still visit both hubs frequently. With one Wasteland it might be even more frequent as Toxic Valley will become a good XP hunting area for me.  
---
PS: the ballistic fiber just outside crater is worth enough to visit each day.
---
Wasn’t that hard for me...I had a friend where it automatically was added to his camp items...looking in floor decor in your camp menu and see if it’s there...if not, happy hunting! Do your best to bump up your luck before the event ends!
---
I’m an equal opportunity raider.  Red = dead.
---
I haven't had any of those problems but the health regen with AR and SD mutations is no longer working.
---
Once again it’s the dam mole rats.  They should never be used for events like this, they’ve been getting stuck underground forever.  Bethesda never learns.
---
Yeah. Turrets suck. Todd wants you to upgrade to missile launchers.
---
Yeh with meat week events in starting to hoard them, doesn't make sense to get treasury notes for all public events when you can only hand in 20/day. Then again, if there was no cap on daily or the amount you can have then you could have all the plans in a couple of weeks... I don't know... Bethesda... You guys.
---
Not everyone whose level is high got there illegitimately. I'm level 816 and I didn't start playing until after the can exploit was already patched out. There are effective, non-exploit ways to level up efficiently.
---
...but how many flamingos is it?
---
It may have been because of sludge lung. To get sludge lung to register for the challenge you need to hop servers and get a second disease (just find a dirty sleeping bag).
---
My biggest issue is the fucking autocomplete. Total bullshit. I was having a lot of fun until that hit me 3 days in a row. Hopefully the double score will bring me up a bit.
---
If you have 600 levels, it can’t run that bad. Clearly it’s playable enough for you to get that many levels. It runs the same as any other online game on Xbox for me
---
It was to a comment of mine about NW being abandoned a few months back.  I’ll see if I can search my own comments.
---
Well thank fuck they brought us that update to bring us the cattle prod amirite?  Such dedication to the game mode.  Thanks Bethesda.
---
what's your GT?
---
Idk it’s not there for some reason and I was playing and got the points for doing a daily it poped up on my screen I claimed it and I can’t find it
---
That’s what I assumed happened when 6 people opted out and left me and one other guy furiously trying to complete the event. At least I made it out with my screws.
---
That's the one update.
---
Well, since you can finish the race 1 month before the limit, you , in fact, always have been able to play on your own term.
---
You just denied that to yourself.
---
Gz thats a good 1* drop
---
I’m just saying it’s not abandoned like OP is making it sound. Clearly it’s not the primary focus but it still gets bug fixes and new enhancements from time to time. We’ve had 3-4 short term events focused on NW also.
---
Feel you. Reached 95 last night. It really is more of a marathon than I expected. Meat Week is a blessing, because it is breaking up the absolute monotony of running laps around the map doing the same things over and over and over and over again. Last night, I had Primal Cuts events popping, normal events popping, and even a SBQ event popping all at the same time. The game felt more alive than it has for months. If seasons have convinced me of anything, it’s that this game needs a steady infusion of content, not gimmicks and stalling tactics between big DLC drops.
---
Once again it’s the dam mole rats, they’ve been ruining events forever but Bethesda keeps using them.  They never learn.
---
Not yet, they posted an update that they are still working on it.
---
this has been an issue since the first meat week. you would think they would have patched it out by now.
---
I thought that wasn’t in the loot pool at all. Did that change?
---
It feels mostly abandoned.  or a serious after-thought.  No new map in over a year is actually absurd when you think about it.
---
I've actually noticed this before Meat Week, happens with my well rested bonus as well.  Not sure if it happens after fast traveling or possibly dying, I tend to always look at the effects screen, so I started noticing this weeks ago actually, but it's possible it was happening way before I noticed too.
---
What is this logic...? The game can't run bad because I play it a lot? 
---
I enjoy the game even though it's extremely flawed and runs horrible.
---
This is why i didn't bother with the legendary run. Just bought myself Elite played it instead. Only came back to grab ghillie backpack and ammo converter (and i was disappointed in both lol) and to check out new event. Still not sure about next season: i want BoS bunker but the grind is so long and boring it's hardly worth it unless there will be other things to do. I mean fun things. I guess it will depend on how long daily ops will be able to keep me engaged. If it's going to be just another boring chore than no bunker for me xD
---
Lolz I'm scotland mate. We still get Vit D through rain clouds tho :)
---
 &amp; i am that optimistic dude who has hammock set up 365 &amp; uses it like 6 times a year 😂
---
Timer sucks. Kill away. Never know when some mob will get stuck somewhere and you have to spend minutes of precious time finding it.
---
I can attest to the massive frame rate drop near the fire,  and in Morgantown during firefights.  Any time something explodes as well.  Sometimes just from jumping or sprinting too.  I'm glad to see any nuclear winter posts on reddit because it's a lot of fun, but it gets absolutely no love from Bethesda. 
---
Yeah they gave us new explosive weapons for an already overpowered meta.  Oh joy.  How about an actual update, a new map preferably.  And those day one bug fixes would be fantastic as well.  A friend of mine has a list of nearly 20 bugs we deal with almost daily
---
Happy end, I want that too, I'm gonna join the SS underarmor team soon, yay.
---
Just keep playing and turning them in. After a while there’s very little stuff to buy that’s appealing. I don’t even turn in my notes most days anymore cause I’ve gotten most everything already.
---
Hey, Morgantown was only released 50 weeks ago! Not a year yet
---
Ok, good to know. I started noticing this yesterday. I’m glad i’m just not alone.
---
I honestly just love this game.
---
Just to clarify you were also playing at the time right?
---
well damn.
---
Are ya winnin' son?
---
Sure, but once the event starts.... I was on a server last night where 10+ people were all prepared with wood, Chally feed, prime cuts, and we quickly killed a handful of critters and picked the plants. The event was over in less than 90 seconds not a single person on a drum or spit. If everybody participates in the things that fill the meter right away then there's no deay to worry about.
---
Yes I was
---
Ok? So again, it was only 3 months ago. Hardly abandoned.
---
Dude the Colossus as a concept is just terrifying, right? 😐
---
*10 seconds
---
Thats why I use the garage door and disconnect the power to it and vending  machines. I do that till I can go on a shopping spree.
---
Thanks a lot, have a nice weekend!
---
It just works. “60% of the time, it works every time”
---
What I don't understand is why they don't just do more covers like they had done for Country Roads and Ring of Fire. I'd prefer more covers, if it means more song variety, over having nothing at all or a limited selection.
---
As much as I'd love a new map I think their priority should be getting rid of hackers and making the game run more smooth on console.
---
I don't know why they made the durability lower than paper shurikens high schoolers would make and throw.
---
Can I interest you in a Tea time?
---
Hahaha i feel the same
---
Sure. I use my high AP runny boi to hunt them and take them out in one hit with my deathclaw gauntlet.
---
Massive irradiated cannibal thing? With three heads? Surrounded by smaller cannibals? Nightmare fuel.
---
It weighs nothing and I always thought objects in a display case all had the same budget cost.
---
'minority'
---
it's also funny because your hot take is no less subjective than every other hot take I've read, either in favor of or against the nerf.
---
Ive attempted the PC in the Ash Heap 2 times now, and both times it has crashed. One of those had a bunch of players who suddenly vanished, maybe the same thing happened with your event and those other players crashed.
---
Event icons should always be on the top....
---
I love tea time!
---
Awesome I’m actually looking forward to getting that back plack
---
I think they spawn but run away
---
It's good here on pc. My isp router is in the garage, so it's going through 2 walls about 100 feet away. Using a RT-AC68U flashed with merlin as a repeater. I run wired to that repeater, wireless to the garage.
---
Went and bought all the cat to run wired but haven't put it in yet, really should- wireless is luffagus. Turn off qos if possible on the isp router, just to test. It sounds like the ps4 but eliminate all the other hardware first.
---
Man. You people seriously lack basic will power. 
---
Not playing how/when you want because you NEED to earn some digital freebies to the point you're not enjoying yourself? 
---
That's a pretty crazy case of FOMO
---
I don’t think using anthem as a model is helping your cause...
---
My base is within the bounds of one of the prime cuts events, I literally got the join event notification walking across my deck. I joined, and the event succeeded.
---
Even if it were a majority, bad game design is bad game design. It has to be fixed eventually, and the earlier the better. Luckily I don't think it's a majority. I just think people who whine like to do so in company.
---
I avoid high level wanted players but I'll actively go to meet a low level wanted player because they were probably just exploring and didn't realize the chest they were lockpicking was in a taken workshop zone. I'll hop in area chat and see if they want me to remove their wanted level lol
---
I've been on the low level wanted end so many times...it's the one time in game I never get upset when a level 400 comes around and murders me, I'm just like hey thanks!
---
Ohthankgod
---
Or how about a FOREST HORDE EVENT: LIBERATORS
---
that's the thing though, your hot take is entirely subjective. a lot of people *want* to be op.
---
Do you play more on console or pc?
---
It should also only cost you 450 gold as well for both shielded and under armor plans. Just read each plan carefully, the text is kinda long and runs off the vendor page.
---
Why don’t you... craft that armor?
---
Level 40+ enemies will also drop that level 40 armor
---
Like don't get me wrong, the game is still a buggy mess, with barely enough content so far to be considered a serviced game, bit of all the things to complain about, the free stuff isn't it.
---
I current have over 1000....no idea what I’ll spend them on...because it’ll take 50 days just to turn them in.
---
And before that we got a minor update in early January... so like I said, we've had one update in 7 months. During the last three months, people are literally spawning in 20 seconds earlier than others and killing them the second they grab a gun. Stuff like that isn't acceptable for a competitive game.
---
If the game mode wasn't full of hackers, bugs and unbalanced weapons, I could deal with only getting one decent update every 4 months.
---
The most accurate statement
---
Or a simple 'AFK' emote would be nice.
---
I mean you could do that to begin with. 😅 FOMO is what drives you to complete it. Even then it’s just cosmetics.
---
One thing I’ve noticed is they can spawn a long distance away, over 80 on the indicators if they are spread out it takes too long to kill everything and the event times out.
---
I’ve not completed the cranberry bog yet .. run out of time every time
---
No clue but I heard there was some glitch affecting private worlds with the most recent hotfix, basically the problem you’re having if I remember correctly
---
Omg yes! They are hilarious. 
---
I like the cultists more though. Especially when they say “I regret nothing!!”
---
Do devs even play it?
---
I feel as if on console its a small community, in which everyone semi knows everyone.
---
Other than some of the random adventure players who pop in every now and again.
---
You cannot have a multiplayer game where everyone gets to be OP because if everyone gets to be OP, no one is OP, and new content gets devoured in an hour. Devs literally cannot make content fast enough for the current endgame meta.
---
The same logic applied to diet, for example, would be that some people want to just eat cake all day every day, and that's cool if you don't need a functional pancreas.
---
Cool...I'm like in the low 10% of players who always avoided doing a bloodied or junkies build, and I can generally kill enemies pretty quickly. With the perk cards and legendaries (explosive or furious) I have combat is fun and challenging. My build isn't one of those one hit kill one man army at all. I think that people, once they adjust to the nerfs, will be happy with what has happened.
---
It was a bug that it worked in the first place, nothing about those two mutations was intended to regenerate health. It was patched out with update 21 iirc.
---
Whoo are youuu
---
GET OUT!! You can do that during meat week?!?!?
---
Really? No the first time I opened it yesterday it was full, all the other times I tried after that it was empty

---
Right here they say everything that Bethesda needs to say about Fallout 76
---
\- They were doing something new with the game
---
\- They are listening to feedback and are actively working to implement it
---
\- They will keep the game running but will stop on seasonal content to focus on the games core issues
---
\- " *And to do that properly we’ll be doing something we’d like to have done more of the first time around – giving a focused team the time to test and iterate, focusing on gameplay first*."
---
I like it.
---
Riding Shotgun becomes a public event for anyone to join after its started. Randoms show up to it all the time when ive started it.
---
&gt;Do devs even play it?
---
Extremely doubtful.
---
If there is a base or tent around then you will fail. They screw with the spawn. Just find one where there's no bases or tents around and you will be fine.
---
I mean it could had been &lt;insert the worst combination of effect for a fixer here&gt;, but i guess that one is good too
---
Not sure. I'm not a melee myself. But fully modded it might be.
---
For this reason I always carry a non legendary Tesla just to tag stuff and let the bum rushers kill the things
---
The nerfs won't really affect you at all. If anything they'll just give you more freedom to pick and choose perk cards, because stacking bonuses will give diminishing returns. Also I don't think you're in a 10% minority. I think the number of "un-optimized" players is huge, especially the number of them who've quit in frustration.
---
Level up xp needs to be capped
---
Yo I might wanna buy the rad emitter from you if I can't find one by the time meat week ends 🙏
---
It is totally a different style. As if the designers who made it never saw the chalky suit. If it were supposed to go with the costume, u would expect plushie material barrels (..and two of them, you know, like on a brahmin), but whatever. It might be a nice fit with a pirate outfit.
---
I’ve never experienced that. 
---
Oh well, I hope they add new content as well. I don’t know how you get around some people having worse hardware than others. 
---
I’m just saying your OP made it sound like they haven’t done anything in 7 months, which isn’t true.
---
And wait... are you saying you see hackers on console? You are the first person I’ve ever seen complain about that.
---
For real though, they need to move him to the garage or something
---
caps should stay in the vending machine and be withdrawn by us whenever we want.  
---
I am more irritated by the fact that if I want to put some trash or comics in the camp on the shelf. This takes away my camp budget and the stash space.
---
Yes, that “something else” is most of your victims  are only taking WS for the challenge and that they’re savvy enough to stash their junk before raiding thieves such as yourself can gank them. 
---
Guess you’ll have to get your junk legitimately now.
---
Have you tried using those defense spotlights (in the turrets/traps tab I think) around your camp near your turrets? Honestly not sure if it helps at all, but I started doing that awhile back and my turrets haven't had any issues defending my camp. Could just be dumb luck though
---
Are you in power armor by chance?
---
Yeah, well sometimes I think there's more theory crafting going on than actual playing. It's like philosophy, bunch of nothing. Angry turtle and a couple of others show reality, I like him.
---
A lot of guys don't even carry a cripple, and you need that if you want to run a perfect arktos or cripple any boss outside the sbq.
---
I should say I'm not for nerfing bloodied. I think the build sucks, too vulnerable to dying and they rely too much on offense. But that's the way they like to play. Dying and bobbing up and down let them do it.
---
Get a automatic weapon and hop into high level events. All you have to do is tag the enemies once and let someone else kill it and you still recieve the XP. Just got my alt from level 1 to level 50 in like a week doing this. Lunchboxes and food xp buffs help too along with a high Intelligence which you can artificially buff by joining a public building team
---
I only seem to get either leather, raider or robot armour from enemies. The only plans for armour I have are leather and raider.
---
I named it G so that way it would be easier to delete.
---
Yeah thats how it feels at least especially if you look at the market place. Everyone is just asking for a BE Gatling plasma or unyielding armor.
---
Death blossoms it is.
---
Because if they say that, people will get pissed that they can’t give a date and that they don’t know how to make a game and that Todd Howard has sex with goats.
---
I don't get it though, wouldn't it take longer and be far less fun to go through the hassle of making a new character every time instead of just doing a glitched line in the sand or having a dedicated secondary character for leveling?
---
Yes!  Considered posting this exact same thing a few weeks ago.  It's so infuriating to sut through the loading screen, take three steps, then wait for another loading screen.  Obviously this is only needed for building/indoor fast travel targets, most of which only have one entrance.  For the few that have multiple entrances, there is usually an obviously "main" entrance
---
Angry turtle has a video about how it was fixed and some other options to being tanky as a bloodied
---
Honestly, these events have a tight timer. I’m not sitting around forever waiting for everyone in the group to tag it and risk failing the event so they can get more scrip fodder. If we’re doing any encrypted, uranium fever, free range, etc, I’ll wait before blasting any legendary. Prime events? Sorry, I’m there for the end rewards. If you really want that 1* wrench, ask and I’ll give it to you.
---
Although I'm all for the rebalance for various reasons I take issue with the idea that the endgame is stealth commando. Sure it's the best DPS but it's also extremely boring. For me the endgame was standing up and making a more forward approach style build.
---
The problem with the rebalance is not that it exists, but that it's not nearly complete. There's a lot of work left to do.
---
The Damage Formula has been changed to a more manageable one in terms of balancing content, but the formula isn't the only thing when it comes to calculate damage, there's also the multipliers, or in other words, both the base damage of the weapon and every possible buff. The multipliers that exist right now have been made with the old formula in mind, and don't work anymore.
---
For example, 9 perk points for 60% damage is not justified anymore. Placing a Prime receiver is not worth the flux anymore. Yes, bloodied got hit the hardest, but let's not forget that \*everything\* has been nerfed, meaning that as Bloodied survived the massacre, it's even more than before the one viable build, while all the others have fallen even lower and some have been rendered completely useless.
---
The Base Damage on all weapons needs to be raised to be competitive, and the damage perks need to be reworked completely. This could also be an opportunity to create more visual diversity in player builds, by for example making the more "joke" weapons viable base-damage wise. I'd love to run around with a Drill at Queen Fights if it meant I could still loot her dead body after. There's not much reason why an Auto Axe (when they finally release it) and Mr Handys buzz blades can be endgame weapons, and drills, Rippers and Chainsaws can't.
---
I already do that because the first season rewards suck a fat one.
---
The true season pass reward was the friends we made along the way.
---
I dont have it so cannot confirm, but people are saying that it's like fixer and bear arm now and entered the purveyor pool if you have the plans.
---
Why did they even waste resources making that thing?...
---
The jokes write themselves. I just hope it's worth the wait tbh
---
Are you willing to pay a monthly subscription fee to pay for all the licensing fees they will continuously incur? It's cool if you do, but I don't, considering I can listen to literally anything I want in a second tab while playing the game without paying
---
that's another very funny justification.
---
one, a lot of people see this game as a singleplayer coop. Fo76 is hardly a full-fledged mmo. something that might benefit WoW for example, could be detrimental to this game.
---
and two, people can be op in Diablo 2 for example, but that's never stopped anyone from running Baal infinitely. because it's fun, it's enjoyable. so instead of artificially lengthening content, Bethesda could just, I dunno, make content people would want to repeat.
---
I had to try to respec as best as possible in the recent months because I got sick of not doing nearly as much damage as bloodied builds. Sometimes it got annoying not doing enough damage to a strong enemy before they'd kill them and then you wouldn't qualify for rewards.
---
Run the quest markers that appear in your map.
---
During the last double exp event i manage to level up a new character to almost lvl 250 - It’s not that hard if you know what you’re doing
---
That's true, but I feel like it would be better to just be honest for once with the community instead of giving a date and on said date, pushing it off again.
---
I’ve seen recent complaints that it wasn’t. So just curious. I don’t have it either.
---
It’s all talk at this point.
---
My pipe revolver build literally lost 80% of its damage, from 3400 per shot to 600. It cant even 1 shot sneak headshot super mutants any more. I like a lot of the changes but non auto rifles and unarmed seem to have been completely shafted compared to everything else
---
I have this too. No Internet problems whatsoever, until I play F76. At least once during my playtime my Internet goes out and my router restarts. I don't know what this game does, but it does some really weird things.
---
That would legit take me longer than just doing the challenges and leveling up from the XP that comes along with it. One Line in the Sand is 3-4 levels alone.
---
Well then I guess its rumor.  To be considered though.
---
it's the best dps if you're playing alone, in a private server.
---
There are 'supposed to' do exactly that but in all honesty how often does something go as planned in the wasteland 😅
---
I'm guessing you are playing on PC.  On the XBox, the worlds aren't usually so filled
---
Have you don’t any of the main quest? I’m surprised by that
---
Happy Birthday Blob
---
Did you "do all the things"?
---
The bog one is the hardest someone has to be dedicated to guard the west side and i think the event will fail if the last enemy killed is outside of the circle. 
---
 Twice the behemoth was dead with time and the fog crawler to the west was alive and outside the zone when killed and it was a fail. Everyones always looking to south and its the crawlers to the west that can get away or stay outside the zone in my experience anyway.
---
I guess the best way would be to file a ticket and ask for unban.
---
Well how exactly are they being dishonest? They are updating us with info on both what’s going on and what they are hoping for.
---
Hahaha yeah "it just works" 😂
---
Yeah now that you mention it, it did happen to me once, but I had just joined a server so I simply thought two people happened to launch nukes at the same time.
---
Now that I know that this can happen, I'm inclined to think it was definitely this bug in action.
---
same here
---
I need the Woopsies and (of course) sludge lung.
---
Thats a bigger step than Bethesda has done. Bethesda says a bug is fixed and its clearly not. Its honestly pointless to even read the patch notes they release.
---
Well these things do take time. 
---
And they are providing proof of them actually working towards those goals

---
Ingame footage of changes to the loot system for example.
---
Fully agreed!
---
Other scorch creatures lure the prime enemies away from the zone or the icons don’t appear on the map, had this problem ps4
---
"similar to working a full time job every week" is a bit of hyperbole.
---
Most of the daily challenges are simple enough to finish inside of an hour (2 on the outside). And most of the weeklies will "just happen" as you play.
---
I'm not really a fan of having to log in every day; frankly I'm getting burned out on the game because of it. But it's not nearly the time-sink you are implying.
---
I've had 21/22 Diseases over three characters (lvl 50+) now. I even went in with no armor and RadAway for the increased disease chance and let them chow down, never had it pop.
---
Saw a post lastnight about it. This sounds is a nice bug lol. It sounds like earl will trigger every time a nuke is dropped anywhere on the map **IF** the mine is in an active nuke zone.
---
Nuke earl, kill him than drop  one on the SBQ. Kill her than earl agian since he refreshed. Nuke sbq a second time kill  her and kill earl yet again. So 3 nukes gets you 2 SBQ and 3 earls.
---
They're spawning a lot further away from the barrel than in previous events so if your perception is relatively low you won't see the markers on the compass. Tents have had no effect on spawns for me. As for time, if you can't see your targets you can't kill them, so you'll obviously run out of time.
---
By announcing a date and then waiting until said date to delay it again. They could just as easily say "we are encountering more issues than we thought so please bare with us" instead of waiting until the "date of release" to keep pushing it back further.
---
The 30,000 caps limit is ridiculous.
---
You can raise and lower individual weapon values or mod values without a major overhaul. Example: they did it last year with heavy guns, elevating the LMG from crap to top tier. But the damage rebalance has to happen first.
---
Yes they already have it on the metero sword from the load bearing event, so 🥺 pretty please bethmeth
---
This is what I initially thought - that most people, like myself, frequently utilize the stash/junk box.  But it’s happened so many times that I thought there might be a glitch to it.  Usually people drop at least a few items.  But I just see a disproportionate amount of instances where these disconnects drop nothing at all.  And killing people and taking their loot in a pvp area is 100% legitimate.  Don’t want to lose your stuff?  Don’t enter a pvp area, and definitely don’t enter a pvp while carrying stuff.
---
What about the poor overseer. Spent all those years hiding in a bunker to hide out in a basement.
---
The new version has you select the ammo type and item first, the asks if you want to buy or sell.
---
Small Letters set, but be very warned: each letter you place takes up camp budget. You can actually see your budget bar go up with each one. The amount of budget that OP used posting that phrase would be considered too much for a lot of players.
---
I got a Zealots Tenderizer after a Cookout last night, so they def will drop.
---
I'm getting so close! I hit the 86th space yesterday. I thought I wouldn't get there in the end and I was fully planning on using the atoms I've earned to buy my way to the end, but I'm not sure if that will be necessary.
---
Really.. awesome! Thanks for the info!
---
Okay well a lot of day one players are around level 300+ and I’ve been seeing quite a few level 500+ players, myself included. I have to complete the repeatable gain 10k ten or eleven times to gain a level 100-110k exp isn’t a lot but when this game is the same repeatable content running a new character out of a vault to gain one level is much faster for us
---
"complaining about them and trying to get them fixed"
---
You're on Reddit... Nothing you do here is going to "get it fixed".  You're just complaining, be honest about it at least.  A smarter person WOULD actually play around it in the meantime, as your sarcastic comment suggests.
---
the first time i did the event was in the divide, showed up about a min after it started. the event actually glitched out because a marker for the enemy was visible but in the spot there was nothing. event: failed
---
Gotta squeeze in that extra meat.
---
Hmmm I guess. But they announced the console delay at least a day before the release. To me that says they were working up to the last moment trying to deliver. 
---
Maybe I’m wrong about that. But I’d rather see it that way. They tried to make it happen and then gave I’m is a 24 notice. And that it’s proven harder to fix.
---
Thats completely fair. But how do you feel about the current host? I find her subject matter boring and her voice too quiet and dry. I would rather have travis due to his unique speaking style and awkward humor.
---
There is only a map companion app that I have found personally. I've looked for others that would do similar things to what you're saying here, but I have not found anything.
---
Congrats!
---
I've been trying to find *any* Junkie's Fixer on my new Junkie character, no luck so far.
---
&gt;Oh well, I hope they add new content as well. I don’t know how you get around some people having worse hardware than others.
---
Before the update three months ago, the loading screen would prevent people from loading in until all players were ready to load in. It would literally say "waiting for all players" at the bottom right. People with better hardward would still have a tiny load advantage but nowhere close to as bad as it is now. 20 seconds is ridiculous.
---
Also there's no hackers on console. We do get the occasional exploiter though.
---
Cost of living goes up...
---
Definitely frustrating. I also have had more luck with the addition of spotlights, but the fact that I’ve seen an enemy OUT OF RENDER DISTANCE taking pot-shots at a camp is ridiculous.
---
I want to think that, but after wasting endless caps traveling to dozens of vendors with absolutely delusional exploitative pricing, I start to wonder.
---
Fairly certain this is happening to several versions of this event. I’ve had it happen at the Bog Town one and the one near Ash Heap.
---
Yeah, the items he are selling seem to be missing a lot of the usual more rare items. Then again, I don't know, maybe those are just gone faster since he's active in an event and accessible to so many at once.
---
I have all the subtitles turned on, and "\*strained guttural noises\*" gets me every time.
---
&gt; For some of you, who define the game as your personal playground in which to shave microseconds off an SBQ kill, I suppose this represents an unacceptable nerf.
---
It's not even unacceptable. It's a change in meta that very often happens in online games. That's why any kinds of records for speedruns, speed kills, etc often have categories for pre- or post- major updates. Here's the fastest time before the major exploit was fixed, here's the fastest time after. Here's the fastest SBQ kill when a junkie's LMG could deal quadruple digit damage to her per shot, here's the fastest kill after the fix. There is no real net negative to anybody trying to stay competitive because this AFFECTS EVERYBODY EQUALLY. 
---
As for the rest of the people, I'm still very surprised that people are genuinely this upset over it taking more effort/specialization to be able to one-shot everything now. For so long this game has been so laughably easy, most of the time I don't even run damage perks anymore (and of course don't run a bloodied build). I have a quad fire rate handmade rifle that can kill off pretty much any enemy fairly quickly with literally no damage bonuses. Base damage. It can be fun and all to have some ridiculous overkill garbage, but it is by ABSOLUTELY NO MEANS NECESSARY to the game. 
---
People are also failing to take into account that this nerf isn't fixing the "magic" weapon bug, nor is it making the explosive energy weapon adjustment they promised back in January 2019, so both of those are still going to be instakilling pretty much everything just like before. And many people going around instakilling everything are using one or both of those anyway. Out of all the things to whine about, this nerf is a non-issue. The gap between bloodied and any other build is going to be decreased, which is a good thing. Now you are punished less heavily for daring to not use the meta. Many more steps are needed to bring balance into the game, but this is a pretty good first step
---
Aww sad. You shoulda duped - all those people got their accounts back lol
---
I’m aware that they’ll make changes before this goes live, but I think this isn’t just a damage nerf that hits bloodied and junkies hardest. Since this is across the board, I think it’s going to hit casual players the hardest and encourage you to just go with a more optimized build instead of something fun or different. Bloodied and junkies will be hit hardest, but that’s only because they have the highest damage output to begin with.
---
I don’t mind the nerds based on the pts videos I’ve seen, I just hope they change some of the awful perks like nocturnal or stalker and bring them a bit closer to junkie/aa/bloodied instead of bringing everything down all the time. 
---
Junkie and bloody should always be top since you have the withdrawal trade off for junkie and having to devote lots of perks/armor defense to help survive at low health for bloody.
---
If they can bring up some of the other perks or rework them, then we can still have elite builds that reward the dedication with being able to sail through mobs and fun builds that can at least clear them without having to drain every bit of ammo and stim pack they own.
---
Not sure about platform differences but never had an issue doing this on PC except once on a server crash early on.  Used to do this on regular worlds too where you just rejoin a recent world but definitely a lot more risk.
---
This is exactly what I'm doing now at 26. Travel to another player's camp in the divide that I haven't discovered then look at the compass for anything not discovered. Discover so much stuff along the way while doing events and killing everything in sight that isn't 40+ with a shotgun build. Starting to now get tired of it so came here for ideas. Back to workshops...
---
No one should be soloing 6 man raids in Destiny and no one should be soloing the SBQ or Wendigo Colossus. I am also happy for the nerf.
---
I know that, and I'm not against the change. Just saying that it shouldn't hit live servers until it's complete, and right now it isn't. Not game breakingly so, but incomplete nonetheless.
---
The PTS are going down for maintenance and updates in a few minutes, so we'll know in about an hour if there's some news in this regard.
---
Does it get announced? Never seen it pop up.
---
I also think they ought to increase the quantity of treasury notes we can convert to gold bullion at the machine each day. Either that or let players sell treasury notes in their vending machines. If my Smiley math is right, each treasury note equates to 200 caps...
---
Hmm just the racking up levels farming/cooking seems weird at that level?
---
Pour one out for all of the “Y”s we’ve created and lost over the course of Season 1
---
No I’m level 505 and I need about 100-110k exp to gain a level. Experience continues to gradually increase each level up
---
I’m pretty convinced that that Beth keeps them weak because using them increases server load.
---
&gt; what do you do with caps in this game?
---
At high levels, there's still things to spend them on. Assaultron Recall Cards (to trigger the Encryptid event), Mutation Serum Recipes, Gold Bullion or Player Vending.
---
Colossal problem is almost a guaranteed level up if someone pops a lunchbox or two, done 6 events and I have 5 level ups now, not done much else except a few primal cuts.
---
Start a new character takes like 10 mins.
---
All you are showing is better PR and communications. 
---
Anyway I totally disagree with stopping content updates. Also do you see the temper tantrums people pull when an event is delayed 2 days? What do you think those people will do if they get a notice that the game will no longer get new content?
---
True this, on Xbox ten people is like a crowded server lately. I play late at night though, don't know if it's more in the AM.
---
How? You can’t place turrets at the Whitesprings golf club anymore lol
---
I think it runs deeper than that. 
---
They had tech issues with Vault raid, and had to shut it down. They seem to be having similar issues getting this raid going across the board. Wastelanders was twice delayed, and BoS seems headed for a similar trajectory depending on how you read the 2020 roadmap which also contains 2021 winter weeks. 
---
A Colossal Problem seems to be an apt description for the current state of content delivery for this game.
---
Just like other people have said, unless you have an emotional attachment to the enclave armor, get the SS with Shielded.
---
Happened to one Cuts event I played last night. Ash Heap.
---
This! We need a wait emote. Like dont start event, wait I'm going afk for a sec. Like I'd use that
---
I don’t think perk coins transfers among accounts to my understanding
---
I had an idea the other day that I think would be a blast. Unfortunately I don’t even know how to do it / want the responsibility. 
---
But, I’d totally tune-in if someone did a Discord voicechat-based radio show for an hour-or-two a day for Fallout 76. 
---
They could play Fallout-Style music, throw in some offbeat Fallout-related news, even player-purchased ads.
---
I took it as those reactions from anime/Manga where people are like "WTF are you doing?"
---
This has been occurring for me since i got it. I cant play on anyone elses private world and no one can play on mine. I made sure we are friends and it seems like anyone that I am friends with doesnt have me listed in their fo76 social as a friend. 
---
There is no fix. It just doesnt work. I did talk to someone that said making a new Xbox account "fixed" the issue. But that really isnt a fix.
---
Getting a three-star is awesome, and I'm working on it, but I got three legendary fixers from Murmgh by buying one star legendaries.  The cost difference is huge - 25 scrip vs 100.  So after saving up to 1000 scrip, I bought almost 40 weapons at one go.  
---
So now I've got a (one star) bloodied fixer to play with while I do the months-long grind we are all familiar with to get a three star.
---
I've been to several which failed because we killed a wave, but the next never spawned.
---
Do the molerats count?
---
They really need to stop using buggy molerats.
---
Should probably also be increased since %10 seems lame vs other effects that work on all targets.
---
The Chally feed goes into a pile behind the cow it's I guess a pile of hay (?) you get a prompt when you walk up to but it's kinda just a nondescript beige/brown pile so it's easy to miss until you've found it the first time. I dont know if there's a cool down and you can use more than 1 Chally feed per event I always drop my prime, toss a feed in there, do 2 laps picking up greens and squirrel bits then jump on a spit or drum and play with my phone for three MI utes while the bar fills.
---
Yeah the meta is garbage you die every other round due to a guass shotty, a vats nade, or some other form of explosive. I used to be a daily NW player but I play now maybe once every week because the meta is trash and I don’t think Bethesda is going to fix it.
---
Ohh that's super helpful! Thanks for adding the suggestion!
---
I have had problems too. In 2 hrs I got disconnected from the server 3 times. Prime cuts earned but lost. Prime Cuts events failed because they never started. Cook offs failing with 8 people participating. Hopefully they can figure out what's causing it. This was all last night,.maybe it's been fixed?
---
My pleasure!
---
Yeah this happens every few events for me.  Doesn’t matter which region.
---
ok
---
Yes, I have. 
---
SPOTLIGHT TURRETS DO NOT HELP.
---
People on this reddit keep claiming they work. I tested it a dozen times. They make no difference.
---
These posts are also meme-worthy.
---
And judging by your “deal with it” emoji, the person that made it was you.
---
Here’s hoping you’re on console, and somebody reported you and included a screenshot with your “artwork” &amp; gamer tag. It will actually get you banned with both Bethesda *and* platform company. Yes, actually. Yes, literally.
---
Thanks for the tip, I think that's one of three that I have left to do
---
It isn’t just the cooking itself. I have over 40 plants plus green thumb in my camp which is next to the farm with the cranberries. I do the prime event, then go pick, then meat week all while stacked with building team, brain fungus soup, and cranberry relish. I’ll then cook all of the meat and veggies I’ve collected along the way. Ends up being a ton of exp from events + crafts.
---
It isn’t as efficient as those same buffs + Westek, Burrows, Golf Club, but it is a nice change of pace when you are tired of grinding those over and over.
---
Yeah if you can kill the SBQ quick enough, within 5 minutes, then you have enough time to get to ACP aswell. I went straight to ACP but the queen fight was over in about 3 minutes, so I should have gone there first.
---
Agree. I currently feed, wood, meat then head to spit drum, or poop.  
---
The funniest part. 
---
These "hunters" look everywhere but where the critters are...they are all in a 5×5 square just off the rock drop. The greens are in the sane place and poop is a no move venture too.
---
Not at all! There are multiple instances of Primal Cuts in all level areas. Only 2 or 3 show at once, but anything in the Forest, Ash Heap or Toxic Valley will be perfect. BUT...if a bunch of folks are at the higher level ones, give it a run! People will always help!
---
I did that last night. I’m curious what rewards I got before my controller batteries died
---
I don't know, I don't work there.
---
May not be a popular opinion but I miss being bored. I know this comment deserves a "you can never win" award but I've been around since BETA and enjoyed the slower pace of things. We have legendary board game, Colossus event (I know it's forever but still), meat week and donating items. As fun as it all is I'd like to focus on a nice build or the likes. But I agree I finished the board game weeks ago and it was a relief.
---
No, I'm not. I'm also aware of the graphic bug while in power armor. Thanks anyway, it's solved now.
---
on the other hand.. magic shotguns still work and nobody is complaining about that..
---
You should get the plans from scrapping or vendors.
---
I prefer this. I've been booted from game 2 of the 3 events there were more than 5 people there, and not once -knock on wood- solo out of 20 runs
---
Or the glitch where the gun you have equipped clearly has ammo in the chamber, but will promt you with the "missing required ammo", thats a cool one too
---
I think they had the right idea but they shouldn't have made it a game mode inside of game.
---
They didn't market it at all so basically there only audience are the adventure mode players who want pretty much nothing to do with PvP.
---
Is user error a bug now?
---
Just for reference, it'll pull wood from your stash if you have some there, so you don't have to keep it in inventory.
---
All right, I totally missed that.....thank you for pointing it out. Considered solved.
---
Fatmans could at least do 5k damage, considering how heavy the ammo is and how slow it reloads
---
I've seen two sides to this. 1. Play drum to start Primal Cuts then jump off and KILL KILL KILL. 2. One person plays drum for entire thing and everyone else gets kill happy. Some thing the constant drum playing makes the mobs move faster. No idea if its true though. More testing needed!
---
&gt;People are also failing to take into account that this nerf isn't fixing the "magic" weapon bug, nor is it making the explosive energy weapon adjustment they promised back in January 2019, so both of those are still going to be instakilling pretty much everything just like before.
---
Don't you think that's a pretty bad look, though?
---
Yaaaa i gotta be honest i was thinkin of doin that but its so pointless as 1stars are not good on their own, you really need atleast 2* for the hope of a vats effects or ffr for the dps
---
You won a seat at "The world revolves around me" table, tuck in :-)
---
So much this.
---
I’ve tried 5 times and haven’t been able to complete the event (xb1)
---
I got rid of my turrets over a year ago lol. Completely useless and eat up a ton of budget. I'll just kill off some crickets or mutants attacking my camp once in a while, and once in an even longer while I'll come back and have to fix a few things. Not worth the hassle of bothering with turrets
---
Also, for the targeting, just as a suggestion, plants apparently have giant ass one-sided hitboxes because my crops always block my shots when I try to kill rats/crickets eating them, so the turrets could just be seeing them as a wall and not shooting
---
Dope
---
Can't relate.
---
Pulls out quad explosive double barrel with malicious intent
---
Blood eagles are hilarious also.
---
It isnt a very intuitive system. Also, when selling or buying a lot, hold back button to exit the terminal without going back through all the screens. If you are selling the same item/amount multiple times, press back after doing the sell/buy option and it will bring you back to the same point to do it again.
---
Not only that, but refreshing NW once and then again in 2~ months time? Absolutely no way they’d do that.
---
This is based off the original idea that the NW icon means they’re refreshing NW as both Season 2 and Season 3 utilize the NW icon.
---
? I was on a drum.
---
I can remember back when updates were almost exclusively NW, and a few little art fixes here and there for adventure mode. People complained nonstop that they were ditching the base game for the BR like fortnite did. But now it seems like both modes are left in the dust lol
---
Zorbo moves 1 space a day, he reaches the end.... it's the end, count :-)
---
There's a weekly for claiming 5 workshops
---
just logged in .. again  .  
---
half of the dailies already complete   3000 pts missed
---
Same.
---
I had a rubber band around the two sticks and something pressing down in a button. 
---
I'll try it again I guess
---
Toxic Valley, Cranberry Bog seem bugged.  In one Toxic Valley event I joined the Prime Radtoads all went away from the center of the event, their quest markers were well outside the actual event area.  In Cranberry Bog, the legendary prime beast showed up, died, and then the event never completed.  Ran around looking for other mobs until the timer ran out.
---
Mire seems pretty reliable, as does Savage Divide.  Haven't ever tried the Forest one, but I hear that one works too.
---
Yeah, I put out my Halloween plans and someone bought @0K worth when I was at 26K already. My fault, really, but I didn't expect a clean sweep all at once.
---
oof.
---
Did you just blatantly ignore the overhaul to the loot system that they displayed on their blog? Thats the single biggest issue people had with Anthem and they are showing proof they are addressing it. If you've played the game extensively and followed the community you'd know how shitty it is and how they are specifically working to improve it. I'm not seeing that same level of effort to improve the game with Fallout 76 and if EA is willing to let Anthem just sit and likely not make any money without pulling the plug then I know Zenimax should be chill.
---
I am sure they will be back in full force for season 2
---
Yes, you truly put so much effort in, you virtually completed the event yourself...have my meat cleavers as thanks lol
---
Oh yeah forgot about them, (walking through the wasteland get hit from the back from a cultist with a knife, “ he’ll no dude, did you just scuff up my new PA paint with your rusty knife? Ok I got you, let me get this shovel out, I’m gonna show you a new meaning of thou shall respect thy neighbor
---
The entire reason they refuse to increase it is because of hackers.
---
Hackers (script kiddies) shouldn’t dictate the direction of the game. Run a fucking script to check player cap count and if you see Jose with 2.3billion caps you’ll know to look at his account.
---
Agreed.  People cheerleading this obviously run Commando or other auto builds.  While there's not a literal damage cap, by adhering to this new general rule of "no one-shots allowed," it's similar to what happened in PvP Survival - you've made DPS king once again.  So high-damage, but slow guns that can't keep up in terms of firing rate, like the Lever Action, Hunting Rifle, and Revolvers, are left in the cold.  I've yet to see how Bethesda plans to address that, if they even do.
---
Frankly, players don't need more reasons to be Commando.  Commando in PTS is easy mode in comparison to Rifleman.
---
Ive goofed with an unoptomised build.on pts, its really harsh. Im worried now youll simply have to minmax to dk endgame content
---
Cultists must die!!
---
Wouldn't it have been easier to say 3 are bloodied and 1 is junkies? Why are you bringing fractions into this mess.
---
It’s now 11 weeks after it started since we got a bonus week for the BoS turnins
---
That sounds normal for a level 20 to me. You're actually at what I consider to be the hardest part of the game where quests start sending you to high level areas but you're still too low level to handle a lot of it. If you see other players your level melting enemies they're very likely an alt for someone much higher level that's given that alt really good gear they've picked up or crafted that would have been much harder or very unlikely to have found the first tine around. I suggest if you've hit a wall to try grinding a few lower level events or doing other side quests through the forest, toxic valley, and ash heap. By the time you've explored most of those locations you'll have gained a lot of xp. If you're on xbox I can craft you some armor and maybe mod a weapon or two that will make exploring much easier. But yeah, 20 to 45/50 is the real struggle. After 50 you're just perfecting your build.
---
Looks like its about 17 days until Zorbo reaches the end, you need to reach the end before him, that should give you some indication of how far behind you are. My suggestion would be to use any atoms you've earned on the run to buy some level ups on the day you see Zorbo at 99.
---
Misses every time
---
Yup, prime meats is broken. Tried it three times on three different servers.
---
Makes me think of survival mode with only being able to travel to train stations.  Damn i miss survival mode.
---
I’ve got 1250 hours in and 5 characters 4 over level 250 and the new one at 95 , I took 4 months off so I am sure it’s possible by legit methods
---
I need a good time waster sometimes. I like this game, it's simple and easy enough that I can mindlessly get the dailies done and still have fun. I have long ago reached the point of not needing anything, my main is level 360 something without ever power leveling or grinding anything. I just play to mess around, try some silly legendary combos. Stuff like instigating assaultron heads, two shot broadsiders, quad fire rate revolvers
---
^This. We all experienced the heavy lagg created by explosives during an Queen Event. Imagine if everybody would run around with Fatmans.
---
The damage nerf is the best thing that will ever happen to this game. What is the point in dropping a nuke only for some asshat to kill the queen in less then 2 seconds
---
Source?
---
It is bad, but it is what it is. People want to abuse broken mechanics to demolish everything in their path. The broken mechanics are still there. You can still wipe out all life on your screen in a matter of seconds, no need to raise up a stink when much bigger genuine issues are present
---
Yes. If i die to trap base i would take great enjoyment to blowing it up
---
not all of us have fo1st

I think you can still stack enough to one shot, but with adrenaline which isnt easy to fit in a sneak pistol build with agility being such a tight special to spec right. I think the issue is the extra damage from switching to non auto might now add instead of mult, and because the overall extra damage you get from perks is less, the difference between auto and non auto closes a LOT, basically making auto rifles do very similar per shot damage to non auto, but obv they fire a lot faster
---
I found out that there's a cap limit the hard way - was sitting at 22k caps and sold a weapon for 23k caps.
---
👍😂
---
If you're on Xbox I'll be around to buy!😊
---
I know you said PC, I'm just confirming: on Xbox you can't choose your server, so doing this on a public server would be a roll of the dice that the second char gets sent back to the same one, correct?
---
I use the drums since it gives a decent bump to the progress bar while waiting for it to properly begin. Also, I lead a Public Events Team so at least 3 people can get XP bonuses
---
Yep; spoke to my friends that play and we've all agreed we get whatever get to this season; and the next season can fuck right off.
---
Why so grumpy?
---
Thanks for the tips, just wondering how to exit without going through all the screens:)
---
Bloodied 10 mm SMG is my running around gun. And perfect cap sink as needed
---
They just need to turn off the entire camp damage mechanic. It adds nothing but annoyance.
---
If you check your inventory you should be able to see what you got. I AFKed a lot during Fasnacht this year due to work (had myself on one of the instruments in case of the musical bot) so I had to come back and check it a lot lol
---
No need to be so combative. I’m not impressed with their blog and disagree with your premise. Let’s just agree to disagree.
---
Somewhere around L65, the challenges got less fun, and became more of a chore. I’ll wrap this season up, I think - almost there now. But knowing the amount of effort needed to complete it, I won’t make that same effort with subsequent seasons. The reward to effort ratio is too high, and having everything driven off inflexible daily challenges means it’s too much a logistical pain.
---
Well, now I know.
---
I agree that I dont understand this unwavering loyalty as well, Ive always loved the Fallout franchise and Ive collected a lot of swag and devoted a lot of time on lore and such ever since fallout 1, it was my nerd thing, and Ill admit Im having a hard time, trying to move onto something else. 
---
But I simply cant keep support Bethesda in this, especially when I see other companies providing much more comprehensive and engaged support for their games, it tells me things dont have to be this way, and we dont have to keep supporting a company (even if we love the franchise) who just seems to want more revenue. 
---
I understand they have to make ends meet to keep validating support for the game, but treating their fans like suckers just alienates them, and fans treating fans this way just speeds up the process.
---
All I want is for them to fix the bugs so I can play again, Im not trying to singlehandedly bring down the game.
---
Seen that couple of times with people camps, while browsing their vendors. Bullet by bullet from world away, while turrets sit still like everything's peachy. 
---
On the other hand, the wandering merchants trigger turrets like nothing in F76 universe...
---
Looks like I won’t be able to make 60 levels before then. Riperoni
---
My only problem with nuclear winter is finding a match, I could of made a cake or two by the time I get into a match (I don't bake either), takes to long and it's actually really good fun... I'm in console btw so no hackers etc.
---
Did they recently nerf the turrets?  I used to put them in workshops and see them do a decent job at helping with Defend events, but since the last patch they are useless.   And I'm talking laser turrets and missile turrets here, not the cheap ones.
---
It's a shame because the game mode truly had a lot of potential. By not marketing NW, the player base became mostly made up of PvE adventure mode players who want nothing to do with PvP and complain about it on the forums.
---
Many of those exp glitches were incredibly timely and would lag the hell out of your computer. You literally couldn’t do many of them without completely lagging your game in 15~ minutes. I guess more power to idiots wasting their time doing this?
---
When Fallout 76 landed on Steam I got over 120 levels from Triple XP bringing me to level 490. If I would have no lifed it, I could have easily got 300+ levels. This was done by claiming every single workshop, teleporting back and forth to defend and running events group with 3 others.
---
I don't think enough players realize how incredibly useful it is to have people on the drums and/or spits, since they prevent the bar from lowering as quickly, if not at all. I had to AFK at the beginning last night so I sat on one of the drums, and it kept the bar up high for awhile until I was able to come back and help with critter chunks
---
I think when I finish, i'm done for awhile. I'm so tired of grinding the same locations everyday. I'm done maxing out bullion, script, whatever other shit there is to do daily. It's tiring and not fun, and not why I play video games. When new content is added, even when it's substantial is short, repetitive, boring. Stuff is constently broken and goes unfixed for months at a time. I paid for FO 1st, hoping it would help bring new content to the game and a more reliable experience but almost two years in, things are still broken from release, stuff thats worked since release is frequently broken, stuff is added broken.
---
yeah, Ive moved on to Path of Exile, I cant accept that they choose to visually downgrade the game and then lie about it calling it an upgrade, I did everything I could to help fix the issue via support and the end result was basically just denial again.
---
I wish I was as good as Blob.
---
Someone's salty for no reason. A player being AFK on a drum or cooking spit is actually super useful, since it prevents the progress bar from lowering.
---
Start spending those caps mate.
---
I'd argue feeling like the game is a job or a chore is absolutely a bad thing.
---
Tying in game rewards to completing ~30 minutes of drudgery every day is incredibly bad game design.  Way to get me to hate logging on.  Bleeds into my appreciation of the game.
---
Yes I will check my inventory after work.
---
Same and playing on private..just building my camp..
---
Dont know why, just placing some new defense walls from bunker bundle..
---
Starting to think it is bugged...
---
Get the kick back to menu, and cant login or find worlds??
---
If you don’t understand how the event works just say so. I’m sure someone would help you out.
---
Nice, good luck! Hopefully you got some awesome loot. Got the backpack plan twice yesterday and the Chally outfit, and a beerstein lol
---
Ya it's rough at some hours. The three minute lobbies are ridiculous too. They should let us pick our perk cards at the main menu and cut the lobby time in half.
---
Yea I start to think this aswell 🤔😂
---
I never noticed this problem. I’m at 80% rads most of the time.
---
I honestly like it, I'm just disincentivized by the grind and their mechanics. It's the same thing that killed off the special cod ww2 modes for me, their system is stupid and incentivizes AFKing instead of playing the game, so you get half empty lobbies full of people sitting around and barely get to play the game. If the majority of exp yield was from kills or downs, and it didn't take a full day of grinding to raise your rank in the later stages, I may very well have played NW every day
---
Same  here I've been trying all week to play and I've had at least a dozen disconnects
---
I'm not trying to be and if I am I apologize. I just don't see how you can see actual footage of implementations of feedback and just hand wave it off. They are quite literally taking feedback from the community and doing it. With Bethesda hell, I don't even know of any community suggested changes that have been implemented other maybe increase stash space and Ward(lol)
---
Just hover over the area and zoom in
---
Meanwhile turrets in NW can spot you a mile away and shoot with pinpoint accuracy, it just feels like they purposely don’t shoot very well to force camp upkeep.
---
Yeah! now I can get back to legendary/scrip grind, note/bullion grind, cap grind (to buy serums and bullion grind), and the not to be forgotten possum badge grind (shudder). Possum Badges are like the snakes in Pee-herman (ooo you, I'll get back to you)).  I'm sure I'm leaving a grind out.
---
Well, hopefully the few tricks i have learned will help it be a litt better experience over all.
---
Um... what?  Where did we get a ‘bonus’ week?  Are you referring to the ‘Double SCORE’ bonus from 8/20 a 8/24, where our Daily Challenges are worth x2 points?  Or the Bonus Challenge time from 8/26-8/31 where we get a few extra Daily and Weekly challenges?
---
Is there something different you saw, that said they were ***extending*** the time instead of just ***adding*** more to the ***existing*** time?
---
Ah, loved that skyrim mod.
---
Would lightning strikes in the distance as I approached whiterun.
---
&gt; The gods have grown tired of hearing guards retell their one-line life story to any passing adventurer!   
---
Henceforth, any man who dares to mention an arrow and a knee in the same sentence shall be struck down with divine lightning!
---
I haven’t had this glitch but lately if I have a little bit over 80% rads &amp; I use a radaway diluted about 50% of the time it drains my health somehow &amp; kills me. The rads are going away but my health drops to zero instantly.
---
Nice! I got chally outfit in my first go round last night and that grill
---
There's a Google doc that was sent to me that actual breaks down where you should be if you follow along from the beginning. Looking at that, you're only 8 ranks back from where you should be. The bright side is that it was created based on the original 2000 daily SCORE, not the current 2500 and didn't compensate for things like the repeatable challenge or 2 hi-score events and the upcoming bonus challenge event. Depending on your level, the repeatable could net you enough to compete with what you get for a weekly challenge just while grinding for your daily level up. 
---
It'll be close but I think you can make it as long as you clear all your SCORE challenges through the end of the season.
---
Right, Bethesda says they are the new tough enemy of the wasteland, I’m like to whom? Colonial gutsy is another one “ does someone here need me to kick their ass” I’m like yeah dude come out here cause I’m gonna kick your ass
---
Yea.... happened to me too...fuck this game....
---
Nothing is happening to magic weapons, so that ultra-quick queen kill is still possible.
---
September 8th at noon is exactly ten weeks from the start. That’s when the season will end, unless Bethesda modifies that.
---
I've had this happen too, a few times. Just started happening recently.
---
I just.... don’t get it
---
Are you trying to break the game? Cuz it sounds like you want to break the game. 😂 C'mon now. Be real. It's really not that hard to zoom in and wiggle around for 0.46 seconds to click join.
---
Wish i knew how people were afk'ing on xbox
---
Been testing it for when im at work tomorrow, and my controller switches off and i get kicked after 20 mins or so
---
It really doesn't help that any of the ui is a terrible experience to use, have you tried using the friends list on pc? You can just tell it was built for consoles.
---
I just want to know will this game be playable on ps5 because Fractured Steel won’t be released until after it comes out at this point
---
If your having problems with Enemies spawning your in a bad server. Hop to a different one.
---
I'm embarresed for you in all honesty, at your level you shouldn't have a problem with anything currently in game... I can do the mire and bog solo with a half baked heavy gunner at level 96 I think now... What you using a drill? 😂
---
Back packs, player vending, purveyor, human NPC, instanced missions, underground camp bunker, etc etc
---
Was gonna be done this weekend...but just got screwed outta 3500 points.  Did the challenges, they registered and are checked off, but no points.  Is it worth submitting a ticket?
---
&gt;if everyone gets to be OP, no one is OP, and new content gets devoured in an hour.
---
That's going to happen regardless.  It doesn't matter what genre you're in: it is fundamentally impossible to craft new content faster than players can buzz through it.  That's why cheaper developers lean so heavily on a crutch like procedural generation, because they think it gives players a "good enough" experience and lets them off the hook.
---
Bethesda doesn't do that, but their answer is to create game worlds that give players the flexibility to do what they want and build their characters how they want to build them.  To that end, if you want to make things more challenging, you already have the power to do so.  Don't be Bloodied.  Don't be Junkies.  Don't do stealth.  Don't do Commando.  Why is it my fault?  Why should I have to pay for your lack of creativity or self-discipline?
---
Sure, it's ultimately better if these things are additive, and if Bloodied isn't such a runaway success.  But you don't understand the full picture.
---
Calm down kiddies, if we all AFK on drums it fails, it's far less use than actually doing the tasks, people turning up actively participating can still do the drums or spits if they so choose or need to, but you're in the way.
---
Let's not make out AFK are our saviours, it's pure selfishness dressed up as contributing.
---
Modern values hey...
---
Try taking higher ground. Scorpions and mole rats have very high perception. 
---
Also something's off with sneak at Primal cuts events. I was stuck in [DANGER] for a entire AWOL event after finishing the Cranberry  Bog Primal Cuts. The mobs at AWOL engaged like I was hidden, but no sneak damage multipliers. This only corrected itself after  fast traveling  to a enemy free area.
---
Plug controller in dont use batteries
---
Do the drums not time you out
---
*laughs in Gauss*
---
So... it's a meat festival, and you eat the salad and stuff happens.
---
I think it's the game telling you to skip the salad, and eat the meat.
---
Maybe they introduced a glitch in the latest patch.
---
Awesome! I think I got the grill in my last event for the night, I'm mainly hoping for the tenderizer plan and the chally outfit and then I'm done lol
---
Yeh, I'd not played for a while and it took 4 matches before I could finally sort my build out and buy perks etc.
---
Are you asking our opinion or requesting we confirm that it’s working as designed?
---
If you acquire a weapon in real life in its default factory state it will weigh \[x\], you spend time and money pimping the crap out of it and now it weighs \[x+additions\], this seems a reasonable case to transfer to the game.
---
I think it should. On some weapons it's fine but on for example the handmade it's practically useless
---
I am curious as well since I want the rewards and am not WFH right now so I can't get a ton of stuff while the event is happening. I saw someone say that placing your controller in such a way that the camera spins around (like either propping it on its side or using a rubber band) to keep you "active" and ofc have the controller plugged in if it isn't wired. Have you tried it like this?
---
I am on lvl 70 and from tomorrow to next Saturday I have a vacation. Not gonna finish it without some rank ups.
---
Wow ya that makes a huge difference.  Thanks
---
Unfortunately ive tried that.
---
Tried; batteries, no batteries, on the drums, on the cooking station, dead in the water (this one was a last resort attempt)
---
I’m at 75 right now. Been grinding my ass off. Do you think it Is still possible to finish without paying?
---
Servers already laggy as hell imagine having the server also sending data to phones and constantly updating for every possible change.
---
Yup just finished yesterday and it feels great.  I even used Atoms I had saved up for I think about 10 of the ranks. It's definitely possible to finish without spending Atoms, but logging in daily is also a must to be safe. I especially wanted the Gatling Gun skin.
---
They should make it all XP based, like in Destiny 2, and the challenges can go back to awarding Atoms or something.
---
Or, if they are really gonna stick to the "must login every day" at least give us a daily login reward or something.
---
Fallout is my favorite series, started with FO3 and never looked back.
---
Fallout 76 is really addicting i find. mind you its the first and only online only game i am playing. i've been playing it since about a month after release. yes the bugs are annoying but to be honest you just find ways to work around them. 
---
like many other good people i don't have a plethora of games and just enjoy the handful of ones that i have, 76 being one of them. 
---
has Bethesda been lackluster for fixes in the game? oh hell yes. but they are a business and in the world of business its about making money, not "caring" about the customer so to speak. Bethesda is owned by ZeniMax so a lot of the bureaucratic bullcrap comes from them. I'm pretty sure the Dev's would love to be able to do more in the game but given all the crap from upper management i am sure they have their hands tied. will it stop myself or you from playing? hell no, we love the game for what it is, a game!
---
Got really lucky last night. Just me and a low level show up. We wait a bit, but it’s clear nobody else is coming. I get the party started. The low level peace’s out partway through. So I am alone. Vampires gauss mini is the only thing keeping me from getting overwhelmed. Have to run off into the trees to get the last fog crawler that is not moving at all. Had only 6 seconds to spare or the event would have failed. (And somewhere in the middle of all that, a nuke dropped on Prime, which sort of explains why I was a lone gunman). Incredible game experience, but I now see why that one can easily fail.
---
Then put rubber bands around your analog sticks
---
Tried this today and it did not work :/
---
No the person you were asking this of but one technique is to take a pic with your phone of the list of people in the world. Add one or two to your friends list, then log off. When you log back on you just look up that new “friend” and join their world. So long as they haven’t jumped to a new server in that time period you SHOULD be put back into your original world/server.
---
Not that there aren’t a 101 things at can go wrong with all that... but it’s one way to leave and return to the same game world on console if you don’t have an actual friend staying there for you. I suggested taking a pic in case the first new “friend” logs off or switches servers, you have a bunch of other names you can try.
---
This is a major worry of mine. Every huge online game has already announced they will transfer over to next-gen BESIDES 76, which is concerning.
---
Yeah I was hoping someone knew what triggered it. I figure if the games going to be so buggy all the time, I might as well have it work in my favor for once lol
---
What are good cap stashes.or where can we buy expensive camp plans?vendor bots have almost the same stuff.maybe I need to start that serum grind.im at 30k rn
---
Tried rubber bands too.
---
Had the sticks pointing away and towards each other
---
People keep talking about this nerf being good for future changes but that's all speculation and with Bethesda's track record it could be 6 months to a year before we see much else done in regards to balance. I like that a few other prefixes will be a little more viable but I don't see much reason to be as hopeful as many are about this nerf magically fixing the issues people claim it will. There will still be plenty of people running around with magic weapons and hacked ones on PC. I think we will see an increase in people trying to get them too. They already ruin events and I've only seen it increase after the nerf became well known.
---
There is no reason your controller would turn off if you rubber band the sticks and plug controller In
---
 If we all AFK on drums it fails, it's far less use than actually doing the tasks, people turning up actively participating can still do the drums or spits if they so choose or need to, but you're in the way.
---
Let's not make out AFK folks are our saviours, it's pure selfishness dressed up as contributing.
---
Good catch! I forgot the game was very different at launch than it is these days. They however dropped the ball on fulfilling a lot of those implementations which to me suggests they don't really know what the community is saying or they are half listening. For instance we wanted NPCs and they put human npcs in but I atleast, wanted the introduction of NPCs and factions to also bring about the choice and consequences familiar seen with these games and we didn't get that at all. The factions may as not exist. The humans do not feel human at all.
---
I'm working in the other room so I just wiggle the camera
---
Completely agree.
---
Wow...this is incredibly awesome and thoughtful.  We need more people like this in the world.  
---
I cannot express enough how awesome I think this is.
---
Well done, all those who leave messages like this at their camps.
---
I’ve never used SD but I have AR on all 3 of my characters &amp; can confirm Healing Factor works with just that (if you’re talking about health regen with healing factor). If not I wouldn’t know also cause I have healing factor on all 3 as well. Seems to be a lot of bugs surfacing lately
---
This happens to me to. My theory is that you loose the well fed effect that gives 25 max health. But at The same time i think it happens too often for that to be the case
---
Ive noticed since the last patch if I jump with marsupial the bad guy turns and runs off. before this patch I was seeing them run if I was up on something they couldnt reach. now its just stoopit
---
Happens to me most at heart of the swamp that damn heart gives me so many rads I have to use a radaway then it kills me😂 &amp; yes only started this week honestly
---
I would also like to note that I have been playing this game since launch and continue to play almost every day. I REALLY want it to No Mans Sky itself but it just becomes harder and harder to defend 76 when stuff like this continues to happen every few months.
---
My camp is just a red rocket garage and an acid extractor so if someone sends screenshots of it to Beth support or whatever I dont think anyone will care. You really thought you were Sherlock Holmes there didn't you💀
---
I’m not sure about pve but it doesn’t work in pvp
---
This could be it actually maybe there’s just something wrong with how the game is calculating you losing that 25 max health maybe it’s literally taking 25 health away instead of MAX health overall? If that makes sense idk
---
You’ll be surprised how many people quit games because they don’t want to optimize their build and whine about everyone doing more damage then them or end game content is too hard. 
---
It’s sad that we live in a society.
---
Does the Blood Eagle captain in Riding Shotgun count?
---
As crazy as it sounds equipping a armor piece with %less blocking will make your shotgun a beast in vats....100% try it
---
Nah. So damage multipliers no longer multiply the existing damage, they all multiply the base damage and add together. Which is a huge hit to bloodied because it’s stacking like 6 different multipliers.
---
So currently, a fully optimized bloodied build, with 9/9 weapon damage (60%), 15% nerd rage, 15% bloody mess, 60% Adrenal Reaction, 80% Bloodied Weapon (I’m not actually sure of the exact multipliers for the last two, but bear with me), and then a full stack of Adrenaline at 60%, on a generic weapon doing 100 damage would look like 
---
100x1.6=160x1.15=184x1.15=211.6x1.6=338.56x1.8=609.41x1.6=975 damage.
---
On PTS it would be 100x(1.6+.15+.15+.6+.8+.6), or 100x3.9, or 390.
---
So bloodied drops by a lot, relatively, but still beats Junkies.
---
What starts to really shine on PTS is AA, because it’s NOT a damage multiplier, it’s an armor reducer. Comparing otherwise identical Bloodied and AA weapons on my fully optimized Bloodied HW (in PA with Stabilized), I was only seeing about a 10% damage difference between the two. Yes, bloodied still won, but barely. That’s strictly weapon effects at that point.
---
In my experience (having bases that are near spawn points for enemies) — having a fence helps.   Well placed fences will stop pretty much everything except super mutants.  I then have varied turrets that are at least 1 level above ground.  For the most part, this allows them to kill anyone that goes after my fences.  The super mutants are iffy.  Typically just have to shoot them and that is the annoyance.
---
I run and grab gut/poo piles and veggies first and once I've found (I think) all of them I'll hop on a drum or spit for the remainder if one is open.
---
There's always so many people killing critters it's pointless to try. But I rarely see people cleaning up or getting greens.
---
Also the super mutants that laugh and throw a grenade “ hot potato haha” I’m like oh ok man, hell yeah I like playing games, throw an orbital strike back “ this ones hotter hahaha”
---
Yeah I have tried it in both pvp and pve and it seems broken.
---
Nothing is worse than being shot at by the Gauss shotty. If it doesn't kill you instantly it will lag you so bad that you won't be able to aim. VATS nades and m79s are extremely annoying and almost impossible to counter too.
---
I played for ~4 hours last night and Uranium Fever and Radiation Rumble never popped. Not once. 😤😫
---
I have an unoptimised build; and my wife certainly doesn't min max either.
---
We did a collosal problem today starting out with 2 randoms, we ended with 6 (2 joined somewhere at the 15 minute remaining mark).
---
It took us basically the entire 30 minutes to kill the wendigo.
---
Was fun though! but a bit of a drag.
---
First time I ran it was a full instance of 8 players, and at least 3 players had some clearly powerful equipment.
---
I dunno; I know it sucks sometimes taking time to kill things, but put it this way, you'll get a shot on all the legendary enemies you want to hit, someone wont have blasted it away in 3 milliseconds.
---
Thank you! :)
---
I'm really excited! I might throw in some quality of life mods like hires textures and bug fixes, but plan on a vanilla playthrough otherwise. Fun stuff!
---
They call me...Tater Salad
---
Might be
---
Fab I'll give it a go, thanks!
---
Just happened to me
---
People who turn up to actively contribute can do drums and spits if required, we dont need someone AFK for that, let's not pretend it's anything but for their own gain...
---
You do not have to exit the mine, if you let the timer run down the game will move you to the exit to complete the event, if you fast travel away you will not complete the event, if you die you will not complete the event, only by exiting the mine will you complete the event, this can be done either running to the exit or allowing the game to exit you.
---
Thanks for letting us know too!
---
I like how you're downvoting all my comments like a salty child lmao
---
What do you mean about less blocking? I'd like to give this a shot!
---
Yet it happens, trust me im very frustrated by it 
---
Controller is only a few months old too 🤷‍♀️
---
Happened to me for the first time today, I logged into my private world just to do a little exploring and capturing some camps and I noticed when it reset it completed 7/10 of my dailies.
---
 So seems to be like people are suggesting - dont be in NW or PW when resetting otherwise im about halfway through the board with no issues other than today.
---
Aww that's cute. I remember when I only had 190 notes 🥺
---
People are going to AFK on a drum or spit, they're literally not hurting anyone by doing that, they're actually helping. Get over it
---
Angry Turtle has a video on YouTube where he tests tenderizer. The visual damage numbers don’t change, but it takes less bullets to kill things, so you are doing more damage.
---
I haven't voted once...
---
It also doesn't work with SSA.
---
They updated the date to august 24 -25
---
touché
---
It is not "filled with crap"... those items are sprinkled in between the rest of the cosmetics and a couple of functional things on the Season 2 run. Pretty much the same as Season 1 but with a different theme. Quite a few items that caught my eye for next season. 
---
Stop spreading exaggerated bullshit.
---
Yeah I don't believe you lol
---
You're minus 2, I cant do that mate
---
Interesting I will have to check that out thanks!
---
Literally doing so on both my GF’s and my account while I steam clean the carpets. 
---
They just beating them drums endlessly.
---
That must be why there are community reps active in the subreddit, so they can ignore things.
---
Good luck!
---
Yeah I still don't believe you, since you probably have one of your troll friends downvoting me as well lol
---
It really is though, it's very consistent. The ash heap event will fail 9/10 times. (I've yet to do it and succeed but -apparently- it works for soome people) 
---
I've done it 6 times now and each time failed in the Ash Heap. Stats don't lie.
---
Warm again.....
---
Really? From my understanding they were nerving all those extreme demage weapon builds
---
Will bloodied builds be useless after the patch? I've had my build for a couple of weeks and I must say it's rather easy. Every legendary I get that isn't bloodied or unyielding I sell immediately. I think I'll look forward to try something new :) 
---
My bloodied gun was a tesla rifle with 15%faster reload and 10% aim dmg. Make it full auto and it fucking shreds the entire room
---
I made a request similar to this in another thread a while back, having just had an infuriating encounter with the event icon, I made a thread about it, then I see this thread and this comment/screenshot about daily ops, Really hope they add events to that menu in future, will be so handy.
---
Would be nice to see anything other than bloodied at vendors, I've been looking for a good non bloodied handmade for a while.
---
A instigating 50 cal hunting rifle can one shot just about anything in pts right now. Even supermutants as long as you aim for the head. Well as long as you have some dmg buffs from perks and what not on.
---
Only problem are mirelurk King’s, queens and other high hp enemies. But they can switch to a non auto fixer to kill them fast anyway.
---
I don't even understand what to do for this event lol
---
I was picking up shit piles or whatever and collecting greens and meat and the event still failed with a dozen people there
---
Yeah, that's how the world works lol
---
Great suggestion, thanks!
---
I was thinking it might be the other buff on the tato salad where it gives you more max hp for 60 minutes but wasn't sure.
---
For me I still get kicked when on a drum after being inactive for a certain period of time. Unsure if it's like that for anyone else. But if you're able to, you can just move the joystick every now and then (the right one to move your camera) or rubber band your joysticks together
---
Yeah it is lol
---
Lol. Very capable. Not about that though
---
For clarification: did you not get new dailies, or were they all new and got auto-completed?
---
Being online during the reset is most likely what caused it, but there is no way of knowing for sure.
---
A companion app would be amazing.  Most of the game is inventory management.
---
I can do restrictions but no fast travel isn't one of them xD
---
I just finished last night. It feels so nice not to need to login every single day. I wish they would make all the SCORE content weekly, and just have a whole lot of them. That way I can binge game on the weekends when I have free time, and just a bit during the week when I don't.
---
I actually just saw in another thread, a screenshot of the way daily ops are shown on the map and someone mentioned the possibility of events being added to that menu in future, so it looks like the functionality is already there in the PTS.
---
Reduces damage while blocking is one of the armor perks.2nd or 3rd star 1st prefix doesnt matter.but when used it makes your shotgun register every pellet at max damage.its insane.i use no shotgun perks and 1shot anything in vats...just about
---
What a wonderfully sheltered life you have lived, good luck for the future my friend.
---
The video shows it works in both pvp and pve, but the visual damage numbers are wrong.
---
Lol so last night I found out about the 30k cap, picking up scraps after Guided Meditation. Had no idea it was even a thing. I tell myself I'd better go buy something expensive, not a minute later someone goes to my camp and buys about 3k worth of legendaries and ammo from my vendor. Fuuuuck
---
On the upside it freed up weight but still...
---
I personally think they should abandon it and add "hardcore" mode back.
---
nope
---
I question more the message that sends, when you prioritize nerfing everyone *except* those who have abused damage exploits.
---
No clearer a display of that was my own experience in the PTS, where I burned through so much ammo clearing a silo under the new numbers, and where we all whittled down the Queen's HP, until Mr. Exploit Gun shows up and melts her in 3 seconds.
---
I can accept the need to make these perks additive.  I can accept the desire to nerf my build.  But when you ask me to accept these things while doing nothing about the exploiters, that's really taking the piss.  Especially when this isn't some isolated incident.  I'd say, in my experience, it's the new normal for at least one person to melt the SBQ, or the Imposter Sheepsquatch, and you can only be surprised when it *doesn't* happen.  That's how bad it's gotten.
---
I'm indifferent to the anticipated dmg nerf just cuz... As if this wasn't like any other mmo game that gets patched, and things get "corrected" but then creates... "different" kinds of problems. For the sake of variation, ppl will figure out new ways to cheese the game. Bloodied isn't even that OP. The problem is the end-game content itself, and from what I saw it looks like there is better AI scaling, higher level mobs, and such. I mean, there are parts of the game that are better suited for different specs. Me, personally. Not sure how using a bloodied melee at Colossal Prob with unyielding will perform. Might need to switch out into stealth armor and lose the unyielding buff. If I had been playing the game longer, I would have switched from melee to bloodied commando, but whatev. Saving up level points now to see how I want to respec for the next patch, seems like the plan anyway
---
I love the random noises the Scorched make, always makes me and my friends laugh
---
Thats good to know, i had been meaning to test if instigating doubled or just added now, sounds like from that, that it still doubles, which would be nice
---
you're not missing out on much, and you're getting the event rewards, which are more important.
---
If VATS worked on plants and piles of shit it would be a different story
---
Snitches get stitches.....
---
So my hunting rifle is anti-armor and shotgun is executioners
---
Ty hopefully I'll make it if I do that
---
My perks are all over the place atm as I don’t want to limit myself to a certain type of weapon. I tend to switch around depending on how much ammo I have. Are they any perks that you’d consider must have?
---
Lol, stats famously lie.  I've suceeded 3/4 attempts, iirc.  And I made up the one failure to placate you :)
---
I have reported 2000 dupers today and will not stop until Zorbo is defeated! !!!!!!!!
---
What bugs me is that they need a hard mode. Where we spawn into an entire world of level 100 everything. That way we can enjoy flatwoods as an op character. Keep the game as it is but implement a new mode for people like me that want some punishment for being so incredibly op lol.
---
I'm a heavy guns build, and have non auto characters. They'll need to balance weapons to address melee and semi auto.
---
Great question. I should have looked closer because I see now that it did reset my dailies and auto completed 6 of the of the 9. I'll update my post to include this info. Thanks.
---
Yeah! Agreed. That's my running around gun too. Except mine is mutant's.
---
I hope they don't fix this before they release on consoles. Very convenient.
---
Downvote me now and read later: I think it is your fault. Having thousands of rounds for sale means you can earn thousands of caps and the game mechanics are very clear: you lose by going over the limit. 
---
It has happened to me more than once because I AFK while I do dishes or make lunch, and someone buys all my ammo, serums and fluxes. 
---
I see the 30000 and just start doing inventory to calculate the loss.
---
I'd like that but only if it excluded legendarys, VATS and stealth boys. Those three things ruin adventure mode PvP imo.
---
Some type of team death match or big team battle would be really fun too. But with NW combat, not adventure mode.
---
I am more concerned with getting the event to complete than worrying about people concerned with getting a shot on each mob. With the state of the events shaky at best, the only thing I refrain from killing are Legendaries. I want the Primal Meat at the end of Cuts for the Meat Cook and the T Notes. Its not like these are the only places to farm mobs. I am bloodied, but I use a less powerful gun and up my health so I do less damage in the low level event areas. In the high level areas, I juice up and get to work. Im lvl 425+ and could give a damn about MORE scrip only weapons and armor....so, ease up, yo. Its not just bloodieds, some people are actually just assholes.
---
I died to the adds after killing the boss and respawned outside the mine with the timer still counting down and got the rewards as normal when it reached 0. I was even the first one out of the mine.
---
I wouldn't hold your breath, if the bug is beneficial to the player it's patched almost immediately.
---
This is the first time in Bethesda's history that a Fallout game has been rebalanced. I take that as a good sign.
---
Rubber bands
---
It's a timed event, the quicker it's done the quicker you can join another. Just tag what you can but don't expect to get everything.
---
My Bloodied Gunslinger actually fared a lot better than my two Riflemen because Tank Killer now applies to Pistols, and the 10mm and Pipe Pistol are fairly quick weapons, even when they aren't auto.  Plus, the ArmCo machine spits out both 10mm and .38 like no tomorrow, so she's not going to be starved for ammo like the .45 the others relied on.
---
It definitely cripples her Revolver game, though.  But from that lesson, I've started transitioning the Riflemen to Commando and modded their Combat Rifles to use .38.  The Assault Rifle may make an appearance at some point, since 5.56 is the same way, but both will likely hang up the Lever Action for good if these changes go through.
---
Have an upvote :D
---
Join or start a public team, that might make things slightly less awful.
---
They were in game at the beginning, but got taken out because they were used in trap camps.
---
Obviously, instead of making repairing CAMPs free, BGS took the path that affected negatively both PvP and CAMP building, while not actually fixing the trap camp issue.
---
So I take back what I said, I just did the event in Cranberry bog and had a 4* Behemoth and a 2* Fog Crawler, got a 2* item out it.
---
Bloodied is still the highest damage on the PTS. It's just not 6x stronger than the next strongest build anymore.
---
Agree but have my own thoughts, why not increase the difficulty then balance it, so every build is viable sort the useless prefixes out, every build is viable, every weapon is viable everyone is happy. Plus it's ok nerfing stuff we have no idea how the difficulty spike with one wasteland will effect everything.
---
They did have mats they was removed bc they are easily abusable. They're still allowed at workshops tho.
---
I believe they were in game and ended up as you surmised they would, so they were removed.
---
What I have done is where there is a lvl which awards you 150 atoms I have bought that one as it hasn't cost anything if that makes sense? Think im on 75 or 76 right now
---
Finally, a worthy use for my TS Fatman
---
Cough cough "explosive bait" cough cough
---
They will. Best option is to store the vendors if you want to stay on server. Then place them back when you want. The items that were in there will still be there, and at the price you had them set at too.
---
I hate math but you laid that out extremely well.TY...I will keep a eye out on anti armor as well...again thank you.
---
This happened to me once yesterday. Didn’t really think much of it...I was a little over 80% rads...just thought it was a weird glitch.  Or just a really bad batch of Tato Salad.  🤣
---
Magazine capacity glitch go brrr
---
This many times. The only pistols worth using, and even then only on 'normal' enemies up to Super Mutant durability, are Gauss with Anti-Armor and Instigating. Everything else is utter trash on the trash enemies. Boss fights? HAHAHAHAHA. No. You are basically a cheerleader. 
---
I did Earl earlier. This is my damage per charged shot from stealth; [https://imgur.com/a/TF8Riur](https://imgur.com/a/TF8Riur)
---
Provided it isn't bugged, you have to go to the creatures. Follow the markers on directional map. Don't wait for them to come to you, you will likely timeout.
---
There are only 3 drums. We can’t all afk on the drums. I do the drums so you don’t have to.
---
Normal pistols are better off than pipe revolvers, since youre stacking pistol and rifle perks, which now add instead of mult. Also thry already benefitted from tank killer
---
All id heard about other pistols before now was theyre also fucked, but that gives me a little hope at least. I think non auto rifles are the most dead tho, other than unarmed.
---
Maybe it's a new balance to bloodied builds, haha heal yourself and have a 20% chance to die. It's not a bug it's a feature!
---
They have chosen not to make the game diablo-like. They've chosen to take a more MMO approach. Probably because new content is more expensive, like an MMO, vs Diablo where you just add new randomized rifts and easy to create levels.
---
Lol, fair enough :)
---
\*pop pop\* \*pop pop\* U R DED
---
Your gonna have shortages of literally everything until level 60 or 70. Just conserve as you can and you'll get there. I'm 300+ and still dont have it all. I have a couple great guns, plenty of ammo and resources but not all the plans. Plans take forever and a lot of caps
---
I think they’re doing quite the balance to us next patch without autkilling me too😂 but maybe that’s what is bloodied builds get for one shotting everything for so long!
---
Also works with flechett harpoon gun and I heard it might work on lasers with beam splitters.got to be in vats for the insane damage to register though
---
The damage re-balance is good for the overall health of the game in the long term.  However, I don't trust the developers at this point to make the other changes needed to make this work. As a Junkie's pistol build that barely gets by now I have zero confidence that between these changes and one wasteland increasing the hp of enemies that my build in its current form will be enjoyable to play.
---
I've accepted the fact that the build I enjoy, pistols, and want to play isn't effective.  Compared to my previous build, stealth rifleman using a guass rifle, it's barely scraping by.  The fact of the matter is that Bethesda  can't monetize weapon and build balancing, so it's always going to be an afterthought for them.
---
The game has been out for plenty of time now and with a system custom tailored for additions yet the only new perk cards we have seen are re skins of rifle cards for an ineffective poorly thought out unsupported new weapon type in bows. Even now for pistols instead of giving any thought of improvement for the complaints that have been around since the game began for pistols all they've done is slapped an existing perk card as a bandaid solution.
---
Tldr: Between the over zealous corporate monetization and pressure on the developers, the lack of vision and oversight for game direction and the horrific base the game is built upon,
---
no meaningful positive changes will come. I hope i'm wrong I really enjoy this game despite itself.
---
What if they honestly do not know yet given the current state of the code? There’s a scary thought.
---
I have no doubt more people would prefer welcome mats and just completely removing player damage from traps, but that would make too much sense.
---
I am not against the nerf, but it feels silly when they can't fix magic shotguns, delete legacy weapons, etc.

Worst case, like what someone else said, you can buy the last couple levels with Atom. At the very least, uppity should be able to hit mid-90s without much issue.
---
Fuck me, please, take my money, how can I ever repay you?
---
You're in the way, plenty of people turn up that deserve to be rewarded that will happily take your place, you know, the ones that deserve to be rewarded.
---
The third paragraph was the first time someone could actually articulate the reasoning. Ty for that. Gives me something to think about
---
I like Sofia because she becomes naked once I put a goat head on her. (Ofc any hat will do)
---
The view is nice when she’s workin hard at the computer. The landscape ofc.
---
I mean, I definitely run an unoptimized build for my main, basically just standard X-01 PA with whatever Heavy Weapon tickles my fancy at the moment. My alt character is an unarmed that's mutated up pretty good. With just that and no bloodied/junkies/whatever, I'm typically one shotting the majority of enemies I run into. Throw in melee damage foods and it gets even sillier, though I do have issues with Scorched Beasts simply because they fly so much. I don't even have ideal armor for it legendary wise yet. I have at least managed to get all but the helmet and chest piece for the Secret Service armor though. Once I get the chest piece, I'll probably start working towards actually trying to get armor thats like...Weightless, + Strength, -Junk/Weapon/Ammo/Whatever weight. But I have no interest in running bloodied or junkies.
---
Also, 1 minute respawn time is awesome game  design. Really cool, Bethesda...
---
No, not really, that's the confusing part in all the people crowing that it's past time. Everything has been nerfed, so Bloodied is now only a little better than Junkies, but both still remain better than other builds and it retains the Unyielding bonuses. They are still the go to prefixes, except solo you'll now maybe want a decent Instigating High-Damage weapon to pop trash enemies.
---
I wish more people would understand that. They act like Bethesda had  them in a choke hold and forced them to do these challenges. We even know now that some of the higher rewards will be purchasable with gold so those that didn't do it still didn't miss out on much.
---
Settler Forager. He's fixed, relatively quiet and gives quests. Gramps sometimes has a merchant fella show up, but I think he knew the kid's dad before the war.....
---
Someone probably has the excel sheet on here, but there are multiple seasonal rewards related to this event only. Plus you get some idle low tier scrip material and lots of treasury notes. So it’s good if you prefer to craft your own legendaries
---
We already have Gramps, the perfect companion. Dad jokes, always upbeat and no annoying dialog. What more could you want.
---
Asking opinions. Maybe it is bugged and not working the way it should. I know how it works on XBOX though.
---
That's affordable, nice, thx
---
You put a goat head on a naked woman........that says a lot about you!
---
I want to be op... without having to move around with just 10-20% of my health and the need to buy (more often than not at outrageous prices) or pray to RNGesus for a specific full set of gear.
---
I lived in the Abandoned town but apparently, I still have to discover it.
---
And sometimes you can't get them, period. I tried five times, five different characters. Can't power a power plant.
---
Shhh
---
Oooh whats it like? I hear tell of this fabled fireplace door. Haha nah I'd like that, I guess the board and that damned chicken coop but whatever
---
But can you put it in a display cabinet?

😂
---
A story three sentences.

👍
---
I have a pistol character and she's played the least. I 100% agree with you.
---
Dude... Turrets are cosmetic items. Never worked, never will. Do they look cool for some camps? Sure. But that's it.
---
Personally I think they are fun. I enjoy seeing the creativity with them. For me it adds that Legend Of Zelda puzzle factor. 😁
---
Yea she is beauty, but she doesnt do nothing. I have to plant, or craft or cook and clean. Hard relationship my friend 🙈
---
You donate the meat from animals and greens to the bins and clean the meat piles and poo.
---
For extra boosts to the bar up to 3 people can use the drums and 3 more people can use the cooking spits. So you can have 6 people afk on those then a few people can go for the meat, greens and put out fires and whatever
---
Exact same thing happened to me. I put a ticket into Bethesda support, just hoping they’ll fix it today as I was already incredibly behind on the legendary run.
---
I have more than 400 treasury notes just chilling in my inventory lol
---
One more level tonight, and I am done. Woohoo!
---
That sucks, I hadn’t heard that. Thanks for the update.
---
**bows**  😁
---
I just leveled up enough to get those farmable tiles, and yeah thats it I'm happy. Don't need or want gauss weapons. Ammo maker would be cool but honestly I'm not too fussed
---
then I'm afraid the nerf is going to do little to help that.
---
Ya I had a GF like that before in RL. Hence the had lol.
---
You Welsh?
---
He said Atom challenges but he clearly meant S.c.o.r.e.
---
His post literally says he doesn't feel obligated to play anymore and that he felt he had too to keep up with the daily grind. 
---
&gt;If the game runners weren't so obsessed with **daily logins** &amp; hopping on the hottest AAA monetary crazes of yesterday , maybe **more people would be able to enjoy the game**
---
Such a satisfying thing to do.
---
I've had turrets physically vanish, yet still take up budget.  Wires going to an empty space where a missile launcher was. Crazy shit.
---
Furious is a good one to look out for
---
It's not. Just another bullet sponge, but you do get 8 treasury notes so meh.
---
Tbf, there is some choice and consequence (what you name your nuka cola, which assaultron body you choose, the new radicals mask, what you do with Athena. ). I would also like to see more. It’s just tough in an online game where there is no going back and people complain about wanting to be able to experience all options. In single player games you can just load up an old save point.
---
perhaps. but if your target audience dislikes the direction you're going, then it's hardly a smart business decision.
---
They just recently changed how damage is calculated, it could be that
---
I thought they patched that?!
---
I had this happen to me too I guess just go next honestly
---
That’s just dumb, thank you for the update though!
---
I wonder this too.  The turrets at West Tek and Harper's ferry melt me fast.  But i come across 10 or so at a workshop, and they barely make a dent.
---
I'm not sure that those who are most upset are the target audience.
---
Bloodied can produce the damage needed to kill the Queen quickly, but that's not necessarily what you've been seeing at Queen battles for the last few months.  Those are "magic" weapons that do something with the game's damage that basically gives them a runaway Furious-type effect if they hit the enemy quickly and accurately enough.  The exponential appearance of the damage is a dead giveaway when this happens.
---
It's a wig. Scalped from someone that asked too many questions.
---
You can change your build anytime you want though.
---
Yea that would suck lol,  also I'm have issues with trying to sell at my C.A.M.P.  it won't let me list in my store. Yet it has a price??
---
The legendary effect only applies to the base weapon. Any mods are not affected.
---
I have an attachment to the underarmor w/ the better stats lol, I'm gonna switch
---
Me! 10 mm nocturnal machine gun for those pesky small jobs at night
---
Now I'm scared. Stay away from me Ghoul!
---
Quite the opposite: I see it at as great first step to put most builds at a common baseline, from which the less powerful builds can be improved as needed to keep things balanced.
---
Next as in cancel my 1st Subscription? It's done already. lol.
---
Another concern I have is the damage multiplicative values added from aid items. Wouldn't this make drugs/bobbleheads/magazines useless?
---
They fixed a bug. It was unintentional in the first place
---
How am I in the way? I’m contributing just like you.
---
Take your time and enjoy the game mate, before you know it you'll be bored and grinding rather than actually enjoying it... That said if you want to boost then do prime events, take workshops, boost your INT etc.
---
I would love to be able to fight waves of power armored soldiers, taking down vertibirds and all that. Something insane, like in Fallout 4, when all factions just go at it. 
---
Or something Like Manhunt, but difficult.
---
&gt;I’m aware that they’ll make changes before this goes live
---
they wont lol they never do unless we bitch about new things :V
---
Hey I haven't seen you pop up on my friends list yet. Sometimes the UI bugs out and doesn't show invites so you may need to send me one. IGN is McSanchez
---
Right, but what is your opinion? Should it be applied to the entire weapon including mods?
---
I wonder if they will change the progression seeing all the issues we had... more dalies...more points for completion...less points need to level...
---
I have spotlights for decoration in my bar and unless I just switch them on they dont target anything through the computer
---
It's like all other gold bullion items, and is bind on pickup
---
Yeah no kidding. I even avoid the adds as much as possible to burn down Earle faster and still usually level from that event and I'm 276 currently.
---
they're definitely not a minority like you said. and even the average joe player, which makes the brunt of their playerbase, is gonna have their damage nerfed.
---
I suppose we'll see. but personally I don't think the direction they're going with is what the majority of the playerbase wants. at least if the small sample found here and over at the official forums is anything to go by.
---
The state of Unarmed has been acknowledged as a bug though.  It's not passing through the same damage logic as one and two-handed weapons are.
---
Non-auto rifles though, I have no idea.
---
You aren't present, you aren't contributing, you're doing something that makes it appear you are. If you can't see the difference, then I understand why you can't see a problem with it.
---
Yeh :(
---
you will not get it fixed. those points are lost forever.
---
So its an exploit and not a build?
---
Noted. :)
---
bloodied excels at what it's suppose to, high damage output. even with the nerf, or any other nerfs, playing at 19% health will always be the way to go if you want to be 'op'
---
unless by 'op' you mean invincibility through vampire's.
---
Whenever you gain rads, you lose health up to a certain point that allows rads to fill up. If it’s low enough, under certain conditions, it can insta kill you.
---
Quit, join then disable vendors
---
Except for the cap on bullion, and script, and stash limit, and camp building budget, and caps you can save...but yeah.
---
it sucks
---
I've encountered so many game crashes ever since Meat Week started. I had it happen to me twice within 30 mins today

I love it when they say "Happy Reclaimation Day!" in a mocking, sing song voice during Riding Shotgun. Wish we could do that as an emote.
---
Because if you increase difficulty first, you end up accidentally gatekeeping content from most of the playerbase.
---
Mad dog Malone deserves a quest line at this point.  Don't know what funnier.  Mad dog escaping all the time.  Or Mad dog getting captured.  XD
---
It's a bad message for sure. Just like it was bad of bethesda to unsuspend so many of the cheaters with hacked weapons or thousands of duped gifts/be gatling plasmas a week after the "ban" wave. But with how this game has been handled, we really need to take some time to congratulate the few things that *are* going well. I'm keeping my hopes up that they do a rebalance of legendary effects as a whole and fix the countless forms of damage bugs currently in the game in the near future, but I don't expect it
---
Just for clarity, it's not a case of letting bethesda off the hook. These are still genuine issues that should be addressed as soon as possible, that in all reality should have been addressed a long time ago. But since that's not likely to happen, may as well appreciate the few needed changes that do happen
---
Unfortunately, nothing can be done about this now, or in the future. best you can do is to make sure you are not playing during the daily reset, but even that is not 100% effective.
---
Turrets at West Tek and other high level areas are high level and "mark 4" or something. They have explosive ammunition, higher perception and shred everything.
---
Little known fact:  charred ghouls are mutated trucks, hence why they hit like one.
---
if this is your first character i say take your time levelling up. Enjoy the life and death struggle of the wasteland. I enjoyed my first play through so much where i was always checking my ammo and stimpacks and walking around with broken armour. 
---
you can get excavator armour from 25 onwards. click on a Garrahan excavator poster to start the quest. A set of level 25 PA will do you until 50 and then look into getting the right set. 
---
In my opinion you want somewhere with water and a junk pile. Or just a junk pike. Use this to find junk pile locations  [https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/)  The one NW of sunshine meadows is a nice early game spot. This will help you find junk

 Try and melee as much as possible to save ammo. A good rifle will look after you early game. It'll save you ammo. 
---
Basically get whatever armour gives the best damage resistance for now. scrap armours t learn mods and upgrade where possible.
---
As a full-health heavy gunner, I'm glad Bethesda's damage nerf affects bloodied builds more than others. I'm sick of not getting any loot from the SBQ.
---
Personally I wouldn't mind set effects like the strangler PA.

That depends on how they factor in those bonuses. Do they apply as part of their own additive stack, or part of the general buff stack? Again, that can be played with later.
---
Yes. Watoga.
---
I'm just glad that this only really affects one of my characters. I've never chased the meta in this game, because I've always enjoyed figuring out my own builds. That, and when I did try out a bloodied build, I personally found it to be really boring. 
---
You're telling me that I can one shot mobs and do 200x more damage to a boss I've run countless times already, and have no reason to participate in it anymore? Meh. I already kill most things in one to two hits with my other builds already.
---
I’ve seen far too many really low level characters popping into events thinking they’re going to be able to dodge mobs long enough to sneak in the exp bonuses.
---
I can’t save you. Sometimes, I can’t even save myself depending on where you’re fast traveling in on top of me.
---
use it at the hourly grahm event. Use the lunchbox emote and hopefully other people will use them as well and you'll get a nice boost.
---
The last 3 times i've used them there other people have popped them as well.
---
308 hours and I am still missing like 3 diseases. One of them is the whoopsies. Is there a thing somewhere that tells you what diseases you have already had?
---
How long do they last?
---
It would be nice but I can only imagine the hacks that will occur if Bethesda comes out with a phone app for FO 76.
---
Hacking your character to:
---
Remove your armor and weapons during pvp
---
Change your perk cards
---
Drop your inventory so it can be stolen.
---
Consume all your aid.
---
Desperate plea from someone still trying to get good gear to all the level 200+ players one-shotting the boss before the rest of us can even see it: please, please, I know you’re busy doing whatever it is someone with thousands of play hours does, but just let the other half dozen people doing the event with you get a couple of shots on the boss so we can get a chance at good gear too. 
---
Literally every time I’ve played it today, someone has melted the legendary boss before the rest of us know it’s there, it’s so utterly deflating and miserable. Just a few extra seconds, that’s all I’m asking for 🙏
---
Sorry I haven't put it across well. I mean do it all in on go, balance all the weapons sort the useless prefix's out and release one wasteland everyone is in same boat at same time and everyone is happy. I'd love to use a buffed ts etc.
---
&gt;This is the first time in Bethesda's history that a Fallout game has been rebalanced
---
That is, without a doubt, one of the dumbest things I've ever read on this forum. Seriously? You expected Bethesda to swoop in and "rebalance" FO3? For what? The benefit of Albino Radscorpions everywhere? What "rebalance" changes would they have made in FO4? Nerfing the omnipresent fedoras and trillbys?
---
If you're bloodied than every thing Will wreck you. It just a matter of Who gets the hit in first. Scorchbeasts are tanky but weak. Ghouls are squishy but hit hard. I think its normal
---
I'm happy to be going back to junkies, or using vampires only and going for an unkillable build. My only gripe is still the exp bonus from unyielding int being so significant.
---
I’m on Xbox so I’m not sure if we got that update yet, we still don’t the new event.
---
Agreed. Trap bases are fun, and 100% intended.
---
But at least you are a man of your word.
---
Must be nice.
---
I finished it last saturday. It didn't burn me out at all,since challenges have been the reason I turn the game on daily. Now I'm just left with winning NW in PA or naked,which is really tough for me without a team. I already skipped playing a couple of days.
---
👋 XxQuarantinaxX
---
It's the first fallout online multiplayer game They have done. They have already rebalanced several legendary effects since they game has been out. I am not a fan of their poor communication and vague promises to the playerbase. They have already failed to deliver a lot of what they said they would in the time frames they set.
---
Character A, Person A buys 1 round of ammo from Character B, Person B for 30,000 Caps (or whatever). Person A swaps to Character C. Character C, Person A, sells 1 round of ammo to Character B, Person B for 30,000 Caps. Person A has now moved 30,000 Caps from Character A to Character C.

If you are getting low framerate drops, check to see if there is someone with an automatic tesla. I have ran radiation rumble twice and only one of them lagged out, because one person had an auto tesla. The same thing occurred later on when doing project paradise
---
No, I have 0 expectation of that. And I had 0 expectation that they'd do anything about Fallout 76. But they've kept on working on this game. And they're improving. Comparing it to other online MMO-lite games, like RDR2, Bethesda is actually doing MORE, FASTER than competitors like Rockstar. I'm not a Bethesda fanboy, but I can acknowledge progress.
---
You can’t without another player to assist.
---
Goat, not sheep
---
They should just add a map of a bunch of Lilly pads.
---
It effects everyone closeby. You can stack a max of 4 for a 100% xp boost. The best time to pop one is when there is alot of players around
---
one hour i believe.
---
okay i had to search that one, yeah for something advertised as account wide, perk are locked to characters when ranked up, now that's really disappointing.
---
Yup! I didn’t even get in to stealth multipliers or melee multipliers or crit multipliers; there’s even more going there (melee has mutations and strength and power attacks; stealth has sneak attacks and perks and weak spots and crits!) 
---
Honestly the way it is on live is the way that makes *sense*, the problem is Bethesda put in so many different multipliers that you can stack, AND with such massive values for a MMO (most MMO’s that have flat damage multiplier passives are like, 1-5% per. And buffs can be big, but short duration and long cooldowns) that they’ve created a massive scaling problem between casual players who feel content is too hard, and minmaxers who feel it’s too easy.
---
Just look at the result from my first Live example. We went from 100 damage to 975. That’s almost 10x more damage! And that’s not even factoring in other stuff like damage buffs, Tenderizer on the target, etc etc. 
---
They’re trying to reign it in but honestly they’re going to have some serious balance problems. Because now things like Swing Speed, Faster Fire Rate, and Anti Armor are massively more powerful *relatively*, because they still scale off current damage since they aren’t a flat “damage increase”. Stuff like 10% more damage while aiming is going to be almost unnoticeable and basically worthless.
---
The event can be incredibly buggy and the boss dying usually doesn’t end the event immediately. I get it if it’s 2 minutes on the clock with a 3* boss, but also remember that your odds of good random gear drops is a fraction of a fraction and most players are just trying to finish the primal cut events so they can get the limited time rewards!
---
No, they should leave battle royal to other games and invent a new, unique game play for PVP. Maybe something like Escape from Tarkov OR the hunt showdown. Have the adventure mode still but then have a hard core mode where you go into a small portion of the main map to look for loot. You have 40 minutes to exit and if you die you loose it all but if you survive you get to keep all that stuff for your adventure mode character. I believe Bethesda should discontinue nuclear winter in favor of more enlightened fallout-like gameplay.
---
Looks like you had a previous character. There was a glitch that gave you a pack when you leveled up in adventure mode and it was fixed upon wastelanders update. I had 154 or something when I went into nw for the first time.
---
As long as me and a friend can still take down the SBQ within a reasonable time... Im ok with this.
---
Sounds like you exploit ammo factories.  So, karma?
---
My CAMP is right next to where the Prime Meats event spawns and I cannot tell you how absolutely sick I am of being raped by Yao Gui and those creepy bee monsters. 
---
I just wanted a consistent supply of concrete, dammit!
---
You're welcome! If you have any questions feel free to message me here :)
---
Wow
---
I don't recommend you play Anthem, Destiny, or RDR2 online then. You'll find that, amazingly, they're somehow worse than Bethesda.
---
Join a public team
---
And it will still be the build doing the most damage after the nerf, just not disproportionately so.
---
Point being that most new content will now have to be conceived with the new damage baseline in mind, instead of having to take into account that one build that does far more damage than the others.
---
Plus the SPECIAL bonus from unyielding is also quite game breaking when you consider that it can give +15 to every stat (+18 during the brief period the Free Radical mask could have the effect), which was borderline cheating for many of the Wastelanders dialogues, which were supposed to only allow you some unique dialogue choices based on your build.
---
So I hope that something is done about that as well.
---
I have a similar issue with max lvl liberators. It’s just dmg type and Bethesda’s weird math that constantly runs them into combat breaking dmg bugs. Fun times
---
I get by with a little help from my friends.
---
Don’t sweat it man, everyone’s entitled to their own opinion.
---
I came across a floating space ship with the glow in dark star wallpaper on the outside and it was amazing
---
must be nice to have some that play :(
---
Primal Cuts, no. Meat Week Cookout, yes.
---
Make it so your camp is just auto-restored after so many mins.
---
We literally got an update to it with wastelanders what are you talking about
---
See, the only one I've failed has been the Savage Divide, that's weird.
---
I'll beat my meat across your face and you'll thank me for the protein.
---
It was old ammo from back when I ran with a Je 10mm for awhile. I bought it all from different people.
---
I’ve seen a couple of those. They are impressive
---
What are your settings at?
---
I started playing almost 3 months ago. I have been tanking in WoW for ages so decided I would not go Heavy Power Armor. That was before I realized this is a pure DPS game for the most part.... (Healing Syringer and working Friendly Fire Flamers would be nice.)
---
In any case, I wanted to be a stealthy rifle character. I switched to wanting automatic weapons. I found out that the “stealth commando” build was the nomenclature but still just used the perks I wanted and just wanted to be competent. 
---
Then I tried Bloody. Whoa. Huge damage. That said, I still die a lot. Old tank/dps habits die hard. 
---
It is fun but I have no desire to kill bosses in moments. I only have the mutations that I find fun, the perks for QOL and Commando. I’m not optimized. I still have fun as a result.
---
Raider Punk is my go-to. He offers good quests, and he’s a total conspiracy theory spouting nutjob.
---
As the other guys said. If this is your first playthrough you should just enjoy it. You can worry about maxing your build later.
---
This will essentially kill junkie’s &amp; beserkers why in gods name would you use those when normal non-legendary weapons do around the same damage now😂 Bloodied melee should’ve been nerfed big &amp; damage overall for bloodied taken down moderately. Nothing else should have been touched in my opinion.
---
Exactly 😵😂
---
they are supposed to come to the barrel but the AI is.. well.. you know..
---
Nothing wrong. They are just melee Mr Gutsy’s.
---
Make sure your hitting the events and join a public team building or events Also try get in a team with 4 people switch if you have too. What platform are you on if Xbox I can drop you some camp plans.
---
Unarmed is also the ONLY weapon category with only 1 perk to boost its damage, so for ages it's been MUCH more perk efficient than slugger, gladiator, etc. They clearly need to work on it. One of my characters is the stereotypical bloodied stealth unarmed and I massacre everything with fewer perk points than it'd take to use a 2h weapon.
---
I really enjoy seeing the different fixes people list for this - including the suggestions already in this thread, I've seen....
---
* Tied to Healing Factor
---
* Move a certain distance and try again
---
* Eat/Drink/Stim
---
* In the option to fast travel, escape out of the prompt telling you how much it is going to cost, then select again
---
* Fire a bullet, crouch, turn off pip boy
---
* Just keep trying
---
I was personally a big proponent of the "Move a certain distance and try again", until I discovered the fact that just doing it multiple times eventually gets you through. The fact that you can do nothing else but try again and it works tells me that all of the other theories are probably wrong. But if you feel one of these (or something else!) works for you, knock yourself out.
---
My personal (completely unproved) theory is the bug is somehow tied to the timer you get if there are enemies around when you want to fast travel. I've had numerous times where I see that timer pop up, but instead of completing the countdown the timer just disappears and fast travel fails. But I don't always see the timer when fast travel fails. So maybe there are more than one cause to the fast-travel bug, or perhaps sometimes that mechanism fails so quickly you don't see the timer.
---
If I'm right, the problem (or one version of the problem) is one system says "hey, there are enemies", then another system says "uh, no, there aren't any enemies", and something about the order or timing those two events means the part that says "it's safe to travel, lets go" doesn't get triggered.
---
A side story - I ran into a guy the other day that was perpetually over-encumbered. He just accepted that as his fate, and uses Nuka-Shine to try and get to where he wants. He even had a theory that if he pointed in the direction he wanted to go, crouched down (and maybe something else) then drank the nuka-shine, he was likely to go where he needed. Now, I can't say he's wrong  - I've not done enough testing myself to prove it. But I'm pretty sure it was just wishful thinking, as I believe most (all?) of these work around for the fast travel bug are.
---
Luckily I'm one of the few that isn't affected by FOMO; I haven't even gone past the first track XD . Plus I play primarily first person so I can care less about how my character looks.
---
I got Remnant off Epic for free so I got that preoccupying my time.
---
I used each of mine for 3 lvl ups,doing the flatwood quests.
---
I was calling them all G because it's the default letter when scrapping a character ehe.
---
I’m actually jealous.   I wish I had taken more time when I was new to the game.   Now I’m a lvl 160 with the game knowledge of a lvl 50.   
---
That being said, don’t forget that half the fun is other players being a variable.    Not enough CAMP plans?  Work out a trade for plans (I routinely have lower levels fetch me certain types of flora in exchange for things), or hire someone to place stuff at your CAMP, tons of possibilities.
---
Pro-tip for when you start getting three star drops, look into what people are buying/selling.   I couldn’t even guess how many god roll legendaries I’ve scripped because it didn’t fit my character build, not knowing how valuable it was.
---
You wearing power armor man?  I mean ghouls can hit you all day in power armor but if your outside PA and running bloodied you will get trucked.  Blocker is a great perk for that along with serendipity of course.
---
At least Destiny's is just tied to EXP. You can grind it out or just let it happen over the course of the season. 
---
Tying them to daily/weekly challenges and removing a passive source of atoms feels really malicious
---
That's the beauty of one wasteland, a lot of the old events that are too easy will be more difficult.
---
special hardly matters in this game. you get some nice bonuses like carry weight and easier hacking, but the only worthwhile mention is the extra ap and maybe luck if you're a crit build.
---
the extra dialogue options are mostly just a different yes with a few notable exception to skip some inane busywork. I don't see how that qualifies cheating.
---
and if your problem is with how disproportionate the damage is, then why not play bloodied? it's doing what it's supposed to, output high damage. alternatively, why not buff other builds instead of nerfing everything to the ground?
---
it's silly no matter how you put it.
---
Everyone needs to chill. They are not going to release it as is. It's on the PTS so they can test it and make the necessary fixes, changes and improvements. It's very unlikely these changes will come with Patch 22, as they will probably need a few patches of PTS to get it right. 
---
If they do take the time to get this right, when all is said and done, yeah Bloodied probably won't do the damage it once did, but the difference will be negligible and it will still be the biggest damage-dealer. Other legendary prefixes will become viable instead of instant scrip.
---
Two words: Explosive. Bait.
---
Some dude tried luring me into his trap cave the other day so I disappeared for ten minutes to kill some Radstag and craft then levelled his camp. Endlessly satisfying 😊
---
Touché 😂
---
I have never had anything occur  like that.  For the future, you can add a link leading an imgur post with the picture.  That’s how most people post pictures in their text posts
---
Junkies is 2nd highest damage by current PTS calculations after bloodied. Berserkers wasn't even tested but I actually think this is a big buff to berserkers. It'll probably be third, and very cost effective because all you need is a broken chinese stealth suit and a berserker's weapon.
---
Aren't they unarmed? Doesn't that negate Blocker?
---
Those suck too. I have exactly the same problems with a scorched nibbling my camp to bits while the missile turret is just chillin’.
---
Most people run high DR for PVE because very few things use energy damage.  Always amazing me when the one super accurate super mutant with a laser rifle melts my bloodied build when I’m outside PA.
---
I pet them all the time with my power fist.  Play dead!  Good boy!
---
I think tanky power armor with vampires weapons is the future and I'm here for it. Fellow MMO tank.
---
Yes ahaha.mine were as well! 
---
F for all the Gs.
---
I've been doing this since the daily lvl up when you needed responder outfit,being naked and in a team.
---
What platform?
---
It was late and I was thinking there were ones that they didn't have this year then I remembered I think they we slighly different color, like I thought the owl was lighter. I could be miss remembering sorry. I tried to look it up and couldn't find what I was looking for.
---
PC 😁
---
Many events lend themselves to sharing the violent love, but not this one. The clock is the real enemy.
---
well, if nobody plays the drum they most likely won't come... and it's faster to run after them anyway
---
I've failed a few primal cuts due to the last wave not spawning
---
This. I was mele initially, then changed to heavy gunner in p.a., then changed to commando. I go back and forth between commando and heavy gunner depending on my mood.
---
Yep - happened 3 times to me last night.
---
I am in the same situation, but I am absolutely enjoying it for what it is. I think the low-level stuff is going to be the most fun for me. I enjoy scrounging for food and chems, trying to still make the game feel like a survival mode or otherwise environmental challenge. Once I get to a high enough level where I am basically invincible, I think the game is going to lose its appeal to me.   
---
Honestly I wish there was a way to up the difficulty because playing FO4 on survival mode, with no fast travel, only saving by sleeping, etc. That was the most fun I had with FO4, and I wish fo76 could capture that survival feeling a little bit better.
---
Different Maxon same family line
---
That's my point, the exits were not available. We all just stood there emoting question marks time after time with minutes left on the timer. SO, I guess I will just sit there and wait till the timer expires since the actual game event is broken.  I've completed the event several times on the PTS with no issues exiting the mine.
---
I also run a minimally optimized build. 
---
Just enough of the right perks tonmake combat not a drudge, leaving me some perk cards in more for flavour of other things.
---
I fucking despise the entire damage system Bethesda made with this game. Not really a fan with how perk cards and legendaries function in the game currently. I would not be opposed to them drastically redesigning the whole "perk" system along with legendaries. Even if it meant me personally losing 100,000caps in value of weapons and gear I would want to see it done.
---
Blocker 3: “Take 45% less damage from your opponents' melee attacks.” That includes unarmed attacks
---
https://discord.gg/7g5mGjz come join the enclave, I play on pc and we are very active, we launch nukes every night to farm the colossus and queen.
---
it just works I suppose.
---
You probably want to go all out for either shotgun (strength) or rifleman (perception) 
---
With your hunting rifle and shotgun as main guns definitely get rid of commando. 
---
Being a rifleman myself, I have all rifleman perks maxed, also tank killer and concentrated fire to get those sweet headshots in vats
---
You didn’t research the entire maxon lore
---
Even if I challenge Todd Howard to a 1v1? /s 
---
But seriously thanks for making sure I didn’t avoid playing all day hoping it would be fixed.
---
I thought this was patched! Trust me I have someone in mind for this. The first time I walked into the door because you could see the vendors. He was cloaked and I didn’t see him. He shut the door behind me and then opened up some flamers. 
---
Saw him again yesterday and initiated a pvp...accidentally blew myself up in an attempt to be able to target his base with my explosive weapon so I stopped bothering. 
---
This guy has 100 explosive baits waiting for him when he stumbles into another server with me again &gt;:)
---
Happened only once so far, in Savage Divide. We finished with 2 minutes left and ran around trying to find any shy enemies until the timer ran out and we failed.
---
Well said.
---
I have my camp next to a blood eagle camp, they’re only like lvl 20 but the boss almost always carries a lvl 50 Gatling laser or some other heavier laser weapon. It’s amazing how much dmg they can do with perk less mobs
---
If I find out that coat was handed down through generations, I’m gonna cause a temporal paradox
---
Same last name, different guy. This Maxon was a traitor / deserter who was too squeamish....
---
I don't really understand the hype optimized, bloodied builds. None of my characters are bloodied, with the only Junkie character being a hoarder / food build. The game is easy; I would actually prefer more bullet sponge enemies to waste ammo on.
---
Override.
---
Not to mention you shouldn't be able to complete every event to the max  every time. 
---
High end content should be challenging, and run an actual risk of failing.
---
&gt;*I DoNt sEe tHe LoGiC 
---
I guess you only played fo4? 🤔
---
By the way you talk and act I'm guessing you're one of those clout chasers with some stupid looking pic of yourself in the bathroom, who scams people out of weapons, the "I won't drop first" guy. Yeah, I'm allowed to be a higher level than you, I put in the work for it. And just because I don't plaster myself to my couch playing this game so long doesn't mean I'm lower than you. By the way, nice wannabe sweat name, looks like you doss people in trials on destiny 2, but what do I know, it's not like you're a dime a dozen or anything, very common not very special, and shit at insulting people.
---
It's a bug. Patch 21 broke it.
---
Yeah that works
---
9 points for 60% is not smart, but 5 points for 40% and 3 points for max armor penetration is and makes a massive difference.
---
I disagree that perks need any changes other than new ones added to support more varied builds.
---
They do need to balance weapon base damage though, seriously, and also sort out all the bugged weapons.
---
Was at 28k when someone bought 20k of my 5.56....feels bad indeed.
---
That sounds horrific. xD
---
I have 3 in my shop at 8k each. No one has bought them
---
I was at the Graham Cook out event earlier today and someone(or multiple people) literally opened about 15 at once, think they didn't realise it didn't stack over 100%. They don't have to be in your team, which is something I never knew. Best event imo is line in the sand when you do that F1st tent trick or radiation rumble.
---
It’s about time we got PA Displays!
---
Yeah I'd love to see her mention events or nukes or stuff along these lines.
---
That sounds like the Division Dark Zones....
---
Somewhere in the mire
---
I had one last night we were on the 4th wave with 2 minutes left and failed because nothing spawned. Come on.
---
Yeah, it was fun to have them for about 5 mins, then you had people using them to have people fall off cliffs.
---
I think we only need to look back at the TSE nerf to see what will happen. Half my friends list quit the game with the nerf. I think this one will be equally as devastating.
---
Wouldn't it be nice if sometimes..... You failed the event?
---
Farming an auto win event is boring af. End game content should run the risk of failure.
---
I take a sip of whiskey every time my FT fails. After 2h of gameplay i don't care anymore... also all my problems IRL goes away, which is a bonus.
---
Especially with the levels mentioned in the list, it should not be an issue
---
Shut up and take my money bitches, this looks good:
---
I saw someone had it on a curtain must have been the only way they could place it
---
Its for real so dumb, please can we potentially get a 50% increase in time, i mean shit, the yao guai in the SD either run away from you or mob you its ridiculous, that and maaainly the burrowing creatures i had to run UP that mountain in the ash heap and kill a legendary radscorpion, 2 min left, run down, put 1000 fusion core rounds into sheepsquatch with a minute left, mutates at 20 seconds and boom fail like there was at least 7 of us and i was focused on sheep while everybody else was splitting time with sheep and scorps, it was going fine if not for the fuckin runaway
---
I may go that route. Power armor is fun. Too bad it’s strength. I do get a great deal of enjoyment from sneaking around otherwise. 
---
Then again, I do like shotguns. Hmmm...shotguns and heavy weapons. Hmmm....
---
I've played fallout games since fallout 3. The devil you know is better than the one you don't in many cases.
---
Is that barrel just a stash box? I love me some barrels. 
---
Those recliners look pretty great, too.
---
Yes the game *is* my personal playground as some random asshole sitting behind a computer screen doesn't get to define how I enjoy my games
---
Good advice in here already, I just want to add that if you lookup various ways of increasing your XP and INT bonuses you will level up quicker.
---
Also, what system are you on? I have lots of plans and low level stuff I normally give away to low level players and I know lots of others do as well.
---
The Albino Radscorpion Union of the Wasteland wants a fair chance for all our radscorpion brethren!
---
I thought the shooting game was Season 2 as well but I’m very much excited for outfit and PA displays.
---
Armor display. Nice
---
I think you don't really understand how multiplayer works but you're free to pick whatever hill you want to die on.
---
My leveling slaves died around level 5 and sometimes forced into nuclear winter
---
Scaling only goes up to level 50
---
Highest level on Xbox console right now is  Mori with about 520 lvls
---
I had a bug a few months ago where I went in and had no cards, but they were all in packs, but then as I started opening them it said I already had the card. So now I have all the cards and 170 points to buy cards that I already have all of, it was a bug that went well for me. Lol
---
Note: it was not a new or second character, just randomly at like level 75
---
Right? 
---
Shouldn't end game be challenging with a real chance of failure?
---
You might have to *gasp* build a party with some build variety
---
Half the issue is the on the hour Primal cuts, there should be 3 and then the cookoff really....
---
The grind is what you make it out to be. If you want a unnecessary god roll then your gonna be farming for a long time.
---
You can just pick up any weapon and be pretty effective.
---
I don’t see them changing level cap anytime soon if ever.
---
I'm dead set on finishing the Run in the next few days so I can move on to my other timegated addiction - trying to outpace the Shadowlands prepatch. Followed by a heavily modded rp run of Rimworld, obviously.
---
Shotguns need work, they're still overcooked from nerfs last year to deal with Two-Shot-Explosive shotguns. If you're gonna go strength and power armor I'd go 2h melee or heavy guns.
---
This nerf made pistols obsolete, same with almost all Non commando weapons and melee especially.
---
it's tough. You can only buy so many serums. You can only spend so many C-notes before you run out of things to buy. You can only have 1000 scrip. You can only hold so many legendaries before you can't fast travel. Sometimes I am like, wait, why do I even need caps anyway. 
---
It is a constant balancing act. I scrip the heaviest legendaries and put the lightest on sale. I have dropped a half dozen or more legendaries in the past couple of days because I got them collecting score and didn't have anywhere to put them. I found myself glad that a heavy weapon was one star because it would only "cost" 5 points to scrip it.  The good side of that is it makes people more likely to spend caps at your camp, I guess, because they need to unload them.
---
Or go into the legendary run board while afk, won't get kicked that way
---
Unless you wanna die those must be some small ass sips
---
They hand me my ass every time if I'm not paying attention.
---
gratz.
---
interested in trading it?

You couldn't be any further off.  I said "LuL" and you went on to fabricate an entire persona for me based on nothing except a few lines written on the internet.  Higher level?  Lol we were just wondering how you were only that level.
---
Quitting posts are stupid and i responded in kind.  You're "shit at insulting people" because your insult is just incoherent ramblings.
---
Though melee and unarmed are different, they produce the same effect? This is not MTG, I assume, where printed words actually matter.  I assume Blocker covers both Melee and unarmed equal. Just feeling more noob-ish now...
---
I really don’t understand why this post has been downvoted so much. I’m not hating on the game, I’m simply trying to improve the experience for everyone... it’s certainly an issue on the PlayStation 4, also I’m not alone on this experience from the comments.
---
Bethesda aren’t beyond reproach and this post was made with good intentions for the 76 community. I’ll leave it at that.
---
It's a variant on it, ducks instead of commies.
---
There's two separate shooting games, one from the Armor Ace SCOREBOARD where the target is a Liberator bot, and this duck hunt one.
---
I just got my first one a couple of nights ago! Can't really complain about it. :D

NW has some of the easiest challenges but congrats nonetheless.
---
(PS4) I've run the event at every location twice and this happened every time.
---
 I thought I read somewhere that if prime beasts are killed too far from the center this will occur but I can't find the comment to quote it. Can anyone confirm this?
---
Yea I noticed it yesterday too. First starts the primal cuts and a few moments later the Cook out. Not sure which idiot thought this is a good idea....
---
They can easily change individual or category weapon damage. They can modify perks. Damage overhauls are much more intensive and have to happen first. Also, I have a pistol character, they were barely relevant before and that's just sad.
---
I have a gunslinger build, I feel the opposite. It's my most fun playthrough. Heavy vats/critical, multiple legendary pistol hot keyed for enemy types. Can clear Whitesprings golf clubhouse with headshots before I get caution. When vats work and fireworks reloading. It's a blast, get my Clint Eastwood thrills. Unfortunately it's not end game viable.  And took a long time to find the right perks/gear. But everything else was fun. Grew tired of my tank/ Melee  unarmed hybrid build.
---
That’s like comparing a diarrhea to a hard turd, yeah ones worse but both of them are still shitty
---
All they did was add two worthless weapons and one weapon which is the most OP weapon in the game which lags the entire game.
---
If it could be done without coding issues, I’d be fine with that, yes.
---
Ah, I see. That’s cool that way some people who want one like it doesn’t have to grind all the way.
---
It fits perfectly in the "Have a great day" sign
---
I don't even understand why you got banned 🤔
---
I do trades with 100k+ junk and never get banned are you sure you're not leaving something out like picking up an duped weapon or multiple  🤔
---
Maybe it’s time I roll an alt.
---
So fall guys lol
---
Nothing can be a 1\* Berserker Golf Club.
---
Some of us didn't :(
---
Only one of those in your example killed literally hundreds of thousands of people per year until the advent of modern medicine, and it wasn't a hard turd.
---
Also clips through the brotherhood fatigues
---
Or maybe you shouldn't harass people while they're trying to complete a challenge?
---
I think VATS will be a lot more viable after this damage nerf. Crits will be a free source of damage multipliers (unless they're rolling crit damage in with regular damage bonuses).
---
Bethesda is capitalist and capitalism kills 18 million people a year. Sit down sweaty 🥺🥰
---
there's been a minimum of 5 people at every single one i've done.
---
I launched two sbq last night. I like killing that bitch. Imma need someone to walk me thru a meat week event. Ps4; takers?
---
*Gatling laser spinning up*
---
Weird flex but okay
---
No bloodied. that build feels generic and sheepish. Just got out of a SBQ with SB sample went to VTU to deposit and WHAM got flattened by that MF twice. Felt awkward having being dumped that quick, twice mind you, in that brief span.
---
What do you have in mind?
---
That sounds complicated. Maybe a bit too complicated for bethesda.
---
I did have a previous character, but I was unclear. I'm level 36 in nuclear winter. Which means I did log in and have maybe a dozen packs the first time, months ago. But I played nuclear winter yesterday and had zero packs. Today over 50. 
---
I mean I'm used to all kinds of bugs in this game, this one just came out of nowhere. Was there even a patch since yesterday?
---
Gear levels don't change
---
 Watoga would be perfect with all the high buildings, the rail yard, all the terrain, and the Forrest
---
weapons and armor still cap at 50 and as far as enemies go i haven't seen anything above 150 other than bosses so im not sure where your getting this infinitely scaling thing from
---
Oh really? I had no idea! Will keep that in mind if I have to go afk and am unsure if I'll be able to play during the event
---
So there's 2 of us haha
---
Ok captard, keep defending mass murder and systemic oppression 😎
---
I won’t frustrate myself with trying to join from the map. Fast traveling to Vault 76 is waaaay easier and a short walk to the event
---
It worked. Thanks.
---
I mean, have you seen Grahm's cooking area?  Health code violations galore.  I get the shits just looking at it.
---
SWTOR has a credit escrow where they go after your subscription runs out. Maybe they should do something similar?
---
That's kind of similar to what happened to me. I didn't look very carefully before I started opening them oh, maybe it had removed my cards too.  hmmm.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only person who had something weird like this happen
---
hmmm looks like you are wrong
---
Some people don't care about NW and tbh I don't blame them. It doesn't matter how easy it is because you still have to go out of your way for 250 score which isn't much. I'd much rather just get some xp then bother with NW.
---
Yeah , I don’t any use for it anyways
---
Same here.... It's not too much to ask for..... Or is it?
---
Did nothing happen?
---
Today there was some naked woman standing right in front of drums. I was the only one on drums. She stood there the entire time. FFS, get on the damn drums if you're going to be afk there.
---
There's brotherhood of steel story in 76?
---
Does nothing. You have to remove one before the other can be applied.
---
Good news, you’re wrong. The max level for gear is unchanged. Enemies scale up to better reflect your level, but max out at 100. Most will be 50 or 75. Things are a little tougher, but not significantly. 
---
Eventually they probably will increase the max level on gear, this change makes that plausible, but it’s not there yet.
---
Also other weapons that desperately need a buff like Mutant’s are getting a nerf instead. And they’re not addressing magic weapons at all.
---
Only a rolling pin can😉
---
I came back to fallout a couple weeks ago and paid for it thinking it was ending that weekend. Oooooof
---
nothing is happening
---
I think I've used that line at a bar once
---
It can be done solo. In addition to the drums prior to the event start, after the event begins run round and gather up all the greens and kill the critters, **but don’t turn them in.** Clean up piles along the way as well. Drop off some wood every so often. 
---
Don’t turn them in. Wait until there is about a minute left. Then turn in all the greens and chunks you’ve gathered. 
---
You’ll either get the meter filled up all the way and end the event or have it so high that the one minute of degradation won’t matter.
---
Lvl 2k, good lord he must be killing hundreds of enemies on the reg lol
---
Yeah im slated to complete season 1 tonight thanks in part of Double score weekend.
---
After ai unlock level 100, im gonna claim everything and give 76 a break. Some of my friends want me to play ARK with them.
---
Also, people need to fill up ONE first, all drums in use, or all spits in use.  You get double contribution if all 3 of either is in use.  Also, if you are on them in the 2 minute countdown for the event you start higher to begin with.
---
you owe me 250 caps^^
---
It’s always amazing when folks will spend huge amounts of money on lightweight receivers, uppers, fluted barrel... then load it up with heavy, cheap lights and optics and builds and tape switches and....
---
Different maxon. It’s his great great grandfather or something. They have different first names.
---
And that’s perfectly viable. You can miss all of the NW challenges and *still* complete the season.
---
I'm not saying it's a job or chore I've just done a lot in game and put a lot of hours in a short period of time. I'm not the type of person to just stick to one game. I do want to complete the season because I'm almost done that is all.
---
https://m.twitch.tv/videos/707826286 Jesus this dude is insane lol
---
That Heavy Melee/Powerarmor/Heavy Weapons toon.
---
Damn that sounds like fun, better change it immediately.
---
Ive kept the last slot open for this reason. Providing a slot to a throwaway character.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel was founded by and, in the year 2103, is commanded by Captain Roger Maxson (service number 072389) formerly of the United States Army.
---
Roger Maxim dies, of cancer, in 2135.  He was succeeded by his son.
---
The Elder Maxson in FO4 was Arthur Maxson, born in 2267 to Jonathan and Jessica Maxson.  He is distantly related to (and the last living descendant of) Roger Maxson.  He was sent to be raised by respected Elder Owyn Lyons after his father died.  We ran into him in FO3 as a ten year old boy.
---
As of 2287, Elder Maxson's reign in the Capital Wasteland was uncontested, and his authority and influence were spreading across the Eastern Seaboard.   We ran into him again in FO4 as a 20 year old boy.  It wasn't an improvement.
---
That's the very abridged version.
---
100 bucks Alrex makes more money than your pathetic ass 🤣
---
I had 3 like that this morning
---
So you're made that someone else is doing the lazy job because you want it?
---
It can easily be avoided though. I know its not an acceptable bug but how hard is it not to log on when dailies are reseting? I get it the first time because not everyone knows this bug exists. I haven't had this happen to me once since I learned just not to log in during the daily reset.
---
I guess you didn’t see the giant post showing all the damage numbers that were tested for all builds showing junkie’s &amp; berserkers are in fact not getting a “big buff” wherever tf you got that &amp; yeah obviously junkie’s will be 2nd in damage it was before the nerf?? Going from 164 damage to like 87 is not a buff or anything acceptable
---
Yep a small number of them are coming from the west in a future update called fractured steel. They are part of the west coast lost hills chapter
---
For Cranberry Bog, I usually use a ranged weapon to tag the Behrmoth and then book it in the opposite direction to take out the Fog Crawlers that spawn way the hell out there. Then the event is completed and I have to run all the way back to loot the Behemoth.
---
Yesterday I tried to tag the Legendary Sheepsquatch in Ash Heap and I inadvertently took out about 50% of its health with a quick burst. I need to remember to cary a Vampire's LMG with me or something to quickly tag enemies without killing them.
---
Just run from Vault 76 if you’re having a bad time.
---
Yes. Harpers ferry
---
I agree. Would be way more useful than the F4 one
---
Seasons actually killed the game for me. I can’t get stuck in another battle pass I have to complete, &amp; this one is the hardest one with the least amount of stuff I actually care for, &amp; I obsess over challenges in general, not with this game tho🖕🏻
---
It is the alpha and the omega; it is the great unifier of all beings.   
---
Also, it has a jackelope.
---
So just in PTS for now.  Then on to PC for those guinea pigs to work out the other bugs and someday on to console.   Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
---
😑 Oh god, not against...
---
My man, this Maxon is the first, it he's the one who started all when it comes to the BoS.
---
i got a lvl50 3star Chefs Furious Rolling Pin.
---
You and those near you
---
Where lol
---
This would be like getting mad at someone in NW because they killed you when you're just trying to do a "survive X minutes in NW mode" challenge.  When you enter a pvp area, pvp might happen.  When you claim a workshop, you are flagging yourself for pvp.  A box even pops up and tells you that to make sure you know before you accept.  You're wrong on this one.
---
Most season based games I take a break after I'm done. It's hard for me to stick to one game. I think my longest streak was 7 months of doing GTAV RP and that's because of player interaction. It was always different when I logged because you never know what people will do next. Quit it do due to depression and a break up with someone I thought I was gonna marry. I do feel the itch coming back, but I don't have the privacy here to get into my character and yell "GET THE FUCK ON THE GROUND" loudly without people in the house wonder what the hell I'm yelling about.
---
We'll be lucky if they react to us clicking on them. ;)
---
How do you expect them to ever make any money if their only sources of income are: game sales, the atomic shop, battle pass tiers, merchandise sales, and a subscription service? Bethesda is clearly on the verge of bankruptcy unless we all buckle down and pay for a premium in game music station. /s
---
Yes. 
---
It's kind of a pain in the ass but I soloed it several times last year as well.  Definitely takes a lot of running around but it can be done.
---
One of the mutations just says increases melee damage and it works for unarmed so I would assume this is the case,  I know angry turtle uses the perk a lot too so I’m assuming it works for unarmed otherwise why bother.
---
No ! Change it to humanoids and remove ghoul slayer's and mutant slayer's also.
---
Then it's gonna do 30% dmg to all humanoids creatures in the game.
---
Phew!!   Thanks for your insight.   This put the wind back in my lungs.
---
You are completely right. I started two weeks late and currently level 94 with mostly only knocking out daily and weekly challenges.
---
You must be part of that first world economy. I’m still living in the third world, selling tatos and purified water to Sunny and selling about 1K in my vendor per session. My cap purse is at an all time high of 5K caps. 
---
It ain’t much but it’s honest work.
---
Oooh im gonna grind some more to get it then. Make my little farmhouse base with a greenhouse and everything
---
I haven't tried to solo the event, but the AoE from my explosive pistol really helps make a lot of critter chunks in a hurry. Make sure you grab as many greens as you can while you're chasing down the critters, and prepare a bunch of Chally's feed beforehand. Food is is the name of the game, and that quick 2% boost every 30s helps offset the drain a lot. Do your cleaning chores when it's convenient, but don't waste time hunting down every pile of crap. The faster you get the cooking done the better off you'll be.
---
Im mainly a PA heavy gunner but recently on my other playable character ive converted him from melee/shotgunner to a bloodied.
---
It gives a differant way to play now. But unfortunately its not gonna last for long with the nerfs thats coming with the next update.
---
My missile turrets targetting is just fine, my main issue is that they go down in a single mothman screech  attack...They need to buff defenses in every way. damage, hp, perception and accuracy for all of them.
---
I can't recommend it enough, it was my first character. Something like this'll make you a monster. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f334e6b&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s22s01sg0pe2eh2c62cr0ip2ic4ir2i12a04a80lu2l71ls2lg2&amp;w=s12id2ih2ii0
---
I’m one of those that doesn’t try to stack every xp boost in the game and run west tek until my eyes bleed. I personally like the variety of NW and the east challenges I can do in less than 5 minutes. I like the challenges more and it’s great if you all prefer xp grinds. Thank goodness the legendary run allows this.
---
Even with the nerf bloodied is still the best, only melee has become unusable anymore.
---
At Nukacrypt we are working on the foundation for one \~ new site @ [roguetrader.com](https://roguetrader.com) is the new generation -- ongoing WIP.  unfortunately, without an integration with Bethesda, we are limited on what we can do.  I'd be happy to integrate with them if they were to open such a partnership.
---
It's also a mobile-first web-app right now, not a native mobile app.  If we can get better integration with Bethesda I'd be happy to bring it to a native app, but without such it's probably not worth the effort.
---
Feel free to ping them and suggest we get this integration going :D
---
How bad is the nerf to the powerfist because all my fun came from running around at the speed of sound and pulverising anything that isn't endgame. If I have to get in an enemies face at least let me 2 shot it with my B/E/C powerfist
---
When I used to main a shotgun on my pve character I used a Q 33 25 double barrel and that thing wrecked in vats.
---
What do you suggest?
---
To ignore healing in this comment belies that you haven't really spent that much time pvping.
---
With those changes the right build would would be unkillable with just stims.
---
I just don’t like feeling like I’m getting penalized for trying to be the best I can be. Yea I have a bloodied unarmed build and it’s great. I die a lot but that’s the price I pay. The in game mechanics make so a lot players hate me for optimizing my build cuz be been playing for so long ( lvl 450) I have to handicap myself when in events so players don’t get mad I killed too many enemies and they didn’t get they tag in. I don’t even try to kill legendaries in events anymore cuz I  don’t wanna hear the complaints. Is that my fault or the games? I love this game and try to be as considerate to other players as I can. No other online game I play had this type of dynamic. Beth needs to change the way legendaries are handle in events. I personally don’t care if I miss a tag, I’ll just get the next one. But I get why ppl get upset. I just hope they fix it right and make it more balanced than in the update. I won’t freak or complain until its live. I would love to use other legendaries and I do from time to time, but I don’t like how hard I worked to get to the point im at for other players to just say I’m a hack or I cheese everything cuz I don’t. I just went towards the best damage output I could get like a lot of other players do. Idk know what they can do to make everyone happy. Idek if that’s possible. I’ll wait and see but for now I’ll be in the back of uranium fever trying not to piss everyone off for using the  best weapons game has to offer.
---
I finally encountered a MarkIV (?) liberator that was wrecking everything. I aimed at it, fired off a burst to kill it, started to run away it then realized it was practicly laughing at my attempt to kill it. I fired at it some more and was tanking the bullets. So I switched to my best weapon and made quick work of it.
---
No, that they're only doing it to look like they're actually doing it, they probably asleep. People who actively contribute should get rewarded, not the AFK folk. They want rewarding for doing nothing, they think they're entitled to it. They dont want to put in the work but expect the rewards anyway.
---
It's the way these days, I'm not surprised, but that doesnt make it any less annoying.
---
Thats what happens when you leave Tater Salad in the sun too long. Gotta keep it on ice.
---
Facts
---
Damage in this game is bananas anyway, content is easy to chew through, and there's nothing meaningful to do endgame. I'm fine if it's an across the board nerf, because rebalancing means they can release properly scaled content.
---
Had it happen to me two days in a row. No I didn't log in during the reset time.
---
I was trying to be funny T\_T
---
Do you expect wastelanders content every couple of months? 
---
I recommend not tiring your self out from just playing fallout 76. There are other games you play or go build something in RL.
---
I play this game off and on so I don’t have much problems with lacking content.
---
I don't know but I anticipate you'll still be the highest melee damage, but you may not be able to 1 shot everything and that's the primary issue with unarmed melee. Luckily all that unyielding agility makes you crazy stealthy as is.
---
As a full hp build im afraid im still gonna be unable to compete cause there is no full hp equivalent of bloodied/ unyielding that affects dps.
---
Sounds good so far. I will give it a try next time thanks. Tbh the last round was the first time I noticed there is also the green to collect lol. Alone this knowledge will make it easier for me haha
---
I'm really hoping that shooting game camp item is interactive and not just a decoration with a fixed animation.
---
It literally *is* doing it, idk why you can't grasp that concept. The spits and drums contribute to the event, they slow the rate of decay of the progress meter. If the character is drumming/turning it makes no difference if the person is asleep or staring at the screen,  the contribution and result is 100% the same.
---
Bloodied is stale shit meta.
---
Ok. Ill continue to use my B25ffr90wr handmade.
---
I bought myself a pink suit and a space helmet in order to go full Daft Punk during the event. I am not going to AFK when you need me funking the shit out if the event.
---
There absolutely is: junkies. 5 addictions, pick them based on what SPECIAL stats you don't mind losing, and pick up a junkies weapon. It's currently, and on the PTS, second highest damage.
---
Thanks for your input. I guess I'll hope for the best , prepare for the worst. What you said makes alot more sense than bloodied is nerfed so I'll definitely hold on to my gear and do nothing drastic
---
 
---
Leveling up: Explore, kill things, discover new quests/areas but like said elsewhere, take your time and enjoy it.
---
Power armor/Fusion cores: I wouldn't worry about PA until lvl 40 if not 50. Cores can be farmed from any of the 3 Workshops near Power Plants. There's a machine at each that makes them if powered up, and once you know how, it's easy to keep your PA powered up.
---
Materials/Camp: Wood, Steel and Concrete. Best tip is to pick up and scrap -everything- you find. Junk, Weapons, Armor, anything you can break down into scrap.
---
Weapons/Ammo: Melee is the easiest way to go here until you get higher level and have ammo stock-piled, as all you need to worry about is keeping the weapon repaired.
---
Clothing/Armor: Whatever you can find and wear. If it's mis-matched, wear clothing over it to cover it up, but if you find a piece that's an improvement over what you're wearing, equip it, scrap the old piece, repeat. Once you're lvl 50 you can invest in some good Legendary Armor.
---
Eh. It’s opinion. I think continuing to add meat shield bosses like the SBQ &amp; Earl while massively nerfing our damage as players is an asinine approach. Just leads to more negativity &amp; complaining for people who dont have well thought out builds because they’re gonna be shooting pea’s
---
If you see the white bathtub, put the Chally feed in a pile of stuff that has a couple straw bales next to it.
---
The only one that's been consistent for me is the Forest. We had around 5-6 people on our last one in Toxic Valley and we failed because nothing showed up on the last wave. So now I'm without prime meat for my next Cook event.
---
Playstation or Xbox?
---
Holster your gun. Then fast travel.
---
If you already have it holster, aim it then holster it again. Bit of a ball ache but it's the fastest way, and it always works.
---
What a rimjob reply mate👍
---
Away &amp; get your hard drive checked ya weirdo 😂
---
How did you only get 10 hours or of wastelanders? Did you just fast travel everywhere and fly through terminals and dialogue?
---
Also BOS dlc isn’t even here yet...
---
I'm rather new to the game but I'm having so much fun! Haven't played a multiplayer game for so many hours at a stretch in ages.
---
Bethesda's logic: if they focus on the grind they wont notice the bugs
---
I think for the first iteration it wouldn't need to integrate with your active server, just an API gateway that interfaces to their backend DB the same as the servers do.
---
Having a real-time integration while you are live may or may not pose a problem, depending on how they are handling the backend atomicity.  It'd be simple enough, however, to just have it not able to make changes if you are actively in a world.
---
Agreed. And impossible to balance around. And cushy with all those insane unyielding benefits, including that insane int exp bonus.
---
It’s all scrip to me either way.
---
Professor X goin old skool
---
Yea I noticed the crap on the ground doesn't do much at the bar. And tbh last round was the first time I noticed there is also green to collect beside the critter meat lol. I was so hard focused on the critters I totally miss them since the event dropped yesterday
---
He's still dropping rare plans.  Both my partner and I got the radiation emitter today, for example.
---
I understand what you're saying, that it can be easily avoided, but it shouldn't be there at all and it's not on the player to learn to walk around bugs, especially when the game is still being developed, as is the case here. There's a seasonal event, and if you log in at, say, 12:03 not to fuck your daily up, you miss it. I always play during my lunch break and I was logged in during the daily reset most of the days and it never happened until this week. It's just not an acceptable bug and there should be a way to compensate players who lose their SCORE if they're too lazy to fix it.
---
Also that still doesn't excuse the fact when you contact customer service you're met with auto-replies, a lack of trying to understand your issue and told to file a report to the development team yourself.
---
Bethesda is just trying to teach us an important life lesson. You can do everything right and still fail in life.
---
If you’re on Xbox I’ll trade you a bloodied 25 less vats cost and +10% damage while aiming.
---
Nothing should be that high of a damage buff . Especially when you can stay cozy at 40% with unyield. It’s so bad that I almost wish they just removed it
---
Got bad news for ya, bud
---
Yes, and it makes sense. The whole server is packed with crazy action, piles and piles of loot and a big number of people doing a big number of things.
---
It's like Scorched Earth all over the map.
---
Yeah I gave up like a couple of days ago myself just not interesting anymore
---
Had a Prime Snallygaster get stuck in a tree and refuse to come near us. Lucky I was on my sniper at the time.
---
It's costly to run, requires a ton of perks, and makes fights like Earl very dangerous. I don't mind it being top damage, but that damage needed a nerf, and it looks like the PTS delivers. If they'd remove int from unyielding, my bloodied complaints would be finished.
---
From trial and error it seems to happen on the 4th wave if you kill everything TOO FAST. Let the wave ride out for a solid 45 sec or so if you can to make the bug less likely to happen.  I've been running the events nonstop between yesterday and today, tents haven't been an issue for me and I even place one down each event I go to and it's not the fact of enemies being a distance away.
---
Just FYI - There is a bug where if you signout while somebody is in your vendor, it jacks with your vendor listings and they all delist back to your inventory.
---
No it really isnt, putting rubberbands on a controller so it doesnt timeout is your first clue it's not the same, even the game knows that. Its the only thing you can do as an AFK that stops you getting booted. You are not doing it to contribute, that's pure bullshit. It would get done without you.
---
You just want to set it, come back and reap all the rewards to sell to other players etc.
---
if you are on xbox sure
---
Its been a while but wasn’t arthur sent to live with lyons because of a power struggle inside the west coast brotherhood of steel after his father was killed?
---
I’d bet money it is either a fixed animation or so broken it’s unusable if it’s meant to be interactive.
---
Some people say its been out since launch. Me and my husband have only had it since waistelanders. It might be hard to do it since people started having it at different times. Like way different times.
---
It's not based on the tent, I've completed all of mine with a tent on site to scrap
---
Yup had this happen on the last wave with the legendary enemy, he spawned in and everyone just melted him and then we eventually failed the event cause like you said we killed everything too fast. Now I know for next time though
---
Show me how to use a cattle prod
---
Nah im good that roll is very meh with it having vats cost AND aim damage doesnt synergize well at all. Im also not sure id want to trade this gun as it seems like almost everyone scams on this game since its so easy to get away with
---
Quite a few people do play like this lol.
---
The amount of work that went into wastelanders is pretty significant. Even down to the small details such as the teddy bears that were filming a Cooking show got boxed up and moved to a corner where they were filming at. Camera and all.
---
I feel like it will kill my medic character.  
---
Bloodied was never fun to me.  i don’t enjoy two shotting scorched beasts.
---
I don't know if you have 1st or not -- I buy bulk goods that are always in demand, like ballistic fiber, steel, cement, springs, oil, etc.  It takes me down pretty fast.
---
Stealth is for babies, ironclad and moving faster than a car is my style
---
Honestly yeah, I think I might stay away from the stealth commando and switch to a bloodied heavy gunner. At this point I’m kinda tired of getting detected with full unyielding, harder to detect, shadowed armor and getting the light smacked out of me
---
At this point they should just rename it "Irony". 
---
Who'd have thought the name Colossal Problem would imply the event had Colossal Problems?
---
You should delete this post.
---
Should have zero int ,keep end zero and half all others
---
It's a curse
---
Hopefully people can't still reach them through your windows or glitch inside by reaching a workbench through your windows.
---
Some ghouls, not many at all, but some, seem to keep their hair.  Others wear wigs.  Bethesda is inconsistent.
---
Current thinking is that the hair humanizes them so ghouls that the player will interact with regularly are given hair.
---
It helps you the exact same amount, it hurts you zero percent. Bro you need therapy.
---
Seriously. It's ridiculous how many limits there are in game. Especially caps, it's not even hard to hit the limit on a regular basis
---
I am used to watching cap limits and turning off my machines if I’m close to max caps until I can offload caps. And usually I can get an idea if there’s some action going on. But something happened the other day that kinda ticked me off. 
---
Just started surface to air and heard a ka-ching; I was at 8000 caps so no big deal. It was some Vampire machete for like 2000. I caught the name but it was in and out of my mind. About 2 minutes later a ka-ching and it was some other random weapon for another 3000 caps or so. Same buyer. I pause and take a look at my map. No one is at my camp. I figure they are done. I’m at about 13000 caps. I continue to shoot at scorchbeasts. 
---
Two minutes go by and as the event is ending and that last scorchbeast comes in sight, there is a FLURRY of ka-chings all one second apart and within about 20 seconds or so, I’m at max, all my bolstering armor is snagged and the ka-chings keep coming. I quick look at the map and no one is showing at my camp. It’s the same buyer as before, spamming A down the list of armor buying as fast as they can while crouched. I logged out as quick as I could but probably lost ... 8000? 10,000? Not sure 
---
The only thing I can think is that they saw what I had, figured it would put me over, and if they didn’t buy quickly I would log out.  What is stupid is that if they’d just messaged me and asked how close I was to cap limit, I’d have been happy to hold what they wanted while I unloaded caps and came back in. 
---
The fact the people need to get sneaky in order to max out a player because Bethesda thinks there should be an artificial limit to “control inflation” in a game filled with duped items and caps is ridiculous to me. That this person acted like an asshat is beside the point; it’s that the system was in place that made them think that was their only choice. It’s just dumb.
---
You need values
---
Or you can kill every wave with 45 seconds left and have the event glitch and never finish....had that happen too. Super frustrating.
---
I commend your bravery friend. We can't be on a path to fun dungeon/raid content without balancing. Right now there are 2 options. Either super buff the bosses so it's hard for the meta build, and impossible for everyone else ( imagine getting kicked from every group if you aren't bloodied unyielding cause they don't want to whipe). Or they make the bosses hard for everyone and an easy joke for the meta (basically what we have now as my first run was a lvl 200 stims shotgunner(me), a level 15 vault dwellers, and A 200 bloodied unyeilding... needless to say the bloodied build did 90 percent of damage and we won in around 5 min). So do either of these sound fun to anyone?
---
I don't even mind giving full bonuses to all the others. Why would I run bloodied if there wasnt an int bonus and the damage difference was like ... 20%? I could just hop in PA or wear vanguards armor or do literally anything else I wanted to.
---
&gt; Downvote me now and read later: I think it is your fault. Having thousands of rounds for sale means you can earn thousands of caps and the game mechanics are very clear: you lose by going over the limit.
---
I agree. It'd be nice if they'd raise the cap limit, but you know what it is going into it. If you are bothered by selling out, raise your prices or put less stuff in your vendors.
---
I play NW everyday..
---
It's honestly more of competing against higher levels. And knowing targets. And getting better.
---
Still an update, which according to op, the last update was 7 months ago. Yet wastelanders came out only 4 months ago
---
I feel like the brotherhood of steel timed missions they're releasing will do very well with a medic.
---
Great initiative. A mobile companion app is necessary if Bethesda is planning this to be a long term franchise.
---
Not yet
---
Just like my wife, she's always got a "headache". I play to escape reality!
---
No windows for that reason.
---
Not when you have to launch a nuke which is a process of it's own to do it and then any chance to fail the event is so easily blamed on the fact that the queen doesnt land often enough for you to hit her...
---
Hmm...sounds effective. If you havent tried it yet, consider trying out a shotgun with a magic effect (33%VATS, 40%BASH, 50%LIMB), target an enemy in VATS (like a high level Super Mutant), and you'll take them out in 1 shot.
---
I have collected several Vampire's shotguns with the magic effect and it makes for easy legendary farming.
---
With the 2 coin change he most certainly would.
---
Sorry for your loss. I know how shitty it is to lose a beloved pet. I lost my Lola earlier this year. Had her since she was just a pup. Just over 12 years. It sucks, but the pain will ease over time. 
---
Also don’t forget to take the time to grieve over the loss. It’s 100% natural and part of the process. 
---
Enjoy the event and take care of yourself!
---
"His father, a high-ranking paladin serving just outside the New California Republic, was recently killed in battle, and his mother, Lady Maxson, sent the boy east to be raised under the tutelage of the then respected Elder Owyn Lyons.[2] Squire Maxson tends toward timidity, which is the main reason his mother sent him to the Citadel.[3] Part of the reason were internal conflicts in the Brotherhood out west, which created an unsafe environment for Arthur. Ironically, the Citadel was the safer option.[4]"

This guy gets it.

Nm the corona, I've had my base blown up  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJDmrx0Lm24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJDmrx0Lm24)
---
&gt; At least it was 10mm ammo and not a really excellent weapon.
---
Does it matter? A loss is a loss.
---
Okay. Well the two times that I failed them there was a tent around. The other five or six times was all clear smooth sailing.
---
Nobody knows, but I have my T-60 and minigun both with BoS paint just in case.
---
I understand you man. Its really upsetting to have this bug happen. Bethesda has no excuse on this bug still being present. They allow people to buy SCORE levels but at the same time are cheating players of earning it fairly. I hope you have better luck with the support man.
---
No, you’re supposed to say: “Waaaaa, Bethesda needs to change the legendary perk coin system so that I can get 6 maxed legendary perk cards at level 200.”
---
&gt; On the upside it freed up weight but still...
---
I'm always tempted to sell my stuff dirt cheap just so I get the weight back, but I know if I do, someone will just buy everything to sell at their own camp.
---
There was a screen shot a few months back of a level 10,002
---
Says the person who is *so worried* about how other people live when it doesn't affect you AT ALL, not even a little bit!
---
I feel you on that. Forgot to cancel my subscription and that ended up fucking me a little :(

It’s not designed to fill the bar, picking up the spoiled food and Chally’s poops prevents the bar from decreasing over time.
---
If you're using the Ethernet cable you will not be using WiFi.  It's a direct connection from the router.  
---
If your bb drops then the lights on the router will indicate this.  If not, then it's a network issue on your PS4 or Bethesda servers.
---
\+10000 - couldn't agree more
---
There are a group of them near the crater, as you approach from the water park side. should be roughly 10-12 of them, and sometimes a leg deer or yaoi gaui.
---
I'm confused, why's he wearing a chef's outfit?
---
I wouldn't be tooo surprised if they don't. I think they're more likely to mention that we're "in" the BoS from the main quest line, rather than the armor you're wearing.
---
That being said, I would also brace yourself for the change where the BoS paints may become obtainable through the new faction, rather than grinding plans. Same with any armor/underarmor skins that came from that grind. Plan grind will probably still be there, but wont be the only source.
---
man. i see junk in a vendor i am THERE! Unfortunately vendors with junk in them are as rare as hen's teeth. unless it's ludicrously overpriced i buy it.
---
But it’s not . Bloodied can push 500% .
---
Yes but I believe what op was getting at was that Bethesda hasn’t done much to address all the bugs, lag, and balancing issues the game has.
---
Sounds like you're trying hard to convince yourself.
---
You've already lowered yourself to throwing insults, tells me all I need to know about you, if I didn't already know.
---
Good day to you young man/lady, good luck in your life.
---
Yes a whole main quest
---
Not on the PTS ;)
---
They patched that
---
Yeah agree id like  increase limits too but I'll take what I can get at this point. Got 1300 treasury notes burning a hole in my pocket and they ain't going nowhere fast.
---
If she says she got a "headache", sry mate you are fckd😔 but we are with you mate
---
Two Words:  Berry Mentats
---
Give it an hour. There’s an hour cool down on the negative effects.
---
Agreed, well put
---
So if I clear out all limits on Monday then I'll have to wait a week to play some more?
---
I mean it would be interesting to see but lore wise. I doubt the Chinese created something like that. During the great war they mostly focused on stealth based technology like the stealth suit. where as the united states had focused on hard hitting weapons and armor. 
---
The chinese probably didn’t even know liberty prime existed since it was a super secret project and never even became fully operational in time to help liberty Alaska. It had power issues that they eventually scraped the project instead using the t-51b. It took the brotherhood decades to get it working and it still wasn’t 100% complete by the time the war with the enclave started.
---
Sorry to hear that man. Times are tuff right now. Hope everything is well enough and that you get threw it okay
---
I keep forgetting that haha. Ya then just take int
---
It wasn't an insult, it was a recommendation.
---
Hell I wasn't even seeing them with a perception of 22 last night.
---
Lucky
---
I never thought of this before.
---
What do people after leaving the vault to make the process quick?
---
Are you crazy, Vato? Jose está loco! He's gonna send his men, now!
---
...
---
I like it, but I'm just getting tired of events in mines. I feel like they can make this a cool event spawn above red rocket in that forest area somehow though. Maybe a giant hive appears and you nuke it?
---
It’s ok lmao, I can add it to my collection of terrible rolling pins
---
That's the problem though. When she's got a "headache", I'm decidedly *not* fucked. Lmao.
---
I've just got a four-year-old that fifteen bucks could've gotten something cool for.
---
But video games make the times a lot easier. :) you hang in there, person
---
Welcome to Fallout 76, get used to it haha.
---
Just read the rest of the comments, it’s in there
---
It would be nice to have an end-game upgrade to the Pip-Boy 3000 with the expeditions. Bonus points to Bethesda if we can go back the Nevada and find the Pimp Boy 3 Billion.
---
You probably had it when it was glitched out and you could build it for free. It wasn't suppose to be like that, they fixed it and you now have to buy the bundle
---
Remember the pipboy kit? Well the Wand Company (people who made and designed it) stated how the pipboy kit was instead going to be a fully working pipboy that would work with the game just like.the Fallout 4 app. 
---
The reason for not going forth with this plan is them realizing that they couldn't do it affordably apparently.
---
One of the propaganda posters in FO4 shows the silhouette of what was apparently a Chinese counterpart with the cation "Their War Machine is Mobilizing...Let's Prepare Ours!"
---
"War Machine" was likely metaphorical...but maybe not?
---
I think this is going to fuck up the balance even more, with how Bethesda is. Also, a new meta will arise, then people will bitch about that and get that one nerfed.
---
Atomic items were stated to be 100% non cannon
---
As well as the chinese were lacking in robot department. The USA was decades ahead of them. And the USA wasnt even able to finish liberty prime. They didnt have the biggest time window to be fair. Yhen it took the BoS's top scientist, engineers, etc decades to get it running
---
Same. I'm reading these and thinking "wow, I wish I had that problem" but instead I'm just poor.
---
16 year old Bassett hound, Nietzche, for myself. Fallout 76 came out shortly after. Grieving sucks, but it's better when life throws you a bone. I still play fallout 4 with the dog mod sometimes. No Bassett but the hound is close enough.
---
I suppose. The reason I said mine is because up above ground I would assume Scorchbeasts would be looking to snack on the Queen, so I’m a mine she’s way less vulnerable. Also the actual fight would happen just outside the mine. You can enter the hive after the event.
---
I'm having this issue on PC.
---
Added :)
---
That's three guaranteed 3* legendaries and two 2* legendaries. Plus a bunch of Stable Flux and over 1,500 in Caps. Not too shabby.
---
You missed a creature. Not all creatures will path to you. If it seems like the event is stuck but the timer is continuing, you need to go search for the creature. 
---
Usually on the last spawn you will get the main boss spawn as well as a few other creatures. Not all will spawn in the same area.
---
figure it out. you can do it...
---
I have a two shot Fatman lol
---
Yes I made it MIRV. Fun but useless. 
---
And yes it'll always take that 18lbs in my stash box. Yes it's worth it. No I'm not ok
---
Thanks again and will do :)
---
The problem isn't they debuffed Bloodied. It's that they debuffed everything else with it. Thanks to the sneak debuff any instigating rifle, pistol, ect will become worthless especially if they're semi-automatic because you can only take a third of their health while sneaking. Bethesda's just giving more us reasons to be bloodied commando or heavy
---
I heard yesterday that it’s a visual bug. You supposedly can still complete the score tasks.
---
Sorry for the loss, you're taking it well, glad to see that. Awesome drop btw
---
Oh damn okay thanks for the quick comment
---
Or they could release mods and let us fix the game they can’t help but keep breaking.
---
That's a damn nice rig...only if its rgb'd out!!
---
76 isnt optimized  like most games.it has gotten better but not there yet
---
This. It's the wasteland.
---
Watoga and Harper’s Ferry would both be great maps
---
I think that happens if they disconnect while drumming, their name also doesn't turn yellow during the event because they're not actually there.
---
Don't go into a PvP zone with junk on you.
---
Yup, surprisingly stable on my end. (PS4)
---
&gt;The problem with the rebalance is not that it exists, but that it's not nearly complete
---
And they put it in the TEST server?! How dare they?!
---
You’re right. The pathing isn’t great. They get distracted by other mobs, get stuck behind trees, or fail to move at all because someone put their camp next to the spawn point.
---
Just think about having 10000 less rounds of 10mm in your stash
---
Melee damage and rads will get you pretty quick if you aren't careful. Blocker and some diluted rad-x will make a big difference. You often get rad worms which also increases the amount of rads you take.
---
Unlikely, they couldn't even be bothered to put in dialogue for one of your companions with the order of mysteries.
---
If they want me to take more time killing enemies and actually fighting enemies that can take a beating then they need to make it easier to get ammo. I have 5 - 6 weapons I carry at all times and my choices are difficulty tiers 1,2,3 or a melee weapon if they aren't worth the bullets at all. When I'm looking for a weapon I want to use for "fun" I need it to have the "weighs 90% less" effect or it will increase my weight to much. There is no reason I should only have 100 lbs to loot with at any given time when I am a max STR build I cant even change the weight reduction perks i have because i can't even stash my stimpacks.
---
Just finished today about 15 minutes before reset and I was pissed for a moment because I leveled on accident. It’s nice to have the push, but towards the end I was over it. I’ll try and make it a point to buy from player vendors every day still
---
I still can't get anyone to do it, tell them how it works and they just jump around. The second it fully starts they jump onto the drums /facepalm
---
The constant 65 FPS is pretty damn good for fallout 76. me personally I'm sitting around 45 FPS and I had to lower some of my settings
---
I jumped in for the legendary run to get score -- I realize I'm not the greatest PvP player, but I've decided something isn't right on NW because I rarely get a chance to even shoot back.  Usually I'm down within one hit or so, and I have great perk cards now (dodgy, nerd rage, etc).  I'm on PS4 so I don't know how much is people cheating or not, but sometimes it boggles my mind that I can be perk'd into commando with every card possible, I have a handmade and I shoot at somebody and not only does their health hardly move, they one-shot me back.  It's quite stupid.
---
Or the players who seem to always hit me, and I can barely get a bead on them.
---
At this point I'm assuming theree are just a lot of insecure twinks using cheats of some sort (even the USB add-ons that I've heard about) -- insecure because only a broken-minded person would need to use cheats.
---
The other day I spawned in and within the first \~30 seconds came across somebody wearing marine armor and they had a gauss shotgun to kill me.  I had barely even made it to my first crate.   Stupid.
---
Who's to say the honeybeasts doesn't snack on scorchbeasts who are too dumb to get close to the nest, killing it with numbers? The SBQ is the Queen of the south of the map,  the Honeybeast Queen could be the less powerful queen of the north?
---
Definitely feel that its crazy.happy you got a nice drop...like you said doesn't make it better but I'm sure pulling that brought a smile to you.
---
Dude losing family is the worst. I hope nobody disagrees with me here but I definitely see pets as family. It's really hard to lose something you love so dearly. I've lost so much, I just want you to know that you aren't alone and we are here for you. 
---
I just wanna say that naming your gun after your cat is badass. Not only does it suit it sentimentally it also works because cats are super deadly to anything they don't like or wanna play with. Just like your gun. Go kick some ass brother.
---
The game is very easy as it is. The nerf is NOT the worst thing in the world, and bloodied and junkies will still be the best and most powerful builds in the game.
---
I had a friend say he'll refund his 1st and boycott the game. Yeah good luck with that boycott bud. Especially with how unhappy people are, the nerf is most likely not going to take place, at least not how it's set up atm.
---
The main issue is the nerf is hurting low DPS builds. Anything not automatic or high fire rate is gonna get fucked. I also think nerfing is the lazy way to balance and fix things, every game does it, but I don't think it'd the best/right answer.
---
Now you know how those of us who live normal lives and only have one day a week to play feel
---
Yeah we had a scare about it a while ago, I've kinda just been trying to make her last days at least pleasant cause a scare at that age is more of a sign than anything. I've been ready for a while.
---
I think yes
---
Yup! The only thing that you can't build for someone else is the backpack!
---
If any game has a cap on earning in game currency, like Caps, AND pushes P2P trading, then the Devs have 0 fucking clue how to run their game, let alone play it.
---
Glad I quit right after they hypernerfed F2P atom earning with their "better" battlepass
---
***Orbital Strike Platform... Initialized and Armed.***
---
*Would you like to... play a game?*
---
They can balance base weapon damage, especially at lower levels, to make up for this. But I think swapping from multiplicative to additive damage is a smart move and I think it should go through.
---
Thanks! I’ve been really occupied and one of the only things I really enjoy doing in Fo76 is camp building lol
---
They need to change the way ppl get loot from leg enemies in events. You shouldn’t have to do that. I do it too, Non leg 10mm auto pistol. But it’s a dumb way to try to get everyone in and still beat the timer cuz if u don’t get a tag u don’t get the loot from enimies and everyone cries. There’s gotta be a better way. And ppl have been complaing about this for ages.
---
Sometime next week, per Bethesda's announcement yesterday.
---
Bethesda Austin didn't even make the NW mode, another studio did. That's probably why they don't touch it, for fear of breaking it further.
---
K bro. I run with a bloodied 2525. Just can’t part with it.  
---
Btw there is a trading sub and I haven’t been burned on it yet.  Also you don’t gotta be a dick about it. I haven’t burned anyone ever. In fact I’m like a wastelands santa.  I give lots of stuff  away daily.
---
I wish people bought my 10mm. I sit on it for awhile I end up just giving new players a thousand rounds when I see them doing low level events.
---
Keep in mind the 500 atom payout at 100. So you only have to make it to 97 to break even on buying the last 3 ranks. 
---
We're in double score right now and they're adding extra score challenges next week I think. 
---
I played pretty casual, just did dailies, missed some days completely and it looks like I'll make it. Next season I'm gonna try skipping the level up challenge and see if I can make it. I basically abandoned my main account this season because at level 450 it takes me forever to get a level. It would be nice if they didnt punish us for being long time players.
---
gone forever, no way to get them back.
---
Ah I didn’t see it I’ll go check it out thanks!
---
Thanks man, I can agree fully that animals are family for sure and I'm glad you find the whole gun thing cool. I didn't really think about the deadly part until now and I'm glad I can see it both ways.
---
Artificial damage caps are weird and I don't think they ought to be included in this damage nerf. Hopefully with time they'll be removed.
---
That doesn't sound too fun.
---
Where would it take place? The very Northern part of the forest near the mountains?
---
 That’s cool! Lol
---
I just got a 3s from the purveyor, was my 3rd roll after unlocking the plan.
---
Ah man, lost my best bud of a cat a few months ago. It sucks. Glad you had some good luck on a shit day
---
And thats a maybe
---
Can you just...not? You're never going to blow up anyones camp with your fatman. Otherwise no one would have any camps on any server, ever.
---
All plans and recipes disappear after you learn them. They are consumed in the process of learning them. 
---
After you learn a plan or recipe, any others you have or acquire will be prefaced by *’(Known)’*.
---
It did, I'm just more glad I can have something certainly permanent to remember her.
---
I haven't got that one yet. I keep getting backyard grills. At least I've got plenty for alts.
---
RIGHT!  The time to enter a match is gigantic!  It's ridiculous to spend 10 minutes waiting to get into a game, to die in 30 seconds sometimes.
---
I think they need to change up their lobby mechanic -- you should be able to enter the vault any time you want to edit cards, poke around, etc.  When you are going into a game, you DONT need to bounce through the vault lobby--just take it out.  Put me in a queue and drop me right into a game.
---
Every time an NPC merchant visits my camp, I am greeted by a chorus of explosions and "it'll take an hour to reheat those beans." If they targeted hostiles like this they would be useful!
---
Hopefully with the upcoming instanced bunker thing(pushed back on release day until the 23rd of October 2077), we no longer need to be bothered with defending or rebuilding camps.
---
You’re not wrong, most people who play this game are just soft and want everything to be mindlessly easy for them.
---
I'm sure him using everyone's stolen junk to repair his camp was fun too. :o
---
People try to say this is a good game but all I ever see on this subreddit is complaints.
---
Thank you 😂
---
This is exactly my response.  All these click bait OMG the sky is falling videos and posts.  Its a TEST server bruh, ya know for testing....
---
Half the time the owner of said base is there and I end up just bs'ing with them afterwards.
---
Oh the ethernet cable is connected to a wifi booster connected to the router
---
I just did the event and there was a guy just standing there the whole time right next to the cooking spits
---
They did not.
---
May Lola rest in peace just as well, you enjoy yourself as well!
---
My suggestion above - take out the vault lobby entirely as part of joining the game, just make it a separate thing you can spawn into and just do your adjustments, with no time limit -- and from there you can join a queue (just as from the main menu)
---
I’ll trade you a grill plan for a chally pack🙃
---
All my settings are at low too 😂
---
Yes, it's pretty barren besides vault 79 and the cabin. Like near where that normal Honeybeast spawns above Freddy Fears I guess.
---
They’re saying that the tenderizer will be to melee players, that the fixer is to gun users.
---
Are you on Xbox live?
---
I go back to fallout 4 whenever I want to use explosives. It's unfortunate.
---
I have gotten so many backpacks
---
Take that snarky little attitude and go play with traffic 😆
---
If 76 stays as long as I hope it does I can certainly see dogs being a part of it one day. Here's to hoping and may your pet rest in piece too.
---
A river derchay amigo
---
“Drifting in space, forever...”
---
Lots of ammo is thenonly downside
---
100% working! Enjoy your revenge, my friend &gt;:)
---
I really think you're right. It might be an unpopular opinion, but challenge is an important part of gaming for me.  
---
The biggest boss in the game ought to be high-risk, high-reward. I usually just see a message that the SBQ has appeared and on 20 seconds later that she's dead.
---
My mother had a cat for 21 years, love bug was her name, I was young when she got her, maybe 6months. I took care of bug for the last couple years, was like a sibling to me, we grew up together. I was 22 when she passed. Didn't think it would hit me as hard. Heres to the memories, cheers friend!
---
Good luck on bad days is the magic of life sometimes. And I hope your cat rests easy.
---
This. The game helps me manage my PTSD a lot. (In addition to my therapy and meds.)
---
What I don't get is why is it such a sought after item? I run a bloodied build so its next to useless for me atm. It's possible I would trade it for something else of value. Just curious what people see in it.
---
Back pack mods are plans. They’re plans that let you modify your backpack at a bench.
---
Yup
---
That’s the Cranberry Bog/Savage divide area. I thought we were talking about the Forest area. Or am I misunderstanding?
---
Nah, you just end up wasting your time cause at the end of the day all it takes it one button press and your stolen junk to repair a camp.
---
Meanwhile you had to go farm all he had to do was press a button, so in a sense you still got trapped. :)
---
76 is like a century before fo4...
---
I'll DM you my GT
---
Edit: just checked and what I have are treasury bonds, are they the same? 
---
Not true. I do not know of this vault you speak of, level 20 and have some 100+ treasury notes. Not sure where I got them from but most probably from prime cuts. What do you get for them btw?
---
im pretty sure i bought it but i cant build it anyways
---
Because you didn’t buy a console
---
Thats right, I forgot about him lol
---
Kent Connelly. Oops 😵
---
im barely able to keep up with my current equipment so this totally isnt good for me

fair
---
Exactly! You cant expect bethesda to pull out a full comprehensive damage rebalance to the entire game in one night. That is just stupid. They are going step by step. First issue, some builds are 3 times stronger than others, fix: make the gap smaller. And the way they did that is great.
---
Now? Continue balancing. Eventually they will finish balancing and release it in a patch.
---
Bought out the last 5 levels just so I could relax and just enjoy meat week before taking a few weeks off. The prizes are great but you are right, it’s a little bit daunting.
---
i have it on one of my chars in the camp inventory (stored) but still cant place it
---
I don't disagree with all your points, but have to disagree that you, as you put it have to go bloodied full damage build. That's a choice you make, you can go around using anything and any build and still have a great experience, for example use only nocturnal gear, playing only at night and sleeping through the day a bad example I know but you get the idea. Most players will always go for the most effective powerful options available, its baked into almost all video game formulas, also it's the fantasy of being a real bad ass in the game. 
---
This will never change so all the balance will do is make a new meta. 
---
There will always be a build that will out dps everything else, then all the players will use that build. The same thing will exist just with different gear. It doesn't matter how many balance patches are put out in a game like this, the only way to properly do what they want is to remove all damage boosting perks.
---
Destiny have been trying to do it for every but after each patch along comes a new dps king, and the cycle continues. 
---
I really do think it's a very risky idea, it could kill off the player base to an unstoppable level. I personally am not too bothered as I just love the game, but can see why so many are upset.
---
I might try using my Vampire's FFR Gatling Plasma, or equivalent Gatling Laser, for low ammo cost.
---
Although, I'm holding back from just taking Earl out using my minigun without even having to reload once.
---
I stay away from Ultracite ammo because I'm doing plenty of damage without it.
---
It's 185 years before fallout 4.
---
Thanks for the heads up, didn’t know this!
---
I still have it placed in one characters camp so I guess I can never move him lol
---
It's exactly what I'm hoping for.  But hey people on the internet need something to be mad about.
---
Lol, people still think spotlights do anything....
---
That's hilarious.
---
good to know. it doesnt seem to pull from scrapbox
---
We get it. You don't get enough attention in the real world. Maybe try being less of a ball bag then maybe people will enjoy your company 😄
---
P.s. The only time I've wasted recently is the time it's taken to reply to your useless comments.
---
Ah ok.  Is this using power line adapter or wifi?  I know the og PS4 doesn't support the 5ghz wifi band.  The pro does.  The other band is 2.4ghz and very suseptible to interference from other devices.
---
This. I have started to recognize the better players, and love fighting them. I'm still learning, but I love the competition.
---
I don't think so. Angry Turtle showed what running around at full health with an anti armor heavy gun looked like on the PTS and he was killing mobs in 1 second, maybe 6 shots per mob.
---
I think you're gonna be okay, really
---
Oh, that’s his name, Kent Connelly. You reminded me. And you’re right he is alive in fo76
---
Fallout 76 takes place about 185 years before Fallout 4. The year the dwellers came out of the vault in Fallout 76 is 2102, 25 years after the bombs fell in 2077. Fallout 4 starts as the bombs drop in 2077, but the bulk of the gameplay takes place in 2287, a good 210 years after the bombs dropped.
---
Regardless of that, based on the information gleaned thus far in 76, I think the Secret Service agents in Appalachia are separate from the ones we deal with alongside the Enclave in Fallout 2. They'd been given very specific orders to guard the gold vault there until the government was able to come back around to reestablish currency, which as far as we can tell never ends up happening between the crazies in the Enclave and most other Govt officials having been either killed by the Enclave, the bombs, or all the stuff that's happened since the bombs fell.
---
If you're stupid enough to fall into a trap you deserve to have your time wasted. Darwin's at its finest.
---
dmg will get nerfed but legacies guns will now become must have thing for end game players
---
I RP as a Native American who is specced for heavy guns, using: FEFR Gatling Gun, ISS Deathclaw Gauntlet, IERW BPR, IE VATS Less SA Revolver, dynamite bundles and tomahawks.
---
Gone, reduced to atoms...
---
&gt; high-damage, but slow guns that can't keep up in terms of firing rate, like the Lever Action, Hunting Rifle, and Revolvers, are left in the cold. 
---
I'm afraid that shotguns will be this way too, and I'm a shotgun build.
---
I keep having it fail with as many as 10 people.  The meter goes down faster than everyone can keep it up
---
Damn I would've jumped all over that  trade lol
---
This is where I got it. Just kill everything but 1 diseased mirelurk spawn and let it feast on you.
---
I mean if you have something I don't have I can give you a plan for it, I have a few
---
Primal cuts isn’t worth it. There are plenty of critters that spawn at the event that will bring it up to the end. Also, playing the drums during the initial countdown will bring it up to 50% right off the bat
---
But I didn't fall into the trap haha. Why exactly are you being such an abrasive prick? 😂
---
Also, Darwinism* since we're being a smartarse.
---
Once you learn the plan for the Tenderizer, you can get it as a random drop from basically anything that would award you a legendary normally. Also have a chance of getting it from Mama Murmrgh.
---
Pretty similar situation to me, though she was already fairly old when I met her, we had a good run and I will be sure to keep her memory alive.
---
Just tried it with over two minutes left on the final wave. Never spawned.
---
He keeps using that word. I do not think it means what he thinks it means.
---
Get you a brahmin and walk around saying "Come here boah."  "Easy boah."  "er a good boah."
---
Today is my first full day of no season. I walked to my destinations. I went to grahms and we talked about the good ole days. Had a BBQ. Relaxed at my home watched the fog roll by. Even had a visitor buy some ammo from my vending machine. This is it. Semi retirement.
---
Sorry, misunderstanding. But yes it's like the border of the mire and savage divide. There's a patch of forest up there near vault 79 and such, was thinking more to the right above Freddy Fears near the natural Honeybeast spawn.
---
all i got is a bow with explosive arrow
---
and a bone
---
i also do it for the easy notes. Ive earned over 60 notes today already doing the event more tham farming sbq ever gave
---
We can give them armor at least
---
You didn't but others have, like that guy who had a ton of each flux the other day.

Cause this community is full of carebears and deserves to burn.
---
Aye aye captain
---
Thanks for the advice! I'm on PS4.
---
So would you rather it be an above ground hive or a hive built underground in a cave?
---
I know! There are a lot of little details I think some people blew right past
---
I honestly hope they buff energy weapons to make them very good endgame weapons. They are my favorite type of weapons in Fallout but are basically outclassed by every ballistic counterpart
---
Get ready for a million Preston Garvys... At least the settlements might finally get the help they need
---
amen!
---
I know right. The first one i was really excited tginking it was really rare but.....then i got a few more. Also would have like to have it have a baby brahmin or something but i understand its to match the outfit.
---
I've had a shitty year. Escaped an abusive relationship, was homeless for a bit, lost nearly everything, etc. This game helps me take my mind off of things. I genuinely enjoy grinding XP and collecting different weapons (like faster swing speed Grognak's axes and FFR handmades) on my mules.
---
Have the bloody chef outfit, chally suit and mask, and meat clever plan
---
Thanks! I'll try to enjoy these low levels and just take it easy, because it's a great game.
---
I miss the challenges already .... gave me a reason to log on .... now all that is left is griefing
---
you cant tell me that they couldnt have picked a better reward then fucking stimpacks and radaway i mean come on
---
Edit: Either way before they even think about starting next season they need to fix the fucking daily/weekly challenge bug
---
Latin?
---
Bow is ... a poorly optimized weapon as it is. But if you pick up an instigating crossbow you'll be gravy.
---
The heavy gun Angry Turtle showed was one you get from doing Beckett's questline and anyone can get it.
---
Love to see some good RNG from players when it doesn’t hit yourself! 
---
GZ!
---
They should just buff energy weapons in general. The buff they got before wasn’t even remotely enough. My BE laser rifle is the only one I have worth using, but I don’t like to use it because I can’t see lasers coming out of it and that irks me.
---
HP buffs are fucked, that's the problem. Any time you lose one, you also lose health beyond what the buff itself is.
---
You can easily test this yourself with Lifegiver or All Rise. The same goes for anything else that boosts your HP, but those 2 are the easiest to test. If you have Healing Factor you'll need to hotkey All Rise and another weapon otherwise you may be healed before you can see the difference. Don't just take my word for it, actually do it. See it for yourself.
---
Latin American 😥
---
I've got absolutely nothing of the new rewards! I've bought a Chally outfit for 200 caps lol, but otherwise a Meat Week Flag that I already had and another 20 lbs of dead weight in a regular tenderiser. And four Flamer plans. I swear if it keeps going this way, I'll cook Chally with those Flamethrowers!
---
Thanks! I'll try to stick to those zones then. Also, I'm on PS4, but appreciate the offer, the community of 76 is great.
---
I think a very simple way they could buff certain energy weapons is by introducing 'silencer' mods. That way it would be much easier to get sneak buffs. They could even tie the mods in with the brotherhood considering they are all about technology. But that's a different story haha, I just want ultracite laser to be the better laser equivalent that they are meant to be, no one uses them cos they're so much worse than normal lasers.
---
Put them in your vendor. A lot of people want it
---
Happened to me last week. Level 500+ camp ended up walking straight in and go splattered lol I read on here that some one just stayed logged in with the body laying there. Which I did and oh boy was he pissed haha. 10 mins later after he tried shooting me to move my corpse he logged out.
---
Two hours of my life will be spent farming radstag. It will be the equivalent of a nuke drop
---
Just what I thought. A part of me wants to enjoy the low-level stuff of the game before it goes full looter-shooter like a post nuclear Borderlands lol
---
i want to hit the secret service ghillie (of which i am only a few off) &amp; then I’ll consider myself done. i don’t really care about the rest of the rewards after that
---
I got the steins and the chally head first then it was chally outfit and then I got back pack I only had time for three of them last night. Had 4 primals fail last night also. I also bought the clean challys from atom shop so I really could’ve been fine with out it again. Got a bloodied 1 star 10 mm gun and a bloodied lead pipe so I’m set lol
---
I was so excited when I got my 1st ultracite bloodied laser.modded it as a rifle and to say it was a disappointment is a understatement ..besides legacy's laser weapon are useless..heavy are ok and just that ok
---
Did you actually buy the bundle before? Or take advantage of the glitch where people could build it without ever actually buying it?
---
They can't do an energy buff as long as explosive energies are still in the game. It would make op weapons even more godly. That's why they brought in the gauss line of weapons ad a substitute but frankly they're kinda so so
---
I keep getting the bloody outfits. Would love a grill plan
---
I’d say Frank Lloyd is a great parallel. FLW was notorious for having aesthetically beautiful designs that were structurally insufficient (like FO76’s ancient game engine) and the flat roofs are prone to leaks (FO76’s various bugs), amongst other issues.
---
Oh i havent played for a while guess ill play again
---
give 'em away, dude. Meat Week is all about coming together as a family.
---
It might be, I can’t think of another event that guarantees a 3* drop. Not 100% sure this one does either, but it’s been 3* every time so far for me.
---
Weird. Done it multiple times, have not failed event once.  I guess I had good groups or something.  Downed once trying to exit, someone ressed me and I got out in time.  
---
Or, maybe I just got lucky.
---
I don't remember so probably the glitch
---
I assume you know about the herd in Toxic Valley? 😉
---
you do not read them, when we entered the vault they installed special implants allowing us to process data differently. we eat the documents. that is why Plans, Bobble heads and Magazines are consumed instead of kept after use.
---
I'd like it to be fully above, but it would make more sense to be half above and half below. The nuke possibly splitting it open.
---
Which is still better than dealing with losing 10k caps.
---
Craft low level to scrap for mods, then craft your current level and improve with learned mods.
---
I think ultracite gatling lasers are quite good. I have a 2* bloodied faster fire rate one and it performs quite well. I much prefer it over my two shot gauss minigun, dps is pretty similar and ammo is s or much cheaper to get even if primed and especially with power user perk on
---
I've had pretty good luck with AWOL but it's not always a 3* loot item.
---
Tato salad  nuff said.  Jk lol
---
Bc I don’t feel like paying for online, getting 30fps, not being able to upgrade, not having rgb.
---
I love my plasma caster, had to compromise my rifle build to make it viable but man it was worth it!
---
I love post apocalyptic stuff and I've been playing ESO and Fallout since 1 and Morrowind. Plus it's one of like 3 games I have a physical copy of, so it just lives in my PS4.
---
Any build with nonautomatic rifles, pistols and (at least for now) unarmed wont be viable. One handed and two handed will be playable but i heard they wont be as good as now. Commando and heavy weapons are even more ahead then they were. As for legendary effects everything stays the same just differences between them will be lower(Antiarmor prefix didnt get nerfed so it will see more play). Also its worth mentioning that stealth doesnt work in daily ops so its less worth to build around it. Oh and mini maxing is now mandatory so bye bye food builds.
---
Power armor displays.   The day has come!
---
Longtime bug. :(   I get tired of having to delete the floor/roof the turrets were sitting on just to replace them.
---
Can you cite a source where Bethesda said the Atomic Shop items are ‘non-canon’?
---
Sigh.  This comes up every meat week.  
---
Do what you want to do.  
---
F the haters.
---
Good call - wording is key on this one!
---
&gt;Bethesda
---
so....you died 3 times and the incompetent is  Bethesda ?? aja...aja....
---
Bugged out as he'll.  Lots of posts on it.
---
Havent tried using laser weapons so if I come across one I'll check it out.just wish they were viable endgame wise
---
I hear ya. What’s the point of killing things in 1 second. I play for some challenge. I refuse to make my build op and still die a ton due to radiation and I just laugh. I have great weapons and my guy is hybrid build where I switch daily from tank/melee/rifle/bloodied depending on what I want to do. There is no fun if there is no challenge.
---
Yes but Is only for decoration and doesn't protect
---
Just take your time and have fun. The end game of 76 isn't really the best part, so don't worry about rushing to it at all.   
---
Resources definitely should feel tight as you're leveling, but if you're running out of something specific, google it. There's often a good way to get more.
---
As much fun as gta fallout would be this game is not remotely set up for car physics, that said I like where your heads at
---
What about brining back the train (or monorail) at least between 1-4 stations to start. Would be fun to take it around the map
---
Would love the outfits and grill plan, got the backpack plan, flag plan twice,  tendorizor plan (haha), bloody outfit and hat, plus 3 of the grilling hat so far.
---
I just did about 6 min ago 😈
---
Yeah, I stopped using them whenever I rebuild a camp.  Mine are usually in low level areas that my ally takes care of
---
Just took an 8 day break out of state and away from xbox when I realized I was 12 days ahead of schedule, got back today and honestly feeling fine. The game is still good, but I feel way less pressure on it
---
Room for another? 😬
---
This is legitimately why the score reward numbers need to be pumped up. So it still encourages logins and gives folks something to do, but we can also play the rest of the game without feeling pushed into it every day.
---
The interior of the Whitespring has a bunch of plans to buy. Grahm is also easily found most of the time for now, thanks to Meat Week.
---
What I do when I have excess caps is run through all the vendors in Whitespring and clean them out of interesting plans I don't have. Then if I still have too many caps I start buying their junk, primarily Ballistic Fiber. You can get I think 400 BF from Whitespring for about 8k caps in one run.
---
If you have no other cap sinks, it works, as long as you have FO1st. Without 1st I think you'd need to go on trading subs or discords and offer to buy things that are worth tons of caps just to get rid of them consistently.
---
Alternatively, buying a serum plan every time you get close to 30k is definitely a good way to get rid of caps.
---
How about this Bethesda... don't have a cap limit.
---
Question: does playing barrel drum in fact help the animals spawn and/or come to you?
---
There’s a blurb in the loading screen about the event that says playing the barrel helps more animals come.
---
Is this true? I’m feel like I’m pretty much doing it as superstition right now.
---
Ash heap, centered around Lewisburg
---
&gt;What about brining back the train (or monorail) at least between 1-4 stations to start. Would be fun to take it around the map
---
I'm with you on this
---
Try having someone stay on the drum.
---
No you don’t
---
Only gotta drum for like 5 seconds
---
you only need the drum to start it
---
Guess upbringings make you see things way different. Whenever we lost a pet or onengot very sick my old man used to hand me a.22,  a shovel and told me to bury it behind the barn🤷‍♂️, life goes on. Dogs, cats,pigs and goats got the same treatment, egg chickens and ducks got flung in the woods, or used as bait for yotes' . So dont really see losing a cat a big deal, but most of the ones we had were just barn cats.  However dogs were alot harder to lose, thats for sure. 
---
REGARDLESS,  sounds like ya loved it dearly, so my sympathies. Its never a pleasant thing to loose something you care about, no matter how calus you are.
---
 Also glad to hear mama mole was kind to you on a sad day.
---
I was thinking this, an armoured train going around the map at all times would be so cool.
---
So your animals spawn and come to you without drumming
---
I use to have a Hitlist (on xbox) of all the big names, high levels.. etc. People i knew who would wreck.
---
Gives you short term goals.
---
There's only a few lvl 200's+ out there that i may have never seen, or never get on anymore that are left.
---
(Camelot)
---
Never thought about buying junk..my scrapbox isnt that healthy for unlimited storage...I'll be sure and check out WS..thank you
---
With all the issues lately,  I assume they were disconnected.
---
Should switch from semi auto to auto?
---
They are invincible though
---
I'm so sorry for your loss. Losing a pet is like losing a family member. 
---
But congratulations on the handmade!
---
this was apparently only an issue if you glitched the camp budget. Did you glitch the camp budget?
---
I sat on the drum through the last two minutes of the event
---
I'm seeing complaints that the animals aren't coming to people but I don't have that problem as long as someone's on the drum the whole time.
---
The only ones that fail are when someone isn't drumming.
---
For me I think it has more to do with near by camps
---
Always go in teamed.  Too many disconnects lately.
---
I imagine, with the world the way it is, that there could be places where cars could work. Unfortunately at the same time, in all the Beth games the roads are destroyed. And the cluttered mess beyond the roads leave me to think that most cars, even restored, just wouldn’t be able to go very far in the wasteland. Unless it’s a plateau style place, like a desert, there’s only so much you can do with a vehicle (even ifs off-road style). On top of that, with the world destroyed, I have a  hard time imagining that most people would have the knowledge to repair such things. And with the world destroyed the way it is, where would one go in the loud, big car that attracts everything? Most people just don’t know what’s out farther than where they’ve been, so why go if there’s nowhere to go? I think it does make sense in that way. Plus I had a few mods for FO4 that add this stuff, and it always seems cool, but riding around in fallout like that just kinda...sucks
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c07bbk/i_found_some_interesting_maps_in_the_games_files/
---
i have been inn events where everything is dead with 2 minutes to go and its failed.
---
nothing to do with drums or tents or camps or afk people
---
The ones that failed for me didn't have camps nearby
---
Huh that is weird an I don't have a answer for it other than that everyone who played before wastelanders that leveled up got packs in nuclear winter after the update came out. People didn't even have to logging to nw to get the packs, it just happened like I was lv 0 with over 100 packs. My buddy had around 130 packs an neither of us ever played nw until the dailies changed an made us go play it.
---
Some knucklehead probably has their fo1st tent set up around there which can affect the spawns.
---
*Staying* on the drums is one reason you're failing it 😂
---
you only need the drum to start it..
---
Longshot doesn't help if you can't see the enemy when they aren't rendered in.
---
I had no idea about this.  Now I understand why my vending machines were empty one day. Thank you for this post :)
---
There is no limit.
---
I really do think it's about upbringing for sure and I hope that first part doesn't make anyone upset cause I do think you are honest in your sympathies but just wanted to say something in regards to yourself.
---
If you got it from a trade you'll be fine
---
There's 8 of us, doubt just me is the problem
---
I've been failing this event WAYYYY too often now. Sucks man :( The mobs simply either aren't spawning or aren't heading to you (meaning they're out in the field like molerats underground etc).
---
Damn.
---
Thank you, I will certainly use it in her memory.
---
No, I'd wait till changes go live to decide.
---
I'm on PC, but thanks for the offer.
---
The main problem is that Bethesda made the change in pst without any official statement on to why..
---
Every other online multiplayer or mmorpg game that does dramatically changes like this do it with a statement on to why and what coming down the road..
---
I’m with you because this rebalance is for a better endgame experience and I Truly believe that 
---
But we are just assuming they going to start doing endgame around character builds like healer and tank
---
You have to store the vender, unpowered venders can still be bought from!
---
I haven’t played the PTS, but I can generally tell you that players don’t enjoy being gimped because others can’t keep up. 
---
Expansions in other Fallout games didn’t launch and trash all your progress. They made that shit harder than vanilla content and **warned you that you would probably get your shit pushed in if you weren’t at a certain point in the game**. 
---
The biggest appeal for most Fallout (and TES players) is reaching the extremely powerful status. It’s what made Wastelanders feel so good to me, that I didn’t need to make a new toon. We (the players who stuck with the game and played it) got to be the badasses who survived the worst Appalachia had to throw at us and were still standing. In short, **King Kong ain’t got shit on me.**
---
Now you’re going to slap us all down several pegs and make the enemies we’ve constantly dunked all of a sudden give us problems? Why not implement stronger enemies? Faster enemies? Smarter enemies? More enemies?
---
If you’re worried that only one or two builds are viable, it’s perfectly fine to nerf/buff those that are out of line, but just giving a huge blanket nerf to damage seems like a huge mistake.
---
Also, just throwing it out there, the tone in your post makes you sound like a complete condescending douchebag.
---
STR+15 alone translates into +75 carry weight, but to cover all my bases, here’s why they do based on the official guide:
---
STR affects carry capacity &amp; melee attack DMG:
---
PER affects VATS hit % &amp; distance at which enemies can be detected.
---
CHA increases what perks you can share with your team, as well as getting better prices when buying &amp; selling and rewards from completing group quests.
---
INT affects crafted items condition, materials gained from scrapping and difficulty of hacking. We also know that it affects EXP gain.
---
AGI affects your AP in VATS and your sneak ability (which is why the build has synergy with sneak builds)
---
LCK affects how fast you critical hit bar recharges and the condition of items you find.
---
But to exemplify this with actual numbers, here’s what you get at base STR 1 &amp; STR 15, with and without  full unyielding set (+15 STR):
---
No Unyielding:
---
Carry Capacity STR 1 = 150 + 1X5 = 155
---
Carry Capacity STR 15 = 150 + 15X5 = 225
---
Unarmed DMG multiplier STR 1 = 1 + (1X0.1) = 1.1
---
Unarmed DMG multiplier STR 15 = 1 + (15X0.1) = 2.5
---
Unyielding:
---
Carry Capacity STR 1 = 155 + 75 = 230
---
Carry Capacity STR 15 = 225 + 75 = 300
---
Unarmed DMG multiplier STR 1 = 1 + (16X0.1) = 2.6
---
Unarmed DMG multiplier STR 15 = 1 + (30X0.1) = 4
---
As you can see the effects are more notorious with a low STR build, which would basically get +30% base carry weight and a unarmed melee multiplier over twice as high.
---
Even with a base max STR build, you get +25% base carry capacity and the unarmed melee multiplier going from 2.5 to 4 (almost 40% increase).
---
So, I have to disagree and find such increases quite significant.
---
As for Wastelanders dialogue, some options and their results are unique to certain choices, such as transferring Athena to the Assaultron body (15 LCK) and have her as frequent merchant at your CAMP. It was even more relevant when initially she had a separate 1200 cap pool independent from the other vendors 1400 daily cap pool.
---
As for why I don’t play bloodied, simple: I don’t like putting all my eggs in one basket. In this case to get the most benefit from Bloodied you would also need to go with Unyielding, which implies getting both “usable” bloodied weapons and “usable” unyielding armor (since RNGesus sometimes sends us Bloodied rolling pins and Unyielding wood armor), which is either extremely dependant on RNG or with some luck available at most likely outrageous prices.
---
Which is what I presume may be your case: you invested too much on that one build and now that it’s getting its damage more in line with the rest you feel you wasted time &amp; resources getting them, since they will no longer allow you to one shot enemies that weren’t meant to be one shot.
---
Like they say, variety is the spice of life and now you, me and everyone else will get a chance to try other builds without been concerned about not having to get a single specific build.
---
As for why it’s better to nerf Bloodied than buff the other builds, it’s better to have all builds part from a common baseline (which the nerf is doing) and then buff them incrementally (and perhaps even nerf some further) to balance them out.
---
You approach would require giving the other builds some drastic buffs that would more likely end up being either insufficient or too much. The later could change the meta until another update makes another drastic buff to the next most underpowered build and the former could easily lead to further overcompensate and make the new build more ridiculously op.
---
I think the current damage nerf approach is better to make changes in a more balanced &amp; incremental way than trying to force drastic jumps in the hope they hit the right spot with another build.
---
I just got a j2525 handmade from the mole.  Pretty nice.
---
That was the most obvious way to test and replicate the bug with a glitched camp budget. There is absolutely no chance that is the only possible way it could occur. It is probably much, much less likely to occur otherwise under normal conditions, but with all things in this game it seems very likely it still could happen in other ways.
---
So what you're saying is the BoS should get cars.
---
The ones I have done that didnt fail there was someone on the drums the entire time.
---
It was just a suggestion to attempt to help, what will it hurt to try?
---
I disagree because of the following. 
---
You cannot even without the damage nerf play the game realistically. 
---
The only way to NOT have all enemies completely sponge every single attack is to go sneak commando with a bloodied weapon.  This is a problem, yes. The covert operative not having a balls out overt counterpart is a problem. The entire game forces you into two builds. 
---
I like the FPS/RPG blend but this nerf hitting bloodied isn’t the problem, it’s what it’s going to for people who want to play casually and not sneak everywhere for 2.5 bonus damage. 
---
Unless you are heavy weapons, casual play is impossible to enjoy, and this will make things worse in this regard. 
---
Bloodied needed reigning in, but by making other builds viable not by nerfing everything. Players one shotting legendaries needed reigning in, but not like this. 
---
The game needed more challenge, not like this. 
---
I did not grind 300 levels to have all enemies as spongy as they were in level one, that kills the RPG aspect of levelling up. My one shotting level 68 supermutants was a pay off for all the grinding, take that away and what the hell was the point. I spent 100 or so levels being a weaker character...I have done my penance. 
---
When will BGS learn that difficulty is not about making all enemies ridiculously unrealistic bullet sponges, it is cheap, it’s a lazy way to make a game and it pails in comparison to the competition. Sponginess isn’t a replacement for good AI and enemies using cover etc to stop you from winning them over. And it isn’t a replacement for modern video game engines and combat done properly. 
---
I really hope BGS address this in Starfield, I really do because when Call of Duty do this better you know you have a problem.
---
Oh, my bad, my camp is like in an obscure part of the map.
---
30 minutes? Clearly I fail at gaming life, but between leveling up (even on my low level character) and switching over to NW and the wait times associated there, especially if I die before I beat the goal the first round, it’s taking a good chunk of my day.
---
there are never supermutants at grove family cabin anymore since wastelanders
---
I just want my shotguns to stop rubber banding I don’t care to much about the nerf makes it harder for people to one shot legendary enemies
---
Ah, well it seemed to work for us so i thought I'd suggest it.
---
Yep...
---
Bloodied will still be the best build so this nerf does nothing imo.
---
The game definitely needs more than the two full allies (Sophia &amp; Beckett).  The other three (Gramps, Raider Boy, and Singing Woman) just give little quest jobs and don't give the full benefit - instead you "feel a kindred Spirit."  Bethesda could easily give each of those three a story to make them full allies: Gramps could have lost his kids so you end up with him feeling like you're his son/daughter, and the other two you could end up felling like siblings.  Not sure why they are there but lesser...
---
from what i have seen the Event's Mystery Pick is either a 1, 2 or 3 star roll. Earle's body for me seems to mostly drop 2 star stuff. there is also the cursed weapons that make for a light weight Scrip stockpile
---
Here’s another I just remembered - heat flashes, which is honey beasts.
---
you can waste your time however you want IDGAF.. just stating facts
---
Nice. Now you get addicted to trying to get better rolls. I have uny or bolstering sentinels or WWR on 4/5 pieces . Damn LL is taking awhile lol.
---
They can be injured and fall to the ground.
---
The damage nerf isn't the issue at all. It is how they are doing it is pretty poor. On paper it would be really good for the game to overhaul the damage system and change it up to make more builds viable and fun. 
---
The execution is abysmal though, especially with one wasteland coming out.
---
This doesn't make the game "better". It just makes an already tedious game more tedious. There are already issues with one wasteland and the damage changes that people are complaining about that aren't simply "my damage is gone". It is way more than that.
---
Could fix some of the issue by flipping berserkers and bloody dmg ranges.
---
-50% to +50% for bloody.
---
-0 to 95% for ber.
---
Bloody isnt as ridic.
---
Ber is worth using
---
None of those things require handouts, for wood head to the lumber mill south of 76, that and the surrounding woods should cover your wood needs.
---
For the letters, vendor hop a bit someone will have em for like 25 caps
---
It could do extra damage to humanish enemies. Like wendigo and mole miners.
---
My only hope is that plasma and laser rifles finally can get some of the love they deserve. And no, I don’t mean legacy ones. I mean the ordinary ones.
---
Sell plans at 10% of given value, stims at 10 caps and all unyielding and bloodied legendaries you find. Some go easily for 3-5k and some for 500 caps.
---
You can easily make 10-15k a week plus what you sell to npc's.
---
Loot all meat from your kills, cook it and sell to npc's. I did three meat week events, and sold the meat from them for almost 1400 caps.
---
Thank you, there are so much changes and without a data report with the values it's hard to understand.
---
Not being funny but this sort of thread is exactly what the PTS is for. 
---
What’s the issue with people putting forward their issues? We are of the hope it’s picked up, used and build upon in the next PTS. 
---
Telling people to shut up because it’s only PTS is moronic
---
Or maybe, it takes develops longer to dig through code to figure out which mismatch of classes and functions create this odd bug and how to fix it without breaking anything else than it does to adjust known code and known math to calculate things a different way. Or maybe, game design and user experience teams are different people than the developers digging through the engine code.
---
I mean, sure they can turn off displays and vending machines while they work on a duping glitch and that's a minor inconvenience. But if they tried to globally disable any of the legendary effects that cause weapons to become "magic", people would freak, and if they tried to implement a fix to how an effect worked on some guns but accidentally broke it on all guns, again, people would freak. So the coders are trying to make that work. In the mean time, other teams are doing their non-code jobs working on fixing other problems in the game, like build diversity and balancing.
---
I think you're in such a rush to own what may or may not be a strawman argument that you overlook that ALL damage is going down. Bloodied/Junkies will STILL be the highest output, and should be, otherwise what is the point of them? And if that is the case, what is the point of your post? 
---
The nerf will adversely affect each of my characters, not just the low health builds. And it will make my low-health pistoleer useless. He barely does enough damage to hang right now. Other than that, I'm willing to watch how all this plays out. It's pretty clear that this is just an attempt to make the game even MORE of a grind by using more resources. Whether that finally makes the game not worth the trouble is what remains to be seen.
---
It's always terrible to lose a pet. 😢
---
I wouldn't know about getting good stuff from the purveyor though. Ive spent my last 3500 or so scrip on a bunch of BS secret service chest pieces that weren't worth a damn. 
---
I sure am looking forward to the 275,000 scrip I'll have to spend to get the whole set!
---
This sounds awesome.    I keep a railroad gun and getting the ammo back more often sounds great
---
No one is a bullet sponge on live as a power armor heavy guns user with even basic stuff. 6 shots in 1-2 seconds with Final Word, which everyone can get, ends a max level supermutant.
---
You monster. ;)
---
Already started lol
---
I built under a pylon and have the Missile Turrets up pretty damn high on the pylon itself and still takes forever for them to target and shoot enemies. Have Spotlights on 3 sides of my house as well as everyone claims they help but the lights themselves only light up and move on first placement. Traveling or reloading they are "Off" and unmoving so i have no idea if they actually work or if people just think they do. Much like the False claim that Scarecrows draw aggro.
---
In all seriousness, what do I mix Poitin with? I just bought my first bottle today.
---
It works for me on my ps4 every time.
---
No, all plans disappear after you learn them.
---
I think it would be cool but there would have to be a drawback, such as we have to supply ammo.
---
Would also love for allies to be able to equip PA.
---
If you don't like the special effects of this game, maybe you're the one who would be happier playing something else. You're just another "nerf bloodied and unyielding" whiner.
---
The drum summons them initially, then you are good.
---
The problem is the enemies spawn so far away and aggro towards other monsters and npc's.  You have to go run them down basically.
---
That's nicely written and your are completely right. 👍👍👍
---
I'd be fine with the explosive effect on lasers being nerfed if they would up the base damage on all lasers. With the current durability on lasers, the damage is pretty lackluster and if you use the beam splitter they break way to fast.
---
Bruh I'm an archer, I dunno what I'm gonna do if they nerf my nonexistent dmg, I thought it was fun to play this way but VATS are nasty af, dmg are low with all the perks and I'm so slow...  They should do a more specific nerf imho. I'm not gonna panic but If they nerf my poor little bow I' m gonna change build and burn everything with a flamer
---
&gt;Telling people to shut up because it’s only PTS is moronic
---
Remind me, when did I say/imply that? 
---
I am just saying to calm the fuck down. It is not the end if the world and the rebalance is OBVIOUSLY not finished.
---
I really hope we get a stash limit increase soon tbh. It's nice having the ability to show stuff off but a real pain having to choose between stash space for nice thing to show off and more scrap space. Not too bad on normal clothes but noticeable on weapons and power armour will be especially noticeable.
---
You can go to Big Bend Tunnel in the Cranberry Bog and talk to Vinny Costa, up on the covered platform, and start the event yourself, provided that the event isn't on a cooldown. If you see it on the map, you can join it any time that the event is running, and you'll get dropped somewhere in the tunnel near where the quest progress is.
---
I agree, my Ultracite Gatling does the same, but it’s one of two viable builds. 
---
In truth this rebalance won’t effect me personally too much, but my lower level characters I’ve tried to experiment with aren’t going to have a good time. 
---
There are so many cool weapons and potential play styles in this game it would be awesome to make them a bit more viable 🙂
---
To help put this in context, where you using with pistol and rifle bonuses, and if so, was that patched out in PTS?
---
well that's completely wrong
---
And you're just another FOTM fanboy who can't see past your own optimization to broader game implications.
---
Pretty sure you only need to be on the drum to start it. I'm rather confident the main reason why the event has been failing is because the enemies tend to spawn at a distance and will sometimes just run away and hide or not even spawn(kinda like workshop defense). I guarantee that if you're sitting by the drum, enemies will spawn outside your VATS range/view.
---
I thought playing the drums was the obvious decision when afk'ing. Lol.
---
Ever seen a headless ghoul heal itself while being still? Because that just happened
---
Go watch AngryTurtle's damage comparison videos, he does it at full health in PA with "Final Word" which anyone can get. The game is still completely playable.
---
More to the point, future content, drops and gear can be balanced so that rewards are actually GOOD.
---
Honestly I felt kinda bad for the Free Radicals after I killed them all and then found that holotape talking about restoring a limo for Roper (I'm a mechanic irl)
---
On the cranberry bog prime cuts if the fog crawler is the last enemy killed and hes outside the circle it fails the event. Thats what ive noticed anyway as the few times ive failed that was why.
---
MEAT. WEEK. IS. THE. BEST.
---
Right now energy damage is being MONDO nerfed, but I think that has more to do with playing around with the explosive energy damage of legacy weapons than it does actual live release plans.
---
The first Primal Cuts I did was close to the Wayward where everyone has camps. Sure enough, the mobs start spawning underneath this guy’s camp building.
---
Eventually we managed to kill the waves, even the one stuck in the actual floor. Then the last mob spawns. A deathclaw. It’s entirely inside this camp building! I’m assuming through a combination of everyone shooting and the deathclaw swinging, the wall of the building disintegrated like he was the Kool Aid man. We went through the now missing wall, looted the body and left.
---
Sorry about your wall, man.
---
The next three events failed when we couldn’t find the mobs in the last wave.
---
Thanks for the information!
---
If they were worth using normally, I’d trade my god mode laser in for that. They desperately need to be brought in line with their ballistic counterparts, maybe have their own specific perk trees to diversify builds. Few people have legacy weapons like myself, comparatively speaking, and our guns are going to be OP no matter what unless they’re removed. Again, I wouldn’t even use mine if I didn’t feel like I had to to make  the laser rifle worth using.
---
I've gotten into the habit of aggressively hunting them away from the barrels, I am still getting about half of them that fail because the final wave doesn't spawn
---
I did the event three times today. In all three cases this exact thing happened.
---
Umm no? I play to have fun. Failing the queen is just a waste of my resources and time. Nuke card, ammo, stims, buffs, 25+ minutes of my life just to fail and get nothing? No that's not "nice". 
---
In the first months of this game I never even bothered with the queen event because it almost always failed and was just a waste of time. Most people just ignored it. Now that it's almost a guaranteed kill not only do I show up to every queen (and the whole server seems to show up) I see, I also launch at least 3 nukes myself everyrtime I play.
---
Not in the least. In fact, I keep a small bit extra open in case I find something I want to add.
---
How will that fix it?I press respawn map shows up press location and repeat..I hope it's fixed justbteally sucks to f.c just to respawn
---
Blaming companies for your own personal behavior is popular in 2020.
---
Most efficient way right now is to make it prime
---
oh you missed what I was saying. I was upset about the respawn timers
---
Think you need to get to level 5-7 before they start popping
---
Yeah, and something like that isn't required for other heavy guns.
---
But they don't die. Though I admit, I would love to give the good commander a tenderizer
---
Ok thanks for the advice
---
"can be balanced"
---
That right there is the key: CAN BE. What have you seen at any point in the last two years that gives you any confidence that Beth can balance anything? Can be and will be are very different.
---
This isn't new content, this is making old content artificially more difficult. Well, "difficult." It still won't be hard but will be more resource intensive.
---
werdddd that would explain it. thank you!!!
---
Dude for the last 5 months ive gotten nothing but mutants and exterminators weapons im so fuckin glad it paid off
---
That's just your opinion. Which you even state is unpopular. So why should the game change in favor of the minority?
---
Life is challenging enough. I play games to have fun.
---
Well for now, and with regret, I will be scrapping my vendors for the foreseeable future.
---
i've met people lower than me who make me look like a joke and i've met people more than double my level make me look like a god. i haven't built my character to be a god roll or anything. i'm still playing around with the perks to get a feel for things. my main gun for those events is an Zealots Explosive .50 cal, secondary weapon is Instigators Gatling Gun. they both do a good job but it takes more than a few mins to clear all the mobs, at least in my case... i'm guessing your a god roll or something
---
Got my Shotgun earlier this week. Started on my armor set last night. Rolled a few times for an arm, and got a satisfying result. Will start the next appendage tonight.
---
Same here.. happens wayyy too often.
---
Very true.   It's just that personally, I would be consoling myself with, "it could have been worse."  Sometimes it's all you have left in terms of consolation.
---
mine just says Bush did 4/20. i should go for something more wholesome.
---
For console players, pick up an external SSD HD on Amazon. It'll cut your load times DRASTICALLY and help with draw distance, pop up and so on.
---
It sure helps to prime everything. It is also require for the gauss mini.
---
Try looking at the challenges and not the checkmark. I had the "auto-complete" for the first time a few days ago where all the checkmarks were up and everything was dimmed out. Only thing was was each challenge was at "0/XX" or however much. I was still able to complete them as usual.
---
Pts has a legendary perk that at base produces 50% more ammo
---
i want to think so as well, to be honest tho i have no way of knowing. just venting my frustration lol
---
I know, and that only puts the LMG evenn more behind the other heqvies.
---
You can buy it on ps4 store but you can only cancel through Bethesda website
---
Why server hop? Just buy the Plans from the Production Wing!
---
I dont know about that game just thought since everyone used froglegs......but you know bad jokes and stuff.
---
Oh yeah tell me about it!
---
With aaaaaaaaaall the different weapons and effects in this game it’s so weird to keep rolling the same ones. Makes me think if it’s even RNg at all lol.
---
The fuck? An hour long battle (legit launch included)that takes buckets of ammo with no payoff . The grind won’t be one shotting things it will be an even more boring bullet grind again to just fail at the end. That’s like going full circle  to the first three months. Now that sure would be innovation.
---
But what was the third effect?
---
That's a nice set. I have 4 pieces are 3star unyielding  2 wwr  and 1 that's a 2 star unyielding. I def rolling for a 3 star!
---
Beats nothing though
---
i agree, i’m a bloody/sneak shotgun build &amp; i can pull thousands of points of damage easy. i’ve spent months perfecting this build. if i look at it from my small top 1% player perspective then the nerf does upset me. if i look at it from a much wider game perspective i know it’s necessary &amp; good. it allows me to open up &amp; actually be able to try out different builds &amp; have fun with the game.
---
The heavy guns rebalancing. LMG went from being absolute trash to being amazing, with a significant drawback in its constant need to reload (and the raw cost of 308)
---
If you're talking about the gauss shotgun, that thing is a beast. I personally think the junkies variant is the best effect to have
---
So people one shot killing the spawns outside the event boundaries make it fail?
---
can't wait for all those "I put my PA in the display and it dissapeared" posts lmao
---
Understandable
---
That's not a specific buff to the lmg ammo so it's irrelevant. It's still way behind others.
---
So because there are worse games out there this one deserves a pass on criticism? 
---
That's a dumb argument.
---
Wait a few months and there will be much more demand by people paying more, I'm sure.
---
Welp, your doomed for eternity
---
I would check the marketplace Reddits, but something specific like that would be hard to find, also extremely expensive and if it was 3* and good stars it might be trade only no caps. But just a 1* unyielding of those, if you could find it, would be like 500-2000 caps
---
No  offense intended to anyone,  thats just how some people are raised. Hell Im the only n one of my pals that actualy plays video games,let alone reddit.
---
I posted because your post made me reflect. To me,  well its just a stupid cat why post on a video game forum about it. Usually id say to myself ,this dudes a bitch a bitch and just move on and not comment. 
---
But after reading your post i really thought about it. Came to the conclusion thats not right. To you that cat was special, and it really meant something to you so posting on here is a way of paying tribute to something you really cared about.
---
I gave some background to the way I was brought up beacuae its made me very calused to pets and animal dying and i genuinely appreciate the post you made because its reminded me not everyone feels that way. So again sorry to hear about your loss, and thank you for the empiphany of sorts.
---
I'd like to see Backpack Nukes.  Lug them out, set them up, arm and leave... quickly.
---
Molotov’s used to have a use. Tagging. But now everyone’s using duped BJVFE25332550250 bullshit (which we *still* can’t get at fair prices on the market) there’s so much lag and damage dealt, my Molotov sits on the ground for 20 seconds then bursts into flames after everything is dead and I get no loot or XP. It’s making it really difficult to level up.
---
The prime creatures get markers. I had it fail 3 times in a row last night with no creatures to be found and no markers on the map.
---
Nice! I'm gonna equip the jet pack mod but I haven't had time to farm flux with meat week. Hope you get the rolls you want!
---
That wasn’t a personal attack on you more the general backlash someone gets when they highlight a PTS issue. 
---
I don’t think it is finished, I hope it improves. 
---
As I’ve said in another reply I’m primarily a vampires heavy so I’m pretty much fine whatever happens to me, I use bloodied sneak when I’m out of PA but to be honest without it I’d be swimming in 556 sales = caps. 
---
My worry is that the theme from BGS is generally that difficulty=sponginess, with the exception of one meta build. It was the same with Skyrim, everything became useless without stacking alchemy and enchanting for max enchantments on two deadric swords to dual wield alongside the slow time shout. Magic was useless on higher levels and so were bows unless you stood miles away and took 100 pot shots. 
---
It would be nice for them to adjust this slightly. Make your cryptids spongy sure but a human blood eagle taking an entire clip to say “ouch my leg is broken” just feels wrong. 15 years ago this was gaming and expected, other studios have refined my tastes a little bit and I sort of expect combat to be a little more realistic (I know it’s fallout but still). 
---
- Buff all weapons if someone wants to invest in perks for their pipe rifle, make it viable for them without spending 100k caps for a BE. 
---
- DeBuff all health and Armour
---
- Introduce a proper cover system as at the moment enemies bullets seem to penetrate through everything. 
---
- Normalise all legendaries, so Mutants can have the same effect as bloodied when heavily mutated, or ghoul slayers does full or 40% bloodied damage at full health to ghouls only. 
---
- DeBuff enemy health in the same way as player health. You can die in a few hits but so can they. 
---
- Buff your cryptids, and made ALL Legendary’s scale to each player (the PTS does this atm and it’s great!) 
---
This first nerf normalising damage multipliers ACTUALLY is a single step in the right direction, but it needs more work.
---
I'll just copy and paste what I suggested to another: 
---
"Try looking at the challenges and not the checkmark. I had the "auto-complete" for the first time a few days ago where all the checkmarks were up and everything was dimmed out. Only thing was was each challenge was at "0/XX" or however much. I was still able to complete them as usual."
---
I got all 3 tenderizer mods but no plans for the weapon itself yet.
---
i mean, my bloodied stealth sniper can still ohk level 100 super mutants on the pts.  
---
I did have to tweak my build to get there a bit but nothing horrible.  How much stronger should semi auto be?
---
Production? Where's that? I've been going up to the power armor room and its just mods that cycle over and over
---
Between the scrip for turning in prime cuts and scripping the 1-2 leggos I get from the event and what I get from Grahm I’m maxing out way early in the day.  I’m no longer rushing to do prime cuts because it creates more problems (weight) than it provides usefulness.
---
Oh.none the less 60 seconds in game time is a eternity!
---
I was using both. It wasnt patched, but since stats add instead of multiply it ends up at 2.2x damage instead of about 3x
---
I sip it straight. Mixing it is just a waste.
---
Reduced weight, nothing special but it is a nice addition.
---
Bloody Mess, Adrenaline and Gun Fu work on every gun but the last one is better for vats and ranged weapons
---
Man I could not have put this better myself. This shit is long overdue, especially when PvP was thing in the game.
---
Thanks fam 🙏
---
all my numbers are fully completed it says as well as the checks
---
but thanks anyway for the suggestion, hopefully it helps someone else out
---
I had to walk out and lightly tap a level 5 supermutant because it was shooting my corn from apparently too far away for turrets to do anything
---
I had a couple 300 levels watch from a distance a I tried to manage a horde of Rad Scorpions in the Ash Heap event, then got pissy when we couldn't take down the Sheepsquatch in time. It's your fault, assholes.
---
Well if it helps any, idk if you know this, but super duper works for secret service stuff. It's not always great but it gives you more bang for your scrip with a few extra tries.
---
How useful are those bundles? I figured they were just like grenades so ive never bothered getting the plan.
---
Yeah, the Gauss. Was saving up my modules for that first, figuring it would take me some time before getting one I liked. Got an Instigating on my fifth roll.
---
Lol why am I not surprised
---
Personally I’d prefer bug fixes over content.
---
Maybe you opened map/pipboy etc, and canceled the reward animation and you got the reward right into your inv?
---
I wonder how many flamingos that ATX flamingo is going to cost
---
Nice! I got the Tato Salad recipe as well. I think Angry Turtle said that one is rare too.
---
Edit: I assumed the backpack plan was common. To clarify my next post a bit.
---
Were you tracking the event in the top right corner of your screen?
---
Did the event fail? you don't get prizes if the event fails.
---
idk I guess that’s what all the toxic waste out there smells like
---
Your getting xp? I get more xp walking around morgan town than an hour of meat week. Its anoying.
---
You only need the Liberty Prime Torso to activate the voice. So u can put the red scare head on top w/ the torso of liberty prime, and still have the voice activate; just in chinese
---
Thanks a bunch.if your on xbox I'll slide you that 10 flux you need for it when ready.
---
If you don’t like it can I have it? No reason to keep a weapon you don’t like...
---
This game deserves, and gets, a ton of criticism. Would you like me to start ranting about my criticisms? I got em.
---
Don't turrets and other defenses cause creeps to spawn?
---
I mean hes just doing what your doing, stating his opinion and the reason why he has that opinion, no need for guys to be downvoting this stuff, everyone has their own opinion
---
I have a heavy uny left leg 3*  and a forest scout left arm 1*.
---
I misread your post.yeah the heavy lasers can be pretty good. I keep one myself.very cheap ammo wise
---
That was a good one. Are you expecting buffs from Nerfhesda? Won't happen. Their moto is like "let's f\*ck up this thing this time and see how the community reacts".
---
PA displays? Shut up and take my atoms! 
---
Now if I only had the budget and the stash space...
---
Feels like some builds are waaay too powerful so I’m more than happy to hear about nerfs. Game is very easy to break.
---
Bethesda games are horribly unbalanced to begin with though so I don't envy them.
---
About time. I was pretty happy with this anti armor explosive 50 cal drop, until i figured out it did 4-5 dmg  against the colossus guy per hit, while the bloodied LMG was hitting 65’s lol...
---
I'm terrified of the armor displays causing a new stash stealing glitch. I want them but I also want my stuff more.
---
Oh i see. Wasnt aware of that, thx.
---
Is it heavy combat?
---
Sorry for your loss...
---
Losing a pet is an extremely hard thing to go through. I lost my cat over 4 years ago, but i never got to say goodbye.
---
Isn't that like the point of this sub? Discussion? Which would include criticism? So yeah go ahead and make a new post full of criticism. 
---
Not sure what point you are trying to make.
---
Git gut.
---
You are vastly overstating how effective the LMG is, even post adjustment. It's still one of the least useful heavies. But for the sake of discussion I'll agree. That's *one* weapon. This is a fundamental change across the entire system. This is far more akin to their attempt to "fix" PvP by slapping an arbitrary damage cap on, which oh by the way, tanked every build in the game except for one or two. Which, based on what I'm seeing here, is precisely what's happening again.
---
Which brings me back to the point from my first comment: my bloody heavy gunner is still going to be more effective that all but a few builds. Nothing is going to change except everybody is worse.
---
The left leg is but the arm isn't unfortunately.
---
The Enclave in the white Springs bunker.
---
Correct, although its such a widely used exploit its sort of being treated as a build
---
As long as you would have if you got the chance then that's all that matters.
---
I'm on xbox, I only need one violet flux. My GT is ConjureTV.
---
Oh ok bet are you selling it by any chance??
---
Whats that
---
this happens to me on the queen too... the lider icon and probably 15 players near each other is a nightmare
---
also the score board.... for some reason is like the vsync is disabled there and the frames are like 300 or something it's impossible to navigate with a controller since apparently the cursor velocity scale with the framerate so a tiny little move of the sticks and the cursor fly across the entire screen..
---
If you're on Xbox I'd be down.
---
My point was the game doesn't/shouldn't cater to the minorities opinion.
---
Yes the event was in the top right
---
He means the tent
---
Make challies feed, graham has the plan, and give it to challie in her feed pile. It's easy to make and can fill the meter
---
Nope I did not open the pipboy
---
Yeaup I’m on Xbox HMU whenever u hop on My Gamertag is SkyRAGEARMY
---
Have you completed the main quest line for Fallout? The whole Enclave questline
---
&gt;"ooh baby I like int raw"
---
ahahahahha @  "ooh baby I like int raw" (for the unfamiliar: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2zgB93KANE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2zgB93KANE))
---
LMG is absolutely not one of the least useful heavies. It's immensely accurate and has some of the highest damage per second of any gun in the game.
---
Nope the event completed in about 2 minutes there was about 10 people there
---
Keep that gun! It's going to be great.
---
You'd have to run some numbers to see exactly what that new calculation would do....to me, a better option would have been to cap Bloodied at +50%.
---
What would be good rolls?
---
I'll message and add when I'm home.it will be a few hours but I got you
---
&gt;high risk, high reward
---
Okay that's cool and all, but where's the high-reward? A 3 star legendary item that isn't a 100% chance to be a 3 star?
---
Good thing Fallout is your favourite and those other game companies with their own battle passes and FOMO stuff won't faze you!
---
Alright, I appreciate it my man
---
Are your vendors next to the fast travel point?
---
I'm definitely holding off for a week or so until I know it's safe.
---
Imagine the same game but in some limited places it takes one more shot to do the job...that's it.
---
Gotta figure out what to sell if for. Checked the FED76 website, you won't like what prices they told me. Lol. Just not sure how close PC/Xbox prices compare.
---
Rename that BE Handmade after your cat and fire it in loving memory, frequently!
---
I'm sorry for your loss.  They may be small but the good ones have an indelible place in our hearts.
---
how does mutant work? i always imagine that it was kind of junkies but with mutations instead of addictions.
---
Always! Just fill out a small verification form and your good to go!
---
Awesome to read! Thx for the post man, totally agree. Also have a instigating 25% FFR handmade, which I’m also keeping in case stuff would change :). There’s just no alternative to bloodied - and I don’t like running around / doing events with such low hp. The threshold to get into bloodied rifle stealth builds was really high, I also almost quit.
---
Notes and turning in meat gives scrip
---
This has been a fucking problem since day 1, beta day 1. It's been brought up before, but never addressed. 
---
I want a key that turns players off. That's all it would take. 1 button, hide players. Full stop.
---
They should make a CAMP item where you rig your own camp to explode just in these situations
---
Xyz purchased 10000 10mm ammo 
---
OH SHIT FLIP THE SWITCH
---
KABOOOOOOOOOOOOMMM
---
I will look for you, I will find you... and I will pay you
---
Hell, I have the most fun on drums. Yeah maybe it’s not as exciting as doing the hunting and such, but I like watching everyone go nuts knowing I’m supporting the good times.
---
Uhhh no idea tbh it’s up to you people usually sell it for 2,500 caps
---
I suspect they won't release it until the normal patch day / time - Tuesday at 10am.
---
I also suspect that BGS never intended to push the hotfix this week (with the release of Meat Week) &amp; were going to be it on Tuesday anyway.
---
I have no idea why they'd lie, but then again, they also LIED about SS Mods being included in Patch 21.
---
Powered (AP refresh), Sentinel -  Damage reduction while standing still, Cavalier - Damage reduction while sprinting (more for melee characters), Any Weight Reduction especially weapon weights, then probably Poison resistance, Extra Sneak, Rad Resistance. For those who have a “magic” weapon, the less damage while blocking one is desired.
---
I would take advantage because it probably was his secondary account
---
What about flamethrowers pointed towards a stash of exploding bait? Big boom!!!!
---
Roughly how much does it take to demolish a base
---
Just hit 1300 today, only got the secret service stuff to get now too.  I'd love an increase or just let us go nuts once and while and cash them all in.
---
Can a handmade be made semi-auto? If so that's a pretty solid gun!
---
Animals are definately part of the family, and anyone who says otherwise has clearly never had a pet be part of the family
---
I could see someone being 2000 but 10k just seems like an insane time investment.
---
SAME! And if one does pop, no one joins because they're all too busy with Primal Cuts or Grahm's Cookout.
---
No it's not a good thing. Everything that does a good amount of damage gets nerfed. If they nerfed everything that did an insane amount of damage ***AND*** made enemies less of a bullet sponge then that'd be different. If you're level 100+ why shouldn't you be able to one or two shot something half your level?
---
TSE Weapons needed a nerf, but it was nerfed too hard. Bloodied and Junkies could be considered OP, but with Bloodied you're risking very low health and could be two shotted by a Colonel Gutsy or one hit melee'd by most level 50+ enemies if serendipity doesn't kick in.
---
Bethesda sucks at re-balance simply due to OP things on the players end being nerfed TOO much. And instead of realizing "Hey this was nerfed too harshly, we should give it a slight buff to rebalance it out." they go "Oh well" and wait for the next OP build and nerf that
---
*Any* pockets
---
don't know for sure, haven't tried the event since
---
I'm on day 5 I think of being unable to finish it. It sucks because I just started like a week ago and was really loving this game until now, I'm just sort of locked and can't find anything to level up anymore so I just aimlessly wander and grind.
---
Yep, perfect SVD sniper!
---
Not at all. There were xp glitches early on that allowed those crazy levels.
---
I didn't say we haven't had an update in 7 months. I said we had one update in the last 7 months. That update was 3 months ago...
---
No, because it's not broken for everyone.
---
People will always be like this.  Get 1st and do the event on private.  Only way around this.  Complaining on here just gotta into the nether.  The high levels will not listen.
---
MORE viable? Are you kidding me? VATS is already obscenely overpowered compared to not using VATS, and it has been since day one. And it’s just a ridiculous, bolt-on system, to make up for the performance issues of the creation kit.
---
This one is +25 rad resistance and harder to detect. FED 76 is saying quick vendor price is around 14k. But I have no idea how the PC prices and Xbox prices compare.
---
Just finished to today and I feel so Acomplished
---
I've been lucky enough to not have my dailies auto complete so I've been able to miss a few days, that being like 4 or 5
---
That’s not too bad! Gg man
---
I check for that but still nothing \*shrugs\* no idea what's going on
---
I bought the whole season pass when you could buy levels. Not worth the grind in my opinion
---
fAiL ! 😂
---
Yes, yes, oh my god, yes!! I want to just log in and enjoy the game, but I'm so busy rushing around trying to complete the challenges that I haven't worked worked on the main quest in weeks. I have so many uncompleted quests that they can't all show on my tv at once.
---
I can't wait until I finish the season, so that I can actually play the game.
---
I mean, no? What good it damage per second when you have to stop firing after 5-6 seconds to reload? And it's certainly not an accurate weapon compared to 50 cals and miniguns.
---
What you mean by broken? Every meat week event I have been in has worked flawlessly. Including the primal cuts ones.
---
I have 400,000 ultracite .308, why would you want to do this to me?
---
I so agree....
---
Completed it Tuesday, I feel so free...
---
Now only Log to come to Meat Week/Colossal, when I used to play for fun , explore, T-Notes and XP
---
Regards
---
JM
---
Put atom shop skins on them
---
I contribute but dont notice any high ping/lag
---
i hope that this new formula help the server to not think like 2 seconds when I oneshoot someone with my shotgun xd
---
Congrats that is amazing.
---
VATS is OP currently with unyielding, concentrated fire and low AP cost weapons because you can chain vats for auto-hitting. But for its ACTUAL purpose, making low rate of fire weapons hit HARD every few hits, it kinda sucks currently.
---
Why would I bother with saving a crit for an instigating 50 cal hunting rifle, or black powder rifle, when I could just go full auto and hold down VATS for chain guaranteed full damage hits?
---
LOL God I'm so old.....
---
no.  just no.  turrets at workshops are annoying as FUCK and need a massive nerf imo.  At the least limit workshop turrets by 75%.
---
Ah.
---
Yeah, doing it with an exploit sounds about right/within the realm of reason.
---
Tbh I’m sitting on .308 ammo at 1 cap each in my vendor.  It’s rarely bought.  So maybe just buy it if crafting is an issue?
---
It’s a lot more common then finding 5.56 or .50 cal that I use a lot more of.  So that is a benefit
---
It’s the highest DPS weapon in the game, the ammo should be hard to craft. And if you prime it you get 10x as much ammo per craft
---
Nerfing will just make bloodied builds even better, and might make newbies and bad builds not viable. And will push more people into bloodied. But I’m fine with the nerf, it will still be pretty much the same except for melee Who got really fckd up.
---
It will take more than removing damage to kill bloodied. Until something better is added, or perks re-worked, bloodied will always be the most damaging build. Hell you can remove the bloodied effect completely from the game and I’ll still be rocking those 20% life
---
People on PC and Reddit marketplaces have tons of caps, so places are inflated higher there than in game vendors. I couldn’t sell a Quad FFR Gamma Gun for 20k in game vendor but was offered 40k in a marketplace.
---
I will cry tears of joy if they ever fix the broken explosive meta with 1 shot grenades even in PA. Also Gauss Shotgun is broken af. Insane amounts of damage, frame drops, and shakes your whole damn screen. There's a memory leak with those explosion effects from the Gauss Shotgun.
---
Probably take 10% budget each😥
---
My turret at the back of my camp at Charleston Station just sits and oscillates like a god damn Westinghouse fan while super mutants pop shots at my crops all day long from across the river.  Yet I saw a camp in Cranberry Bog the other day shooting robots with missiles from a mile away.
---
I haven't had either yet, just meat cleaver plans!
---
exactly my thoughts too..... \*shrugs\* guess it can't be helped
---
Wasn’t it already extended for a week due to the Atlas Observatory event?
---
Yeah I believe the words they claimed they “forgot” to put the SS mods in and I should’ve known that Bethesda timelines mean give or take a week
---
My favourite radio mod for FO4 was Radio Nam, added a load of vietnam war era tracks that fit really well with the apocalypse theme
---
Just because it’s worked flawlessly for you doesn’t mean there’s not a problem, this subreddit has been plagued with complaints about various things not working properly
---
Hi in-game friend! I had this random award to give out before it expires...so there you go.
---
people are gonna do what they do..
---
that said it is clownshoes that bases are allowed in event areas and on mob spawn points...
---
Are you on xbox because it is working fine for me
---
Haven’t heard this, If that’s true then great
---
Yeah I’m on Xbox and have had it not happen 3 hours in a row
---
Makes sense. You think 8k would be a fair price?
---
Because its a good song?  
---
They could just make a more upbeat radio station with more similar songs
---
maybe bc the colossus is a new mob but the 5 times I did the event we made it in a reasonable time and it was fun. The queen sometimes takes a lot of time bc she decides to not land for 5 minutes lol
---
I honestly like it more than the queen... also 8 notes lul
---
Bloodied, by all accounts, is still the highest damage build on the PTS. It's just not 6x more damage. I'm not specifically anti bloodied. I'm anti "endgame meta is killing SBQ solo in 22 seconds and everything else is literally miles behind"
---
I agree. Absolutely do. 
---
But before they release this (as said in another post) things should be rebalanced with cards and weapons first. 
---
If I’m already struggling with the late game (take a non-bloodied rifleman or a non-bloodied revolver build that doesn’t spec into crits) this will make it much worse from what I understand, by lowering their damage even more.
---
So while I agree, we need to see some of these changes at least *before* One Wasteland. 
---
*I’d also appreciate if the melees got moved to make actual sense, IE the most damage is on two handed, then one, then unarmed, with the difference between them being stuff like crippling, tanking, effects applied, etc.*
---
For real, fuck the rubberbanding.
---
There will be a second week of it, in September. It's not an extension, it's another week next month.
---
If you do the daily/weekly challenges from now until the end of the season how many ranks will that be, do you know?
---
I usually run a separate power grid for my spotlights, so there is a switch attached to my generator, then the spotlights. When the spotlights are glitched just switch the power of and on, then they work again
---
The only way is up...
---
FOTM as in, been here since beta and have run every build? Lol a true hater you are
---
Have seen plenty of times where prime creature marker didn’t show in game or on map until I ran into the creature stuck somewhere. My guess is that the creatures spawn farther away and the market doesn’t show until the creature gets within a radius of the meat cage or your character.
---
No matter what day of the week or what event is going on, this sub has, and likely will always  be plagued with complaints about various things not working properly.
---
Meat week working great here as well.
---
The strength reload perk makes the reload time negligible. It's also extremely accurate compared to a 50 cal and has like 50% faster fire rate than it naturally.
---
no on xbox you can got to the Microsoft website and cancel it through your subscriptions.
---
The nerf doesn't change the meta. It's been said since the last bloodied nerf that Bloodied could lose half It's damage again and still face roll the game.
---
And now that's happened, and it does in fact still faceroll the game. 
---
But now everything less than that takes *even longer*.
---
Nerfing everyone's damage and making enemies bulkier really just isn't the way to make the game more fun.
---
You need a cat costume to go with your new bloodied!
---
 That's why we have to donate shit to brotherhood to get us a second week late September
---
👏
---
We're getting 12 fps on ps4.
---
06 on Xbox.
---
On the other side of the coin - just because it's broken for you doesn't mean it's broken for everyone. Which I would guess means no extension.
---
We seem to be operating from completely different experiences here so I'll bid you a pleasant day.
---
Again, just because it works for you doesn’t mean it works for everyone
---
you can only really lower it by choosing dialog options in a negative way, but almost everything you pick makes them either not care, or make them like you more
---
For a 1* Unyielding heavy armor piece?
---
Think that might be tuff maybe try attacking there camp I would hope that would work also I think you can tell Meg that you are done either them maybe that would help
---
Kind of, it just doesn't count mutations so you don't get more damage the more mutated you are.
---
I have not experienced MEAT Week being broken..
---
Ive experienced a lot of clueless players doing annoying stuff.. but the event is working just the same as every other time its been active
---
My frames drop and sometimes my game crashes when I'm by the fire.
---
No, this is the 3*
---
My camp was on the primal cuts site before I even knew that was a thing I'm afraid...
---
I still find it funny people don't understand why others do this.
---
This. I honestly believe even if something was 100% on point, someone would still find something wrong with it. Fact is, the event works and is completable if people just do what they need to do. As for primal cuts, it's pretty common sense now which ones you should avoid, there are plenty of them that still do work. Should bethesda fix those ones and the small issues with meat week, yeah, will they, probably not.
---
What are the stars?
---
I remember I was getting an insane amount of XP during the first meat week and then one I think they held during a double XP weekend?
---
Sadly, everybody is packing mega builds and equipment these days so its harder to really get anything decent from primal cuts in the bog now. I just got kind of a standard thing going on, nothing crazy like bloodied so I'm often running half way across the area to take down a fog crawler before someone immediately blows it head off. XD
---
How does 10,000 rounds sound like exploiting?
---
10k is literally nothing when it comes to ammo.
---
Duck Hunt?? Awesome
---
Shoulda cleaned up the Chally Piles if you didn't want to get Ecoli
---
Oh my Christ I’ve had minimal problems, a couple of prime events failed in the first few hours for me but apart from that it’s been fine, I’m going off constant complaints on here 
---
It’s like the autocomplete score bug, it’s not a problem for somebody unless it happens to them
---
Unyeild, Radiation and Sneaky
---
When you ohk an enemy, enemy next to it does too, think that would be fair enough. /s
---
Ok great thanks! Bought a bottle from Micil Distillery in Galway.
---
There was the chest at the end of the Vault 94 raid but that's no longer a thing.
---
Yea i remember from last year when people would not help out and i would get not rewards
---
I need that goddamn train set right now
---
The Spotlight Turrets don't work for me either, but the Work Light does (at least for Missile Launchers in my testing).
---
10% to put down and then 10% to display 🤦‍♂️
---
Something in the Mire. The tall grass and canopy darkness would make for some excellent ambushes.
---
Nope. Even if you run every mutation that you possibly can, it only gives you the flat 10% damage boost.
---
*Arrows*
---
Yes but the PTS damage of bloodied is not so much more that I want to put up with low health builds for stuff like Earl.
---
THAT'S the point. You can now create content with very simple mechanics like DoT or AOE damage, or stuff that knocks you out of stealth, or stealth enemies (ala BoS missions) that disadvantage bloodied. And THAT is balanced.
---
Bloodied will still be best, but it won't be so VASTLY superior that it's literally the only optimal choice.
---
Seriously.. it’s self explanatory
---
It pops up every hour, on the hour, slightly south west of V76
---
its common to do so for the challenges. it is also common for people to not understand why people are doing that.
---
I’ll repeat just because it’s fine for you doesn’t mean it’s fine for everybody
---
Thats awesome! My brother and I have to get it shipped from Ireland to the states.  My favorite is knockeen hills 180 proof.
---
Yeah it would be close to that. If I had that in game I’d probably sell that between 5-8k. Probably would get more maybe 10-12k from a 76 marketplace Reddit.
---
Looks like a brine barrel from 1787. It looks to me like the work of master hooper Josiah Wooldruff, who learned the craft from his father Jesiah Wooldruff, who in turn learned it from his.
---
The slats are not flat. They're curved. The base of the barrel is approximately 20- Every barrel is inspected before usage. The key is that the oak was cured and shaped by Josiah's cousin Joshua, who was a cooper and not a hooper.
---
Yeah but that’s assuming everything runs perfectly
---
I do it too.
---
But sometimes, when I feel I have too much money, I buy plans for 10 caps each.
---
So I’m the only one having this issue I was able to do it yesterday but it hasn’t happened today
---
Awesome, thank you for your time.
---
I definitely don't want players to struggle. I just think a rebalance has to happen for broader game direction. If I'm wrong and EVERYONE SUFFERS with no positive outcome then ... Well ball will be in Bethesda's court.
---
Probably a happy camper afk.
---
How do you get that hat?
---
There’s people that it’s not even popping up on the map for
---
This post did a great job of highlighting the problems with 76's endgame. What it didn't do, imo, is explain how nerfing the endgame builds is actually going to fix that issue. 
---
So, instead of super specific, super optimized builds that everyone already has (not me, so i guess not _everyone_), we have the exact same grind fest game with more time-to-kill on most encounters and literally 0 options for true optimization and high dps. How does that fix the end game exactly? I get that its not a _bad_ thing, but how is that a _good_ thing?
---
I like the idea but I feel like less people would play if it's not right in their face at the main menu. Low levels might not even learn NW exists for months.
---
Mutants is: Flat 10% damage increase. 
---
I totally agree with Otaku. Bloodied is likely still going to be on top of a nerf that is just squeezing for more bullets. There does need to be a rebalance but it needs to be across board. The fact magic weapons still exist in PTS blows my mind. Scratch bloodied, everyone will be mowing down the SBQ with magic’s probably.
---
This was sad to read honestly, never seen this.
---
It's never easy losing a fur baby, they're family. I'm sorry for your loss and hope you're doing okay.
---
Now you and Phoebe go show em what you're made of!
---
She doesn't land because people stand on fences or buildings or tents, and she can't path to them. Fun fact.
---
Already have, that was my first idea when I got it!
---
I think I accidentally lowered my standing with the settlers by accepting the daily and during the encounter I chose to get bribed by the raiders, which gave me raiders standing and lowered settlers, but I think not really notecable
---
Awesome.  We have a cat named Phoebe too.
---
How exactly did you do this? Meat week doesn’t give that much xp does it?  iv got a build i wanna try but not interested in running the story again since an ounce of prevention is still broke and it takes too long to grind even with glitches.
---
They can use the power armor glitch to get in sadly. It happened to me before.
---
Mine too. I’m not moving it either...
---
I'm doing better, it'll get better day by day. 
---
And I sure will, she's already been putting in some fantastic work.
---
Could do it for 7k and you can have the other 1* with it till you find another heavy piece.
---
Just finished it today myself. I’m going to put the game aside completely and play some JRPGs or something on my PC.  I can use my free time at night to catch up on Anime on VRV.  
---
Then when the next patch comes out I can decide how much I care to run season 2.  I want the glass walls, but not enough to do this again.
---
I think the other issue is enemies aren't powerful enough, whens the mast time you've seen sometime die from a SBQ blast or even a regular a scorchbeast attack
---
I know the pain of losing a pet. I have lost many, and always they remain in my heart.
---
Im glad you got a great weapon, and little things like that mean a lot when youre suffering and just want something positive to happen.
---
This is great to know because we lost the event after like 30 seconds lol
---
This is my favorite new bug, or possible feature. Loading into a nuke zone and choosing to find a new world from the menu results in your camp getting completely destroyed.
---
No control over loading into a nuke zone other than to choose to find a different world, camp still demolished.
---
Its a bitch to craft, but it’s hella easy to find.    And like someone up there said, there are tons of people sitting on enough .308 to fund a small war, had a dude give me 5k .308 just to get it out of his stash.
---
1) it means they can individually rebalance weapons without horrifying rate of fire or damage implications that we currently have
---
2) they can rebalance mobs, armor or HP wise
---
3) One wasteland will make level scaling much more functional, meaning payoff and difficulty will scale
---
4) they can create new encounters or rewards or mechanics scaled for the broader player base, not just those who can do 3400 damage 3 times a second.
---
This is extremely specific title for this game.  Poor bot performance.
---
You don’t need unyielding for a good VATS build. All you need are the specific perks for it, and it’s already incredibly powerful with most weapons, as long as you have their correct mods equipped.
---
Bethesda could REMOVE CAPS from all the duplicated presents.  There are players with 20K plus large holiday gifts.  They need 20K?  They open 200 presents.  Need another 20K?  Open another 200 presents.  
---
This is Bethesda’s fault for not removing Caps.  They removed Scrip, but left the caos. 
---
You’ll find bags of useless plans and liquor when these players leave your camp.
---
It's every hour on the hour though. If it doesn't pop on a server, hop to the next one. Somehow I just find it hard to believe even if it didn't pop up that you couldn't just go there and participate. Hell scorched earth doesn't pop for me 90% of the time but I go there and still do the event if I see it, and this a hell of a lot easier to guage because its hourly on the hour.
---
And how do you look like in them? Does the ss helmet do anything?
---
Will this grant you access to things like the Tenderizer plan or do you have to do all the meat week stuff too to get those rewards?
---
And just because meat week is "so broken" for you, it's not so broken for everyone else. 
---
Far more people are telling you it's fine for them.
---
I have zero reason to not turn my Rifleman builds into Commandos at this point.  It will probably drive more people into Junkies or Bloodied just because they are more efficient at what they do, and people will strive for all the efficiency they can get, given the alternative.
---
While it's fine for these effects to be less overkill, I think Bethesda also missed the opportunity to shake up the meta and promote new effects.  We've been saying for almost two years now that Berserker should be comparable to Bloodied - it's objectively more dangerous to play as a Berserker.  The suggestion of having Mutant be stackable with the number of Mutations is frequent as well.  Or that Vampire should be more of a health leech.  None of this has been done, and it probably won't, in favor of just nerfing everyone.
---
For me, yes and no. A couple of sessions farming lead and steel (or even just buying at train stations) can get you quite a bit of basic 2mm. Ultracite sure helps with SBQ, but the stable crimson requires farming, too. So either way, I’m chasing mats. Haven’t quite dialed in a routine.
---
I just wanna be able to play a shotgun build and not have to have a magic weapon and infinite VATS man
---
Nerf stims then? I'm sure they could figure out a way to easily balance it.
---
Does killing the beasts give you any special rewards other than the usual meat? I'm fine with playing the drums the whole time but I feel like I have to get off and kill a few wolves to make sure.
---
I only have 3k caps 😂. I know a way to get more hopefully you’ll still have it by then
---
They do appear to still be meta, just less meta than they were but still more meta than everything else. 
---
That’s a lot of meta for one sentence.
---
bro they've been needing to fix shotguns forever and I'm with you.
---
If you need letters, I got you, I have a few extra plans for small letters.   If you want neons, I can place them for you.
---
I'm not sure that the pts rewards are the real rewards.
---
I can defiantly get it done in less than an hour. If there is one challenge that isn’t working out I’m fine skipping it. But I actually find signing in for a quick 30 min to run my daily challenges has often turned into great gaming sessions as I run an Event or two for extra gold and jumping to random camps to buy 3 cheap things has led to cool purchases. I’m pretty happy with the changes it made to my attitude about signing in.
---
Has NW been played?
---
Same. My camp was already there and has been for months. I deleted a foundation that partially blocked the drum but I’m not moving my camp.
---
I'll keep it in my stash box for ya. Holla at me when you're good.
---
Oh wow. Don't they do a 90%?
---
Speaking of backpacks, we need to be able to opt out of the visibility of them. The nuka-cola jumpsuits look great but the backpacks get in the way of the logo on the back.
---
Just have your vendor on a “top level” or up stairs everything “seems” to render downwards so the person logging in can’t just sprint to an open vendor, they would have to jump or jet pack to even get close to it and by then everything is already in game
---
Oh, so it's fine for you as well. Let those who actually had major problems make these posts.
---
There's videos out there comparing the effectiveness of things like critical banker / grim reaper's sprint with ... just having higher stats through unyielding. And the result was pretty firmly on the side of "don't bother, just use bloody mess"
---
This is the real problem
---
Honestly, half the complaints I see are about prime cuts failing. 
---
For my group, once we noticed the creatures spawn at the edge and dont move, we have adjusted and spread out.
---
Is it ideal? No. Does it work? Yes.
---
I can't comment on the other issues, as I have not experienced them.
---
Yes when I see someone purchase something that puts me over 25k caps my instant reaction is to run to my Xbox, shut it off, start again and go straight to my vending machines and store them until I spend about 10k
---
They are useful in the way of killing groups of enemies within a wider radius compared to other grenades. Their explosive radius is what makes them valuable. Also, they are cheap to make relative to how powerful they can be.
---
Edit: they are only slightly weaker to Nuka Grenades
---
Yes,  180 proof is 90 percent
---
The mirelurk kings, anglers and mirelurk hunters that spawn do most of the killing TBH
---
I had some RAD-Scorpions that weren't able to take any damage. It was awesome.
---
I do the exact same thing...🤘
---
And then 10% to be able to show to other people
---
well, in FO4 the effect WAS versus humans...
---
Yeah a couple of people as opposed to many many people over the last few days on this subreddit 
---
And maybe read the other comments first, I’ve already stated that I’ve had problems with a couple of prime events in the first few hours but that’s it 
---
Jeez why do you people get so butthurt
---
Word, Analog Duck Hunt!
---
I'm a stealth shotgun build and won't change. I expect that the endgame missions require help, and that's cool -- all the Vault 76 crew coming together to beat the SBQ the way the BOS couldn't.
---
But I do not like the heavy pull to Bloodied builds. They're ridiculous. It'd be great to have most builds fill a role, like how Enforcer can knock a Scorchbeast out of the sky temporarily (it doesn't), and for fuck's sake, make explosives useful! Why don't we have Missile Launchers be truly effective against her? They should be! Syringer should be useful somehow, not against her, but in some way. All the weapons should have some potential.
---
Back before adrenaline was broken you could get it up to 750 per shot. Uncharged shots would easily one-shot with a few adrenaline buffs going. The tube was just as bad because you could get it to one shot too but with massive blast radius.
---
Nope, I tried that and it didn’t work
---
There isn't one.  It's bugged or intentionally left out, no one knows.  Thx.
---
I killed probably 200 raiders and they are still allies.
---
This happened to me. Move it already since I don’t want anyone around my property
---
And I think once things are flatter they'll be able to play with enemies, effects, and quest rewards to make more builds viable in diverse situations.
---
I tend to spend as soon as I get past 10K. It helps a lot. 
---
I buy smiley when I get to 10K to take me back to 4K, If I get to 18 I buy a serum plan. 
---
But it’s hit and miss, I can go weeks with cheap bloodied and junkies items and have no sales, and then two weeks later someone buys all my nocturnal pool cues and maxes me out? 😅😅
---
yeah. i bought them yesterday
---
I found that plan on him at the cook out. Just took a long while of hopping.
---
I done probably 50 primal cuts already. Haven’t had any real issue with them. 
---
The issue i see is that people wait and sit in a circle for the mobs to come to them, which causes them to fail. You have to go find your meat! Be a hunter.
---
Christ on a bike it was just a discussion post, why are you getting so angry?
---
Definitely
---
Rum Smoothly. That sounds like it would be refreshing onna hot summer day.
---
Yeah but notice that everything you said there relies on future updates and tweaks, not just the nerf. Thats like saying eating cake is great for your health because you can eat an apple afterwards. 
---
If they were doing all this at once I would agree with you, but a flat out nerf with no other balancing is the cake with no apple. Please correct me if I'm wrong because I desperately want to be here haha.
---
Ohh okay. I doubt that. It will be in a sense because the plan will be sought after but sadly meat week is limited time
---
K I N G
---
Which was the fun
---
Would be great if people dropped their duplicates.
---
See, you already have that option and you availed yourself of it.
---
You play the game *your* way.  That's what's so great about Bethesda's open worlds.
---
While the damage of things like Bloodied needed to be reeled in, there are a lot of players like Op who basically want to enforce their play style on everyone else, and it's a tiresome argument.
---
iiight bet
---
That's why I'm not putting anything I can't craft/obtain easily on the Mannequins.
---
Considering the history of Mannequins and Bethesda games, I'd be annoyed if my rare gear *got up and walked away*.
---
~~It's exactly like that.  More mutations equals more damage with a cutoff at, I think, four or five mutations.~~
---
Edit: Apparently, I'm completely wrong.
---
Do a hard reset on your console / PC and clear the system cache
---
Yes, I got it from him yesterday.
---
True but it is more rare.
---
The only plans I've seen him have that I don't already know is challys feed and a protective lining. I'm sick of server hopping!
---
bloodied is really harder to play now, it's still the best, damages wise, but it's also far less convenient.
---
All in all, I like the changes, the game feel more like a game where you have to use everyhting you have to be able to survive, it's good.
---
Thank you I shall try that now
---
Pretty standard exploit. At least the wave spawning in the air/courtyard. Don't know about the 3\*.
---
just because it doesnt work for you doesnt mean its broken yo
---
can you elaborate on the Chally feed recipe. This part is the only thing I can’t seem to figure out. What does she eat and where is the recipe?
---
This isn’t new been around for awhile
---
Well, we have 4 potential options:
---
1. Nerf happens, no changes later to balance. Game will die because EVERYONE will hate it.
---
2. Nerf Happens, changes follow.
---
3. Nerf and balances happen at the same time on the PTS over a longer period of time.
---
4. They cancel the nerf and we just have the current state of play.
---
I figure you have a 75% chance of being happy. That's not bad.
---
19 year old cat, Nightmare, she of the fishhook claws and perma-tude.  I understand and would give a shoulder in a heartbeat.
---
And Mama Murgle has never given me something memorable, so you came out better than I.
---
I drew a blank with support too on compensation atoms for the two levels the bug cost me when the legendary first started, they acted as if they didn’t understand what I was saying and kept repeating we don’t have the tools to give back lost score, I kept repeating “I know I’m asking for 300 atoms to buy the 2 levels it’s cost me in lost score” It went back and forth like this until they stopped responding. It was disappointing as up until this interaction I had always found support to be really helpful and had positive experiences.
---
10mm ammo you say
---
I haven't bought the helmet because it does absolutely nothing. It looks pretty nice, just a bit bulky the BoS beret goes very nicely with it as well.
---
Unyielding, while the easiest, is not the only way to boost your stats either. And the fact that the ability to do so, and the inclusion of the VATS system, in its current form, just further proves my point of how OP it already is. Anybody with half a brain is going to do the minimum work to optimize their build, and if that includes a decent amount of VATS usage, they will work on increasing its performance. VATS should also not be an absurdly powerful mechanic out the gate, so making its base form “more viable”, should not be a thing to begin with.
---
30k or high valued weapons trades...
---
I’ve done several that I’ve killed everything, the timers kept going and nothing happened and the event failed, this was in the mire, killed the mirelurk queen and the 2 gulper spawns and nothing
---
Thank ya
---
Wait a sec.... you’ve been playing since release and have never encountered Graham in the wild and not during meat week?
---
That seems really improbable to me, only because I’ve seen him too many times to count almost, walking across the wasteland w/ Chally
---
Please read other comments before posting things I’ve answered at least twice now
---
Well I've had the autocomplete bug hit me before and and I've had two Primal Cuts events fail due to bugs... am I allowed to have an opinion about it now?
---
Same
---
Is that how it works? I mean if so I can gladly do this and safeguard my stash. I did build close to the fast travel point in an attempt to be convenient.
---
Look at it as a solution in the long run.
---
Watoga.
---
I wish folk had better luck than me. If I could share it to have people have something they can hold onto as well I'd do it in a heartbeat.
---
No one is butthurt but you. Literally, the last post you made on this sub was along the lines of "Bethesda can you release one thing that actually works".
---
Yeah if you people don’t get so bloody aggressive about it
---
I never had success with additional spotlights with normal turrets nor rocket turrets but with the heavy laser turrets. They shoot fairly well and also over a higher distance. 
---
But they often have a problem to notice an enemy on their own, thats true. Still, its something totally diffrent if im getting attacked 200 feet away from my tower - the turrets shoot and hit. I use a mobile tower camp i already placed at almost every corner of the map. Its 8 heavy laser turrets, on the first floor with two spotlights. And it holds waves at the prime meat events in cranberry bog and ash heap... not without them destroying all my vendors downstairs but, yeah. You wanna watch the lightshow as a proof? I can dm you my tag.
---
I tried doing the challenges and it definitely didn’t give me any score, so I think that it’s not the case
---
Hold up - you've never seen Grahm in-game, in *three years*?  The fuck lol That sucks
---
Yeah because it kept failing for me, that’s not fun...
---
I still maintain that VATS should get optimal use when paired with low fire rate weapons. If it's a serious OP situation you could just raise the AP cost per shot of auto weapons. And TBF with the way they seem to be straight up dropping full auto weapon damage, it's halfway there.
---
I have Never seen him in the wild before, and didn't play meat week last year.
---
Don't you mean... a 76% chance?
---
lol sorry I had to. Yeah I feel you. The late-game definitely needs a change, I'm just skeptical on how they are going to go about it. If the past is any indictaor, I'm guessing they will do something like a major nerf with few options, everyone will hate it for a week or two, then they'll slowly release patches that remake other viable builds over a month or two (I guess option 2).
---
That's my guess but I really hope they get it right on the first try haha.
---
It's like golf - the lower the better? Right?
---
*Cries in Xbox One*
---
Disagree, let them run the new change on live servers for awhile to make sure it works as intended before making other changes. No hurry.
---
I'm sure those you have lost loved you dearly. The little things are what make up a larger, greater, whole in the end.
---
I had a medics minigun too with over 200 fire rate. I guess it’s been debunked as a magic weapon :(
---
Nice concept art.
---
"Realizing that endgame was just acquiring an unyielding set, a bloodied weapon, and changing their build to stealth commando. Realizing that they had to stack all the damage perks and tweak their build to do so. Realizing the perk card system and all of it's flexibility didn't matter, knowing 90% of legendaries didn't matter. Feeling like everything special they'd enjoyed so far was meaningless unless they could jump around in stealth and 1 shot 99% of enemies."
---
Ok this part if your post is extremely dumb. You DO know that post nerf, bloodied stealth commando is even MORE prevalent? It STILL has the most damage boosts, except it's just additive instead of multiplicative. Plus the fact that 2.5x sneak attack damage is HUGE.
---
Post nerf, there is even more emphasis on the efficiency of stealth commando. The difference is, current version has it to where other builds can still 1 shot shit. In other words, there's a soft threshold now where damage past a certain number still gets you insanely fast TTK. After the update, there will be even more emphasis on min/maxing damage as nothing one shots higher level enemies anymore.
---
Also, it's almost as if people forget what makes bloodied bloodied. The difference between junkies and bloodied isn't 50% vs. 80%. That's assuming every Junkies build is full hp. A bloodied build revolves around the adrenal reaction mutation and people seem to forget that.
---
I've never encountered him in the wild before, and didn't participate in meat week last year.
---
Is it just needing bloodied or is it a Carpet bomb of nerfs?
---
Splish,splash, ur opinion is trash
---
Honestly they have been improving the game, slowly, since I started playing it, right in the wake of the TSE nerf. Despite Bethesda being ... Bethesda, I actually have some faith.
---
HAVE SOME GOD DAMNED FAITH ARTHUR.
---
I’m not butthurt at all 🤣 I don’t feel the need to argue on posts that aren’t mine and could easily just scroll past if I disagree 🤣
---
Are you on Xbox, because i have all plans i could craft you the mods
---
Happy Birthday
---
Maybe, if the event wasn't 30 minutes long.
---
The problem with the SBQ, as her recent lack of landing and cripples shows, is that she really doesn't have a whole lot up her sleeve.  It's only a handful of different attacks, and it doesn't make for a particularly interesting battle.  She can also behave like the world's least interested final boss, flying in lazy circles all around Prime.
---
Got a external ssd hard drive put the game on it runs better and faster cost 100$ but is so worth it
---
I have moved my camp because of this.
---
You literally answered your own question.
---
“New games won’t make the cut”
---
So regardless if another game had the “best” battlepass, you’d never try it to know.
---
Additionally, you make it sounds as if you’re addicted to it like crack. Just take a break if it’s that bad.
---
Bloodied is the highest damage but it's no longer so high that everyone will want to be bloodied if they start introducing more Earl-style mechanics that penalize low health builds.
---
No. U will give ur life to him. If Todd's blessings send him after me I would accept my death
---
Yeah and we all know how *that* one ended haha. Yeah I've been playing on and off since friggin' beta and they seem to have the ready, fire, aim type attitude when it comes to nerfs like this but they do eventually land on a decent working setup.
---
That would make it less than useless. Other builds let you do that much damage at full health. Hell, TS lets you do 25% more and you don’t even have to build into it.
---
I stopped selling ammo just to spite you, you one ammo buying piece of tra... lol just kidding. About the trash not the ammo! 
---
I do try and jump to a couple of camps to buy something at least a little bit interesting and if nothing else I buy 100 ammo.. I guess I’m just community-minded like that
---
What card game?
---
I dont think it will be a problem. I see it as more a way to keep people already playing. The rewards don't really have to compete, just be good. Sometimes i deal with FOMO, but then: like the apex S6 rewards, for the first time, are not that cool to me but I still play, I just dont pay attention to the pass. You know?
---
For me, married with a full time job, I play 76, Apex Legends, and MtGA and do just fine with the passes.
---
That said, too many people treat it like a job and burn themselves out (which I've been saying a lot lately in this sub). A season pass is great, but its never necessary and people should never let themselves feel like they are working for it instead of having fun (especially the free ones.) THAT is going to be what turns it into a problem later on.
---
It’s not a bug, someone’s abusing a glitch. Pisses me off no end, I like running around with my shotgun
---
It's still good to farm xp even though it fails half the time.
---
Reddit is a fickle bitch sometimes, I asked the same thing like 6 months ago and basically got Cap-slut-shamed for not managing my caps etc. 48% upvoted with a 0 total score.
---
My camp on cow lake has been there for months. Had no idea primal cuts spawns right across the lake. Feel free to use all that's available but I'm not moving  just for a week long event
---
In what universe do you live in is "bloodied a little better than junkies"? Junkies build are usually full health. It is counter productive to go low health junkies.
---
Did you forget adrenal reaction serum exists?
---
I believe the problem is more related to burrowing critters that stay down due to glitch.  Creatures such as mole rats and radscorpions
---
I’m really curious what the overlap of “People who are upset that they don’t get to tag a legendary” and “People who want a higher daily scrip limit” is.
---
I don't really see it as a means to help myself, as much as help others.  Especially since I'm done with the Legendary Run, the most beneficial thing I can do for them is launch nukes and make sure they have successful Queen and Earle battles.
---
I've long since stopped caring about what the Queen actually drops.  A good quarter of the time, I even forget to loot her.
---
But I know that selflessness isn't a common trait, and a lot of people melt the Queen just to show off.  And no one is impressed.  Believe me.
---
I answered your reply to my comment yo..
---
nobody forced you to reply to me.. 
---
If youre unhappy with the content of my posts Id like to remind you there is a blocking function on this site that you might enjoy.. Have A Nice Day
---
I was able to outheal the tenderiser, fortunately. Then I jumped server because I couldn’t trade with him and I wanted to save my decontamination shower. Which was destroyed by explosive bait today after some cunt stole my chems from the locked raider collectron.
---
Once someone else launches you'll be able to enter for the first few minutes. Go all the way down (there's only one tunnel) and wait for the debris to fall down the shaft. You'll be able to do the event for the first time.
---
They time gated the entrance to A Colossal Problem.
---
If you're on PC, I'll happily take you on a Silo run.
---
Trust me this wont stop them its not just this game but the gaming comunity is full of selfish people just have to deal with it and move on
---
Which new event?
---
I took virtually all my points out of luck.
---
Only leaving starched Genes for my mutations.
---
VATS bloodied 50 Cal Sniper  build, maxed out Rifleman = 500 Basic damage x 2 Covert operative = 1000,Mr sandman for Night =. 1100 per shot.
---
I was wasting a lot of points in luck better used elsewhere.
---
Just my opinion.
---
For the Queen my Bloodied Mini-gun absolutely trashes her.And still does i was playing today.
---
Yupppp. And the vendor foot traffic is awesome for me.
---
Watoga
---
A fallacy overlap you got there bro
---
Yup. Vats just isn't worth it except as a means of autohitting with full auto bloodied guns. Hopefully that changes.
---
I’m with u here never worked once so far and from what it seems it’s broken for a majority of ppl don’t listen to these fools.
---
We have a PTS now, I think it's gonna go differently. Less Dutch, more Hosea.
---
Me and souki the shredding vampires FFR minigun will pour one out for you. 
---
Souki was a deranged but ultimately wholesome shitzu
---
I think a Deathclaw queen event would be more fun, especially if there was some kind of deathclaw instance where you could find more flavors of deathclaws.
---
Sneak isn’t going to be efficient because of all the spawning wendigos
---
I avoid junk since trap kills are still a thing
---
If your target is already in combat, you lose most of your damage. If you can, try and target creatures furthest from your teammates.
---
Exactly, hopefully I can clear some frickin stash space lol.
---
Hopefully not. These events become like voluntary repetitive chores the longer they run.
---
I don't mind the added week later, two straight, like Fasnaught, was a little too long.
---
Here's a score calculator: https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html
---
Thank you 😊
---
&gt;Shouldn't end game be challenging with a real chance of failure?
---
Well, it should also have a "real chance" of a nice reward.  I don't see that coming, do you?
---
Once you get to the point where there's no plans, serum recipes, etc. to buy Caps add up real quick. You're poor until you're not. Then caps become pointless and just another inventory management chore.
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
That was the winner thank you very much
---
Hope they drop Deathclaw Hide!
---
Make Deathclaws Great Again
---
Suit only, no helmet. Which is weak.
---
Nope, thats junkies
---
That's an often requested feature, I'm almost certain we'll get it at some point ... on the other hand: when you want to &amp; can hide your backpack, you probably buy less ATX backpack skins so idk.
---
Yep. 3 out if the last 4 events for me gave failed. Good times, good times.
---
Unless everyone does a gentleman’s agreement to use 10mm pistols. It’s never going to happen. People are selfish and feel entitled. IMHO BGSA should have learned from the past events and made killing the legendary an optional thing. And given everyone that is in the event a legendary drop in the event completion.
---
Everything is made in China
---
I do it all the time. 1 shotgun shell, 1 shotgun shell...gimme them all now.
---
That’s how it look when I spawn in to may camp after a fast travel and it rendered down and I never had that problem again oh and just a tip if you didn’t already know ppl can still buy and use your vendor without power
---
Haha. I actually added ammo to my vender so others could do this.  Though I put a captured frog in there for 1 cap for fun.  I will spend caps for something worthless if it's an impressive camp.
---
Before meat piles.
---
Again, this statement has already been answered, But since you can’t be bothered to read I’ll repeat: I’ve had minimal problems with it myself, only a few primal cuts failing in the first few hours, however this subreddit has been plagued with many many complaints since the event launched 
---
Yeah I’m aware I’m just not petty enough to block comments...
---
Primal Cuts is about quick kills. Legendaries are rare, but still should be shared if there's time.
---
That's a cool idea
---
Aye, I have been bitten by this bug quiet often.  I would consider doing away with my turrets all together if I didn't have a military outpost theme to my camp.  :-/
---
I’ve had a prime cuts fail with just me, in the mire with the queen and the 2 gulper spawns being killed and the timer still running and the event failing, but yeah there are a lot of problems with mobs running away apparently
---
Glad it worked ^_^
---
I'm down with anything that gives those majestic creatures the deadly power they should have
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I agree.
---
Not sure why some are reporting such huge changes in damage.
---
Only thing i have noticed, is the ghouls in Guided Meditation are a bit tougher to kill.
---
And insane levels of Scorched spawning at the Queen during,and after event,making it a bit more challenging.
---
We need sniper turrets
---
Thank you 🙏🏻🤣
---
Energy weapons saw a massive nerf, unless it's a bug/mistake.
---
Someone showed the difference on a laser from 200 something down to like 60.
---
You keep ignoring his main point which is that they haven’t changed bloodied builds at all, they’ve nerfed all damage. Quit trying to get around that and actually address the point.
---
I hear your point. For some, like me, I just check what the effects are. If it's heavy I'll sell it to NPC or just drop it. 
---
So it's worth it to tag to check effects to see if you got a god roll, even if you are at scrip limit, make sense?
---
I go for the easy treasure notes
---
not necessary, they would just need to remove aid stacking.  If that's not enough then make it like nw where damage interrupts the heal over time.
---
But yeah I don't mean this as an attack or anything but people are always chiming in with these pvp suggestions who just simply don't pvp enough in adventure mode to be qualified to comment.
---
I'd be fine with a no legendary survival mode but there's more to balancing pvp in this game than just removing everything people think is op like legendaries and stealthboys.  
---
it's actually pretty balanced as it sits today and could be really well balanced with some minor changes.  the main problem is more accessibility of pvp gear than anything else.
---
Yeah, steel dawn is parch 22 in september.
---
You're welcome
---
Wow so that been a bug since launch? Hardly surprising. I just scrapped my shielded one because it looked horrible with some outfits. Good to know it's on "never going to be fixed" pile then.
---
I have never once had it fail in the cranberry bog?
---
Sounds like the same problem with all hp increasing items. Want to have some fun as bloodied? Pop a psychobuff and run in to a nuke zone or the mines in Rad Rumble. 
---
You become immortal to rads. Your hp just stops at about 30 something hit points no matter how many rads you take. Getting hit will increase the rads until you die, and you cannot restore lost health with food or stims. But Medic and Vampire effects will magically erase those rads back to the max health. 
---
Once the psychobuff wears off you are stuck at 999 rads until either you die or pop another psychobuff. And if you take more psychobuff to extend the effect, you just drop dead.
---
There are a lot of things that would be much better with simple little added details like that. Details that show mutations, effects on armor, being intoxicated/high, anything like that would be a huge improvement.
---
In regards to catering it towards semi-auto weapons, I certainly agree with you. But overall I see VATS as a holdover from the older games, and the horribly antiquated engine they still keep held together with duct tape, and virgin sacrifices.
---
Whatever.  I think it’s the dumbest thing to complain about.  Go legendary hunting if you want legendaries, don’t expect to get Them at events with tons of people, even a handful of people. 
---
Personally I think they should stop legendary tagging, whichever team does the most damage gets the legendaries.  It doesn’t make sense for an enemy to drop 4+ items just because people did a small bit of damage
---
The biggest challenge with this is if there is less than 30 seconds on the clock and you have to take out the Alpha *AND* the ads. Otherwise, no meat for you!
---
Still baffles me they didn’t make a legendary card that reduces rifle weight. It would be in high demand.
---
Have to be engaged in pvp first, just pick lock the door if you want in lol
---
Add me and I can help out XxQuarantinaxX
---
Ok? Well done?
---
Some real d*cks on this game
---
Thank you! I’m shocked you didn’t get downvoted into oblivion for your reasonable opinion. 
---
I just want to add on that the end game needs a lot more, this is a positive change but the game needs something to do. The same handful of events are no longer enjoyable, there are no real big dungeons or raids to do, since looting is entirely centered around legendaries, nearly EVERY item you pick up is useless, sure I can always use an extra stimpack for my collection and another piece of copper to add to my thousands is cool I guess, but overall, the fact is, there is nothing to do, nothing of value to loot, and at this point, for me, no point in playing. The legendary run is just tedious chores, the events have gone stale long ago, loot is underwhelming and useless, there are too many useless legendary effects and so once you beat the story there is literally nothing left. The game desperately needs raids or something like that that provide very good rewards, the game is years old now, it’s time to increase the chances of getting the legendary you want from the 0.001% chance it is now. Trading is fucked bc of duping, legacies and brutal RNG so that’s basically pointless, if you didn’t get a duped legacy or luck out and get a 0.001% chance B/E/FFR fixer/HM/plasma/tesla then you can’t get anything worth anything, it’s about time they gave you a way to actually try to get the legendary you want. An update every 6 months that takes a week at most to 100% is not going to retain players’ interest. I’m back to playing GTA bc while that game is also incredibly outdated and tedious, it is somehow LESS outdated and tedious than this game has become. At least that game has hundreds of missions and activities, 76 has like 6 events/missions worth doing and they’re boring now.
---
Probably.
---
Has anyone ever dropped more than a 1 Star legendary for completion? Done 12+ events now and all I get is one star scrip fodder.

I agree wholeheartedly, this nerf is necessary for stainable content, though it needs some heavy tweaking. I also think some things on the side of enemies need a rebalance, sure I can currently four or five shot a level 90 sentry bot with my axe I don't even have addictions currently to make it most effective and that's a little absurd, but I also think that some level 50 Mr gustie with a wild hair up his ass shouldn't be able to tear my level 91 self to ribbons with two shot when I'm in full T-51 or T-60, and some Random level 60 charred ghoul shouldn't be able to single handedly rip it's way thru my whole camp and two shot me when I'm in full marine armor, legendary effects regardless.
---
Yeah that one I don't understand. The only thing I can think of is that this is their way of seeing what happens to explosive legacy weapons. Because right now explosive on the PTS is a solid way to boost damage, and legacies have weird math.
---
Dang cause he has a coded door behind that
---
I mean, the dataminers have handed to them, on a silver platter, where the bug appears to happen.  It centers on a code change that was intended to fix the Furious effect, which was broken a few patches back (and also when this started happening).  It even ropes in that "15% less damage while blocking" Armor effect which, until you actually see it, seems like an inexplicable cause of the magic effect.
---
Of course knowing about it and fixing it are two different stories, but I don't think we've even seen Bethesda publicly *acknowledge* this this issue, even in the PTS.  And frankly, just them saying "Yes, this is an exploit, and we're aiming to fix it" would be a nice wake-up call for both the RL money traders who peddle this gear, along with those who report the most egregious players using it.
---
I've seen the Radtoads spawn far and Honeybeasts. People don't run forward either.
---
I have issues in workshops with Radscorpions a lot so that makes sense. I haven't come across those in Primal Cuts though.
---
Goddamn mole rats.
---
My camp is messy. But oh boy am I messy irl
---
Probably after providing your bank account number and PIN so they can deposit the atoms.
---
I don't carry junk on me BUT if i happen to have junk on me it's usually a small amount and if anything looks odd i either avoid it or just go for it.
---
I’m guessing you are referring to the Primal Cuts event where you can gain lots of XP killing enemies? (You can also boost your XP by using the Inspirational perk in a building group, eating cranberry relish, resting at your camp and probably lots of other stuff as well)
---
Yeah not too sure you're gonna be able to get in lol
---
Screw this event! Im going back to watching SG-1. "Jaffa Kree!"
---
I'd hazard a guess that like myself the majority of people who have immaculate and organized camps do so because of OCD, and thus I'd say that there irl environment is just as immaculate.
---
Have you seen the barbarians that just place stuff all over the place? Hoarders irl
---
Where can I see the changes in pts like the change notes?
---
When you count Unyielding, which is part of most bloodied builds, it will always be vastly superior. There is far too much synergy for Low Health to not blow everything out of the water. The need to add perks that have synergy with other builds if they want to actually impact the meta share Bloodied has. 
---
DoTs are negligible. A decent amount of people already run fireproof, and its easy to have a piece or two of Poison Res armor. Or, when the patch hits, just pick up Rank 1 of Funky Duds. Essentially all AoE is either poison, fire or explosive. Which is covered by Poison Res and Fireproof.
---
Like, the damage changes in no way makes the game more balanced lol. Its the same meta, the only difference is that melee got knocked down a lot, and even then it's still more powerful than 90% of builds.
---
I've never used a bloodied weapon...
---
Your friends gave up because the game sucks 🤣
---
Sounds udderly fantastic
---
press alt and f4 together
---
I made my vendors on a power switch so i can turn the switch off when i don’t want my camp visible
---
I feel like it is what it's been since Fallout 4, a way to play if you don't have great gunplay skills. Spend some points in luck, you don't have to aim.
---
Yep, been happening to me too. Scared the shit out of me when a combat shotgun spawned right in front of me at eye level.
---
Right now, it's grinding, but do the Meat Week events, they pop quickly and reward exp and loot.
---
I think, perhaps a possibly better way to handle the Legendary Runs (This is only season 1) is to instead only do weekly and increase each tasks score reward, that way it's feel less grindy and all rushed. Also, most of the rewards a meh. Also bring back atoms for daily.
---
Doubt this will happen though.
---
Edit: A word
---
it's not the problem with the new system but pistols being under powered, increasing base damage of pistols fixes this issue, increasing damage to everything causes the situation we have now your optimised build is doing ok when other builds evaporate bosses with similar optimisation
---
Fully agree, same on the SBQ when trying to find the spawn icon while there are already a shit ton of people there.
---
the boss at the end of primal is not more than 1\*, you can’t get a god roll with 1\*.  It’s basically 3/5 scrip people are complaining about
---
I hear you. I've gotten in the habit of carrying a m79 grenade launcher specifically for this event when that glitch is being used so that I can tag the entire group of scorched with a single shot. It has done wonders on my blood pressure ;)
---
same i beat it after 2 weeks because of that
---
“Just take a break if it’s that bad” - except I’m addicted to it like crack lol
---
It doesn't matter if they don't fit in, it's still a paint
---
Hmm. we ditched 1300 of our explosive bait cause we thought it was patched. O.o
---
I was at an event and someone's camp rezzed in around us. That must have been fun for him....why are there 3 dead rad toads in my kitchen?
---
Newbie Question: Is it an actual backpack, or a skin for an existing backpack?
---
Or hasn't been three years has it?
---
great now im gonna have an even worse time at level 20
---
I feel your pain. Lol
---
There is no endgame period - that's the problem and the nerfs do nothing to change that.  A collosal problem is a collosal whoop of nothing other than a stupid boss fight with no strategy and making it last longer doesn't make the fight any better.  30 seconds or 30 minutes - just pump rounds in and such - is not satisfying endgame content.
---
The legendary run and the lack of meaningful endgame content have all caused many long time players and holdouts to stop playing.  No one even cares these nerfs are coming or not anymore - there is NO satisfying endgame content left.  Making items non tradable instead of fixing duping for good has totally killed endgame trading anyways so no one even cares about legendaries anymore - its all stupid RNG utter BS.
---
76 is done now unless Bethesda starts wising up.
---
Sounds mooooovelous.
---
My only issue with unyielding is the int bonus because it penalizes through EXP non unyielding wearers. Not so sure it'll be as dominant as you seem to think it will be.
---
&gt; Why don't we have Missile Launchers be truly effective against her? 
---
Agreed.  The first time I saw a scorchbeast I thought "man I'm gonna need a missile launcher to kill that thing!"  Jokes on me, that is the worst weapon for the job.  Scorchbeasts shouldn't have explosive resistance, they should be extra vulnerable to them!  There is a reason people use rockets and missiles against tanks and aircraft!
---
The only downside for explosive weapons should be that they are heavy and the ammo is expensive.  Other than that they should be highly effective against everything (like literally every other game with explosive weapons...).  In any other game you'd be ecstatic to find a rocket launcher, except this one.
---
I miss the days when destroying CAMPs was a thing.
---
Right now it's all found in videos, discords, people making reports from PTS.
---
Another was a  Male Player with a pot Belly who wondered in to my Camp.
---
Stripped down to his Underpants.
---
Lay on the Bed and started flashing Love Heart Emojis.
---
I love to see more of Maryland like Baltimore, Annapolis, or my hometown of Greenbelt
---
It sucks but until Bethesda improves just get over it
---
I already hate my human boss. Why would I want another?
---
Hearthstone, but yes yours is the view I hope to mature into. I’m guessing it’ll come soon. I’m close to not trying to run season 2 as hard
---
🎼There was never a man like my JAHNEEEE!!! 🎵🎶 lol
---
The dude has 14 steel extractors
---
Best way to learn is to just go ahead and see for urself
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvK6KsLkPUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvK6KsLkPUs)
---
There's the door, man. No one is forcing you to play.
---
If this event didn't have so many weird issues with it, and if it was even slightly longer, I would be with you on this. I've already been in a couple of these that just failed because we didn't kill everything in time. 
---
In something like Uranium Fever, I always try to tag and wave. But in Prime Cuts, gotta get them all quickly - so unless you **know** all the other creatures are already dead, and you **know** you have some time, this just isn't going to happen. I was in one and I saw "Legendary has mutated" and I didn't stop what I was doing to see if I could tag it - I just kept killing what I was dealing with because I knew time was of the essence.
---
thx!
---
Yes but people can still buy from the machine if they find your camp and the machine.
---
I noticed that a few days ago. Was putting a rack up and it was floating away from the wall. I think they're trying to fix the problem where some things end up part-way inside a wall. I know that was a problem with the legendary run reward poster.
---
There is no reason everyone can not get a hit on the final enemy. And why do people need to bring their damn tents right in the middle of the event? Like really? Afraid your gonna loose all those screwdrivers and baby bottles if you can’t scrap it when it is complete?
---
But in this game ive seen just a few selfish ppl.
---
I’d argue the people you brought into the game quit, because they started playing the game &amp; probably realized they never actually needed to pick it up on the first place
---
I'd argue that they specifically told me what upset them.
---
IMO... enemy scaling in this game is broken. Game seems really easy in the low levels regardless of weapon choice or perks... then around 20-30 the game gets really hard unless you have invested heavily in damage perks (or unless you are melee, with lots of strength). I personally ended up rolling a new character because I messed my first one up too badly. 
---
Soooo... the only advise I can give is to max out all perks you can that add damage with your chosen weapon.
---
Yup I’m already there - but go ahead with the attitude cause the game is dead without players anyways.
---
I think he meant bloodied without adrenal reaction, Just like berserker and junkies 
---
So +100% damage is still good
---
Camp is clean and ordered, personal environment is tidy 90 percent of the time unless I am working on a project or have major distractions.
---
I’d argue they just didn’t want you to feel bad they wouldn’t be playing this game with you anymore
---
I saw a camp that had stuff strewn all over the place, just covering like 90% of the open space inside their house. There was still a clear path through it all and it was really set up in a clever way. Reminded me a lot of a fun house.
---
Sure Jan
---
Delete the game lol at least then you have to wait to play it
---
I've been seeing 1, 1, then (rest of stack) more lately, but I like the 1-1-1 people just as much because that ticks it off for me, too.
---
It's not though. You might want it to be dead but it just isn't.
---
Once the acid resistance card comes out those arent gonna kill anybody either
---
My names Karen you ass
---
...sure you don't mean the ammo machine from the blueprint exploit?
---
No issue, that is how the event works.
---
Nor should it, if someone invests an epic perk card into it. That's a big investment with a high cost.
---
You left some creatures alive.  in the savage divide there are always some honey beasts lurking.
---
It’s because I’m low level again. I’m constantly being picked on. Workshops, my locks... They wouldn’t dare if I was a high level. It’s unbearable knowing I can’t switch to my main and totally destroy their asses.
---
Looking at your tag I am not surprise.  The Brotherhood once again doing what ever they want heedless of law and order.
---
Im just a tanky melee build that wants some legendary kills from time to time yknow :(
---
Just pointing out a lack of dangerous creatures in the wastes
---
Lmao I’ve seen dozens and hundred of people quit and stop playing.  You have no clue how much time and people I’ve played with in game.  Kid yourself that it doesn’t matter - your 3 friends are a drop in it he bucket compared to what I’ve seen.
---
It’s not a bad mode it’s just the XP distribution is wack and gives u little indent I’ve to kill given that surviving longer gives more XP than a kill. Also the spawn in delays that give other players that have a high end pc a advantage is a little unfair. As I hate when I done in and everything’s already looted in a 100m range 😂. But honestly I find it very enjoyable it’s just frustrating with hackers and the low XP yield.
---
Interesting, haven't seen this one yet luckily. I dont take a lot of chems though.
---
Your pun behooves me to contribute.
---
Agreed, I want more, more challenge. I think they thought floaters would be but ... I can pop them in one shot at 40 yards so uh. Nope.
---
I'd say im OCD. If im doing a project or task, i need it to be perfect. So if im doing a junk themed camp, then I'll be damn sure to place everything in the perfect spot even though its just junk
---
Well played. You are truly Karen.
---
Some just like to complain or farm some karma with a copy/paste 'suggestion'. A lot of others just lurk the subreddit for announcements &amp; news.
---
I don't let myself go above 20k for this reason.
---
You mean at the cook out?
---
I don't care about it at all. All I wanted was the ammo converter, the rest is just a bonus at this point.
---
I can tell you from experience that turrets are actually unbelievably accurate... when targeting player characters. I’ve been sniped by a wall of bullets coming all the way from the opposite border of a workshop. The accuracy’s just turned down when they’re targeting invading creatures for whatever reason.
---
Oh man you are clueless indeed - standing on fences isn’t the problem but stun locking her with stagger causes the queen to not land.  Shows how much you know about the game.
---
Omg it’s like workshop defense all over again isn’t it
---
I see the effort and money the devs are clearly putting into the game, plus number estimates thrown around by youtubers trying to do research into active player base (estimate was 500,000-1,000,000), and it just doesn't match your anecdotal, butthurt, salty, world-weary bullshit answer. So, go play something else. That community will be so blessed to have you.
---
Besides the loot (meat and junk), they give you a decent amount of xp the daily level for score
---
Meat Week provides a ton of scrip even if you never tag a single legendary during a Primal Cuts event (on the chance there even is one, because they aren't guaranteed). My biggest Meat Week concern is trying to manage all the scrip you get from it.
---
Damn, I guess I’m the weird one then.   My camp is neat and tidy (not as fresh as some of y’alls though) even have a labeled spot for dropping unwanted stuff, but irl my game room is a sty.  I like to call it organized chaos because I know where everything is, but in reality it’s just a big mess.
---
Just nerfing everything across the board as they have done is a lazy, inexperienced solution to a larger problem that is a lack of game balance. Furthermore it’s not even working properly. You can try to justify it all you want to but at the end of the day they are putting duct tape over a hole and calling it game balance. Just like their “Graphic Update” for Wastelanders where they just turned up the shiny/reflection light effect and called it a day. I don’t know if BGS Austin is understaffed, dealing with impossible deadlines, can’t work around the engine/coding limitations, or just inexperienced but this is one more novice solution to an issue that will probably cause more problems than it solves making more builds further irrelevant and useless than before.
---
Just going off of what I heard from Captainoob. But I can see that you're out for blood so, whatever man.
---
Is it fucked up that when faced with some of the silliness of the season grind challenge I said fuck it im an adult and just paid to keep ahead/finish the thing for the rewards? All of the new and fun camp stuff was always the draw for me , and half the time they are just selling in the atom store anyway.
---
The sad part is that there is even a need to do this.
---
So no chance of 3 star drops at all?
---
Yea sadly you only can get one stars from this event , it's not like fasnacht
---
That was the original ban line. If you accrued more than 100k of anything in 30 days it would flag you way back when. They have a new one now, but I don’t know how it works.
---
Their only effort is monetization and the atom shop and getting you to play up for 1st.  Go ahead be sheep - trust me you’ll tell me someday I’m right in time.
---
There in one in the bundle for the regular atomic shop one.
---
Thats actually a really good idea!
---
Yeah, the nerf is fucking over people who've put work and hours into their build.
---
Correct. 1* only.
---
Yeah there all steel extractors practically inside a Fort Knox fortress
---
how do you spend caps on bullion?
---
Securing the technology inside
---
Upvoted.  For the cry babies out there, I solo this event with 2 mins to spare.  The only reason you fail is because either some idiot dragged the mob away from the event or you are sat on the barrel waiting for the mob to come to you.  Strap on a gauntlet and have some fun. 👊
---
Awesome thanks for the invite, I’ve joined and done the thing to verify myself 😁
---
That's true you can drive an hour into OH from WV and it looks the same
---
Oh i don't bother looking at stars before tapping, usually I notice legendariws with their flashy color first.
---
But yeah a constant 1 star isn't what I'm looking for. Some people are trying to rush the event though to get to next primal, so that may be it.
---
You're a real sourpuss.
---
This! When we could be 100% sure that in the next 3 months a rebelance comes I would be totally for the nerf but right now I think it's only one more way to make the game more grindy.
---
I'm all for bloodied and junkies being hit but I tried making a pistol build and they kinda suck, shotguns have the hp rub band bug and I've heard bows suck so hopefully they buff other stuff to the level of rifles and lmgs
---
Swarms of baby death claws!
---
Edit: like raptors but not
---
So you listen to some Youtuber and don’t even verify anything.  I guess that’s the typical 76 player that wants to believe in lies.
---
Thanks for clearing that up, thought the RNG gods hated me but now I forgive them
---
This is how I feel too but given the responses in this thread if there's even a week where someone's preferred weapon isn't exactly to their liking, the streets will run with tears
---
I reached 100 on the Legendary run on 18th August and I didn't spend a single atom to do it. The legendary run gave me a great incentive to play the game and I enjoyed getting all the challenges each day.
---
That could be a really fun like long event if they could track how many babies made it out and then let them mature into adults. Now boom you got a 100+ deathclaws running around in the wasteland just having a party.
---
I mostly agree, but I've played since beta and my bloodied stealth range attack build has never been a queen killer. Even with the card stacks and a bloodied rifle, I still can't solo the queen. Not everyone who has been playing all this time has gotten god level weapons, no matter how many hundred (probably thousand at this point) legendaries we've traded in for script to hopefully get one from the legendary vendor. I wonder if SBQ fights will actually be completed now or if it'll just be an event where you burn through all your ammo just to have the time run out.
---
One level 0 is white springs hotel manager office. In the lobby down a short hall to the right.
---
One day u should
---
Sometimes I don’t have a choice. 20 seconds, 3 enemies, I just keep shooting. When I have a choice I just tag it and get it low and run.
---
Agreed on shotguns and especially pistols. RIP my pistol character :( they need some love.
---
Unfortunately, magic is the only thing keeping shotguns even partially usable as is.
---
It was
---
A fix that breaks others.
---
Youch.  I pushed mine close to a wall to display my new tenderiser
---
It's actually been done in the most well thought out way possible, and the change was absolutely fair as the principle of it affects all builds "equally", the only difference being the amount of boosts one is able to stack. This way future content can be properly balanced against everyone. (EDIT: It should also be noted that they didn't say the change was final, but on the contrary explicitly said it was a first step.)
---
Of course, as I noted earlier in another tread, the damage overhaul is far from complete and shouldn't ship to live servers until a number of other things are addressed, but stricly speaking the issue with hacked weapons, magic weapons and legacies is another question entirely, and their existence shouldn't preclude doing something against an unrelated problem.
---
Obviously things are not black and white, and these glitched weapons also fall in the category of things that need to be addressed very soon, preferably before the damage overhaul goes live.
---
It’s all about clock management, so agree to disagree on this one. I ain’t easing off the trigger and risking event fail, and I don’t think anyone else should be either. This isn’t like Uranium Fever where there’s time for everyone to tickle damage the legendaries. Get in, slaughter everything, and on to the next.
---
Instead of weapon nerfing, make some enemies upto level 200
---
He’s been bugged for 2 weeks for me.
---
Gaming is a great escape from real life for those who suffer within their own minds, myself included. The community spirit is great. Stay strong, every grey cloud that passes reveals more glorious blue sky and sunshine :)
---
Thanks! 2 to go
---
I suspect people will down the queen just fine, and they can tune difficulty if people struggle. But as it is, launching the nuke takes 3-10x as long as killing the queen.
---
&gt;I would not be opposed to them drastically redesigning the whole "perk" system along with legendaries.
---
They should've used the Fallout 4 method of picking your special at the start of the game.
---
Level 451 PC, never played bloody and never will.  Have I been doing it wrong?  I've gotten a ton of entertainment hours for little investment.
---
Just find an object inside the walls to interact with (a chair, workbench) or use photomode to glitch
---
Nothing personal really - you’ll realize that most people that complain about the game wants it to do well - I don’t care about the nerfs but it will not make a difference.
---
If they don’t fix the endgame because it doesn’t exist then people will always reach a point where they leave anyways.
---
One wasteland is artificially another way Bethesda is trying to slow down progress so new players don’t exhaust the game so quickly.
---
I got a quad,explode 44 mag and it's still only 112 dmg like why do they suck so much
---
Could the train set could be both ATX and SCORE?  After all there's two versions of the shooting game, wooden here and the metal one that's a reward next season, so it could stand that there's two however different versions of the train set.
---
Oh ok. But he was pretty  low level with meh gear so idk....
---
Sounds like you're doing just fine :) my most fun is power armor heavy guns. I actually dislike feeling the need to use bloodied/unyielding to stay competitive.
---
No problem. I think you can server hop and do it two more times.
---
And 70-80 lbs of stash space.  Assuming that the static frame is the display.
---
There is an unmarked location in the forest full of safes. The train yard above whitesprings also has a safe room full of them.
---
It should be at least 50. I think 100 is good, but Bethesda would never do that.
---
Why do you think Bethesda really care, it was the same in previous Meat Weeks.
---
Mostly because they cost a ton of perk cards in agility, which means you can't also max out all the other agility perks that are so powerful. That and most gunslinger guns aren't silenced, meaning you don't get that sneak attack multiplier.
---
&gt; I am sure (ok I hope lol) Bethesda read all the comments about the grinding and will readjust next season.
---
Are you kidding me? I bet seeing that we still grind the game while not having fun will surely bring out their happy face. We're at the exact point they want us to be, somewhat liking the game but trigger happy to buy levels because we also somewhat hate the grind. The FOMO is strong with this one...
---
I did my chores and I'm right besides Zorbo, don't know if I'll finish. Let's see how the next season rewards will be and if they're not really, really good I might just say fuck em. And if Cyberpunk drops I might also say fuck em (the latter one is much more likely I presume).
---
If you make the run to Flatwoods you can get at least two levels out of a mule, for each of the quests learning to boil water and then cook a steak.
---
Wish we could disable vendors remotely
---
Oh I got you sorry. That is silly
---
I just did one where they didn't move from spawn. Except for one, it made a break for it. I had to chase it down. Still ended up failing the event, one must have wandered off the radar.
---
Last year all the drops were 1* combat armor I believe. So at least we have a little more variety in the worthless 1* garbage we get since a Bloodied Fixer could have some value even as a 1* if you were so lucky.
---
No, they aren't, who told you that?
---
My 4 "magic" shotguns still tear arse on PTS lol
---
Or the vendors that say like '31 weapons and 12 armor' and they are all like pipe pistols, asylum uniform white etc.
---
I get bi with a little help from my friends
---
No, as there's only one version of the train set.
---
Timer plus scrip and notes plus it’s only a 1* = nope. Gonna gunfu them into oblivion.
---
Oh you're right, it's less than 2 lol my bad
---
well
---
They dropped the ball.should of been buffing instead of nerfing.
---
I’ve watched low levels struggling with the boss and also there are other creatures to kill (on some prime cut events) so personally I tag, wave, give it 10 second s then kill it and move on.
---
Illegitimate builds apparently so we must enjoy them while we can. I never thought I was exploiting the game, who would have thunk it?
---
I mean a small nerf I can understand, but when my bloodied DCG goes 2k less damage then it should... thats overkill
---
I'm a bloodied unarmed main, I've heared a lot that unarmed damage will be awful. Can someone give me some stats?
---
That’s a really good improvement. Now they need to refund me all my wasted levels I used on respec.
---
Upper level  of camp McClintock.
---
What PA are you trying to put the jetpack on? Also do you have the plan for a regular jetpack unlocked on this PA?
---
Well, if you're under 70, you're still not the oldest player I've met so far ;)
---
Like the repair kids. It was a small think but you could buy now comfort items, which they said wouldn't be added.
---
After that they added the fridge and the scrap kids. 
---
Bethesda has an agenda and this agenda is orantated towards money, oh suprise. Making the game more harder and make player invest real money to buy stimpacks, power cores or ammunation. That's something Bethesda could do to try milk their fans to death.
---
Well time will tell, I just hope I'll be wrong
---
What does DCG stand for in this context? This game has so many acronyms.
---
Bloodied builds benefit from tons of stacking, multiplicative buffs. When those are changed to additive, the returns are massively diminished for bloodied.
---
The change of multiplicative to addition is much easier to develop for future content. It’s not as simple as simply reducing damage.
---
Idk about you but I want to do bosses where bloodied is not the only option. 
---
These exponential damage increase needs to be addressed (10k dmg melee weapons) or else any content they release will only revolve around bloodied or casuals. Where the majority will cry that’s it’s too hard or whine it’s too easy.
---
Yes this should have been in the game at the start, but, Beth started growing a brain switching to additive.
---
There is a reason why most mmo use additive for their damage calculations.
---
My new character is lvl 25, so i dump the prime meat and jump on the drums, i know what im doing after last time, but i dont see many people actually doing it so...
---
So you expect someone who has had their camp in a spot for months to move just makes things easier for a week?
---
I like the Blue Ridge Caravan BP with the Moo Moo costume.
---
I noticed yesterday there are at least 2 different Chally models.  In one model Chally is carrying trunks on each side, not a barrel.
---
In the other, there was a barrel on one side, but it was more like an oil drum than the wood barrel of the backpack model.
---
Yep, its progress atleast.
---
And some of us like the 1300-1400 score we get from said glitch.
---
Thanks. I've only been to the one in the Forest, and at level 93 the XP wasn't much. I'll try one in another zone next time.
---
People will show off if they are given the opportunity, they won't stop unless forced by a no-build zone around events, but Bethesda?....
---
Read my post, I said people were building new camps.
---
Oh, cos it meat week meat week grahm love week of meat
---
Meat sweet, meat treat, grahm gonna eat da meat
---
Who gonna eat da meat? Grahm gonna eat da meat!
---
Who gonna eat da meat? Humans gonna eat da meat! Who not gonna eat da meat? Chally
---
Oh cos it meat week, meat week, hmmm hmmm hm hm hm
---
I have only got 1 star items from these events.
---
If bethesda would expand the number of characters a single account can have but they already said no to doing this.
---
Ye same here and a friend as well
---
Grahm*
---
I’m pretty happy with that not gonna lie. The cost of leveling up the cards was my biggest concern with the legendary perks.
---
They may be accustomed to hanging back when there are lower level players so that other people can get in a hit before they 1 shot everything.
---
Damn dude awesome tip thank you so much. Wish I had realized that sooner!
---
What you mean by illegitimate builds?
---
No worries 3 years as a father and still haven't nailed the dad jokes.
---
Hopefully it’s very soon or else fuck bloodied I guess
---
That's probably for the best lol
---
The reduction is really good if they’re planning on keeping this system, which seems to be the case
---
Now is the outfit display only for outfits or can you put armor on it as well?
---
Honestly you may be sarcastic but I’d love that no joke
---
Thanks for the downvote console folk, They ain't patched lol
---
i envy you guys who have the patience to put up with this shit lol its just classic fo76 nature, be underprepared and under-resourced and punish the player base for playing the game later.
---
Two big thumbs up. Perfectly worded.
---
Why can't we just have unlimted caps but can only use 30.000 in a week or something like that?
---
That wouldn’t solve anything lol.
---
What a mooving hero.
---
I’m not the biggest fan of the perk scrapping but I thinks it’s here to stay. In addition to the scrapping they should make it so you get a legendary perk point every level after 50. Also why not add it to the daily op rewards so people can grind for them in a fun way.
---
Edit: Why is this getting downvoted
---
Sadly that's not how they have so many caps and doing so would result in nothing. People "bypassing" cap limit use the holiday gift usually to proceed. They just open a bunch and get load of caps and voila.
---
no idea why people are downvoting you, magic weapons are sure as shit, not fixed on the pts.
---
I've only seen one way to lower rep, and it was with the settlers. I talked to one of the Hunters that Roxy sends you to talk to or to deal with the former raider. I suggested to the Hunter that it was time to go attack the people at Foundation, and that lowered my Settler rep, but I don't think it will affect it after I've reached full Ally with the Settlers.
---
Xo1. I can build the free states jet pack on it. But that makes sense
---
There's a person in the Wayward that lets you.
---
I’m expecting my bloodied build to finish the SBQ In at least 30 seconds 😤😤😤
---
This is a joke
---
Thanks, mate
---
I hate the pricks that go 1,1,1. It causes annoying noises and pop ups, only to find I get 3 caps out of it. At least buy the rest of the stack when you’re on the third buy up. Unless you can’t afford to. Then only buy what you can afford.
---
Children my friend, children.
---
Me and friends always mention that when it comes to DLC, new games and boss fights. We hope to god that thing is actually a Chinese robot like the Nazi bot from cod, that would be such a cool fight. It's likely metaphorical though, like you said.
---
The REAL problem isn't bloody builds, it's the lack of variation. Bloodybisbthe only build where you REALLY feel like you've got a build. I tried full stealth and honestly, it wasnt as fun as bloody. 
---
We need sets for specific weapons maybe. Maybe a new effect that adds 5% damage to a specific gun type, maybe some unique effects but keep the end damage similar across the board so people dont get pigeonholed (am I using that right?) Into specific builds.
---
Damn, even having small visual effects like a more intense looking leader beam when you have that armour on would it FEEL more unique. Everyone wants to feel like a badass, but not enough weapons give you that feeling.
---
Bloodied are still the best dps. Idk why people are thinking otherwise.
---
I run a full heath vanguard build. I can one shot a lot of things with it. But yes it's a stealth build.
---
First i check plans, then yeah, i'm inside this club too
---
melee builds completely slipped my mind for some reason, my bad. yes, bloodied melee builds benefit the most from unyielding. but I feel like that's the only build that 'needs' unyielding, special is negligible for the average player.
---
you focused a lot on carry weight and I get that's a constant worry for most people but whatever the bonus, it's hardly game breaking. carry weight is something a lot of us would love to see gone in the first place, you make it sound like unyielding is something detrimental. not to mention it's relatively easy to get more carry weight anyway, a set of excavator with calibrated chocks for example nets you a lot of it and still benefits from the inherent damage reduction.
---
Athena is perhaps the only example of charisma directly affecting wastelanders. in most cases the special check is there simply to give you the illusion of choice. and nothing's stopping you from respeccing later on if you feel like you need to hear a couple different lines from npcs.
---
&gt;In this case to get the most benefit from Bloodied you would also need to go with Unyielding
---
not necessarily. unyielding does not directly affect bloodied builds. chameleon is better for sneaking and if you're not sneaking, then you should be wearing PA. the only exception being melee builds, which now have no option *but* to use unyielding armor if they want their damage to remain (relatively) high.
---
&gt;which is either extremely dependent on RNG or with some luck available at most likely outrageous prices.
---
the same applies to all gear. meta gear will always be more expensive.
---
&gt;you invested too much on that one build and now that it’s getting its damage more in line with the rest you feel you wasted time &amp; resources getting them
---
it's still going to be the one prefix outputting the most damage. I feel like nerfing things in a singleplayer coop is stupid and goes against what the playerbase wants, that's my case. I also feel 'more in line' is disingenuous seeing as how the whole point of bloodied is dealing more damage than the rest, there's no reason for it to be 'more in line' with medic's or what have you.
---
&gt;now you, me and everyone else will get a chance to try other builds
---
speak for yourself. I've already tried other builds and I don't plan on switching any time soon. bloodied being the way it is also means you have to waste less time gathering resources, which is the main reason why picked it up. unless you can find me a prefix that kills things faster, bloodied and junkie's are gonna remain the go-to.
---
you also never *had* to play bloodied. nothing was ever stopping you from playing vampire's, or making a medic's support build. except people always want *more* damage output, and that's bloodied. I don't understand, a lot of you want to deal the same damage but with a different prefix. makes no sense. what's stopping you or anyone from picking up an executioner's weapon on the live server? the dps? but once they nerf bloodied that's magically going to change? again, it's silly no matter how you put it.
---
and speaking of which, I'd agree with your last 3 paragraphs if they actually intended to buff bloodied, or other prefixes. because as it stands, it's just a nerf across the board for no real reason. for instance, they can't really buff berserker's without bringing it too close to bloodied, making bloodied irrelevant. alternatively, one could always use the strongest prefix with adrenal reaction.
---
Yeah I understand that I’m just salty about magic weapons being so easy
---
I don't run a bloodied build because I actually like not dying. I don't have any god tier weapons because RNG hates me. And I fucking hate this idea of "One Wasteland". ESO did the same thing and before the nerf, I could one shot low levels easily. Now? I can't kill a low level wolf in a low level area on my high level character without hitting it 3-4 times. It made me quit the game. No seriously. Everything became tankier...not just the shitty low levels...EVERYTHING. I quit because I don't need that shit.
---
One Wasteland is just going to ruin this game damn it...more so then it already has been.
---
LOL They win!
---
Yo you still got that leg? I got 7k
---
LOL
---
I welcome the hit to cheese builds, but the nerf affects everyone and will make currently somewhat viable builds absolute shit-tier. The nerf needs to come alongside one wasteland and a serious rebalance of everything.
---
We have so many insta-scrip legendary effects and weapons that desparately need a buff. I'd say make creature-specific buffs +100% dmg and several weapon specific buffs +20/30/40 instead of +10/15/20. Make mutants stack +10 for 5 mutations. Make assassin's work on every human enemy. Increase base damage of slow-firing weapons like pistols. Adjust effects like vampires to include base damage. Increase base damage of shit-tier weapons and make all weapons have ups'n'downs so they're all viable in appropriate builds. Etc. etc. etc...
---
Nah, I found it doesn’t. Ever.
---
They aren’t one of the primals, so they don’t count towards the waves. They are just there as an annoyance
---
My Camp is decorated and organized as well as it can be without using Building glitches. 
---
Currently am surrounded by beer cans.  
---
My junker car is full of trash.  My newer car is actually clean though, and have had it for a month without even smoking in it.  Gonna keep it that way.
---
I’m not even gonna level all the way and I’ve logged in everyday but 1 week and now I get to skip alllllll the prizes and worry about next season ☺️👌🏼
---
Even more justification to call out "Say hello to my little friend"? ;)
---
Sorry for your loss, 20's a good run though. Did you give her a good send off?
---
I honestly havent bothered much with the season, as I can't log on every day.  So when I can, I just worry about whatever missions I have, workshops, or if I can catch someone I know on.
---
A certain trading sub has people offering legacies and bloodied handmade for them...
---
Your RNG seems to be, yes. Overall? No.
---
No problem! I was pretty excited to find that out for myself the first time!
---
Once I accidentally scrapped my accordion and spiked my controller on the floor
---
Missed cards due to the perk pack bugs aswell
---
I prefer NV system to Fallout 4. NV system feels so much more like an actual RPG's system than 4 or 76 system. If we had NV system they could charge me $5 to respec everytime and I wouldn't even be mad about it.
---
Yes, this, so much.
---
I didn't realize how much the season rush was ruining the game for me till I finished the season (and I had to drag myself to even log in to finish the last rank) last week.
---
Now I log in, mess with my camp build, do some dailies, maybe join an event that pops, vendor hop, and if I get bored hop over to the PTS and play around with that.
---
No need to constantly replenish squirrel stew or find a near full building team, no need to craft berry mentats. No need to run 5/5 unyielding armor instead of the two life saving pieces I prefer. No need to take workshops I don't want or need..
---
**No need to play the game the way I don't play.**
---
So glad to be done with the season.
---
The only thing I hate is that the next one is only like a month off and from the looks of it it's going to be the same... either log in every day to do challenges I don't enjoy or grind XP to finish early. Neither one is fun.
---
I'm very happy to know many people commemorate their pets in the same way I have.
---
The event join area in the Cranberry Bog is within my camp area.
---
I’m not, but magic weapons are a lot stronger and that’s my point
---
That's how I was doing it sometimes too, but it's annoying to have to play the game some way that's not enjoyable and doesn't progress any character you want to use.
---
If Tea Time pops up, the right-most cash register in the neighboring Red Rocket’s level 0.
---
You get The Mooth Man. (i will see myself out).
---
You have addressed what the problem is:
---
Magic weapons demolishing end-game bosses in seconds. 
---
But you propose that the across-the-board damage nerf is a good solution. 
---
Wouldn’t fixing the broken “magic” weapons be the **REAL** solution?
---
A bunch of the events that I've been in that failed was because the creatures were spawning on the other side of the map and were lingering there instead of approaching the quest area. Either that, or the whole event crashed my game.
---
How many perk points do you get per card again though?
---
I beleive its still 2.
---
That's what I thought as well, but every event I've failed with no more enemies around to kill has contained mole rats.
---
I don't think you're getting it. If an enemy has 1000 hp, and my bloodied weapon does 1500, and my junkies weapon does 1000, the junkies still 1 shots it. In this scenario it does not matter.
---
If an enemy has 1200hp, and my bloodied weapon does 400 dmg, i can 3 shot it. Meanwhile my junkies weapon does 300 dmg and it takes 4 shots. But this isn't the best scenario to demonstrate the discrepancy as some troll will just say "oh that's just a microsecond difference!" Sadly this is what your post revolves around and it's simply foolish.
---
A 33% better damage scenario really starts to gain emphasis the more hp an enemy has. If a fight lasts a whole minute, that's a 20 second ttk difference. That's huge. 
---
Now if a player decides to optimize their bloodied build even further for efficiency, they're ONLY objectively more efficient than anything else since it actually MATTERS.
---
As for earl mechanics... lmao that's just a movement management issue. Wtf does that have to do with pure dps? As if a full hp build can just sit in rubble lol. If you're implying higher health builds dont have to utilize time to avoid traps equating in better dps, that's not how the current "earl mechanics" work. 
---
It doesn't take a high level mathematician to see that min/maxed dps builds later on are just pure efficiency benchmarks with everything being spongy.
---
In case you STILL don't get it: in current build, your argument in favor of the nerf is the huge multiplicative discrepancy that bloodied offers. BUT FOR NON HIGH HP ENEMIES, A JUNKIES OR SIMILAR STILL HAS AN EXTREMELY LOW TTK.
---
Post Nerf efficiency discrepancies are more LINEAR, and gaps matter ACROSS THE BOARD. The irony is CURRENT BUILD dps gaps do NOT matter across the board.
---
The scenario in which the nerf is actually good is if everything isn't a bullet sponge, however that is not what is going on in the PTS atm.
---
Is it 2 for a level 1 Perk card?
---
I put 1 year and a half into my bloodied builds and if this drops I’m still go a be the most dps out of the other builds. 
---
So I don’t really care either way.
---
I just got a max level 1* Beserkers Fixer. Imma put in my vending machine for 2000 caps  and see if anyone buys it.
---
Meanwhile I can’t earn them because An Ounce of Prevention is broken and uncompleteable. As a result, I can’t progress with the Dupelanders quests and therefore can’t do the Vault Raid, and without doing the Vault Raid I cant earn notes, and can’t get bullion. Pisses me off.
---
For sure! As for the send off it was nothing special aside from giving her a grave.
---
I absolutely love the idea of having people do shit for you in exchange for items or things they might want. Like I could totally see myself having some low level player gather some junk or flora i need in exchange for a bunch of .38 ammo that is overpriced at even 1 cap but is worthless to me and helpful to them.
---
I beleive its still 2 ,but dont have PTS to verify 100%, but if they changed that they wojld have mentioned it
---
Its also annoying when you are trying to do events and everyone wants to be the first to shot the boss.
---
Wow good to know, what is the exchange rate and daily limit?
---
+15 in six different stats is nothing to wag a stick at.
---
It makes you carry more, hit harder, more accurate in VATs, better at NPC trading, gain more exp, craft more durable items, able to stay in VATs for longer, better at sneaking, better at firing off crits.
---
It just... makes you better at almost everything.
---
That would be nice but I doubt there is a way to track that
---
You apparently forgot that there will be many builds that will be barely playable after the nerf. While you have fun with your still top-of-the-pops bloodied build, others will fucking struggle against the new level scaled bullet sponges.
---
What should we do? Respec? With the bullshit legendary perk system on the horizon?
---
I'm with you, I have a neat clean looking house and workshop but my real life is definitely organized chaos
---
What can you do with banjo or arcordeon?
---
Don’t wait for them to come to you. Get proactive and murder them at their spawn points.
---
Since I started doing this about 5 primals in, I haven’t failed an event. The mobs get stuck behind trees and rocks, get distracted by mobs, get stuck in a hole, fail to path around a camp/tent. They can also fail to show on radar if they stay near their spawn. They only show up when you get close, so it’s easy to miss one and fail.
---
There is no way that is limited to just camps being near these events. Even while alone on a private server I am experiencing major spawning issues at various locations (primary issue being that mobs are spawning insanely far away).
---
There's a fucking liberty prime PA, statues that cause explosion effects, and alien probing devices for sale what more proof do you need?
---
Yes, absolutely, and if people are to be believed they're pruning down the magic effects in the PTS: apparently Junkies being one of them. That's all related to netcode and I suspect it takes some digging to fix it.
---
I'll have the cosmos suit in a few days and I'm doing it
---
They didn't nerf Bloodied enough
---
How exactly is this a player problem? Go complain to Bethesda and tell them to manage their game properly.
---
I completed my run the day before the BOS banner was given out. Didn't log on again until Colossus went live lol
---
Yeah I found it thanks
---
Same, was very happy because I had some nice fellow build one at my base and if I ever deleted it it'd be gone.
---
Note to bethesda: people would probably pay more for more skins and camp items if they could AFFORD TO PLACE THEM
---
I mean seriously, it's like a kid with a lemonade stand asking you buy some and hold out your hands to catch it... uhm no.
---
there's no music except those awful drums. I already got the backpack and the chally outfit, so I'm done with it.
---
&gt; I like that a few other prefixes will be a little more viable
---
The correct phrasing would be "other prefixes will also be less viable, but not drop as much in viability as the current cheese ones"
---
Amazing 🤣
---
Mate, there are legendaries all over the place, I drop a dozen daily at events for newbies because I don't have enough space. I you miss one legendary enemy at event that needs to be done in a hurry, you'll get another one 20' after. People at the game are usually generous but not because they are obliged but because they want to. Tomorrow you'll catch a couple good rolls for sure
---
Also on Xbox.  But I've had the opposite.   Half my Primal cuts work correctly (even when having to hunt them down, half have been glitched a bit.  Meat Week only issue is sometimes it doesn't even trigger.  That one is rarer, but I have had it happen a few times where it won't even be on the map, no one even there.  
---
I won't say it is perfect, but not unplayable like Fasnscht was in the beginning.  They've done a good job keeping this one fun (well not Primal).
---
Magic weapons shouldn’t be included since their bugged/glitched weapon. 
---
I’m sure they’ll fix it eventually. 
---
^inacoupleyears
---
Naw, it's stupid.
---
Im hoping when the legendary perks are released theyll do a perk pack give away to all players to help lffset the glitch,  but thats wishful thinking.
---
Deathclaw gauntlet, im a bloodied unarmed and we are getting hammered
---
If you store your vendors, the items and price stay in there when you replace?! Shit, I had no idea...I thought you had to redo it all.
---
All you need man it's to sell ammo (5,56mm), get your caps, and travel camp to camp to see what's good in those vending machines.
---
Personally i got everything i needed, like this. Now drops are just some extras.
---
Really it's your fault for not leaving the server or at least putting a switch on your vending machine so you can switch it off and become invisible in the server
---
Isn’t the pts nerfs going to address this?
---
It's natural to form a bond and care for a pet or animal you took care of their entire life. When we immigrated to the states in 1999, my parents got us a kitten to help us cope with the scary move. She helped me through my Middle School and High School years. She always waited for me to visit from college. She passed three years ago and she was the best cat I've ever had. Loyal, loving companion.
---
If you can don’t have the jetpack plan from the Enclave Vendor, then you won’t be able to craft CC and DM Jetpacks.
---
Besides explosive bait? Did they fix that?
---
A lot of good options and ways to get ammo.
---
For one, are you on ps4? I probably have a lot of .44 I can give you.
---
Was rocking this yesterday with my Jangles jet-backpack and alien blaster. 🤙
---
Bethesda are fucking clowns, easy as that
---
Great lol
---
Thank you my username is the same as reddit its mth_219 btw I just found the wanderer but she wont talk to me maybe you can get her
---
Craft it homie.  Ammosmith perk maxed and Super duper perk maxed
---
I've been looking for a TSE leveraction for awhile now and decided to check a team mate's camp and lo and behold there was a TSE -90% weight leveraction for 24000 caps. I immediately bought it, and my team mate immediately left the game and then I felt guilty. I should have messaged him about it but I was just happy to find the gun I was after and the thought didn't cross my mind until afterwards. The system we have now sucks for everybody, buyers and sellers alike.
---
I still run TSE full health rifleman/heavy and honestly always will. I feel like I will be affected very little
---
Can someone please explain to me how this post is a negative thing? Isn't making caps awesome? I truly don't "get" it.
---
Welcome to the wasteland!
---
Honestly, this is very much normal and in keeping with the feel of the game - you are a fresh face straight out of the vault, trying to make your way and survive in a world gone mad :)
---
Odds are all these progressive people you see are on character 3 or 4 and have farmed really good loot for their alts. 
---
If you're on ps4 and need some help, poke me and I'll happily show you some spots that will make your life easier, give you some advice when you're stuck or craft you a decent melee weapon so you can bonk your enemies on the noggin when you inevitably run out of ammo :)
---
Oh I do that, I’m always at max caps and frequent other vendors. But the reason I play anymore is for hunting legendary enemies every day. It’s not much fun finding the rare 3* ones and getting a 1* weapon/armor, just seeing if anyone is having this bad luck as much as me.
---
RNG gave me a 3* fixer two days ago.. berserkers, scrapped it, but he's still out there watching us
---
You’re absolutely wrong. 
---
Magic weapons need to be fixed, 
---
Effects from food and chems shouldn’t stack, but nerfing every build in the game? That literally just makes it so bloodied is now the ONLY high damage build left.
---
We need buffs not nerfs, buffs to berserkers, mutants, and two shot should be reverted to it’s original state since explosive is no longer a powerhouse.
---
I am not good at math, but that looks an awful lot like 300 points(50+100+150). Does it cost anything to get the first level?
---
I have never done Meat Week before today. I've not looked into what goes into the event, and thus knew nothing about it, except for one or two small tidbits of information that I had seen somewhere.
---
I went to the event, was completely lost as to what I should do since it wasn't at all apparent to me. I think the event text just said something about helping Grahm, and then there was some confusing meter that didn't really make any sense to me at first glance.
---
I did know to deposit 15 prime meats and get the max buff, for what little good it does since it lasts 15 minutes and gives a measly +5% XP buff.
---
I saw people playing drums, but there were none that I could play. I saw some people rotating spits, but there were none available for me to use.
---
I saw some animals spawn, and then they immediately died, probably because someone just shot them with an explosive weapon. Then a bit later it happened again - spawn, immediately dead.
---
The whole event was over in like 20 seconds and I ended up just staring at stuff like a dumbass, not being able to do anything.
---
I don't know if I should feel bad about it but I don't, since I have no clue what I could have done other than pick my nose and scratch my ass.
---
I'll do more next time, I guess? I don't know.
---
depends on the explosive ammo, 40mm scorched have them so hit up line in the sand, and scorchy places. Need missiles? Hit up bog town west tek and huntersville.    
---
Really though explosive builds are hard, you can craft your own for sure but the ammo to killing ratio is terrible. Though an instigating FFR auto grenade launcher is pretty fun.   
---
.44 ammo scorched or make your own.  I am sure if you asked around people have .44 in large amounts unless they scrap it to the machine constantly.
---
The purv gave me a 3* bloodied explosive handmade last Sunday morning, made my whole day. Just when I think I’m out Bethesda pulls me right back in.
---
Even easier, make the event marker layer above the player icon layer...that way the prioritized icon is for the event or place you're traveling to.
---
TF you mean illegitimate builds? Wtf is an illegitimate build? All the perks work as intended.
---
Hahahaha!! You mean the Colassal Problem questgiver? Maggie, was it?
---
This comment made me laugh! Thank you!
---
I enjoy not using bloodied n stuff, I like seeing the bullets fly
---
I think you are missing my point. The point is that they put paints into the game that shouldn't exist for another 200 years, that is the attention to detail level we are dealing with here.   
---
Call me skeptical, but my money is on there not being dialogue that triggers off the time-travelling paint schemes.
---
I heard it the first time today and it solidified Grahm as the best character in the game for me.
---
Yes, that’s more what I had in mind.
---
Where can I read about this rebalance? I need some context and I’m having trouble googling it.
---
The reason I love my bloody stealth build is cause of how it is now. I know that by making myself almost a 1 shot target, I’m guaranteed to kill a super mutant in 1 shot. Large enemies or large groups of them require thinking, cause if I’m spotted, I’m dead. I don’t one shot behemoths, I can’t take on a scorchbeast queen. I believe that increasing level caps on enemies on late, end game, areas is the solution.  One wasteland might be a step in the right direction, but I think true dungeons are the way forward.
---
Edit: I use single fire rifles rather than commando with PA so that may be where the big problem is
---
An excellent post with a well-balanced mix of thoughtfulness and saltiness. Bravo.
---
Nerfing bloodied and junkies doesn't invalidate the end game. I have never touched a weapon with either prefix and participate meaningfully in all of the end game content. AA, Instigating, and Furious pull their own weight, and can be used for end game content. The issue is that bloodied and junkies outshine them so severely that it puts players outside of the intended game balance. Did it occur to you that the devs never intended for you to be able to solo the SBQ at all, and that is in fact a byproduct of a ridiculous amount of synergies that no other build can achieve? Sure, they could buff or create other builds in line with the current prefixes that they're instead nerfing, but if their intent was "No one should be able to do that," why would they make more people able to do it?
---
Working fine for me and several others I've told in game... Only Todd Knows WhatsUP
---
They're not nerfing legendary effects. They're changing how damage stacks. They can go back and buff any number of things afterwards.
---
Oh I want that tenderizer plan I get that and I am done, already got 3 tato salad plans. I may need to do a 1:1 trade if my luck doesn't kick in.
---
I push mine into walls so you can see it. But yeah it’s broken
---
Ye, the only thing making me uncertain is the length of there life time in the game and how easy it is to get kne
---
They say TSE will have a comeback. I'm skeptical. More about the TS than E.
---
Have you really got a big black clock?
---
It’s one of the ways I make so many chems.  I have a sign at my vendors that says ‘prices negotiable’.   Someone wants to negotiate, I drop the price to whatever they can afford in caps plus a handful of ingredients.    Sometimes I’ll go find a low level and switch my mic to area like ‘hey, you wanna make an easy thousand caps?  Bring me 30 ash rose, join my team and I’ll mark your map with places to look.’
---
They get what they want, I make a little money, and it gives us both something to do that isn’t grinding.
---
I agree 100 percent
---
Thanks, edited OP, long day in the sun with cocktails and screaming babies lmao
---
2:45 left and enemies stopped spawning.
---
What platform do you play on
---
I just could never get behind having no health or tanking addictions for extra damage. I can one-two shot most mobs and I do ass to the queen but don’t fight her often so no worries there
---
I do berserkers and that’s one of the hardest builds in the game. I get nerfing blooded and junkies. But not besekers. With the no armor should be a pretty good build
---
Yes! And it’s broken. The time it broke is 6:45.
---
Deathclaw armour!
---
If you got the ammo converter pick up any weapon you find on the ground equip scrapper perk and scrape them all.
---
After that put on ammo and super duper and make rail spikes and convert them to points. Every 1k steel is around 2500 points.
---
Rail spikes is the only ammo that just takes steel. It’s an interesting way to get ammo while never running out when fighting super mutants, raiders, and scorched.
---
Alien Blaster buff! Yeah!
---
rank 1 cards are free. One every 50 levels.
---
I was originally mad about the nerf but I mean, I guess that's fine. The weapons vs eachother are still roughly the same and it will make most weapons do far less damage. I don't like that as a bloodied build but I mean, means I'm tankier as a bloodied build
---
Cats are incredible.
---
I don't get how people can live with them selves hating on them. All because they don't understand how cats think and function.
---
Liberty Prime existed pre-war.  There’s no reason the paint scheme and voice recordings couldn’t have been accessed and used. 
---
How is a statue that has pyrotechnic effects lore-breaking?  There’s nothing special about either. 
---
Aliens exist in this game. How is a model of what someone thinks an alien probe might look like lore-breaking?
---
I asked for a citable source from Bethesda where they said the Atom Shop should be considered ‘non-canon’. Nothing you said provided that.
---
i am finished the 100 levels , i also am wondering whats next , i just finished 15 minutes ago , so i havent filled the S.C.O.R.E bar yet to see , but ill report back once i get 3475 more points
---
Ye my main issue is magic weapons not the nerf. I’m annoyed at the nerf just because it came before magic weapons
---
This, they need to figure out how many cards you "should" have and distribute an amount to each character to top them back off. or Just tie it to your level and let you trash cards you have no use for, for no reward.
---
No but what makes it invalid is how easy it is to get a magic weapons and how much better it is which is also my problem
---
xbone
---
it makes no difference it just takes more bullets to kill, that is pretty much it. SBQ will still be quick with a small crew, same with encrypted and earl. Bloodied will still be meta but it will just be alittle crappier.
---
Bethesda always cucks their own fanbase before they do anything with the hackers and glitches my dude.
---
OwO
---
I keep getting Chally masks.
---
Who's the brave bastard that said magic weapons are patched with no evidence, then deleted the comment when called out? You hero lol
---
Idk if it’s actually helping but I go bang on the drum in the middle of waves, haven’t had this glitch since
---
yeah ultracite just seem to be their way to have the Institute laser weapons, higher fire rate and lower damage, in the game without breaking the lore to me. 
---
Laser weapons could use a buff in general, especially in the durability department (really you need luck of the draw to make them usable). Honestly i'm hoping the BoS are bring a some type of "BoS laser weapon" with them.  
---
Still beam splitter + tormentor seems to make a laser rifle real good at blowing off the legs of assaultron, so there's that.
---
I dont' like weak weapons like pistols and bows being relegated to the equivalent of a BB gun after the nerf.  They suck now for the most part except for instigating (if you don't do bloodied or junkie's) which will be decimated by this re balance.  That means they will effectively make any slow loading low base damage weapon completely worthless. They need to increase the base damage of pistols and bows by at least 2x to keep them from becoming even more worthless.  Why have weapons that nobody uses because they are so weak it's not worth investing in?
---
Now you'll eliminate the marginal weapons from being 80% worthless to completely worthless.  Bloodies and Junkies will still be the 'OP' build, but really do just normal damage.   Those with alternate builds have to adopt bloodies and junkie's builds to even be able to play normally.  I don't play bloodied and junkies because I want to play with more than a handful of weapons and 2 builds.  I'd like balancing to be more that nerfing everything. That seems to be the BGS model.  Too powerful? nerf base damage and cap max damage. Introduce bugs then say "Have fun!" Not.
---
I want a REAL re balance of weapons classes to make pistols great again.  Bow weapons suck and they'll suck themselves to obscurity after this patch. I want a Fatman and a missile launcher that does damage like in FO3. Fix the base damage to match other weapons classes or give them a special attribute to make up for their sucky damage and lack of suppression options.  Western Revolver (all pistols, actually) should be dual wield, the damage increased by double and the damage perks moved to Perception not Agility or increase (double) the special points allowed for Agility if wielding pistols. This would balance the pistols and make them a viable build.  That's the kind of balancing that should be going on as well.
---
Apparently not. Saw some people say it still works.
---
Had that happen 4 times today right after 2 Primal Cuts bugged and timed out even though everything was dead. Really has me questioning why I play this game.
---
I thought that might help too, and it seems the enemies -are- attracted to the drummer, but I've laid the drums the whole time in multiple scenarios where it failed for no reason. Enemies just stop spawning and no markers appear. Sometimes the honeybeasts spawn atop some rocks and don't move. Just strange lack of QA for this event.
---
What's the point of the game but to play it? I got to 100 on the Legendary run on 18th August without spending a single atom. I enjoyed having the incentive to play and do all the challenges every day.
---
Wishful thinking indeed
---
How would you like to join the Deathclaw disciples
---
Wait, has One Wasteland been confirmed?
---
I got 6 grill master hats. At least yours will sell after event ends.
---
yeah i got 8 serums for this tank type build ;(
---
Thank you a ton for this post, I was dead set on getting this bundle or the cultist bundle and I think I’ve made up my mind now
---
Ok I understand what you mean but you don't need to be a dick at the end
---
Almost every single nuclear winter match I play on xbox is just like watching a slide show. Causing me to die in most cases when I get in to a fight. Everyone that I play with on there has been dealing with this. If someone is shooting at u with a gauss shotgun or a 
---
.50 Cal, its instant freeze, then u are dead when u unfreeze.
---
I can deal with that, literally half the level to get cap so almost 1/5 time commitment
---
There's some Hawaiian riff going on in there
---
They should , but give them power armor to justify them having “boss” Health , so you could do a high ranking brotherhood outcast or some raider/blood eagle that is hopped up on chems and stole a suit of power armor.
---
I love when I go the the legendary machine and start scripping away only to realize I'm getting zero scrip because I'm maxed out. I need to remember to buy some legendary gear more often. I'm too busy completing the Legendary Run and Meat Week.
---
higher level zones (ash heap for example) have npc level 75-&gt;100 , it's  good xp for sure
---
 :)
---
Cheese ones? The nerf will make trading other prefixes more viable for me.
---
Grahm sells the recipe for 100 caps, i think.  It is boiled water, tatos, and corn if I remember correctly.  Maybe a different vegetable, but they are just water and growable crops.
---
300 gold / 6000 caps / once a week
---
&gt; The event is to frequent for me for to long! 
---
You do realize you don't have to do it the whole week or that you don't have to do every Prime Cuts event? Or that not everyone plays so much that it's "to frequent for to long" for them? 
---
Get the rewards you want and stop if it's too "intense" for you. It's not the same for everyone.
---
I'm around lvl. 175, played at launch, was active here for a long time, and have no idea what the magic weapons are. I think that's something you really have to go looking for, with the intention of breaking the game experience, and unfortunately those people will always exist. :/
---
I really hope that train set is animated, it's adorable.
---
I have a question about this nerf would junkies be the best or like what is the best damage now
---
No thank you!
---
I must no-life this game because I'm over 130 and have only missed a couple level up rewards.... Thank god Im finally getting a job today
---
Wow, halved the cost of legendary perk upgrades overall.  Perk coin system still has issues, but it is improving.
---
Not to mention the way the game loads camps, you can just jump inside the building before the walls load
---
Sounds like the game is becoming a survival game again.
---
I gotta get those lawn flamingos!
---
only the outfit in different color, no helmet sadly. could work with the nuka girl helmet I guess but i don't have it to test.
---
Yeah while fallout 1st is a shitty concept in general, tbh you really only need it a couple months per year to stock up on scrap and learn those groovy dance moves. Tbh I mostly got it for the robot dance when I found out you get to keep it after the subscription runs out.
---
Amazed, they do listen....a bit
---
The "L" stands for *Light*.  .50 cal is not a light bullet.
---
6000 caps gets you 300 bullion. Only once a week.
---
New appalachian central train yard.  If you go into the blown-out building in the back, tons of safes to crack
---
I've noticed that lately, they take forever to load, it didn't use to be that way. Although I've also noticed some huge bases. I thought maybe the increased the budget or maybe some of the wall sections are cheaper than others now.
---
As a tip: It's basically guaranteed that there will be another Week in September, so it's not necessary to no-life it.
---
I found that a good Public Building team was always sufficient.  Not saying that I haven't run West Tek a few times, but really don't understand the fascination some have with it. I've never seen that many legendries spawn there &amp; have always preferred to run White Spring, Charlestown Capitol, the Burrows, &amp; Glassed Cavern.
---
Other than those areas doing events like Line in the Sand,  Heart of the Swamp &amp; a handful of others  leveled me just fine &amp; gave me more Legendries (good &amp; bad) than I could make use of. I tend to stack events &amp; daily quests rather than use a bunch of xp buffs (Squirrel Stew, Cranberry Relish, etc.). More variety that way &amp; get to meet &amp; play with a variety of new people al the time. I just looks at whats available in the area I want to play in &amp; go from there.
---
Yea I stopped paying any money toward bgs until they right some wrongs but unfortunately they just keep adding to the list of reasons not to subscribe or buy atoms. Especially since nothing we actually wanna spend atoms on works. YOU HEAR ME BETHESDA? I wanna put shielded mod on my camo ss underarmor that I spent atoms on for gods sakes!! It’s useless until then
---
Fuck dude that's shitty. Are you on PS4?
---
*whitespring bunker intensifies*
---
Thanks.  Yes.
---
I just stopped going to the event. I don't need scrip.
---
I feel like they just need to offer better rewards for successfully competing them, as is there’s no real reason to power them up unless you want to farm fusion cores, but even then most people just build a fusion reactor to power the fusion core maker. It’s be nice if there were guaranteed legendaries inside , it’s  be cool if like there were events that only started when there was power available to let them go trough, like say Thunder Mt needing to be on to trigger A Violent Night or other new events, most people aren’t gonna run a 20 min mission for garbage mobs and an outdoor grill plan, he’ll even a long lasting buff like say running through the nuclear reactor ionized you to deal rad melee damage or gave you like a Tesla effect where your bullets caused chain lightning. He’ll make it give 5% bonus xp and give me the confetti effect from lunchboxes and I bet more people would do them.
---
One of the successes of F76 is that it caters well for a diverse player base. I've played since January 2019 and am very much a casual player, having long since completed the vanilla game and Wastelanders I log on periodically for the challenges and thoroughly enjoy myself when I do. I have no set build (never have in 215 levels) as I like to utilise multiple weapons; TSE Lever Action (rifleman) and Instigating Plasma Caster (heavy gunner). That said the TSE LA has been nerfed to such an extent that I've had to invest in Adrenaline (3*) Demolitions Expert (5*) and Bloodied Mess (3*) just to make it viable, and when I say viable I mean I can just about one shot high level enemies (with the exception of Mirelurk Kings/Queens and Sheepsquatches). The Plasma Caster on the other hand still benefits from Adrenaline and Bloodied Mess but can still take 3/4 rounds to down enemies. Having said that it's incredibly satisfying, so much so that I'm thinking of hanging up my TSE LA for good and making the IPC my go to weapon. 
---
In summary, I've already had to adjust my play style to compensate for the loss of damage output on the TSE LA. As a player of no fixed build things are about to get more challenging by all accounts, but in the absense of meaningful content, it'll be good to focus on experimenting with and optimizing new weapons etc.
---
What's your PSN? If I get any extra meat week plans I  can give them to you if you want (idk if they're tradable tbh)
---
Besides the loss of pausing gameplay while using VATS, it’s remained virtually the same system throughout 3, NV, and 4. The first two games had a similar system, but it was far less of a feature that gameplay was based around, and could even be turned off completely. It was essentially implemented to help replicate the turn based combat of the old games, but has become the focus of much of the franchises combat. And unfortunately, as we have seen in 76 especially, it is implemented quite poorly, and the developers don’t even know how to fix the system from propagating incorrect damage values.
---
Might give that a try, thanks!
---
PC, sorry.
---
Got the game 2 days ago on Ps4 and currently stuck on this quest. Been trying to join different worlds and analyse the blood sample first but so far no joy.
---
I move camp when this is about to happen to me. Gonna get some atom for moving 76 times soon!
---
For me it was quicker to go to V76, then run.
---
Same, I have a handful of Caribean islands that need my attention in Tropico 6. Presidente gotta get paid.
---
So today I log out at 0855 pacific time. And I still got hit by the auto-complete!! On a double-point weekend. Total and absolute BS.
---
Ugh I want to down vote because you asked for it but I want to up vote because I'm in the exact same boat as you and you're right. 
---
*insert meme of guy not knowing which button to push*
---
sucks that you can't roll legendaries like you can w/ the wastelanders plans.
---
I’ve got 300 from fasnacht. But if the event bugs, like it has been, no treasury notes for anybody either
---
And you still spell his name wrong.
---
Nuclear Winter's biggest problem is and always has been that there is zero anti-cheat. The amount of people who hack is so damn high that if you don't at least have the ability to see people through walls you might as well be shooting yourself in the foot. I don't hack, but I play knowing that most of my opponents can see me no matter where I hide. 
---
Right after that is that some people are allowed to load in faster than others. The amount of early fights that are decided by load in time is stupid.
---
If Beth fixed these two issues they could probably ignore the mode for another half a year and I'd still be happy with it. As it is the game is incredibly broken and anyone who doesn't have both cheats and fast load times is at a huge disadvantage.
---
Xbox my friend
---
you can increase your odds by not learning dumb weapon plans , hindsight 20/20 , don't learn walking cane plan
---
I want to say no, only cause I used to use those type of Legendary Weapons.
---
Yeah, that's pretty demotivating.
---
I believe it's a weekly limit of 300 for 6k caps. You can buy smaller increments as well.
---
I can’t even get on anymore, my game freezes and crashes when signing in
---
True, playing on pc instead I got introduced to this type of beast almost instantly so it makes me a little salty lol
---
I work 7 nights a week from 11pm to 8am, I'm sure you'll be fine
---
Uranium fever has the chance to drop all rare jumpsuits/scout masks.
---
I bought two plans for it today, so yeah.
---
"just buy more things! Problem solved!"
---
Bethesda, prob
---
Junkies is, and will remain a solid choice. It's #2
---
Ok Bethesda, you have my interest again.  Now just ensure my full HP lever action Chinese SS build is viable and you have my time.
---
Gang that is bummer. But heck I wish I had the caps to buy those 10k of 10mm!! That would make my new sub machine gun more fun!
---
Nice that's what iv been after as well
---
Uranium fever sometimes drops 3 jumpsuits including the BOS.
---
Toxic Valley and Mire versions don't have burrowing enemies.
---
I just don't run it outside of those locations, and I bring feed for Chally instead. Works fine for me.
---
Can you PA glitch through a wall if there's something on the other side of it?
---
You’re milking that pun a little bit.
---
Not as Bethesda really intended but allowed to fly for years and NOW they decide to fix/balance it??
---
I'm a bloodied build so will need to either call it a day or adapt.
---
What can I say except you’re welcome!!
---
Yeah, someone did this to me yesterday.   I was pretty shocked when she showed up behind two locked doors.
---
I've removed my vending because of that.   Loading takes so long now that someone could practically run a lap or two around my entire camp before the thing is fully loaded, easily accessing vending and/or stash.
---
I think I actually prefer that: doing the event non-stop for two weeks may burn me out, but having a break in between could definitely make it more bearable.
---
We had them spawning across the lake too.  I thought it was normal.
---
Nah its alright, people are clueless. Better leave it that way.
---
They don't call it "RNG" for nothing tbh.
---
Ugh.
---
When I was level 15 a level 70 thought he could bully me in pvp boy was he wrong I just keep killing him over and over till my shotgun broke then fast traveled
---
I found some guy who had two PS4 and he has both of his characters just on the drums that’s next level afk farming
---
Thanks - I run Uranium Fever quite a bit so I guess they will show up at some point.
---
You can only have 30,000 caps at once. Anything you earn over that limit simply disappears.
---
Oh that’s awesome. I didn’t know the rank 1 cards were free. Do you have access to all of them right away or do you just have the ability to unlock a legendary perk every 50 levels?
---
Train set: we Animal Crossing now
---
There's a Toolbox with a Lv. 0 Lock in Poseidon Energy Plant, when you enter through the Cooling System.
---
I’m terrified how much budget they’ll eat up
---
I'm with you, I'm  a shotgun main and have an explosive shotgun which should be a day-ruiner for pretty much anything, but woth the rubber banding damage it's not very useful. plus it breaks REALLY fast, which I wouldn't mind if it was as deadly as it should be.
---
I don't know. My guess with how this game works you could and would get stuck in said object.
---
No. Bethesda said on the official forum today that for consoles colossal problem will be released early next week
---
Thanks for the info.
---
I’ll say next week Tuesday
---
Tbh as someone who has the best endgame weapons, I would enjoy a nerf, but tbh just getting rid of the legendaries in General would make it more balanced, but then you lose the goal of grinding. Maybe only 1* items like fallout 4
---
Sure is right. Only ever have problems when there is multiple people. Solo has never failed yet.
---
No only your's I think
---
Take your Xbox to your community pool to cool off
---
So annoying!! My turrets are more likely to attack wondering traders then actual threats.... dumb da dumb dumb
---
I was having the same problem. My game would load all the way to the sign in part then after about 10secs it would hard crash and buzz real loud. I bought a $50 500gb ssd from Walmart and hasn't happened since.
---
That is an alternative yes, what i meant is that there is **no direct equivalent** for unyielding and bloodied for full hp builds. The only effect that exists for full hp is vanguard and only affects DR.
---
I'm a bloodied build as well, but bloodied isn't really broken that hard. However this will make PvP pretty much unplayable against tank builds. It is what it is though, bloodied will still be much better than other builds. I'm thinking of if less as a nerf to all of our weapons, and more as a buff to all of the mobs
---
I'd like to see more mobs and a glowing boss.
---
What are the secondary perks on that shotgun?
---
turn off the screen shake.  you're right about it being op trash.
---
I just realized when I commented on this original I didn't noticed that u were on xbox as well. My bad
---
I have 4 chally's masks and no outfit.
---
No I haven't noticed that. Maybe there's a dust build up in your console. That did cause my Xbox to heat up in the past.
---
I know you said since the update, just a thought.
---
You responded to my comment retorting something that I didn’t even imply. 
---
My point was that they don’t need to change how damage stack because that is too severe of a nerf for any build that isn’t bloodied. Instead they could change how aid items apply so you can only have one active food and one active chem effect at a time. That would completely fix insane damage  through legit means.
---
I have a question about Grahm’s event. What are the greens that you can donate? It’s my first meat week!
---
Yeah I do get those Luau sounds near the cooking area.
---
I find that a 3\* enemy drops some sort of 3\* item about 20% of the time.
---
Only had it since Xmas and I keep it clean as possible. Maybe I'll see what Microsoft has to say.
---
No, that's probably just server lag
---
That's not gonna happen unless they make a better respec system, which I'd also be down for.
---
I have 3 outfits, no mask. xb1?
---
I don't even play Bloodied builds, but they need to do a lot more than nerf damage if they want combat to be engaging.
---
Enemies basically just stand relatively still (or derp around mindlessly if they're Scorchbeasts) and occasionally return fire.  They need to have enemies that actually...do stuff.  As it is, I am not looking forward to more boss fights that are little more than damage sponges.
---
It appears they only drop 1 stars.
---
So they double the perk coins we get and also half the perk coins we need ... what you guys want I dont understand it
---
Praise the dear leader
---
Do u happen to have an external hard drive that u can plug up to it? Like a regular hhd?
---
Almost all builds in normal gameplay are still viable. However high damage, single shot weapons were nerfed more than auto weapons, since Beth seems to be moving away from OHK attacks. You'll see a lot less damage in events like collosal problem, and SBQ than you did before.
---
Nah I ain't moving
---
So we all need to respec into heavy weapons power armor builds now?  This just makes DPS the king. Just like they did to survival mode and pvp. Instead of opening new possibilities, the nerf further limits viable builds.
---
provided things don't change in the PTS, when you hit level 50, 100, 150, etc. you can pick 1 legendary card out of the total list of available legendary cards.
---
That’s a title that keeps on giving
---
Things like this are always possible
---
Where is it? West of fairgrounds wouldn't overlook it as it's downhill toward the west. You talking about tyler county fairgrounds?
---
Cant like this enough!
---
What’s the rarity of the prizes?
---
Yes. It’s running super high for no reason. When Wastelanders first dropped it was only doing it when talking to Davenport. Now it’s just all the time.
---
They did add a new bit about Grahm wanting more songs about meat
---
Start a new character! I currently have bloodied heavy, commando and pistol builds and newest one I made is berserker commando.
---
Makes sense. Seems to be the day they do most of their updates.
---
This still sucks. I want to respec and have loadouts
---
I honestly enjoy it this was for the hunt. It's way more fun than seeing folks up on the pole invisible, but really in DANGER status.
---
There is a banjo on the porch at the Aaronholdt Homestead and an accordion on the overseer's desk upstairs in her house.
---
I’ve actually got it on my external hard drive already, I’ve never had this problem before today so it’s very weird
---
So far gotten 4 chally backpacks and flags thats it.
---
Glad im not only one thought it was my console hopefully its just 76 going try another game tomorrow see what happens.
---
I left when someone was at my vendors last night and this did not happen to me.  Thankfully
---
Whoa. What an absolutely absurd (and arbitrary!) limit! Thank you much for the explanation.
---
Last time I played, which wasn't that long ago, on PS4, I saw people fail more SBQ events than succeed.
---
Seems to be happening about 10-15% of the time for me.  (guesstimate;  had it happen 4 or 5 times so far).
---
There was definitely some lines I'd never heard before that cropped up recently but I didn't know if I'd just never heard them or what
---
Nice!
---
I've bought two of them so far. I've noticed he doesn't seem to have the rarer plans as much tho.
---
Nice, I’m level 472 which means I can pick 9 cards and swap them in and out like existing perk cards? Sorry if it’s a dumb question, I just hadn’t read the mechanics of how it all worked in game. Most of the focus has been on the coin grind
---
If you don't want to PVP, turn on Pacifist and don't take workshops. Pacifist will prevent the random guys from being able to destroy your camp. As far workshops go, you are warned that it flags you for PVP, so you are fair game. The munitions factory is very popular and will get contested if you take it.
---
Nah. Your gun does much damage per shot the game can’t keep up so you’re seeing the health rubberbanding effect.
---
I agree its good, but its late. The ”balance” in the game with experience, damage, rng and pvp are just lack of any balance. If shown in a graph it would spike in every direction. Lack of deeper and more thorough systems... It’s still not much more then a shell, even though lots of attempts to add seasonal events and now also the legendary run (battle pass, free though, except time is money and we had to wait for a long time)
---
Oh definitely. I Love Meat Week, but it's going to end at the same time as the Run for me, and I will definitely need a breather from Appalachia.
---
I have a 90% weight reduction super sledge that weighs 24 lbs.
---
Builds that Bethesda allowed to persist for too long, builds they never intended to be so powerful but the player base became accustomed to them and they only now have decided to balance them.
---
WATOGA MAP!!!!!
---
That's not halving, and it was 2000 levels to max your perk cards, which was fucking stupid. I do applaud them for listening however, it is appreciated.
---
\&gt; There is an unmarked location in the forest full of safes. 
---
Junkyard just NW of Anchor Farm.
---
Sure, thanks! Add me on PS, my ID is ZekeLodbrok.
---
Also AFKers can provide a lot more help than “maybe helping the Music leader”
---
Huh, Xbox on EST, anytime of day gets a match within a minute or two
---
my mule has a camp like this. “slightly-organized-hoarding house”. tiny home with all the facilities.
---
Welcome to the club.
---
No you know what about rng it is about your real life luck today I killed 7 3* and got 6 3* but yesterday I killed 10 3* and got 3 3* it is about your luck and it is just random
---
Yeah I only paid for 1 month.
---
I'm not near finishing, won't spend aroms to even try. Also I dont give a flip, when a game becomes and obligation my interest in it goes down significantly.
---
Coolio, I'm at BamBamBungle I'm on usually for  fair bit each day depending on workload and commitments :) see you in game!!
---
I actually was referring to Samuel with his "Penny's got style..." line. ;)
---
No, but my shotgun has been doing it for a week now. In VATS everything is fine but shooting outside of that was taking way to long. Like there red health disappears and is replaced with a grey bar that then is replaced with red?
---
Go to the Agriculture Center. The fertilizer bins I the back are all locked. There’s 3 of them
---
For Christ’s sake just get rid of the perk coins, and give us a legendary perk point every 50 levels. It doesn’t matter how cheap they make them, if many players have already been completely screwed over by not being awarded duplicate perk cards. I’m level 488, and have lost HUNDREDS of cards because of this, and over 150 other cards, that I have used during my numerous respecs, and min-maxing of my SPECIAL stats. How on earth do the devs keep overlooking this glaring issue, and not addressing their methods to fix it, if they do keep this god awful perk coin system.
---
It only popped up once while i was on for 3 hrs today.... I stocked up about 18 primal cuts with nowhere to put them and had to log off.  Guess I could have server hopped.  How long will they stay good?
---
Munitions is the only one that will be contested regularly
---
Go to ur fallout icon hold down the start button and click on manage game and add ons. Scroll to the right and select copy all then select the other hard drive that u want to copy it to. You are basically just making another copy of the game. U can start the game while it copys
---
It's my second negative experience with them actually, the first one I had been dumb enough to support ESO, I bought the Gold edition and it came without the bonus content code so I ended up having just a normal edition for 20$ more. They never gave me the code. People are giving this post thumbs down and bootlicking a company with god awful customer service. It's sad.
---
Yeah it was stupid and now it got more easier can you stop telling me how stupid it is and what should they do right now ?
---
Got disconnected three times in under an hour. Nobody was using ammo factories so I don't know what the fucking cause is.
---
They DO come to the drum. It’s just the waves tend to start farther out and yes you need to hustle towards them. It makes it more of a challenge rather than just sitting in one spot.
---
First thing I did when I reached 100 was to stop playing, lol, kind of tried to force myself to do the new events. In the end I can just buy the new event stuff anyway. 🤷
---
Agreed and what this will lead to is a bloodied build won’t run bloody mess. Bc it’s barely worth it. But hey, ricochet might just be a new bloodied meta to run. Glass cannons will have the points to run even more defense cards, bc we already have the damage.
---
Dude i was lvl 15 i never had check the setting i had no idea of pacifist mode and i thought people dont steal workshops because it didnt happend before
---
And i´ve never said i dont want pvp i just said that the high levels should no abuse lower levels
---
Legendary perk points every level after 50 would completely negate the new grind they are attempting to implement with the new legendary perks. One every 50 levels would be in line with what they’re trying to create.
---
This.  I use a instigating crossbow.  I can one-shot most of the time on lvl 68 super mutants (barley), but if I lose sealth and it's perks, my base damage is pathetic.  Even with all the damage multipliers it's not impressive, but just makes it possible to one shot.  Anything goes wrong with stealth and you're screwed and will have to run and hide or die.  Boss monsters?  possible, but I would not spend the 4 hours it would take to take down a scorchbeast and the amount of bolts it would take would be ridiculous.  So my stealth crossbow build is effective on normal bosses and average legendaries, but not something I'd use to take down the SBQ. I live with those limitations to enjoy the build.
---
&gt;so i claimed the workshop
---
Full Stop
---
Or they go all crazy and start chasing something far far away. In the bog, I had to chase the last creature 150 plus meters. There should be an event boundary for the creatures. Instead they want to tour the map.
---
They really need to add an account wide solution.
---
Make sure u select the copy all option and not the move all option
---
No, no, you did perfectly. That's the whole game right there /s
---
If its the Prime Cuts, my guess is your missing one or more.  I ran 4 last night and every time the "Boss" showed up at least one more normal enemy spawned.
---
A lot of skeptics here, but I have experienced the same.  If I don't play the drums the enemies spawn far away and don't always proceed toward the event.  If I grab the drum, they seem to come toward me.
---
It's 500 levels of cards with the new system, so around 700-800 for most people to max all the cards. Still huge but a more obtainable goal if you give up on playing alts.
---
Cheers I’ll try that now, it’s on my external hard drive at the moment so I’ll copy to internal
---
This is a nice change but i'd rather the whole 'scrapping perks' aspect to be removed entirely. I like to have the perk cards to be able to run multiple builds, With this system it seems like you will need to stick to one build if you don't want to grind forever for the legendary perks. They should also come out with the system that will let us use any level of a max level perk card at the same time they release legendary perks(So if you got say max level adrenaline perk that requires 5 points but only 3 points left to fit you can still equip that with the lvl 3 bonues). The respec system needs to be changed to just cost caps also. If they are going to be keeping this system, they should give us a daily challenge to grant us a perk card pack or maybe a weekly to give us 3 or so packs.
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
It's a lot of fun, might recommend it to a friend!
---
Mama Dolces has 3.
---
The locked door, a toolbox under the stairs, and the locked truck trailer.
---
Your opinion is as valid/valuable as mine. What do you think they should do? Or is this perfect for you?
---
I have 580 notes 😂
---
I’m fine with it, BUT they need to allow full respeccing of all SPECIAL AND Perk Points. In most games if devs did this and didn’t give a respec option, they’d have their asses handed to them
---
Bullshit.  The only thing that will happen is bloodied remains king and the other builds get totally pushed off the charts. 
---
That is until Bethesda finds some way of charging you , probably with special perks only available by atom store...dead games dead, there’s no coming back from this cash grab exploit
---
Thanks, will do
---
When you hit max caps, there should be a mechanic that stops all future sales. You as a shopper Can see how much caps the vendor has, similar to a npc vendor. So if the vendor has 25k caps you only buy for 5k caps. Best thing would be if you can see on the map the vendors caps. So you dont have to fast travel to someone with 29k caps.
---
Bethesda can't fix the auto-complete bug, you think they can manage everyone being on a unique reward system?
---
the Chinese Stealth Suit can help you in regular gameplay, but it won't do you any good in the new Daily Ops. As it stands right now, all enemies in all locations have a special mutation that cancels any and all stealth, so with it's not great defence and low durability, it won't do you any good to main it for the Ops.
---
I am convinced this is a screw up. Who the hell wants a baby blue or pink jumpsuit as an end reward? Like a toddler's outfit.
---
I guess I am lucky because there have been at least 6 people in every cookout that I have been a part of.
---
I was able to claim the bos baret just on Tuesday
---
if he's really a cheater then he probably has millions of all junk to repair his base.
---
just saying.
---
My bad. As punishment, no meat cook out for me for a few hours :( with only stinky pile clean up duty when I get on.
---
&gt;Everyone needs to chill. They are not going to release it as is. It's on the PTS so they can test it and make the necessary fixes
---
if we just stop giving fuck they wont fix anything :V 
---
&gt;Other legendary prefixes will become viable instead of instant scrip.
---
You have no clue what you are talking about XDDD this whole thing didnt change much in terms of legendary effects dynamics only antiarmor will benefit realy rest will stay the same. Weapon types on the other hand will get affected pistols and rifles got killed they are unplayable unarmed is bugged(so for now also dead) melee got hit hard with nerfs so its not good so we are left with heavy guns and comando aka difersity got lowered and we are going to spend more ammo :V
---
And put out fires, they have the biggest negative impact on event progression of all the factors.
---
They should just make it being able to overlimit in one session and then you can only spend and will earn +0 in all the events, basically kinda like how weights annoying people I mean
---
It’s not a vampire issue, it’s a shotgun issue
---
Happened to me 3 times yesterday.
---
Love that.
---
I heard someone say sleek doesn't stack with fixer or speed demon. Apparently sneak speed caps at the +20 from speed demon.
---
I'll have to admit I don't seem to move faster in sneak with sleek legs.
---
prob was a molerat or radscorpion then. they tend to get stuck while burrowing.
---
Bloodied and Unyielding (and to an extent, junkies) provide a simple ultimatum. You put yourself at critical health in order to do big damage. It's fair to be top of the damage charts, because you risk dying more than others.
---
I've leveled two characters to end game in my time playing (from beta) and here is what I have to show from it.
---
My first character is a modest level 106, since I don't do much with him anymore. He uses a junkie's handmade and rolls in the way of sneaking. 
---
My second character I decided to use something some people would chew me out for- Energy Pistols, namely the Gauss Pistol. I recently acquired a Junkie's, and yet again I'm running my usual 5 addictions in order to do my damage on things. 
---
I struggle with some things with high armor due to pistols not having an anti-armor perk, while my friend who is running JUST adrenals twisted muscles and talons with a furious powerfist and is one to twoshotting things WELL above his level that he shouldn't be. Once he get's a bloodied fist weapon, he will be doing monsterous amounts of damage.
---
How am I supposed to keep up with him?
---
I agree, and I'm also tired of turrets attacking the ally assaultron and then the assaultron attacks my camp and the only way to stop it is log out.
---
prob was a radscorpion that stayed underground. cuz beth really can't code burrowing right.
---
I don't think so no. Its more like when you level up and can pick a card to have available to equip. I believe there is a cap to how many legendaries you can have equipped at once. If I remember correctly you get 1 slot every 50 levels until like 5-9 slots. Don't quote me on this part I may be wrong.
---
So at level 50 you'll pick a legendary and gain 1 slot. at 100 the same happens. but like lets say at level 500 you don't gain any new slots but you can pick a new card. Once that happens you can start swapping them out as you see fit.
---
Since the legendaries are account wide at rank 1, if you have multiple characters you can have swap choices. So if you have 3 level 50 characters, they each can pick a card and get 1 slot. But since it unlocks for everyone you can choose which of the 3 cards you picked go into that 1 available slot.
---
I'm also trying to just remember everything based on one PTS test I did before the most recent one. So everything I'm saying could be wrong.
---
Tbh agreed, I don't like it at all, but I thought it would atleast look better with the helmet lol
---
Jebus, the server I was on last night, if you werent there 2 minutes before to prep, you would miss the rewards because it got completed so fast.
---
The one was done in the time it took to set my alt up on a drum, didnt even manage to get to donate any primal meat.
---
But solo, I dont think its possible, watch for people starting to gather 5 ish minutes to the hour gathering around the cook site. Thats how I know im probably on a good server.
---
I would have to do this after every update for some reason. I would update one fallout game then delete the old one then re copy it back just to make it play. I haven't had this issue though since the ssd
---
It is!
---
This post is udderly ridiculous.
---
Yes! Exactly!
---
I mean you can play the game when you want anyways. The only one tying you down is you.
---
You can use 30000 everyday if you wanted to, you'd just need to make that much a day.
---
That's weird. Hope you get it figured out.
---
I think its hit or miss. I have read posts here that say brawling does not stack and you should only put it on one arm, but this was from last year so maybe that's changed. I have not tested it though.
---
I'm glad it's happening around the time I intend to go immerse myself in Cyberpunk.  No regrets... maybe.  A lot of the fun in the Bloody Unyielding build is tweaking every little thing to be optimized for your play style needs.  There's already non-boss mobs I can't even one shot with an adrenalined \~2300dmg Gauss Shotgun.  I'm having to dump 3/4 of a mag into the Yao Guai and Fog crawlers right now in meat week.  Same with windigos in ACP.  
---
Aside from a lack of decorum in event legendaries and killing everything in Line in the Sand/Radiation Rumble, I don't really see the PvE complaint.  My regular crew of lvl 100s never run bloody because they don't have the risk appetite necessary to run it full time.  Nerfing a high risk-to-reward build only negates the fun and accomplishment that comes with going in with 20% of the health of an equitable full-health build.
---
That said, I run Vampires almost as much as Bloody depending on event.  Max rank Unyielding for the 15 special boost is where the real benefit is.
---
Dang it, no I'm on PC.
---
I feel like you're making a bit of a strawman argument here. The fact magic heavies still exist doesn't invalidate the fact that the legitimate builds are broken.
---
Min maxed bloodied commando can 2 man colossal problem, the band new content, in less than 5 minutes. Go watch angry turtle and mitzy. That is very much not what the game was intended to be like.
---
They have had the road map for one wasteland for quite some time, and it made perfect sense to balance the various refixes and builds somewhat, otherwise it was bloodied or nothing. 
---
Magic weapons will be fixed at some point, but the thing to remember is that magic weapons are a bug, not a balancing act.
---
They are putting the chicken coop and few other bits from this run into the bullion shop.  So you will be able to purchase them for gold bullion when the next season starts.
---
I would enjoy Fallout 76 more if it were my own personal hyper optimized wonderland, because it's a Fallout game. That's what Fallout has always been about.
---
Are you loading in when the event is beginning? Happened for faschnach too. 
---
Seems to be what's happening is there's too much going on, timed out. If this sounds like what happened, make sure you log on for the event 5 minutes before the hour.
---
I didn’t think giving Graham the Prime Meat went towards the progress bar. I thought it only gave you 5 script per 5 meat.
---
U dont need to be cheater to have enough junk to repair ur base its cheap af imo esp if u do some scrap run in the west tek.
---
The ones I find are always way over priced.
---
Tagging users in the OP does not page them, you need to do that in a comment.
---
Here’s why I don’t like it:  I want things to die before me. 
---
In all seriousness I don’t want a nerf but maybe a better balance of other weapons , but at the end of the day I’m gonna play with whatever they do.
---
Nice.  I'll have to try that.
---
If you come to my camp it literally says CHEAP AF. All plans including those stupid wall mounts are 10 caps or less. All ammo sells for 1 except cores which are 15. I have free water. I even sell my serums for 200. I’m always at 20-25k. If you sell for cheaper prices people are more than likely to buy something. Maybe it’s just me but 10 caps is a lot better than none and it sitting in vending for weeks. 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Edit: my bad forgot the guns and armor. I sell them for the price it lists. If it says 150 for a 2 star bloody- then I price it at that.
---
There are some plants around the barbecue you can grab.  They are quite unusual so you can spot them more easily
---
The only other perk on it is: +33 VATS hit chance
---
lol. we gotta keep grinding, m8
---
After numerous resets it finally loaded me in and it appeared to be an issue with not only me loading into that area but the fact that my survival tent cause a clipping issue.
---
It’s fixed now.
---
There are definitely still problems with the system, for instance duplicate perk cards that were silently discarded upon opening past perk card packs, or people who have chosen to respec SPECIAL rather than pull a card, the coins you'd get for those cards are lost with no way to recover them.
---
Also savage divide, haven't had it fail but i have on more than one occasion had to chase a radtoad that decided to run *away* from where it meant to be going.
---
I thought this was going to be about the fact that people regularly miss numerous "95% chance" shots in a row in VATS.  But no, this is about one of the many other flaws in this game.  \*sigh\*
---
Yeah it's pretty lame. I solely built my guy around being a badass with shotguns. I got every perk I could leveled as high as they go. When I got my vampire shotgun from the legendary scrip vendor I was so excited and I felt all powerful the first day. Every day since then has been seriously disappointing. I'm doing and extra 40% damage per shot and taking 3 shots to take out a simple level 5 scorched.
---
Like that shotguns are bugged? I have a secondary shotgun that doesn't do it (regen enemy HP).
---
No I mean perk points u get from scrapping perks.
---
Post it over another poster and it will work.
---
&gt; But the heads are still alive, occasionally twitching. 
---
lol, whut?
---
Once you hit 100, the board should reset, and all the cosmetics are replaced with atoms/bullion/scrip/caps/lunch boxes. That would be the best way to do it. But they gotta do something because quite a few people are finished and the dailies/weeklies are just wasted now. They want people to keep logging in, well having nothing after maxing the board is a nice way to do the opposite of that.
---
On what system and what you offering for one
---
Forget damage all I want is legendary power armour pieces :( my special goes down a cliff soo. As I climb into PA
---
For starters, how about replacing perk cards or providing coins for cards that were lost due to duplicates pulled from perk card packs?  How about levels spent on rearranging SPECIAL points?  Reducing the cost of upgrades and providing more coins is improving the system, however there are still shortcomings that should be addressed.
---
Try a trading sub or discord.
---
I dont care enough to submit a ticket, I have had exactly 19 repair kits in my inventory for months now, the # doesn't go up or down after SBQ event.
---
To be perfectly honest I'd never use a serum again.  Just get starched genes or use sunkissed to remove rads, and collect 'em all.  There's almost no downside if they're set up right.
---
You should be thanking whoever put their tent at the spawn point for huge XP bounty. Get an explosive weapon or tesla and tag them all when they fall from the sky and rake in the xp.

HOUSE PARTY 76!
---
Check on the official forum, there are some posts that could help you.
---
I love it because it has decent rewards and it takes so little time to complete.  Fasnacht was a minimum 15 minute grind, usually closer to 20.  This one is over in a few minutes.
---
I’ll take your riches!! I need weapons and armor
---
Die?
---
Im gonna be that guy and say "it's part of the game". I hate PVP but if something is in a game, then you gotta understand you'll eventually encounter it.
---
30% is no where NEAR enough for that gun. Like... 150% might get it there (remember, you can only get like 30 ammo a day for it, unless something’s changed)
---
&gt;That seems to be the BGS model.  Too powerful? nerf base damage and cap max damage. Introduce bugs then say "Have fun!" Not.
---
Yeah, I noticed that there becomes a point there the BGS and relevant perks cuts off at 2300dmg.  Which is good to know since it's a waste to have max rank of adrenaline when rank 2-3 is more than sufficient.
---
System?
---
Best thing you can do is determine where the spawns come from, and place your turrets in a semigroup there
---
First thing you should do in any game you start is look through settings.
---
Good luck. Also wrong sub
---
You have a magic shotgun.  That sometimes causes the health thing you described.  Use it in VATS and it should one shot nearly everything if you are close enough.
---
my bad i never use reddit.

o thanks

I haven't seen Radtoads at Savage Divide, are you thinking of Toxic Valley?
---
Thats why they are rare, and that is what makes them valuable. Duh
---
Darn, would be nice if they had an additional stats page that listed everything and what they cap at.
---
Yeah, that is my experience too.  Mostly honeybeasts and bears for me though.   Using Berry Mentats and kill everything, but the timer just keeps clicking down to zero and failure.
---
I want legendary cards completely disconnected from perk cards for points. Legendary perk points should just be the sum total levels of all characters on your account (can’t go negative if you delete a character, but you won’t go positive until you’re back above your previous high point.
---
That’s what I want.
---
With what have got right now in pts 200 perk coin to level up which means 100 perk cards we get them from perk packs also we get perks every time we just leveled up we get double xp with lunchbox it is %200 xp and legendary run . Also If you are high lvl player you got duplicates I saw people who got each rank adrealin from 1 to 5 If you collect the packs smart this is pretty easy

Yep. You have to watch it for a minute, and then you’ll see one of the three twitch ever so slightly. I’d show a gif, but I don’t know how to handle that.

New legendary perk for ammo crafting is already coming. Also in Daily ops enemies drop ammo for the gun you kill them with.

That's weak, it's easy to level up with team perks,lovers embrace, canned stew. At one point I'm earning 150% XP on events

Oh noooo I didn't even think about that

Note to players: the game servers already have a large amount of instability and lag with the current budget because so many people are using exploits to build things in unintended ways. They're not withholding the budget for shits and giggles

Brilliant.  It would be the anti-human attribute which now makes sense since we have human NPCs to kill now.  It would make it more viable instead of instant trash.

I love it - Cow Lake. I'm there too (and have been since last year), but never thought to name it.

That one does seem a bit more challenging, but it’s actually completed quite a bit in my experience.

Therefore it can't be 'better or worse' than before. You either get lucky or you don't. It's how you perceive streaks as good or bad.

Calibrated shocks for the legs hands down, medic pump for full health build, emergency protocols for bloodied.
---
Arms don't really have much to write home about, I go for the unarmed dmg increase for laughs on low level creatures and to save ammo.
---
Head is a flavour choice really - I initially went for the targeting but everything showing up as red annoyed me. Then the pip on all sighted enemies annoyed me during questing. Now I just go for the int for extra xp.
---
Which reduces the damage by like 50%
---
But come next week they will delay again and it will continue to get delayed because why not? Why not delay it for the 5th and 6th time. Who cares if it’s been in the pts for months and months. But yeah supposed to get it next week but we shall see. But hey we got meat week. Where half the primal events fail and then you can only turn in 2 cuts every hour anyways. I do like the plans tho being I missed out on it last year. As it was when I wasn’t playing game after buying at launch and beating main story. So far I got the backpack and the dirty outfit and chefs hat. Didn’t need outfit much being I bought it from atom shop.
---
Yes exactly! I've found it depends on the area too.
---
The one in Ash Heap they all come to you regardless. But the one with the Gulpers and the Yao Guai do not come to you quickly unless you play the drums a lot.
---
I don't run bloodied in PA.  I guess it depends on whether you main PA or regular armor.  I only use PA for radiation areas or when I switch to heavy guns.
---
I find the thrill of micromanagement and optimization the most fun of bloodied.  Plus, the tertiary fun of knowing you yourself can be killed in one or two hits makes me actually try to not die.  It's about the only real daily fun in this game.  Everything else outside of maybe camp building is monotonous, but goddamn do I get some adrenaline when I go into a populated and heavy hitting melee mob area.
---
*A level 100 legendary prime behemoth is approa- aaaaand it's gone because some level 19 asshole deleted it with their "magic" gun.*
---
Nice, so for the first time since the system was first unveiled, it is easier to progress. With a 40% decrease in the costs and only an average ~14% decrease in perk coin accumulation, it is finally less of a grind than the original system
---
Can I haz ur stuff?
---
Dunno the content always seems to bring back old bugs, pretty sure 8 years from now this game will rock :P

And I've got free water, crops, and drugs/alcohol for whoever drops by

I think OP means the Mire, not Savage Divide.

I'm excited, the flamingo pen at my zoo is a little bland.
---
Have an orgy of course. It will be messy but what isn’t.
---
You get perk packs every 5 levels, not every level. The issue with the system is if you have level 1, 2 and 3 cards on a max level 3 card then when you open a pack and that card is in there, it disappears, you lose a card.
---
I have lost many cards this way, a lot in fact, that's the issue.
---
It's better, not great. XP is irrelevant, levelling up is so easy it's an afterthought tbh, but not 100s of levels.
---
If that happened to me? I'd eat very, very well.
---
you prime things for ammo usage, not damage, at least LMG.
---
Hope so.
---
Agree 100%. I know I can shift-balance my cards to max-out one build over the other giving me the highest possible kill (or over-kill). But what I have found now and do is just mix the cards up a bit more so things are more balanced to what "I enjoy" for a game play style. A bit of a hard ass with Heavy Guns, and some with rifle...But neither a Zeus God Killing Build. The game is actually more enjoyable to be now I found. A bit slower paced, more of a chance since the creatures actually have somewhat of a chance to threaten me. It just got to the point that I was speed running through everything like a hot knife through buttaaa.
---
Couldn't agree more (regarding the suggestion for boundaries).
---
I embraced the bloody junkie lifestyle thanks to the game showering me in junkies crafted legendary weapons. And it synced up well with my habit of hauling around hundreds of chems anyway. Basically drugs are good, kids. And if someone offers you free drugs, say thank you, because drugs can be expensive.
---
&gt;Get an explosive weapon or tesla and tag them all when they fall from the sky and rake in the xp.
---
DO NOT use Tesla as ash piles created by them have been causing massive framerate drops in events since the last patch.

Best thing to do is use explosive, you can aim at the emitter and fire 2 shots when the scorched drop and tag all of them for meat pile collection after the event is over.
---
&gt;it means they can
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
"they can" lol. "can" lol.  wow lol.
---
I'm probably gonna go full health build and got the medic on but for head right now I have on plus perception because I sneak and use vats not sure if I want stealth boy on chest
---
I use a door 🤔😁
---
That was definitely not the case.
---
Not sure what they're thinking, they promised to fix that effect and put it back in the pool 19 months ago. I appreciate them tackling big balance issues, but arguably the single biggest balance issue is the broken things they swept under the rug. Even on the PTS, I can kill a level 80 legendary sheepsquatch with my nocturnal explosive gatling plasma before it mutates, during the daytime where my damage is DECREASED, using ABSOLUTELY NO DAMAGE PERKS. This is my legitimate drop from 2018 and I still want this shit nerfed
---
Welp send in a ticket along with all the others that’s in the trash can.
---
I certainly will, they can give me my atoms back
---
I'm a rifleman build. 
---
I may just quit the game again. If they nuked my rifleman build, the only build I've ever played. I'm done
---
You can still get more than 20 ammo a day or whatever you said above
---
Ah yeah, I always used the GAS sign for my Welcome Home neon sign.
---
Wasn't 450 and not 500 the amount needed to max a card before? 
---
Anyway this seems more in line with the xp grind and the general level of players in the game.
---
I like it. A lvl 1000 should be able to max all 6 cards. Considering I only saw one in game,it feels correct to call them legendary.
---
All shotguns are broken in vats. There are at least 3 damage bugs affecting shotguns at this very moment. I've been complaining about all of it for a while, albeit to deaf ears. At least with the upcoming nerfs, people are starting to complain more about the broken weapons
---
I forgot to unplug it. The kids seems more energized now though.
---
Yeah, I think people play for different reasons. I like stuff that fully engages my attention...that helps me get my mind off of all the difficult real life stuff. It's more exciting for me. Danger is fun.
---
But you're right though, if most players don't like balance changes then it really doesn't make sense to do them.
---
But even these nerfs still feel like they leave a lot of room for players to be super-overpowered anyway.
---
Edit: It does see like the original post here supporting nerfs got 700 more upvotes than downvotes, so I guess most folks do support the changes.
---
Same here. Didn't play my fairly new only 1 month old xbox all day. Turned on to play FO76 to do meat week and my app kept crashing trying to do the events, then it crashed my xbox. Happened in 15 minutes. Thought my Xbox overheated but I put my hand on it to feel for heat but there was barely any.
---
When solo, in the Bog the stingwings staggers me a lot. Not a problem the rest.
---
Fair. I started stealth commandos and got bored of sneaking and vats, so I rolled power armour for maaaaaany shots and tanky tanky build :) vampires minigun and I'm nigh on immortal atm.
---
Harper's ferry and a charleston mini-area were already datamined almost a year ago. I can understand them not adding harper's ferry because of how laggy it is even in normal gameplay, but no real reason to keep charleston away. From what I've seen, people have been asking for a smaller map for quicker NW matches for a while now
---
Personally I sell most of my stuff cheap as it is so easy to get caps on a daily basis. I’ll try to keep my caps around 23K and only keep about 10K worth if stuff in my vendors. If someone goes on a buying spree, I’ll just head over to a vendor and buy an overpriced plan or two. If I find myself low on caps I’ll throw a couple K of .556 in the vendor. Caps are easy to come by and most weapons I sell are either 3 stars or things I think other players may want. I normally round to the nearest 50c from the suggested price. Yeah, it would be nice to have a bigger limit, but what would You be using it to buy anyway? Every now and then I’ll drop into some low levels camp buy their whole inventory and then drop it back to them. Once you have your build and main weapons, the main thing I’ll actually purchase is ammo. Don’t stress about the caps, unless you are a low level.
---
Well no shit... I just meant compared to the last meat week they seem less, but that's just my RNG..
---
I'm level 60 and feel like I can't find armor over 20 protection and weapons that do more than 100 dmg. Is this weird? Or how its meant to be...
---
Yea
---
&gt; Alien Blaster: Damage increased by 30%.
---
Cool, it went from being useless outside the forest to being useless outside the toxic valley. Maybe by 2021 you will be able to use it in the ash heap!
---
That.........is fantastic.
---
What does it look like if you put 5 of them up? Are they all in sync?
---
After I got lucky from purveyor 5 weeks ago with getting 3 bloodied weapons in a row with only having 300 scrip and one being my first bloodied fixer I have not gotten crap. I get pipe pistols from her or berserkers. Then the other night on Xbox server fought queen twice and wendigo colossus three times and got all berserkers. I believe the drops have been crap and yes I’ve noticed more 3 star enemies have just dropped more crap anymore. And dailies and events aren’t giving me anything good. Got two 1 star bloodied weapons from meat week event. One was a 10 mm sub and other a lead pipe. Still waiting for a 2525 fixer or handmade or explosive light machine gun. But that’s not happening
---
Dude, been playing somewhat casual, been doing a zerk on my main, a bloodied on one character, and vampire/suppressor build on another. I’ve only gotten the bloodied to level 10 and he’s already arguably stronger then my level 100 zerk.
---
Seriously they need to do more then just nerf bloodied they need to make other builds worth it. Zerk is honestly the closest in damage to bloodied when your have no armor on but has 0 benefits going to it even if you wear a full set of broken with +1 endurance m. Vampire takes forever has 1 good armor set and has 0 perks really going to it.  Junkie is a quick easy build to set up but can’t put out the raw damage bloodied does plus has several negative effects to doing it.
---
You basically can go with 2 prefixes in this game on weapons and be able to destroy stuff without sneaking and it’s bloodied and two shot. That doesn’t seem fair in my opinion and what makes endgame a little unfun. 
---
There’s seriously 0 reason they can’t add armor effects for zerk and junkie like adding the armor rating as hp or increasing it with addictions or perks to help make vampire build a little easier to set up. This is why bloodied is number 1. It’s quick and easy to set up, does a ton of damage, has a mutation going for it, 2 separate armor prefixes, and some perks that make it worth while.
---
Barely playable? That’s absurd. Hence why Beth doesn’t listen to complaining like yours. Nor should they.
---
Nah. My camp has been in the same place, where the Savage Divide event happens, since the first week of launch. I like my little pond. Nothing from my camp interferes with the drum though, and from what I've seen so far it doesn't seem to interfere with prime spawns. 
---
I'm not moving. I staked my claim years ago. The Vaddy Shack stays.
---
Death to those who stock the mounted head plans! And a pox on their kin!
---
Because that comes with P22 ... :/
---
Anyone selling the meat week flags on XB1?
---
Where do you get the recipe or plan for explosive bait?
---
Exactly.  Especially the ammo one.
---
Probably less yet, dont forget about perk packs, probably closer to level 750 or so
---
I mean yea when they try to sell them for 300 I lol every time. But there’s still players new to the game and or making new characters who need them.
---
Thanks for the explanation, I've not accessed the PTS so only getting info from Reddit76.
---
Will have to wait and see, I don't like change.
---
Also if you get it done quick then you can usually get onto another one that's still running and complete that (assuming at least a couple of people were running another one at the same time and hadn't completed yet).
---
shoot the hostage
---
Could be a bugged creature.  I had one in my last run (although on the first wave).  Basically a radscorpion that apparently only I could see (I was trying to kill it, but no one else seemed to notice it).  I wasn't able to actually damage it, nor could it damage me.  But we couldn't advance to the next wave, and had to abandon the event.
---
Free states you can craft for any of them even when you don’t know it. I have t65 and I wasn’t going to buy 2000 jet pack plan for it. And I went in and was able to craft it and then I found out it is a bug. But hey I got a jet pack with out having to pay for the plan. So I stopped complaining. I have dark cosmos on it but I kept the free states until I get bored and have nothing left to buy with gold then I will buy it
---
So sorry to hear about your loss, man; it felt like my heart was torn out when my cat passed on. May the universe and the wasteland continue to smile on you and Phoebe. ❤
---
I had an enemy glitch underground on one which we couldn't reach to kill, and a perpetually tunneling mole rat at another that we couldn't manage to whack fast enough.
---
My favourite Fallout moment so far has to be walking towards a location and I saw one off to the side so I went for that one first. As i walked up i saw a radscorpion and saw that it was level 60. Immediately turned around with a little pee running down my leg. Out of nowhere a death skull scorpion attacked me and took out half my health with one hit. I started running for my life. I found a bus and hid in it and just listened to the radscorpions repeatedly pop out of the ground. I just did the help emoji until a level 220 casually came by, turned the radscorpions to a dust pile, gave me a thumbs up and jetpacked away. I was level 20 at the time and still think about it 50 levels later.
---
They should just remove it. Who in their right mind would pick an assassin weapon that only does +10% against humans when you could just use a mutants weapon that gives +10% against everything?
---
It's just pointless bloat in the loot pool.
---
I couldn't use Unyielding even if I wanted to.  I like a bit of a challenge but I like having a bunch of Health.
---
Well said. I fully agree. It was only Bethesda's sloppy-ness that allowed us to "enjoy" such unbalaced playing field for nearly true years. Any other company would stomp such brutally overperforming builds within weeks. In other online games people complain when a build is better by 5% and "forces everyone to use it", while here some builds are overperforming by hundreds of %.
---
Also, the fact that bloodied builds were allowed to run rampart for so long is a nail to coffin of any arguments in the vein of "Bethesda cares only about playtime metrics". If that is the case, why weren't the bloodied builds taken care of year ago?
---
Tell me. Can a Bloodied beserker’s hybrid really outdamage a Bloodied build?
---
Yeah i was just sitting there and it failed
---
Indeed
---
Bold of you to assume it will still exist 8 years from now.
---
I don't like change at all, I got 5 vault accounts and hundreds of meta weapons about to tank in value.  But it's the same thing as when sentinel got nerfed. Everyone is going to liquidate their weapons on the markets, when this thing hits the market it's gonna be the perfect time to trade for really good weapons which everyone will realize in a month or two that it was still one of the best items in the game. Everything is getting negatively effected. They will still be metas,
---
Another person who doesn’t understand what has actually been changed here. 
---
The change in damage calculation ( multiplicative to additive ) is just a result of bloodied getting nerfed the most while others not as hard.
---
This change helps prevent exponential damage increase.
---
Agree in principle, because root cause fixes are needed, particularly in how they are coding these instanced raid events that struggle to scale. But in actuality, I think a full stop on new content would kill the game right now. 
---
We’re already in a content drought waiting for BoS expansion, we’re on the edge of the next console generation, and online games need player engagement to stay relevant. If this sub is any indicator, 76 is already struggling to keep player engagement while we grind out seasons and reputations waiting for Meat Weeks and the larger story dlc. Shut down all attempts at new content, and that just gives players an excuse not to log in anymore. And once they log off, no guarantee they ever log back in no matter how monumental the overhaul. 
---
I personally believe Anthem is toast, failed launch and largely out of sight and mind. It was a bold decision, I’ll give them that, but I think it would kill 76 if Bethesda tried a similar path.
---
I think the abbreviation should be 2SE not TSE
---
otherwise how will people know I want a TroubleShooters Explosive weapon.. not Two Shot..?
---
Bloodied doesn’t need a nerf.
---
Dying needs meaning of some kind.
---
The balance to bloodied is you die more, or at least potentially, and if you read about the new Daily OPs, it’s a lot more it would seem.
---
That’s fine if dying meant something, anything.  Losing your junk or a short “time out” is meaningless when you balance it with your damage output, because there really is no balance.
---
Give death some teeth and there would be a bit more concern about being a true high risk/glass cannon build.
---
If devs play the game at all they will use console codes to facilitate their activities, they wouldn't rely on something as mundane and low brow as 'builds'.
---
You sure it's not a due to the piles of real items piling up from meat piles de-spawning?
---
Yes so much. So use 3 star that and maxed out ammunition and you get nice amounts and when the lovely legendary perk cards come there’s a even better one that I plan on making out
---
Nostracannibus.  Thanks.   
---
I've never played meet week before, but I was playing almost everyday and only 6 tiles behind Zoros before my internet went down.  
---
I do want to complete the season.  Any help I can get I'd appreciate.   I'm anxious to see where I'm at when my internet starts working again.
---
Depends on your perks but as long as you are offline you should be good just sign in right before a meat week event
---
Kill the officers, get and decipher all 8 codes.
---
Only thing it doesn't work on is when crafting legendary armor and weapons
---
NEVER MIND THAT! They changed the clock to a 24 hour clock on the daily ops!. HEY BETH DON"T YOU WANT PEOPLE TO PLAY THE SHIT OUT OF IT TO FIND BUGS? What's a polite way of saying "fucking idiots"?
---
Yes, but lately I've read reports of people saying it only doubles the amount of ammo before Ammosmith, and given that ammo crafting challenges also work this way, and there's another Ammo crafting card coming soon, I'd love if someone who did the math could clear the issue up once and for all. Even better if they know how Ammo Factory is going to stack with these two perks.
---
Ah, that’s certainly more acceptable. Although in that regard, you’d end up going in the opposite direction, and keeping the grind where it was before the cost reduction, or extending it once more.
---
Eh i'm not sure. I'm really close to 700 and never really respecced(maybe 1 or 2 points moved around).
---
I have about 380 points saved and 20 packs to open. I don't know how many cards I have but I have a lot,which also mean I lost a lot with duplicates. I should be able to max 3 right away,which is what I really want.the rest will just be added bonuses.
---
Can you not move your camp &amp; still enjoy the game?
---
Or possibly just deal with it for meat week,&amp; then go back to the regularly scheduled programming?
---
&amp; I guess if not,are you on Xbox?
---
I didn’t look before posting...
---
But I’d jump on the bandwagon,of...
---
Can I have some stuffs?
---
Savage divide and ash heap. You can run around and kill  what appears to be everything, then you run around for the last minute and a half trying to figure out why its not completing successfully. Then it fails. Super fun.
---
Today's PTS patch claims to have fixed this issue. I don't have either the Camo nor the regular SS underarmor, but hopefully you'll be able to shield it once Patch 22 drops.
---
Because you have shity internet...
---
Bethesda can't do anything about it
---
Agreed. The "last one doesn't spawn" is happening at least a third of the time, even at clear (no tents or camps) locations. Just wastes the time of everyone there.
---
Oh my go, the merchant. 
---
My turrets and Beckett hate those merchants with a firey passion. They will fire on a merchant for hours...hours. If I store the turrets and replace them, immediate firing again.
---
Go away, merchant. Let me send them away. Quick chat - I don’t want anything today. Or have a no soliciting sign.
---
I for one welcome the nerf of that meta, far too long has nocturnal chameleon rocket launchers sat upon the meta throne. it will be nice to see what emerges once they finish the with the reworks, perhaps it will be finally the time that furious binoculars can finally shine!
---
Who buys 10mm?  What a wierdo
---
It works with everything, including crafting equipment with legendary modules. 🤙
---
And bulked junk
---
No it works for anything. I crafted 20 guass minigun and ended up with 35.
---
&gt;Give death some teeth and there would be a bit more concern about being a true high risk/glass cannon build.
---
No it doesn't, it's already a pain to get back to your junk after you drop it in a difficult area.
---
Metas don't need to be nerfed.  Bugs need to be patched (\*cough\* magic guns \*cough\*), and other builds need to be buffed.  Bloodied has plenty of tradeoffs to balance it. The other Legendary effects need buffing, and from what I understand this upcoming 'nerf' actually helps to level the playing field and actually allow Bethesda to buff and tweak.  We'll see if that **actually** happens or not.
---
After all that talk about how cool event the Meat Week was, I'm really disappointed. It's totally underwhelming and not even nearly as fun as Faschnacht was. And not just because the broken spawns in Primal Cuts, or because the main event doesn't even show up most of the time so you literally has to camp there to don't miss it, since it's over so fast (I kinda understand why people AFK for this reason alone), or because of the crap rewards. It's simply missing the spirit what Faschnacht had.
---
Forgot about that
---
Everytime I try to load in it is freezing. I've restarted FO and my Xbox. This is ridiculous.
---
Ash Heap
---
Let us know what they say.my x runs hot as hell
---
Ash Heap and Forest here. Ash Heap's worse, but both fail regularly.
---
&gt;Hackers, Dupers and exploiters never  be allowed to actually have fun in a game ever again! ruins the  experience for everyone else!
---
*Yawn* Another vigilante thinking they should do Bethesda's job. Get a life kid.
---
We're the foundation of this game. All those god tier weapons you all trade for have been, guess what, *duped*. It would be a lot harder to get those weapons and plans everyone wants if we weren't here.
---
I took all mine down. Haven't had to fix anything in awhile...idk 🤷‍♀️
---
We had an event fail because of a guy's camp that was set up close by. The animals went to attack it while everyone else was wondering where they were.
---
Yes Toxic Valley, my bad - big white area top left of the map, not the big beige area down the middle of the map.
---
I always get Toxic Valley confused for Savage Divide, not the other way round though.
---
Incorrect sir.
---
Hooman, no tell Chally what in meat cook
---
It will be very helpful when bos get here😉🤫
---
I want them also. I’ve only seen him in wild four times and I’ve played since launch but took about a 6 month break and it was during all the summer events. So I need  this plan also. Got lucky after 3 events got the back pack
---
It does proc when crafting equipment with legendary modules, but doesn't actually double the output.  You hear the sound and see the icon, but it doesn't actually do anything,
---
The cap limit is annoying as hell. Once you sort of own everything you want other than things that you almost never see in player vendors - that Bloodied Fixer or the perfect piece of 3\* Unyielding armor - you are stuck buying stuff you don't need from the vendors just to keep your caps down. (How many Assultron recall key cards does one guy need? Even plans aren't a great cap sink because they aren't weightless, and they do add up.)
---
I get it. The alternative to a cap limit is a highly inflationary economy because there just aren't enough things to spend caps on during the endgame. High level players will be rolling with six or seven figure cap accounts. That bloodied fixer will be 250k when you do find it in a vendor.  New players would need to spend a year playing and saving before they could actually buy anything exciting from a player.
---
I just wish there were an easy/fun way to spend caps even on transient content. Let me rent the insult bot for 500 caps/hour to hang out at my camp and insult everyone who visits. Let me rent a sentry bot to guard a workshop. Spend caps to sponsor a grand fireworks display at the Whitesprings which maybe riles up a bunch of ferals for people to fight during or after the fireworks show.
---
They get nuked.
---
For those who may be interested, [the damage on the pick](https://i.imgur.com/YNGHnyB.jpg). Base Str 12, no perks into 2H, but Nerd Rage and full UNY equipped.
---
It’s an exploit with the fo1 tent
---
You'll be able to, with the next patch.
---
Allies seem to make things worse. Before I had a ally, I had to repair 1 crop every couple of days. Now I have to repair several each time I visit my camp. This is on a private server, so I don't get a lot of visitors.
---
You stepped into a PvP zone. End of story, you ignorant foodbuild.
---
I’m sure this will get downvoted but, here goes.  I’ve had this happen to me, I freaked out the first time it happened, but then I realized it was fictional currency for a fictional weapon that is in a GAME which is meant to be played for entertainment and fun.  I’m very into my Fallout world, but there are way bigger actual problems I should be focusing on.  Just saying.
---
Yeah, I think they need to increase the time allowed. With the spawns being somehow more inconsistent than they used to be due to fo1st tents (probably) we need a bit more time to run to the prime beasts. I've set up a farm for chally's feed, and always bring that and wood so at least the meat cook is less likely to fail.
---
Sorry? What areas are you talking about? I'd like a challenge.
---
Even if they change how death works people will just run around in EP Power armor and never die. It wouldn’t solve anything...well at least to people who just charges and not care if they die or not.
---
I stil want to fight the real moth man... it would be a glorious and disturbing fight but a grand one noke the less.
---
Once, and only once, in over 1100 hours, have I found a vendor with reasonably priced junk.
---
Why would they increase it again?
---
Doesn't stop us from contesting your workshop and killing you. :)
---
Fallout 76 weapons, armour, Chen’s etc need a major rebalance. So many interesting and unique weapons are dreadful
---
It’d be a bit pointless because the bonuses from unyielding/ bolstering armor can not be applied to a Beserker. I play a Beserker sneak commando with full health. Lots of damage? But it’s fun to manage this build and plan attacks to cripple so that you can reposition before getting clobbered
---
What do you mean vats nades ? I thought you couldn't use throwable in Vats, only shoot?
---
thanks
---
I’ve just had to go out but hopefully it’ll be sorted by the tome I’m back. Thanks!
---
Unyielding certainly can - just wear broken Unyielding armor.
---
Why would anyone use a Trouble Shooter weapon?
---
honestly, this is the one thing I want them to fix the most. I'll fast travel to my camp and here gunfire and an 'argh' sfx. I'll wander over to my turrets and see that they've killed the settler colonist that spawns nearby for the 10,000th time.
---
Lost my dog on July 2nd, I feel ya. Our pets mean so much to us all :(
---
Add xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero) and I can help you out a bit with junk for your camp and that sort of thing &lt;3
---
It has worked for me. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
True. ;)
---
Always the ammo one.
---
I hope the show brings us closer to getting a new single player entry. (I hope that’s OK to say on a 76 sub).
---
The Mire seems to have the most issues with not completing after you kill everything. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
lol don't enter PvP zones as an under equipped lowbie. Plain and simple.
---
Lots of people yeah.
---
Yup, do them on my own too.
---
It isn't good. Lemme explain why
---
The problem with this stuff is the exploitation of stealth and multiplicative stealth boosts. Angry turtle and captain noob pioneered this approach. When they soloed the sbq in a few seconds they both had stealth builds. If youre a stealth build trying to kill sbq in a public world, good luck. Your stealth and multipliers are destroyed by some power armor build with a heavy gun. They only way to effectively solo is either by using a private world or by having nobody in your public world, meaning you're not hurting anyone. 
---
The main problem in conclusion is stealth, not raw damage from weapons.
---
In conclusion, leave my guns alone and nerf stealth.
---
Came to post this. Have an upvote
---
Honestly, if they delete my legacy weapons I'd just quit the game. Too much time and effort straight up gone, reduced to atoms.
---
He's wasting too much energy worrying about something even Bethesda won't give a fuck about.
---
Same thing happened to me, not complaining tho😏
---
Omfg this story is gold. Story of a young foodling blossoming in fallout.
---
I've only made it halfway through the board coz I haven't been dedicated to score points. Just having fun and taking what I get. 🤷‍♀️
---
Absolutely agree. I’m one of those bloodied builds that’s about to be nerfed and frankly I’m fine with it.
---
Losing a pet is *not* merely *like* losing a family member, it *is* losing a family member.
---
Most games I go into, mmo's included, I go in with the mindset that I'm going to suck for a bit. Ill grind and gear up and eventually, hopefully, I'll get powerful. Idk if I'm for this nerf, currently lvl 126 with nothing to great for gear. Def not an optimized build. My only real complaint is getting to these events, and some high lvl toon is there, one shotting everything. Just let us get a shot or hit ffs, or maybe everyone in the event should get drops, even if you don't get a chance to damage a legendary. Not usually a fan of participation trophies... but what are you supposed to do when the lvl 400 plus 1-2 shots the 3 star legendary about the time you target it with vats.
---
The hat is the Atom Shop pirate hat, which looks kinda different from the pirate hat from the Halloween event. Don't remember the last time it was in the store, I grabbed it close to when the game came out.
---
Increasing the cap wouldn’t solve anything. 
---
It would be o shit I hit the cap of 40k and someone bought 10k 10mm instead.
---
It’s been proven not to work...
---
As any type of heavy gunner how are you not getting loot? What type of gun are you using and what legendary effects if any? There is no reason you shouldn’t be able to loot the body if you are running just about any heavy weapon other than plasma caster, harpoon, or broadsider.
---
I have the same handmade but level 35.
---
Fun to fuck around in silos with
---
I'd log back in to take down raider, settler, responder, enclave, or secret service bosses. Basicly anyone but free states or BoS.
---
Isn’t this comment about 5 weeks to late?
---
Are the rewards random?
---
It's the apocalypse.    
---
If you think everything is going to go your way and everyone is going to play nice you're missing the whole point of the games.
---
It’s FOMO you don’t need to do the seasons. You can still buy the things that affect gameplay like ammo converter or chicken coop with gold bullion if you don’t do it.
---
Only thing your missing out is cosmetics.
---
 Anybody know how much a pirate outfit and pirate hat goes for over on the market? I wasn’t playing during Halloween and I’m thinking of buying one...
---
(Although Halloween is pretty close, might do me some good just to wait.)
---
If you picked up an item that he requests that happens to spawn in the world while not in the active quest, you can turn it in again and again.
---
That's great.....when we can start using it and see how it works.
---
Yet they are still adamant about fucking people over for having varied builds or using the horridly bullshit 'respec' system the game rubs into your face every time you have a fucking point to spare.
---
Goddamn fucking idiots.
---
According to the guide it's only meant to give 1-star drops.    
---
Players from level 2+ can enjoy it and that's the point.
---
I'm server hopping so much for this plan I haven't even done the actual event yet.
---
Sadly, did me too this afternoon, hadn't all day yesterday, weird
---
There's nothing saying you have to level up and do the run. We didn't pay for it so if you want the items then yeah there should be a grind if you dont want to grind dont do the challenges... you don't need the items to play the game. I do the challenges  because I enjoy playing the game when I can and I want to complete run. If you aren't having fun with it just don't do it. I haven't played every day but ill still complete the run you people act like its life or death if you aren't on every single damn day. Ill admit it's not a perfect execution and it can could use some changes but lord guys.
---
I'm glad I wasn't the only one to think this, since this was the original case, when it was introduced to FO4
---
I hear anti armor is a good choice. But I also don't study this game like I do for honor. Maybe somebody else could inform the both of us
---
I love seeing them blossom into being so we can go farm them.
---
BGS is never going to make the game easier, they are going to make it harder.
---
It's the apocalypse, we don't play nice.
---
Well, they could implement MAC bans but that just means they need to spoof that too. But just like with any security, there ways to circumvent it. The only effective means I have ever seen for dealing with cheaters and hackers are to segregate them into there own private sections.
---
Bloodied Weapons are out, Vampire and Anti-Armor Weapons are in.
---
Soon he will grow into a strong saltiboi, then become a redditard.
---
Really dude?
---
This is a community event that's easy enough for all players to participate with its own rewards and THAT'S what concerns you...?
---
 Strange 🤔
---
I am a pc player
---
I've never had a single quest from him, the damn freeloader.
---
My camp is near top of the word, on the edge of the primal cut in that area.  Ive been there for 6 months or more.
---
Yeah feels bad. Just happended twice in a row for me. I've even had to chase a fog crawler for 20 seconds, cause for some reason it ran away from me and the barrel, eventhough i shot at it...
---
I rolled laughing at the last part...
---
“Before you ask, no they’re mine you can’t have them.”
---
(I can’t wait for this quest to be added on consoles.)
---
100%
---
Should have realized sooner
---
Animal Friend perk lets you have a camp pet
---
Well I have a build with around 6 to 9 perks into pipe guns and general damage. Which are all multiplicative right now and will be quite fucked and really fucking barely playable when the nerf drops.
---
Hence why I really hope Beth doesn't listen to know-nothings like you.
---
If unpowered vendors can be purchased from, what’s the point of powering them? (Genuine question)
---
Either way, more salt for meeeeee.
---
I’ve only just noticed that, I wrote this half asleep lol so bare with me
---
My unarmed character's been getting quite a workout lol, my max sprinting setup has me chasing down all these enemies who just run away from the event site.
---
Don't hate the player, hate the game.
---
I agree, 30k is not enough  I end up disabling my venders each week because I hit cap and then I just go camp to camp until I find something worth buying.
---
100k would be more appropriate, especially since the most sought after weapons are closer to that range in caps
---
Honestly I’m just getting pissy about magic weapons existing stuff this point
---
That's what I did in whole 6 minutes but still the event has failed LOL
---
So bad!
---
I use explosive, but I have seen comments about the ash piles and the event does get super laggy when someone is there with a Tesla, so yeah explosive is probably best.
---
This. Have a separate room with a locked door and a switch. Only way to protect it
---
Good to know!
---
But I wonder: Does the cookout ever fail? I'm starting to think people are too efficient :D
---
Every one I've been to has been completed in under 4 minutes, most closer to 3.  A couple times I've fast travelled to the event as soon as the notification popped up and it was over by the time I loaded in. 
---
I'm at the point where I don't really understand all the hype for this event?
---
I sell my .38 for 0 caps for new players as well as challenge shoppers. Thanks to all for getting that crap out of my stash.
---
Powering them just advertises your camp on the map and makes it a fast travel point, but it's true only one ever needs to be powered!
---
Yeah that’s it buddy! Smart guy award right here
---
Do the Colossal Problem event and you always get 3 star.
---
Powered vendors appear on the map as a fast travel waypoint. Unpowered vendors do not.
---
Piggsssssssss innnnn spaceeeeeeeee~
---
Turrets are a joke, you're better off saving your camp budget and not placing them at all.  That's what I do
---
So was fasnacht and that rewarded 1 - 3 star weapons/armor. I thought it was a bug like the broken primal cut events. Guess it's intended nvm
---
ohhhh. I will have to try that out.
---
I've noticed that too, I was hoping it's just my luck. I'm not too fussed as I'm enjoying the event but it's a bit odd
---
Same thing has happened to me twice in the last hour. Im just going with it
---
Im glad, i never enjoyed the bloody experience either in 76 or any other game. This would be one good step to bringing me back. Hell maybe ill try out a tanky build
---
I guess you haven’t been playing that long because that happens all the time
---
Edit: Oh and naked super mutants too
---
HeHe! That made me laugh!
---
Ive had my base at the lake in savage divide since day 1 release
---
In otherwords no, im not moving 😚
---
I've just looked into it and it seems 1* is the max aloud on this event. Strange considering we could get some nice 3* gear from fasnacht ha!
---
I quit when they nerfed the TSE weapons lol. I feel bad for everyone who's about to get clapped. Good luck boys...
---
Edit: I quit but came back a couple times.. Especially when Wastelanders released. The last time I quit was because the end game was boring and the Queen never gave me good gear. Just all junk.
---
That moo moo takes wicked dumps
---
Meat week event will only reward 1 star legendaries.
---
I just thought that I would suggest this first before anything else. If it doesn't work u may have to delete then reinstall. Idk
---
Count the spaces from the zeta ship to the last space. That's how many days are left.
---
it's the same problem with legendary scrip, and they just gave us more legendaries from events, my box is overflowing and I cant get rid of them.
---
I also have over 600 notes now, I get around 100 a week now it's insane, all these events giving the notes makenit easy to get 30-60 notes a day now
---
I like the challenge that comes with the budget limit.
---
I shared my experience in a post about daily ops but I've got two commando characters, one bloodied/unyielding and the other full health/vanguard. B2525 fixer vs AAE fixer. At 19% health the bloodied does about 2-3x the damage vs the AAE with demo expert 3. The full health has a lot higher survivability and doesn't get one tapped when serendipity decides to not proc. Because of that the full health actually cleared several of the daily ops *faster* than the bloodied one. This rebalance is a good thing, neither felt gimped. I'd like to see them start tweaking underutilized legendary effects next to bring them more in line now. Take off the penalty on nocturnal, up the damage on berserkers, make stalkers useful for literally anything. Now that the base damage calc is more even there's room to tweak the others and give us a LOT more build diversity than just "handmade or fixer"
---
That’s good, it was honestly more convenient then it had any right to be. Still might be due to unyielding and serendipity but yeah.
---
Wow. Excellent idea. Been dropping steel and never thought of that. Kudos for you.
---
Ooooh okay, that's pretty weird. Thanks for the heads up, I know what to expect now. I got a bloodied plasma caster which is nice I suppose
---
aint gonna lie, I been afking the event like fasnacht, but I keep on the drums or spit to at least help out.
---
Three hundred people, 2 hour rounds, and the whole ass map. It’s wishful thinking, but I think it’s need
---
I have fast traveled away then back to where I was and it would make them appear
---
Bloodied for damage, but honestly I like vampire and low health.  You still do a lot of damage but I was tanking hits that would usually instakill me.
---
Big yes
---
It is fun when it works right. I'm close to 1k hours at this point but the bugs can get old quick for sure.
---
So you can just afk in the drums even before the event starts?
---
and the assaultron is probably athena visiting sofia.
---
Devils advocate here, i liked camps on spawn sites last year, it spiced things up and made it more interesting, like a giant hermit crab spawning in their garage.
---
Supposed to be that way.  Brahmin out front should've told ya.
---
Vampires, instigating (because if the fire rate is really fast, the 2nd and 3rd bullet I think get the instigating bonus), anti armor, bloodied (but that may change because the nerf coming later)
---
Accidentally scrapped my multiscope lol.
---
Did not know that was a thing, assumed it was an ally.
---
Down side is, nothing to grind for except Meat Week. Let's be honest, the rewards lately with events have been weak.
---
Niche weapon... imho no need to change what everyone calls a TSE.
---
Sorry, but im gonna steal this idea!
---
Ah Ill try that, annoying as it is.  Thank you.
---
Yes. 100%.
---
Deathclaws are matriarchs not patriarchs
---
Less worse but still bad. Perk coins should be account wide.
---
I've been saying this to so many people. 
---
Its a great attitude - don't let it feel like a job. Im 20 away from the end, and I never check challenges.
---
I might during the double score weekend but that's it.
---
nah it is stupid if will make my build unable to play as i can now 3-4 shots to kill a legendary supermutant with a s.sledghammer that will be way more on the new "Balanced" and i will need to repair often for little rewards the same on my armour since i will be there reciving more damage, making all my effort so far useless, at least give me a free full reset and stop invalidating people builds to "Balance".
---
I miss tony, my pet deathclaw.
---
 :(
---
20 feet? That's being too grateful. They have less perception that Super Mutants do, they probably can't even see a molerat if it ran past them for two hours. Meanwhile, a molerat can spot you while you're sneaking even with something like +20 agility. Bethesda, please.
---
I guess it kinda depends what you're looking for, but I have a character that's a PA tank build with vampire's heavy weapons and I really enjoy it.
---
Thats an endgame weapon right there.  I got a 3* bloodied fixer a friend gave me for my bloddied build now I just need a furious for my heavy
---
for taming:

---
About scrapping cards, do maxed perk cards scrapped still give only 2 perk coins or 6 perk coins if they are 3 levels?
---
I mean...that sounds hilarious to me. 🤷‍♂️
---
I thought six was the maximum.
---
Usually play 3am to 7am give or take ET if you play during that time add me dimwitt27 I'm not great but I have some stuff and willing to share. I can also kit your mutations to what you want i have most recipes
---
I hadn’t seen anything that said it was 1* so wasn’t sure if it was a bug or bad luck
---
Farmable tiles helped out with this a lot since the game likes to spawn creatures to attack your crops, but they can't attack the crops if you build them on an elevated level, so they just do their usual AI behaviour of 'If I can't attack the thing I'm aggro'd to then I'll just run off to who the hell knows where.'
---
Fallout Hunter: World
---
Fallout Hunter World: Wasteborne
---
I think it could use some more mods too.... as well as a few other heavy guns.
---
Ash Heap, the end boss is always a 1 Star, had it be a 2 Star once or twice. It's also spawned random Legendaries in a wave or two, once a 3 Star.
---
In the Forest, I've never seen a Legendary. In Savage Divide, only once or twice has an end boss been a Legendary, both times a Hermit Crab, one time was a 2 Star. But that is by far the most insanely popular event, with stupidly overpowered players killing everything before you can get there or else no one shows up at all and it's really tough with Yao-Gaui spawns.
---
Yeah New Vegas is overrated your friends are right to mock you.
---
Isn't he saying that they should have just nerfed bloodied and not everything else though...? I don't think he's complaining that bloodied got nerfed only
---
If it's at the Kelley monument or whatever, those animal corpses always despawn on me after a they are dead for a few seconds. There are way too many animals in that area.
---
Meat week might be speeding up corpse clean up just to keep things running smoothly.
---
If I had an award I would award. This is a great idea.
---
Odd, I've been periodically afking on the spits &amp; not taking any rad damage. This character is bloodied so I would typically be returning to a corpse, heh...
---
saving that
---
Mire is crazy hard to me. Their average waves are rough and then a Mirelurk Queen. I've had a Scorchbeast show up -- not sure that was part of a wave or not.
---
ALSO good to know.  That would make sense!
---
low health bloodied/junkies + emergency protocols works well for me; demo expert maxed + BE/JE heavy weapons library (need bear arms) + vamp weaps for an emergency - I do fine at lvl 600 with just a set of excavator - popping 3x formula P is your friend for magic weaps and getting consecutive headshots for queen or Earle
---
Yea he’s been there before I was in the lobby which was 2hrs or 3
---
I keep getting the 'Meat Cleaver' plan over and over again. I kind of want to cry ha ha ha...
---
When Super Duper procs, it always only affects the base amount, not the modified amount. This is true whether it’s ammo or chems, etc.
---
I wish I could tell you. I had a friend place it for me. But I would hope so.
---
Umm... I’m a bit of a newbie to 76. What’s perk coins, if y’all don’t mind me asking?
---
Nope. You didn’t.
---
The main event (BBQ) is on the hour, every hour, so just keep the clock in mind. Prime Cuts can be fun, but usually only for a 1 Star Legendary, if that. I've preferred the Ash Heap area. Forest and Savage Divide are insanely popular and no fun; it's best if you can get two to four other players. If anything, it's a way to get Legendary Scrip.
---
God, that should be cannon.
---
Especially since she encouraged us to launch a nuke rather than just get Lou or the motherlode.
---
What kind of build are you runnin? I have a little bit of everything. Mostly weapons. I have a few select armor pieces too.
---
I am still completely opposed to anything that requires scrapping cards.  It is beyond fucking stupid as once the meta changes you will not be able to switch to a different build. 
---
Anything involving card scrapping is just bad design.  Scrap the whole system don't just reduce costs.
---
I agree. Still fun to try out different stuff
---
I found mine during Riding Shotgun.
---
The spawn site in the Ash Heap is just over the hill from my camp, so I am getting a lot of extra damaging traffic. At first I thought it would be nice getting rewards for the event constantly finishing near me, but it is far more annoying to constantly have your camp overrun by cave crickets and rad scorpions.
---
I love daily challenges. Especially the buy stuff from a player. It makes me find new locations, also when it says kill this amount of creatures or a certain kind, I'll be going everywhere and learning new places and levelling up. I remember getting 3 spots up on the board game just for finishing the daily challenges. It's not really Tedious. I have plenty of food in my inventory and I have a farm to cook stuff. I love the daily challenges and I think getting rid of them is a bad idea. If u don't wanna do them than don't. If u wanna do weekly than do those. But I do see where ur coming from, guess we all play differently and want different things. Dailies are fine and should stay but ig u wanna tweak them go ahead, but I would still want the score and that. I'm fine as is. I'm level 32 defeating level 60 creatures I'm fine. Daily challenges actually go me into the board game. I do not wanna grind more in a day than I already do. But yea I see where ur coming from
---
The perk coin system is fine, level up you'll get more cards
---
Get Gud scrub
---
I've been selling everything I can (mostly plans) at either 6 or 12 caps each. Can't seem to get rid of my inventory fast enough. My plan is to eventually get rid of the vendors. Too much of a hassle to maintain. I can generate more caps by bundling junk and selling weapons i collect on in my travels. The only downside is its nearly impossible to fast travel due to weight. But, I'm at the point now were there aren't many plans left for me to purchase and with ammo converters being so ubiquitous in the game, its getting harder to find vendors selling reasonably priced projectiles.
---
Yup, this happens to me on PS4 regularly.
---
Once you unlock the bullion vendors there's a guy in the wayward who sells bullions. He was upstairs in the office when I found him. He has a weekly limit of 300 bullions (6k caps if you buy all of them).
---
What kind of weapons would you ideally want?
---
My concern is what happens when the meta switches or entire builds become unworkable due to fuckups.  A simple error gutted melee as a build on PTS.  What if you had scrapped hundreds of points to get a build that was suddenly not viable?
---
Assign points per level.  Allow them to be changed easily.  This current system is bad design choices.
---
Sure it may be just setting a path or direction for the future, but I don’t think I’m alone when I say that Bethesda has made plenty of missteps. There’s no guarantee for healthy patches after this. I’m only a level 60 toon myself that’s a stealth sniper build, but every time I look at the benefits of unyielding and bloodied I’m finding it harder to justify not going for it.
---
Fuck yeah! 🤘🤘🤘
---
Awesome stuff looking foward to the legendary perks
---
Annoying, but on the upside, you'll make quite a bit from your vendors if you remain there and install more defenses ;)
---
Yeah if they keep this I think Im done
---
my ps4 does 60 fps max...
---
&gt; I'm anti "endgame meta is killing SBQ solo in 22 seconds and everything else is literally miles behind"
---
I have participated in like ~60 SBQ kills playing this game and only one single time have I seen it die fast in recent memory, and I am pretty sure that was just because there was a cheater present because she literally died instantly upon landing, legit one-shot.
---
Back when you could permanently keep her on the ground she seemed to die quick, but these days, every time I see the event pop up and fast travel down there it takes like 10-15 minutes for her to go down, and like 60% of that time is just afking while she flies huge laps around the area out of range of everyone.
---
No it hasn’t. You are mistaken.
---
Good news is a lot of the rewards sound like they will be purchasable with gold
---
He has those. Bought them last night.
---
My answer is yes.
---
I found one two days ago just setting on a shelf! first floor at National isolated radio array (near the table that has bunch of telephones)
---
Since the PC hotfix, I've had several. Was a wonderful surprise!
---
Try another sub. This one doesn’t allow bartering posts.
---
k
---
If you are kicked every 20 minutes, I would question if the issue is on your end.
---
could you recommend some please?
---
Yeah the way I understand it is you have 6 slots to use, but my question was after you get 6+ legendary cards you can swap them out or if you’re locked in to the original 6. I would assume you could swap them but well, Bethesda. 50 levels would be an expensive mistake
---
Me too. Just save them and sell them in a few months when people will want them.
---
DM sent.
---
I wish we would be able to go to Daily/Weeklies from previous day's aka archives and do them whenever you want.
---
Dunno make it like you open Season1 Legendary Run and you have all 100 days listed there. Just select any day you missed, unlock that X day, then you finish SCORE and unlock another day etc etc.
---
Perhaps some slight payment (caps?) would be needed, but it would be nice in the future you could access all seasons and so for example season 2 during season 4
---
GamerRKO
---
If you have a resource pit most likely 30 other people have their camps in the same spot to harvest it also.
---
thank you!
---
Ah, that would explain it. I'm on console.
---
Yes, when the mobs spawn in the ground, and are untargetable and unkillable, we are clearly scrubbing it up. 🙄
---
Well said!
---
Soon™
---
Sì
---
And miss out on the literal thousand hours of grinding I’ve already put into this game? You’re just trolling, right?
---
Oh, I did get a 3 Star Legendary Sheepsquatch at the end of Ash Heap. It was just me, out of Stimpacks, my partner glitched out. I was past time, but wanted to take him down and drew him into a nearby ruins and finally did it.
---
I sure hope so.
---
Yes. But only with the base amount. Not the amount with ammosmith on. 
---
So if it’s a 100, with ammosmith it’ll be 180. But super duped only adds 50. So a total of 230
---
Yup, you may even get the Super Duper sound, but no jazz.
---
Of course, I would rather get Super Duper on every Radium Rifle I created than my Secret Service armor... sigh.
---
No, that's ridiculous and I hate it. You have to pay real money to get the money you earned out of it.
---
Smart buyer
---
They probably wont increase the cap limit because of people selling caps ive visted a few websites with people selling caps for cheap asf
---
Meanwhile, the guy you are buying from is running around trying to find somewhere to spend caps because he is approaching his limit. And on and on. 
---
I just picture a slow domino effect of people disappearing from their missions one at a time and everyone standing around someone’s vendors while the first guy is just spending caps like nothing’s going on.
---
Congrats, it didn't glitch for you.  The times I've played it, killed the Behemoth only to have the event not complete.  Ran around for a minute or two after looking for enemies, doing laps around the event area.  Might have been a single mole rat underground that never came up for all I know, or a Fog Crawler that ran off toward Watoga instead of toward the drum.
---
The events are hit or miss.  You got a hit.  Many people experience misses.
---
Sorry it read that way, I genuinely did not mean that with snark.
---
People seem to think the rewards are end game content.  They are not content. 
---
The legendary run was meant as another reason to keep you playing daily and reward you for that. If its ruining your enjoyment then do not actively participate and try to finish it. 
---
A ton of the end game is just grinding anyways.  So do what you enjoy.
---
I was at someones camp and left traps than kill people when they get close to the vending machines. I was looking to buy .45 ammo but found death instead, such a dick
---
I wondered about this. Somebody came to mine yesterday and bought tons of stuff...took me near the limit. I assumed it would block sales as the train station vendors do. Thats not right!
---
After I left the group I was running with I’ve left that game for about a week
---
Hm, I see him often but I suspect that's because I spent a lot of time taking workshops. He walks along the path next to many workshops...
---
What does that have to do with anything? Very few people do pvp in this game, and switching it to only affect human npcs would make it worthwhile. With the damage cap being easily reached without the effect, it’s pointless. My own death to my friend goofing around is irrelevant.
---
Why not let it be both?
---
They should place the Cap Limit to 100k tbh.
---
They haven't released the fix for it yet
---
I dont mind, like I said the peace and quiet usually are worth the trade off. Plus they're easy pickings from the roof with missle turrets
---
What would be the point? Do you even use the effect yourself over furious, anti-armor or something better?
---
I learned this lesson the hard way too. I had someone buy up all of my serums and some ammo. Now I make sure to keep a better eye on my caps
---
So when you kill everything and you’re timer says 2 minutes to go but you get the event failed come up. How have we screwed this up?
---
Bloodied.  Emergency Protocols is OP.  Even after the 'nerf'.
---
I get bears wolves and sodding mole rats
---
I wish they had a baseless option to use our own foundations
---
Doesnt protect it then either if you know a trick or two. Or they just pick a lock and give no fucks. Safest but less convenient way is to store the machines. Or swap the door wall out to a plain wall
---
My concern is what happens when my rank 4 legendary card is broken during an update.
---
Oh really? I’ve been wondering for such a long time if I could do that. Thanks!
---
Edit: to clarify, I’ve been wondering if I could sell shit and not have it on the map. I kinda like the peaceful solitude that the game has (behind all the predictable mayhem).
---
3 capper here.
---
Holy shit, I forgot Meat Cleavers exist.  Speaking of Throwables...  Bethesda should add Perks for players who want to use Non-Explosive Throwing Projectables as weapons.
---
If you throw a grenade and the vats you can shoot your grenade in the air which can often allow you to instantly down multiple targets at once or sometimes entire teams.
---
Early next week it looks like?
---
You can modify a std baseball bat to half a dozen different colours
---
ASSaultrons and leveled gutsys.. only mobs in the game I carry a specific weapon for
---
Me and my Aquaboy perk agree. Only melee and harpoons allowed.
---
Acp on console yet?
---
Same problem here sometimes I die and sometimes it does what it should. It quite random though. 
---
I also killed myself 3 times today with a diluted radaway, and with my psychobuff I heal my rads by around 20%😅
---
 Well I'll go back to my corn soup and tato juice dont want to mess up whit my diet 🙃
---
The problem with this buff is the timing and I’m still unsure what good this does other than making the same old content even more stale. I’ve spent 1,300 hours collecting and utilizing weapons and armor revolving around a bloodied build. You have no idea how much work it was. Bloodied should be the strongest build. It should be slightly nerfed for sure. 
---
My problem is blatant laziness. Instead of giving us more build options that are viable this is the big change? People are still going to use the same build, it’s still the meta, and all this becomes is an inconvenience.
---
I just don’t understand why other legendary effects can’t be reworked with simple equations so we actually have a choice other than bloodied. Two years and the legendary pool is still wasted.
---
I also don’t understand all the hate on bloodied players. Just playing the game directionless or using weapons and armor organically found my first 100 levels just wasn’t working out. Bloodied provided a more realistic play style for me imo. If I shot something a few times it died. I relied on sneak and can be easily killed. It felt so unnatural to be a sponge and shoot other bullet sponges.
---
I’m doing my part
---
Pretty sure Bethesda using some garbage engine from like 1997 on this game 🤦‍♂️
---
Agreed. I do the dailies cuz they easy. Theyre what brought me back to fallout 76. I know most of the stuff I won't use but I'm a hoarder. I want everything lol. I think the game is fun, I don't grindf or bullion or scrip, idek how to get it, it doesn't bother me.  It's like eh. If I get it I get it. I don't care for legendarys like bloodied. I do what I think is fun. And that's surviving off of cram and purified water. Lol
---
Gonna be all about the berserkers armour with fall damage and breathe underwater! It will synergy nicely with the nocturnal rolling pin with improved durability!!!!
---
To vent
---
The whitespring, there are level 0 locks all over the places
---
For a second I thought you were talking about a very different pair of binoculars.
---
Rank 96 right now! Definitely gonna have to do that when I get it!
---
That'd be awesome, one of each, or even some very random ones. If they give them extreme personalities it would be even better, like, imagine having to, for some reason, fight Beckett to death
---
It only completes about 50% of the time so congrats on that I guess🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Anywhere scorpions f up the timers hiding in the ground
---
My camp is right beside it , just to solve this problem for everyone . Plus it’s meat week inspired and totally badass .
---
Mostly nice for the plans and clothing. Newcomers/low levels are the one's who'll really get something out of this since the event gives some nice experience and starter items
---
Well, I hope you have a wonderful life then
---
"I have 4 endgame characters, 3 are bloodied, 1 is junkies "
---
Yea, these builds will still have decent damage. People with either build will go "It sucks, but it's not so bad." or something along those lines. For those of us that don't run either build, it's not going to be so great. Unlike many who claim to quit a game, I'm not going to be playing if my normal build character has to deal four times or more damage to every single enemy in the game.
---
Exactly.  It’s not worth bloating my inventory to carry a dozen weapons when I’m fighting something different everywhere I go.
---
Am I just remembering shit wrong or did it also only give you one star combat armor last year?
---
I did.
---
You denying it only impedes you from just trying it. I'll keep getting extras, you can keep doing what you're doing.
---
 OP have you seen [this video yet?](https://youtu.be/n3SIT5xlLxI)
---
Your post reminded me of it, a fairly similar situation.
---
Save your levels. I know I will.
---
It would be cool for them to repurpose the 4 horsemen power armor skins into bosses and you need to kill all 4 to complete the event.
---
If you are struggling you can always find a lvl 0 then server hop, usually it will be locked again but empty(normal loot rules still apply)
---
I do it once a week and it works everytime, you either haven't tried it or youre just not doing it right.
---
Lots of broken meat piles for me. Occasion enemy falling into the ground. But its mostly been at active events like primal cuts.
---
Exactly. Bragging about being a bloodied build and one shotting everything like they are so big and tough. It’s funny because I just sit there and am like what is the entertainment. And then if they die I just think, good thing you have overpowered things because you really aren’t better than anyone. Especially if they one shot a legendary when there’s other trying to tag it, I just joking their team and put sun kissed on. Haha
---
I haven't seen the numbers, but the issue I had wasn't that that was the end game is that any other choice I was laughing bad.
---
Bloodied and junky aren't just the best choice they where the only good choice. Double shit is miss leading when really it's barrly worth its name sake. The msg buffs to a type of enemy is a bad primary effect. 
---
The game revolves around weight and weight management. So to carry around even 5 different weapons will cost you something. All for a 40% boost to something you rarely have to fight.
---
And saying that we need to lower the bar to make new end game content is super wrong. It brakes every rule of an mmo. Stuff should be pushed. Numbers should be crunched. The end game should be like the "end" 
---
Rather than making stuff worse why can't they bring other play styles up? Make to so theirs more ways to play?  Make new effects remove ones that players hate and never want. 
---
Idk if every weapon need to be viable. Cause then we will have a game where nothing really matters. No reason. To grind or work to anything cause it will all suck just as much as what I have now.
---

---
Ah you seem to be talking about weapons, We weren’t on the same page then.  I apologize
---
My missile turret is the only one that seems to work, everything else only seems to target the random trader that shows up at my camp.
---
Is this still a thing ?
---
Imo not worth it. Level 95 now, almost at the end. I am not doing this another time for those paultry rewards. Timegating kills it. Just get the first thing every season, like the ammo converter.
---
Can confirm: PA + Vampire's = solid Tank build
---
I found a blue one once when i was a lower level and didn't know it was rare so i threw it..
---
Now i regret it.
---
They've really got to rework/buff other builds so we actually have others to choose from, other than two builds being outstandingly better than the rest.
---
O.0
---
Yes. This year gives weapons now as well
---
you won't miss out on the thousand hours of grinding because you had those experiences and that can't be taken away from you, I'm not trolling its just your looking at it from a place of entitlement. It's not a far fetched idea if your going to continue playing then you are definitely going to level up which obviously mean more perk cards = perk coins.
---
Duplicate the occurrence and record it. 
---
Because no one that’s claimed that has ever been able to provide valid documentation.
---
You may have heard the notification sound and seen the pop-up. But that’s a glitch.
---
That’s the closest you’ve come; you *think* it happened, but it didn’t.
---
I kinda wished they had a message that popped up thanking mr for playing and ask for some feed back for season 2 or something...  .but then I realized they don't really care that much.....
---
Xbox
---
Still would have liked to see it a flat 100 but it's the same thing in the end and a big improvement. Good and good.
---
i think the Pearly Peepers you got for completing the Sheepsquach quest line does just that (you only get one, and i scrapped mine)
---
But then i'll miss out on the *thunk* my shovel makes as I murder my 76th chicken of the day.
---
~~Can't we hate both?~~
---
Yeah if I ever go back to PA, I'll be using using vampires, instigating and anti armor the most. I just can't get let go of unyielding at the moment lol
---
Just fyi, first meat week I got four tenderizers and made bank off of them.  Second one got 3 and sold them all too. They aren't really a great weapon and now that the plan can be learned.....sell that shit.  They are heavy as hell and you don't want it in your stash.
---
On your idea, something similar to showing all season rewards for that spot.  Like spot 10 for season 1 was atoms, season 2 is a gun skin, and season 3 is a armor skin. When you hit that level or spot, you have a choice of either of those.
---
Once you do, you now move to spot 11 which has all items from the seasons and continues that way. What happens when you hit level 100, you restart/unlock a legendary card/slot.  You could call it mutate. I would still keep the scrapping cards for coins for the legendary system in the ptr.
---
Definitely toxic valley. Fucking radtoads are always running ridiculously far away. I e had the most success with cranberry bog and ash heap.
---
A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon.'
---
All colors can be crafted except for Pink, Indigo and Yellow specifically and these 3 sell for thousands of caps
---
Seeing and hearing the notification isn’t proof that it procced. 
---
It doesn’t proc when crafting legendary armor or weapons.
---
Oh cool. Are you talking about the "Unsolved" quests? If so, I started those a week ago so I should try to complete it for that.
---
Yup Pink is one of the uncraftable ones and is a rare drop which is why I'm offering 20,000 caps for a Pink Lvl 45 bat
---
Sounds like this would take workforce from the main game development, and it needs a lot of workforce.
---
I'm part of a group called United 76 Military. We have a lot of service personnel in the group. I myself am a serving infantry soldier. Be glad to have you
---
Probably done close to 40 of them now and only failed once which was in the savage divide. My go to's are Ash Heap for the acid in crickets and savage divide for acid in Yao guais. Never had a problem at Ash Heap at all.
---
Are you still selling your AA FFR Gatling?
---
Then document it with a recording and post it here. 
---
Super Duper doesn’t proc on Legendary Crafting.
---
Show your proof or retract your claim.
---
“Unnamed”. “Certain cheats”. Wow. Sounds like nothing of value here.
---
Yes PLEASE nerf the gauss shitgun. It is way op especially when perked for it. If someone is shooting at u with one, it lags your game causing u to freeze in place while they kill u. Its trash. Also there are way to many grenades being found and not enough stim packs. People only ever want to throw grenades now and v.a.t.s. them. We do need some kind of defense perk card from explosives in this game.
---
Thanks for sharing. I love the action shots, very cool!
---
You should be able to find it cheaper by vendor hopping. Brick building set isn't rare. 
---
And this isn't the trade sub reddit.
---
The issue with fully armored players 10 seconds into a match is the differential lag when loading. It can be upwards of 30 seconds. You've been in for 10, but they've been in for 40.
---
Sounds good. Guess I dont have Alzheimer's today, not sure what tomorrow will bring...
---
That’s right he is but that would be impossible since all they did was change a x to a +. That’s what I was saying.
---
Changing the frame of a house changes its shape. You may add on and remove from the exterior but that dosent solve a problem if the frame needs changed.
---
You vats them in the air
---
Prove it.  I've crafted a least 50 Gauss minis, one at a time.  I check each gun after crafting to see if it's worth anything or just scrip.  Every single time I've gotten the Super Duper proc, it's been only a single gun crafted, not two.  You are remembering wrong, observing wrong, or lying.  Provide evidence or GTFO.
---
Upvote for "Shitgun". Lol
---
the exact quest you get them from is " Baa Baa Black Sheep" a part of the Lying Lowe  Side Questline
---
Isn't that 150 level ups to max one card? that's still ridiculous
---
Aren't both of them season rewards though? I came across a workshop that had both of them built in it. Not sure we have access to future atom shop items or do we?
---
Alright thanks
---
Once you have your shops unpowered, you disappear from the map. If i need to shut my vendors off for caps I do not join a pub team so they can't see my camp and then it's just up to pure random chance someone finds it. 
---
Even if they do the shops are behind a 3* lock in a bunker, yes it can be picked by anyone over level whatever, but it's still a good deterrent. Most people, myself included, don't want to bother with the hassle of a wanted flag.
---
If you're in a highly traveled area, probably store your shops. If you're like most of us and in some obscure spot that happens to have a deposit it's extremely unlikely someone will come across it. The only powered down shops I've come across were people who built VERY close to me when I lived over by Twin Lakes and I could see them from my door
---
Make more characters, find an honest friend, and transfer
---
I was really hoping that too. I hope they eventually add working arcade games.
---
Yeah. I wish they didn't. I wish they tweaked some to additive because damage can get ridiculous. Plus, the new legendary perks would make us even stronger, so I agree with some nerfing, but, just changing almost everything to additive is a lazy remedy.
---
Edit: Also, make other builds/weapon classes a little stronger, pistols, berserkers, comes to mind.
---
he appears at the cook out near vault 76 on the hour
---
Fair enough :)
---
In that sense this guy has been effective removing his threats lol
---
Preach!
---
Yeah I have moved on also to other game, there is a fix for this bug thatI tested and it works but I don't really care anymore, it is not worth it to spend my time in a game with trillions of bugs and liar devs.
---
I love how many people took the time to comment just to say, "no, I'm not moving."
---
Wait are legendary cards different per character? I thought you could rank up a card and use it no matter the character
---
Hmm instigating still works by doubling damage on full hp. What’s to say they may or may not add in some multiplicative modifiers to things. 
---
But that’s something for Beth to consider. They have said this change was the first step. We are still in pts phase.
---
Many times i have helped a low lvl player and we sort of became friends and started playing together. That’s how i met people to play with. Feel free to add me tho if you need someone to play with! Psn: NikkiWierden
---
Would be nice if any excess caps you get would go to your Stash, right?
---
You're what's wrong with the game, co-signing terrible ideas and finding work arounds to problems that shouldn't even be there. This damage nerf didn't do shit.
---
Seems like a bit much for just RP.  Just find some Blood Eagle camps, they are always hostile.  You'll want to increase both faction reps as much as you can for the Gold Bullion plans.
---
Armor is a different story. For those, assassins should have a counter part effect for players specifically. Perhaps Pro-Tec, for bonus protection against dwellers.
---
A lot of the player base has felt like this season was a slog.  I don't think the login every day model is working.  Since I finished the run I've been having more fun playing the game how I want.
---
Thats fallout.  A RPG game that allows the player freedom to choose how they play.  That's why the multiple builds and prefixes make it so unique.  Yes you get the bloodied meta.  But even still you get to try out so many different styles.  
---
The new events.  Riding shotgun. Rad rumble, Earle, free range,  encryptid, are all fantastic steps forward.  Compare those to powering up and the messenger.  Now the addition of scrip and billion is nice.  But the limits are not.  The dailies need looking at, which they are and players in the PTS are very positive about it.  
---
So many great changes are being made.  It's just a shame these caps and restrictions are  being implemented to limit our enjoyment in a session.  It feels very mobile esque and preditory.  
---
But with all that said the devs and community managers seem to be taking more feedback on board.  Changes to the legendary perks now give more coins.  Camp items that are requested weekly are coming out.  Actual balancing in the works with the recent damage changes.  The only thing stopping progress now is the engine and tech debt incurred.
---
Yeah instigating is gonna one of my mains (I still use some here and there), vampires and anti armor. It just bothers me how damage perks make little to meh difference now.
---
You can get 1400 from the vendors selling to them. You can do this every day. So in one day you’ll have the caps you need.
---
No, I believe it’s all Cloudsaved
---
Me too
---
Nuclear winter just needs a massive update for things that would provide easy quality of life improvements. Some of which are pretty standard for BR's and embarrassing for Bethesda not to have.
---
For example one of the biggest killers; give us a way to edit perks as well as outfit outside of waiting for a game. 
---
I know they plan to add the vault as an exploration thing soon tm but hopefully that comes with needed updates to NW.
---
No because i know where everything is to get my NW Score ... lol (yeah a new map would be fun)
---
You too bud!
---
I love the mg-42, but it burns bullets like no other. Gave it up due to spending as much time getting lead and acid to feed the beast than using it. I still drag them out for fun but as a primary weapon, it's too bullet hungry. Sounds like this might be the weapon to use after the next patch that would destroy slower cyclic  weapons. So I'm all for something to make ammo cheaper to make.
---
Bringing up the favourite or emote wheel also skips the reward notification i think
---
This right here. Had a bunch of asylum dresses in vendor. Some guy comes buys two for 15k each (I already had 10k in hand) then I though...oh well at least he's done and didn't hop servers.. some few minutes later SAME person bought two more for 15k and 18k...all went to the max demon. Frustrating that they can carry around so much gifts and keep spending even when we can't stash that much.
---
Whats the max caps?
---
 But they scrap for wood and steel! And I’m burning a LOT of wood this week with all the meat to cook.
---
Allegedly
---
&gt;If we had NV system they could charge me $5 to respec everytime and I wouldn't even be mad about it.
---
Don't be giving them ideas.
---
Just giving you some good-natured shit my man. It's all good
---
Yeah this is why I only build in the Forrest.  I get so tired of rebuilding the camp or fighting super mutants every time I wanna go make some corn soup or sleep at my camp.   It’s too annoying.  There should be a pacifist mode in camps...just like in pvp.
---
I suppose that they wanted people to branch out more on perk cards. 
---
If they go through with this I would be able to switch to use some str perks that I would never use due to removing just 1 point from a damage perk can modify damage quite a bit when multiplicative. 
---
This allows players who strictly want to be dps can be while others who want more utility suffers a bit less.
---
Nah it’s all server side I think.
---
My biggest problem is when people queue up SBQ.. and then demolish it while giving others almost no chance to get a hit. A couple times I’ve gotten there and didn’t even get a hit. It was sad. :(
---
The might be a fair statement if the exp to level - leveled off.  But those levels are going to be very expensive to replace.
---
All I’m getting is beer stein plans. Lol
---
&gt; -imagine fighting a bunch of lvl 100 mirelurk queen under water and having the need to go and breath from time to time wile you wear a PA or hazmat suit so you dont die fro toxic water so you don´t die.
---
I don't think i'll be participating in such a headache.
---
The real thing to point out here is you had 10k of one ammo, not 10k ammo total but with 300 of each type in the game lol
---
The first 50 levels will suck and be a grind. By the time you get to about 140 you'll be cruising along nicely.
---
This summed up my issue. I shouldnt have had any expectations given their track record but I keep fooling myself. Dont get me wrong I enjoy the game, but all the sht they've pulled has destroyed my blind love for bethesda and leaves me feeling some way. This was just the nice small cherry ontop after stripping away daily atom challenges that where initially advertised as part of the product.
---
I mean, they added the insult bot after experiencing major player backlash and lawsuits so you would think they could add a small thing to show they arent just promoting communism through a game that's nearly as time gated as a mobile app combined with "free to play" monetized game mechanics..
---
-End rant- (sorry!)
---
Yeah, I agree. That's what I was trying to say. 
---
Jesus y'all are fucking picky on this sub. Sorry it wasn't worded in a way that you approve of. 
---
Must be lonely being the type of person to constantly pick and bitch about someone's wording on the net...
---
Why waste my time with someone like you. Be the salty person you are🤣
---
I run with a BOS detatchment. More than wrlcome to join us when you feel you are able. Have plenty of ammo, weapons, and armor to get you suited for the wasteland. Gt Narmyknight.
---
I see what you're saying, I just would think they would target people who use unoptimized builds who use "magic/bugged" shotguns and other weapons which kill almost everything in seconds, without much damage perks. Making damage perks less useful may force some players to actually use magic and legacy guns even more now.
---
I really hope it gets modified a bit before it officially releases. Or, like you said, future buffs.
---
I just hit rank 100. I have completed a daily challange after I hit 100 but the score bar did not progress further. It stays like this =&gt;  S.c.o.r.e Rank 100/100    0/3475. Did not earn atoms either.
---
Stash boxes in build mode.
---
Even before I started reading this post, I was feeling pretty confident that this was going to involve Workshop PvP. 
---
*If only there was some sort of warning that PvP could occur in a workshop when you went to claim one.  Maybe a pop-up or something?*
---
/s (Just in case)
---
yeah that's good balance between the devs wanting a system to keep leveling valuable (thus a huge investment) and players actually wanting to get the cards they want finished at a decent rate.
---
stashboxes
---
Care to share a how to on that? I've wanted to use more complicated wiring in my camp.
---
My only full character got through the entire game solo and unarmed(as in no weapons, not fist based weapons). Obviously people showed up to fight the queen. But whenever I could go solo, I did.
---
So yeah, the game might need some balancing
---
I looked there and nothing. Is it towards the top or bottom?
---
What do you mean, I do a sneak rifleman, I wear broken SS armor, there’s no really good armor, since the great ones give bonus dr, I use a broken SS chameleons chest peice only for the jet pack, I mean my Br/E handmade gets 110 damage on auto with out one card into auto, 215 on harden reciver. It’s pretty good, but after the nerf it won’t be that good
---
Still a helluva grind.... god
---
That's how I play anyways, little progress is ever made, but fun is achieved.
---
unyielding has always been good for most builds (except the low protection ones), but it's even more true in the PTS.
---
However, you might need to use different protection sometimes. Daily ops with robots are nasty, you can take massive amount of damages.
---
Drums, spits, and fire patrol are highly underrated. Raising the bar is one thing, but those can stop it from dropping entirely.
---
 I got a 3 star assassin's Tenderizer earlier, it has +50% limb damage and +1 str I believe.  Dumb assassin's =/
---
Thats where my camp is!
---
***Translation:*** *I’ve just realized I’m probably wrong, but I’m too scared to admit that.*
---
Burden of proof is on the claimant. That’s you.
---
Top just below the plain blue and yellow box. It looks similar but is slightly taller.
---
First day of meat week a guy had is camp foundation literally blocking the barrel to start it. A little explosive bait and we were off to the races. 
---
As long as it is clear of certain elements, normally people will show up to keep the base intact.
---
How? Ever time I try to sell something they'll but it for like 3-4 caps tops, thats a lot of stuff to get 1400
---
No pictures.
---
For shame!
---
It's a non-combative event, no rad toads, no super mutant suiciders, no trying to keep robots alive, just killing a bunch of furry woodland creatures. (Ok. Wrong on the furry part) 
---
Maybe they should just reward scrip but complaining it doesn't reward 3* items is really being spoiled.
---
I'd swap servers if that happens. It's probably the same people in each event one shoting the legendaries.
---
Nerf endgame? I won't be happy but fine, don't nerf base stats, perk cards and weapon mods as well though, because you're just fucking over the early game players!
---
Ugh mine is yellow NW, orange NW, standard, little NW, foot locker, cooler, the rest....is there usually a delay in adding it?
---
I like the gauss shotgun. In my opinion, it is to shotgun builds what the handmade is to commando builds, or the 50 cal is to heavy weapon builds. I say this as someone who’s been melted by gauss shotguns and as someone who melts others with gauss shotguns.
---
Love to know the answer. I know it’s a great weapon, but having to charge it really diminishes the value.
---
God the truth is so salty, it burns!
---
I thought he was at posidein
---
Server based homie
---
I wouldnt be suprised if they started selling perk card packs in the Atom Shop.... If thats case they should introduce more Perks with every update
---
My CAMP is on the Savage Divide and Cranberry Bog border right next to a relay tower. Scorched constantly came up and destroyed a wall or two which was annoying so I made a line of turrets.... they all got destroyed and they brought maybe one scorched down to half health
---
The whole areas are absolutely littered with loot items.  Ive been picking them up and selling/scrapping them. Seems a lot of people arent bothering to loot on kill though. When I saw how much crap was laying on the ground when I loaded into my first Primal Cuts ever yesterday my immediate thought was "This cant be good". I was literally kicking objects out the way as I was moving around
---
Buying something for 0 caps doesn't count toward the challenge unfortunately. giving away .38 to new players is nice though.
---
Just cause they twitch, doesn't mean they're alive though.
---
I don’t trust vendors behind doors that can be locked lol.
---
Hustle hustle. You can sell weapons and armor instead of scrapping them for a while. 
---
Run around the forest collecting wood. Bulk it and sell it to the vendors. If you have the woodchucker perk you double collecting.
---
The more he digs in his heels, the funnier it gets.
---
You sell cores for 15? What platform are you on?
---
Don't you have to get it from the atom shop first?
---
Everyone does this.
---
Been awesome seeing the responses. I get a new headset Monday night. In the meantime if anyone wants to meet/share some sweet sweet loot lmao, DM me and I'll shoot ya my snap or somehting. And my build is all over the place. 
---
I do have some semi good armor. Have a set of sentinal BOS armor. 
---
I would preferable like a Handmade of 3\* Obviously TSE is preferable nbut also expensive. 
---
Really any high level legendary would be great right now. I've been out for a little and don't know the meta anymore lmao
---
This is very good news, a perfect balance IMO, yet some people will still complain I feel like
---
I swear this community makes this mess of a game as good as it can be. Like if the community wasn't so great this shit would be dead as soon as you finish exploring the map and complete the Wastelanders quests.
---
Thank you :)
---
If someone finds my unmarked camp and picks a lock they can shop. The caps don’t mean that much to me 😂
---
Fun fact: It works with Power armor crafting, resulting in duplicate armor pieces on the same frame.  Always gives me the heebie jeebies so I remove the extra part and scrap it, but I guess you could probably exploit the system somehow and have double mods or something.
---
So we’re getting Mannequins and PA stands this coming week? Awesome
---
I have stash boxes outside of the door and inside next to the vendors. I make it as clear as possible it’s not a trap base
---
They were bugged so anyone in the PTS could build one. That's happened before with ATX items, I haven't logged into the PTS yet today but it's probably fixed or will be
---
The most I've done to document it was count the amount of modules I have and count the number of items I have following. Only a dummy would check after everyone. 
---
I literally just did it with my SS armors I got 5 extra that time. 
---
I've heard the noise and keep going. Maybe yours are bugged, maybe this game is absolute garbage and is inconsistent in everyway, maybe some people get a bad bugs and others get better features. Who knows.
---
If this post is still relavent by the time I do it again I'll be glad to post before and after SS.
---
At the end of something like this your first thoughts shouldn't be "finally done" or "was that the end".
---
Yeah, it'd be nice to see a acknowledgement of it and for them to say they'll do something. I just work at a company that builds most of the software they use internally and I'm the one who's job it is to put the code the developers wrote onto the servers and make it run, so I've seen the different teams working on different parts and seen some of what bugfix sometimes looks like. So I just wanted to say that just because A is happening, it doesn't mean that B isn't or even that A is a higher priority than B.
---
EDIT: Clarifying my job
---
I have a queen killing base. It’s designed to have her land on a platform where everyone can easily shoot her. I’ve more or less figured out her aggro and landing oddities. She only doesn’t land if she can’t reach people that has aggro. I actually never see stun locking in the air. You GET aggro by shooting her first before anyone else. I haven’t figured out how you lose aggro but it does sometimes happen. There are specific geometry that the queen likes landing on, this is easy to figure out with my base but you can kind of tell on the world too. It all boils down to this. If she’s not landing - move to the open.
---
No. It is server saved. I’ve installed the game on a new PC and had all my progress.
---
It would be nice for atom shop stuff to work properly but that would be a burden I wouldn’t want someone else to carry
---
If I see a fellow vault dwellers camp being sniped while I’m shopping I will gladly help by finding and killing that one super mutant a mile away. Spotlights have improved my rockets in the past but idk how really helpful they are so I wish someone like Angry Turtle would test camp defenses.
---
Gotta do drums and rubber band your right stick so camera spins around
---
He wasn’t there but the event started
---
Go into photo mode and put a rubber band around your joysticks.
---
I’ve been traumatized fam. It’s hard to trust in these wastelands.
---
My suggestion is stay clear of all workshops, there are always going to be people like the one you bumped into going out of their way to hunt PvE players with full PvP builds. They are looking for easy cap farms and easy kills, they engage players they know they can win against and love to see frustration and knowing they are frustrating you. The workshops are the only PvP forced locations that are always up so they are constantly on the prowl to engage and kill for fun; they could care less about the resources.
---
Sure thing. Post it. 
---
We won’t hold our breath. 
---
And make sure it’s in a single uncut run. No edits.
---
I'm glad you think you're so funny without even making a joke. It's like borderline psychotic🤣
---
No, but you will lose your photos
---
I bought the last 10 spaces on the board just for a longer break, the daily level up was killing me....... I had plenty of time too finish too as I was 12 spaces ahead of Gorbo or whatever his alien ass is called.
---
You on console or pc? The patch wasn’t released on console yet.
---
&gt; **Waste Management:** The Assaultron boss in **The Burrows** now scales up more appropriately with player levels. 
---
I don't see anything from **Daily Ops** here. Don't they mean just the normal end enemy you can always find it the Burrows? Correct me if I'm wrong
---
Atm, I'm at work. I'm not sure though.
---
