Also make sure youre alone or somebody might grab your stuff!!

---
---
Thanks so much!! I think the cat in the tree is my fav part.
---
For once !! Haha. Thanks!
---
oh I've heard of that long ago.  sucks it's still broken for you.  I thought they fixed it but can't confirm.
---
My theory is that there's more content related to the Burrows. For example, you mentioned a dive suit. I vaguely recall that only after you mentioned it :) - thanks! There are a few places that come to mind when thinking about a dive suit. There was a single inaccessible tunnel that I found in the Burrows. It seemed as if it went somewhere, but I couldn't find any way to open it. In contrast, there was another similar tunnel that was accessible when unlocked by rotating a nearby wheel. A dive suit might also make sense in the reservoir (I never explored there after the Burrows came out, only before), in one of the ponds I mentioned in the original post, or in the tunnels beneath Dyer Chemical. There is a lot of connection between Dyer Chemical, Harpers Ferry, and the Free States. There were some new notes added to Harpers Ferry related to sentient ghouls, I believe. Those ghouls ended up at Dyer, no?

---
I tried for the longest time to solve it on my own, but the trail went cold, so I'm hoping the community can spot something I've missed.
---
Could the Sonic Emitter have damaged the pipeline?
---
Glad you like him that was my husbands character. The white suite was part of the tuxedo clothing set back from new years not sure if it's still in the shop.
---
I wonder if it makes him legendary.  I've seen him as a Lego 3 out of 30something times. hmmm
---
I have all the first batch of mounts, I'm patiently awaiting the rest. 😳
---
Awe thanks!! That's a bummer...I think the bunny one is one of my fav masks too. Hopefully they will bring it back.
---
not nuked I mean to say
---
So, if it's going to apply a mod, it won't show you a breakdown of what components it's going to consume. If it going to use a known mod, a breakdown of the resources pops up right before you craft it. That's how I caught it. It wasn't telling me what mats it will use.
---
I’m 99% sure that in f04 they could do this. I clearly remeber farming for explosive miniguns by reloading interior cells of fort strong and waiting until the super mutant in question was shooting explosive bullets.
---
and if you're a bloodied unarmed build like me.  the burrows doesn't get radiated so you can wear your regular gear.  no power armor neccissary, but the benefits of nuked enemies.
---
That's exactly what I was talking about: very few people will even consider going in v94 for the plans under current circumstances, considering how unreliable and tedious it is to get them. Some might want to do it but most people won't even go near vault 94. I still have to hear from anyone to say they're loving it and let's be honest, these raids are simply in such a bad shape that I'm not surprised that very few of us are ready to dedicate their time running them. The quality of the content and risk/reward ratio is not even there, there's too much to be improved still for many of us to consider this as a valid time sink.
---
Enjoy the turkey!
---
Cait for me.
---
thanks I can never find enough
---
&gt; But hey it feels too late because most the community flipped their shi
---
No, about 20-30 whiners, not "most of the community".
---
I’m here to serve.
---
Expand on your problem? Have a similar weapon, interested. ;)
---
My wife hates watching murder mysteries with me lol. Halfway in, I'm tensing up every time the someone is alone with the "unrevealed" killer haha.
---
Haha for sure !!
---
In what region does the game cost less than $18?
---
That’s how you do it
---
throw it on the eventually pile
---
Will do. Killing her now. :)
---
sounds like you're out of range
---
&gt;Bethesda's realized it's a lot easier to just profit off of them than it is to remain in the good graces of their most passionate fans.
---
It went right over your head that the people spending thousands of dollars on this game \*ARE\* Bethesda's most passionate fans.  Being the noisiest and most talkative on social media does not equate to "most passionate".
---
unplug it for 30 seconds and then plug it back in again
---
666 upvotes...
---
Somebody get this man a gold please
---
He says as if people don't do exactly that on this sub? Meanwhile, you followed them onto another sub just to check on their posting history..... who tf does that? Just ignore them and move on.
---
BRB, gonna make an indignant post about some horse that's been beaten to death for months. Gotta get that sweet sweet reddit gold.
---
grandpa is that you?
---
Nowadays? Let's not let start that nonsense. I've been in corporate longer than I care to admit and I've had emails from 60 YO directors that *I'm like... that's not how you use a semi colon. Why TF is that an Oxford comma?? Ok look. The button at the top of outlook does bullet points. No... Don't bullet that. Bullet the bit below that's listing... what? No!*
---
Yeah this is exceptionally cool information.  I also think there is something more to the giant nuclear dump/workshop in the far south. Can't remember the name but I have a feeling there's a lot more to it.  I fought of a wave there once and one of the enemies was impossibly stuck under the map just below one of the buildings.....
---
I think they gave it to anybody that signed up before they fix the bug , ticket or not.
---
Idk if you’re talking about me, but I didn’t check anyone’s posting history 😂
---
I haven’t got a clue where the fuck you got that from mate
---
I can verify that on PS4 if you delete a picture in game it will still be in the fo76 folder on the PS4. And bonus, all your pictures from BETA will be in a separate fo76beta folder on your ps4. The glory days, we were so innocent.
---
It's a much better game than I expected. Got about 2 months play out of it. Looking forward to expansion.
---
Wowza, saved me some atom. That picture is SUPER misleading if you can't put plates on it.
---
The only issue with someone priming your weapon for you is you have no way of making the ammo.
---
Blue baller's should be called incel's ^^^just ^^^saying
---
Perhaps I don't need to know who you are, but I'd bet a limb that you are ratty.
---
Your clickbait is quite late.
---
[removed]
---
can you show us a pic of your camp so we can make them ourselves?  if not I understand.
---
Im confused, isnt the magazine what determines your round capacity?
---
False. I signed up first day and received nothing.
---
I took a few days off of the game to play something else.  I don't remember it being this unpleasant.  :(
---
The "faster reload" legendary perk doesn't seem to work anymore.  As a result, every 10 rounds I get to spend a second or so reloading my gun in the middle of a fight.
---
Has a Primed Handmade always had this low of a capacity, or did it get changed recently?
---
I don’t, I had to reload because it happened to me, don’t even know how it happened
---
Nope. I didn’t get anything.
---
We all rock the Raider emblems
---
There is a hidden chamber in black water mine.........right next to the Whitesprings.
---
I can on my charisma build
---
Killed ny first legendary tonight aswell. The body disappeared so couldn't loot it. But luckily managed to get two more down later.
---
Didnt they also say they're slowly rolling it out for everyone?
---
You cant win with some people. People lost stuff, got mad, bethesda makes it right and then some. Then people say its p2w lol.
---
That I dont know. I just know I did not receive anything and got it first day. Never had any issues though so dont really care.
---
I tagged ladydevann and i believe she is looking into it.
---
I think one or north of the missions, one in the Mire and another in the toxic valley. The toxic valley states at a talking computer in a basement at a cabin, and the other in the Mire is at a small shack where you go to three locations and collect samples of creatures to put in a data base
---
&gt;follow the story line until it becomes hard for you
---
&gt; stay in that area till it is easy. 
---
This is such good advice yo.....I'm l44 and doing a quest for Rose....getting the trappers key from Huntersville. And I got mollywopped trying to do that quest!
---
All you need is some ear buds.
---
Lmao! That is Awesome! I just learned something new today, that takes the definition of Fanny pack to a whole new level.
---
You have inspired me, I will spend some time at the bottom of some of these water sources, see if I can find anything, aquaboy ftw.
---
Yeah, found this on their website. So apparently it didn't matter if you did a ticket or not they could tell if your account was affected:  
---
"Accounts which were affected by the Scrapbox issue were identified and have been contacted via the registered email address associated with their Bethesda.net accounts. The details of resolution have been provided in that email. If you did not receive that email and you are a Fallout 1st member and believe that you were affected by the Scrapbox issue prior to the fix on October 25th, please contact Bethesda Customer Support with your information, including character name. "
---
Thanks for replying! I hope it works out. And the bug with Gatling weapons stopping if you switch from hipfire to aiming down sights.
---
Alright, I'm in! 
---
Exceptional write up and with the recent mishap of other games mysteries being unlocked before the community could pull together, *cough* Destiny, maybe we can solve this before the true nature is spoon fed. 
---
Side note, I hope you are right! Would be awesome to have some hidden dungeon that has yet to be discovered or mentioned. Am a little unsure due to all the data mining going on but willing to help search.
---
Thanks brother
---
I wasn't clear on what the cause of the damage was. It seems like the damage was recent, because the terminal in the Burrows makes it seem like water was still flowing just fine about a year and a half before Vault 76 opened. The damage could be anything. The Sonic Emitter itself doesn't seem functional or damaged, so I can't say that they ever get it up and running.
---
To me that is saying, "If you think you lost stuff (want free stuff) contact us and we will issue it"
---
Take my silver you earned it.
---
I mean if you signed up before that date I would definitely try. It's like 50k worth of scrap
---
Lol hey just a little sass. I like how, while my statement is pessimistic, still slightly accurate from past updates, I have downvotes. My comment has everything to do with the topic at hand. Yet ppl use reddit as a facebook like/dislike usage. Believe me I'm excited for the dlc as well. But i ain't holding my breath expecting perfection.
---
oh I know, I didn't downvotes either.  I'm just being a silly bastard
---
This drops from uranium fever now.  I got both the Forest and urban scout masks today.
---
Sucks, I empathize because I don’t pvp. This is just game mechanics though.  High levels need something to do.
---
I got it for $6.99 at redbox used
---
Grab a super sledge off a mutant and try whacking her in the legs when she's focused on someone else.
---
When u have several plasma core with partial used load. That where combine cores makes sense. :)
---
I never wrote its bug free.
---
It's clearly in Toxic Valley somewhere, but this is the first time I've ever seen it.
---
I don't use energy weapons so I wasn't aware of this. I've never had them fail to disappear when empty in PA.
---
And i wrote nearly just like you said
---
Patch 14, for whatever reason, changed the default display of the vending machine inventory.  But adding another item of an existing quantity when you already have 30 items assigned has been like that from the start.  It's like it needs a hidden 31st slot to properly support that.
---
This is actually normal! Sometimes, a “leg” might get crippled, forcing it to walk as the wheels no longer turn.
---
I love this
---
What I'm saying is he can manufacture dense mods for selling in his vending machine. Its alright that your retarded
---
Congratulations! I do have to ask one thing however, why is that Grafton monster so big!?
---
This indeed seems to be either some weird obscure limitation or coding issue on consoles - or just something entirely arbitrary. I remember FFXV also had a hard limit of 100 on its in-game photo gallery, which was then doubled at one time, but the limit itself remains to this day, and it remains low as hell (especially considering that game also does auto-snaps). And to this day, I don't believe anyone ever gave a sensible explanation as to why it exists, when common sense says there shouldn't be any limit as long as you have free space on your drive.
---
Wow, just wow. Oxhorn should retell this tale, he may be able to do it justice. Excellent work!
---
Great job. This is the stuff I love seeing on here.
---
I put the interlopers and the Mothman cult under one god as they are from the same group
---
Definately will stick with creatures. I've never had too much issue with crickets, more liable to kill myself than them killing me. Only place I had to farm them was Tanagra's cave, that's when and if the 94 was the non-cricket spawning raid. Will definately try Toxic Larry's Meat 'n Go Snallygaster spawn! Thanks!
---
Very Nice!!! Thanks
---
Awesome post! I’ve ways had this hunch that the vault dwellers will activate project clean Appalachia and cure some of the scorched plague, and boom, that’s where the Wastelanders come from. Your post has only dragged me further down the rabbit hole, reinforcing this conspiracy theory I have :)
---
Is that the hidden chamber that has an exit near the power substation?
---
I think so
---
If you watch the Wastelanders trailer there's a HUGE water purifier looking thing in what seems to be a water reservoir. Maybe this ties in with what you found?
---
I've seen those turtle chalk drawings all over Appalachia! I believe it's part of an unimplemented questline. There's another block of locked content tied to the Enclave, the presidential suite in the Whitespring Bunker, and all of the voting machines in each major city. Frustrating dead ends. For now.
---
I think you'd enjoy reading all of the terminal entries in the Enclave Bunker if you haven't already! Something similar happened after the nukes dropped.
---
Nicest faction is only in two towns despite supposedly being a large separatist movement and having numerous labor protests and strikes that follow the same ideology but for some reason aren’t related  😶
---
I enjoy role playing a junkie junker who does loads of drugs and booze selling all the rares, legendarirs, and bulk junk for waaay too cheap. 
---
Doesn't matter to me, you got any mo of that Daddy-O?
---
Absolutely. I once got 18 of them for turning in Technical Data. That was all I got though :(
---
I was going to say go to the vault raid on novice, get to the part where it’s cave crickets and they drop 5+acid a go, no time limit, no disruptions, constant flow of them, but you have to be able to kill them easily
---
And a time traveler😂
---
Can you provide the location, what's the closest POI ?
---
I grab those too. :D Trying to piece together as many of these nodes spots as possible to eventually post all of the locations I know so that farming copper is easy.
---
That's not how it worked in Fallout 4.
---
Hmmm, any way to confirm this? If that is completely unrelated, then I'd want to look more into the communication loss between the Burrows and the Enclave Bunker. That in itself might be a dead end as well, but it could be worth exploring. Every little detail so far has led somewhere.
---
Will let you know. I’m saving up.
---
Literally putting those items in the boxes.
---
This still don't justify them over advertising it.
---
It is just a new location with some back story, 1 new mini boss, 1 new weapon. No farming, nothing else. And the news were everywhere like it was going to be some game changer.
---
Your ridiculous dude. Seriously downvoting me over forgetting about stuff because I have a real life. You must have no life at all, I feel bad for you.
---
Yeah, i read everything. But its been so long. Im doing a replay of it now, (lvl 13) so ill for sure read it all again.
---
Normally, I'd agree. As I looked through this, I kept waiting for it to just be another lame Easter egg kind of thing. But everywhere I went, there were connections. The Sonic Generator was a huge find. I had explored Mosstown earlier in the year, and that was not there. It seemed wholly out of place, yet when I went to Mosstown to find evidence of the BOS expedition, that... That was huge.
---
Well then actually the Fallout 4 version sucks.
---
There are many bad things in fo76 but this seems quite logical.
---
Lay off the Nukashine. 🍾
---
i have seen many "thank you bethesda " posts/comment in my time with this game  , so not completly true that  they dont get that.
---
Levels dont mean anything, alot of high levels use mules to sell off the stuff they dont want taking up their mains weight. I have 3 mules lol. Just gotta pay attention to how many things theyre selling. I picked up a quad ffr gamma gun for 750 caps from a low levels camp and there were only like 3 weapons in the machine. Point is go anyways, never know what you may find. Also western outfit for 10 caps 😂😂😂😂, flipped for 20k. The only thing i wish is if they had a way to mark if you already went to their camp
---
I certainly didn't take your comment as antagonistic so no need to apologize. I may be coming off as defensive because I am lightweight fed up but I'm starting to think my well intended post may carry just as much negativity. So I'm sorry for contributing to the problem.
---
A new faction iirc
---
You set the center of the nuke at mama dolces...should cover morgantown and still leave the train station out of the nuke zone
---
Its not lorebreaking anyway, the pulse gun from new vegas was made to counter possible chinese power armor. Unless people want to say new Vegas isnt canon lol.
---
It's suppose to still happen from my understanding.
---
Quick question, if anybody can answer me.
---
In the NW vault, there is a poster that says if you win you are rewarded.  I have been playing NW and won twice - both games with kills if that matters. What is it that I am supposed to get for winning? I haven't seen a reward.
---
Just pushed back is all.

I have had 5 spawn at the SBQ but never seen multiple in the wild
---
All the food shit is leveled. You’ need to put it in your stash and it’d just waste space until you were lvl 45-50...
---
What dsp you need specifically? I'll pitch some shit your way.
---
big wow
---
Would you please bring s uain with the team? Nothing has changed and the situation has actually worsened.
---
I'd be happy with that
---
It used to work a while ago but they broke it in one of the patches and never fixed it.
---
Of course you are, you paid for pay to win perks in this game.
---
I didn't recurrence anything yet....
---
Leave off already. Not every 1st member was given a ridiculous amount of scrap.
---
The Scortched liked that.
---
No complaints. I enjoy not having to share a server with anyone else the most. The scrapbox is just a bonus
---
1st members argued against p2w by saying that they still needed to farm the junk anyway. Now they get handed free junk, so what's the new argument here?
---
And rightfully so.  I've thrown over 200 at this broken fucking game.
---
Thanks! But right now, lead, aluminum, copper, glass and screws. If you don’t have any to spare it’s fine
---
No. The scrapbox is the pay to win feature. Anyone with bhalf a brain would understand that there's no point in playing a multiplayer game alone. The private server is the disguise here, because you all know how "private" it actually is, lol.
---
I can do copper, aluminum and glass easy.  Much in need of screws myself.  Ps4? I forgot to check sorry
---
Add me genomeninja
---
Yeah I’m on ps4, my gamer tag is “EnslavedPikachu”
---
I would love to have the rest of the heads. I want to build a hunter's cabin to display my trophies.
---
I’ve just got up.. two hours I just spent going to all the known locations one after another.. Logged on and checked challenges and it was the first thing I decided to do.. imagine adding a daily challenge that makes people want to turn the game off🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
---
Seems pretty private to me, haven't seen anyone else in it. I actually enjoy playing it alone but that's just me.
---
Go grind events, noob. Jesus h christ.
---
Probably carried over by a nuked area
---
That's a pretty clever solution.
---
They'll make you pay $50 a month for it.
---
I received free junk without losing anything or creating a ticket.
---
You probably mean West-Tek, and yes, you can get a triple Mirelurk Queen spawn at the nearby location known as The Freak Show.
---
I had the exact same problem today. I figured I was either doing it wrong or that it wasnt supposed to work how I thought. 
---
I guess it is in fact broken. I just disconnected the power from the door to close it.
---
They're giving all F1st members these because they know 1st subscribers are true gacha game players who enjoy p2w mechanics.
---
Me too lol
---
You're misrepresenting the situation. They didnt get free scrap because they are fallout 1st subscribers, they got it as an apology for a bug.
---
The only thing that's wrong with it is the amount of Vault steel people are being given. Nobody had that amount saved up and the level of difficulty to get it in the first place means it should have been a lot less than 600.
---
Yeah bro Im totally going to subscribe to someone late in the game.
---
I lost all my junk (13 characters consolidated into one scrapbox) on the 2nd day after 1st was released.  I sent in a service ticket right away, and I received my replacement junk yesterday.
---
People who lost countless other things due to bugs never get anything as compensation. Bethesda straight up tells them that "don't have the tools to restore anything". Yet, they bend over backwards to pander towards 1st members. I am not misinterpreting anything, you're not seeing the truth because your judgement is clouded.
---
Based on your post history all you seem to love is hating on fallout 76, a video game. A real low.
---
Im on the fence about getting a subscription ,whats holding me back is the private server i just dont see a plus to that.
---
Are you...
---
I don't want to put words in your mouth, so I'm asking.  Are you insinuating that Bethesda intentionally faked a glitch where paid subscribers would lose items, just so they could drop a lot of items in those people's scrapboxes a month later?
---
10 pts. 4 stage design and management. Ever considered theater? Hollywood needs help. Lots and lots of help....
---
The water with the Behemoth was part of the FEV testing, and is also why Supermutants are still around. After they were exterminated people moved into the area, drank the ground water and such and contiously evolved into supermutants. But Im glad to see your thinking.
---
Yes. And I have a suspicion they'll keep doing this to keep the whales happy so that they keep paying for the pay to win features.
---
Well that answers a question i asked in another thread about why my Junkie and non-junkie weapons of same type had same damage.
---
Nice one
---
What level are you?  I dont have any low level legendaries but I can make you a good set of armor and a few weapons if you'd like.
---
I'd be lying if I said FO76 wasn't one of my favorite games of the decade honestly. Granted, I don't play *too* many games to begin with, but FO4 and RDR2 are the only other ones that come to mind in terms of which games I've invested the most time into.
---
76 is such an oddly unique experience and I've enjoyed the vast majority of my time with it. Most of the people who love to bash it don't even play to begin with.
---
Theres one or a few in every 'section' of the site. They are either security terminals or mainframe terminals. Theres one right away when you enter site charlie and there's some in rooms next to reactor pipes. Hack into them then turn off the special targeting. After turrets kill everything, turn off turrets
---
Hemlock holes workshop has 3  acid nodes. If you're not afraid to take a workshop that will generate plenty of acid
---
Welp, I learned something new... :) thanks for the replies everyone!
---
thank you very much for the replies
---
You can go to a weapon workbench and modify your weapon of choice and it will show you how many mods it has and how many are unlocked.
---
Started when they added the countdown to fasttravel when enemies are near 6 months ago.
---
I dont think it does I am lvl 450 and the amount increases every lvl
---
A couple hundred people (at most) who complain on Reddit out of thousands of people who played the game worldwide don't really count as a lot of people who hate the game. The haters are a minority, they're just very vocal.
---
How can you tell the amount increases?
---
Well I have 1st and didn't get the free stuff
---
Pretty sure the bracket is far above what is needed. If im correct anywhere from 100-1000 has the same xp amount according to fo76 wikia
---
You will, soon.
---
Perhaps the contaminated water carrying whatever has taken over the Mire now has a direct link into the Whitespring Bunker. I'm in the camp of those thinking that whatever drives the (very lonely) hivemind of the scorch plague is directly involved with the strangler infestation and the Lucky Hole Mine thing. The notes in that mine express that what they worship is like, hellllaaaa clingy. Scorched? Really glad they'll never be alone again. Strangler vines? Some sort of mega-flora growing with clear intent all over the most rich area of the map, fed by Dyer chemical dumps and a GECK gone wrong. Ash Heap? Meteoritic Sword (tentacled beasts face on the hilt) drops from its Event only if you've first completed the area quest line, which hints at the remaining drills retain the sentience of the dying wife of Hornwright. She straight up delivers the Meteoritic Sword after meeting you, a VERY common drop that was turned on SEMI RECENTLY. 
---
  
---
Perhaps with the same patch? I have a literal post in my history mentioning its increased drop rate. I can edit in the date of that. Always asked questions about it only for people to shrug just as much as me.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So ANYWAY, the only outlier to this thing seemed to be the Bunker and MODUS. Factor in the ruined and inaccesible research lab and a recent supply of infected and connected water? Maybe the glitchy MODUS personality issue he says is recent has a more sinister base? Perhaps those red data stores in his mainframe got some bad liquid coolant? Hm hm hm hm hm.
---
Questions questions questions...
---
Yeah you can, but not with this one....because there aren't mods to be unlocked for it besides the two that I mentioned apparently.
---
Well it's nice to see some people who appreciate the game, regardless of what people say about it
---
No actually I'm right there with you on this second point. I said the exact same to a friend earlier - never been this kind of response before 1st. But that's not what you're saying in your post, so you are misrepresenting the situation. If your post was about how it's wrong that theres never been a response like this before 1st then I would have hit it with an upvote and commented how I agree.
---
Do you often find yourself thinking like this?  That there are hidden and malicious motivations behind events that other people think of as mundane or straightforward?
---
Do you really need to ask why something doesn’t work in this game?
---
You think a corporation does *anything* without malicious intent?
---
Did I say it was lorebreaking?
---
I’m like 85% sure Duchess will be in the basement of The Rusty Pick. We know she’s in since one of the released images’ file names was titled with her name. She was known to inhabit that basement. (There’s a holotape down there with lore.) Plus, at some point the basement was changed to remove the secret exit so it is now a dead end - a perfect little hideout for NPCs.
---
Argument? Only 1st members who lost junk in the scrapbox got free junk. Most of us didn't/won't receive anything.
---
Should I take that as a yes?
---
It caps off at 50.
---
I’ve heard that it does stay the same after 100, but it does not really feel like that to me. It takes way more time to lvl my 300 than any of my chars in the hundreds.
---
Caps off at 50.
---
I think I’m more leaning towards the “Bored AI” dropped nukes theory:)
---
I would like to think that maybe this entire story is literally going to be a quest with the update. Long drawn out, repetitive routes to repair things in hope of a better Wasteland? That sounds vaguely familiar
---
Whats legendary mode even do.
---
Have you stopped??
---
Ppl get worked up because near launch devs said cosmetic only and here we are now with a sub that gives features we'd thought were not possible but should be a part of the game.
---
I just launched a nuke solo and only just got to 55. It was tough. I'm using a heavy build and took in over 2k 50 Cal and 3 plasma cores. Left with about 500 50 Cal and 2ish cores. I also wore a piecemeal set of armor. I had about 40 stims on me and left with 20.
---
Apparently there's a market for contrived outrage.
---
Part of me was hoping at the end of this extensive research, there might be a reference to Epstein. 😆
---
There wasn't, great research!  Good luck!!
---
Put it in vendor for outrageous prices. Thats what i do with my bug parts. Not sure how biliing affects scrapping but i break down bulk acid and dont have as much problem.
---
The Holy Bible is the cliff notes version of my post 😂
---
What part of the trailer?
---
All the fences are made from surplus Faraday cages. H&amp;H Hardware made a killing on that shit.
---
No, "P2W" in this sub stands for "Panties 2Wisted", not "pay to win".
---
This is by far one of the coolest things I've ever seen...
---
I received the scrap boxes and have already given most of it away. I don't feel I did anything to deserve it since I didn't lose anything.
---
The first time you kill a creature you should get its mount as a symbolic gesture. I would have loved to have mounted the head of my first scorchbeast kill.
---
By your logic, people should be allowed to enjoy drugs because they are not harming anyone else, right?
---
Tldr?
---
Nice, i haven't found this but i haven't been playing long at all, will definitely check it out.
---
It seems hit or miss. There’s times I’ve had a bounty and I’ve been able to initiate PvP on pacifist people by using their mutations against them, but there’s times it hasn’t worked. It’s iffy.
---
Well, my thought would be that the BOS team survivors fell back to the pipeline itself, causing a blockage which is showing on the Whitesprings Bunker terminal. So, how do we get into the pipeline?
---
Come on. It’s a far cry between a video game fake world and real life where you can really die, hurt or kill others, commit crimes, etc. That comparison makes no sense whatsoever.
---
There's undiscovered content tied to the Burrows, and I'm hoping the community can help solve the mystery.
---
Fortnite and CoC don't cost $60.
---
A few things. The in game map shows the areas as they are now and they would not have looked like that pre war. I can find out the info on a lot of the terminal, note, and object placement between updates and will reply back later on with my findings.
---
No, the comparison is enabling criminal behavior, because it involves real money. If it allowed you to pay caps to get these perks no one would care. The monetization is downright predatory.
---
Gathering scrap for crafting and repairs is about 80% of the game. I think you should just play it yourself honestly. Not trying to be negative.
---
I really don’t understand why people bitch about the membership and it’s perks. If you’re willing to pay for the membership, you should get the benefits. If you don’t want to pay for the membership, you don’t get the benefits. It’s that simple. It’s irritating to see people whine and get their panties in a bunch because they don’t get an outfit or a Scrapbox
---
Mine started doing it today. My turrets attack each other. Last one standing shoots my structures.
---
Best bet your bottom dollar over time they cost quite a bit more than a measily 60$, the legendary skins on Fortnite cost 20$ each, how many do you think 1 person buys that plays a lot? Probably more than $200 worth, I know someone who is sucked in and I watch him drop like $40 every paycheck no problem lol so... what did you say?
---
People "get their panties in a bunch" because Bethesda downright lied to their customers.
---
I have a diving suit
---
Just like the Fissure Sites and Nukong all of them. You give Beth too much Credit
---
GT SpyD1990 on Xbox add me and if were on at same time. I'll help ya with some mounts.
---
I honestly agree, I like to play it out by myself, however I feel like I can’t go any further in the game, unless I get a little boost
---
Not 1st. Maybe 50th make it a challenge.
---
In what way did they lie? Would you care to elaborate?
---
We'd need to find the pipeline itself. I'm not entirely sure where it is, assuming it's not hidden underground. The Burrows would be a natural entry point, but there's no sign the BOS returned there.
---
No. This is its own separate skin
---
So they are addicted and have a problem. How is that a good thing? So you're saying that we should encourage/tolerate such behaviour and be okay with the fact that Bethesda is trying to be equally predatory?
---
THis kind is whataboutery is the problem. When someone points out what Bethesda is doing wrong, y'all go "What about X game and Y company? They charge Z amount this and this...?"
---
SO what? We should be OK that one bad thing exists and hence be OK with others trying to do the same bad thing as well? Because there are some bank robbers at large we should just let everyone rob us?
---
I’ve been having that thought myself lately.
---
I agree, there's been games before with premium memberships. I dont think people realize that their Xbox subscription is premium if you have Gold because standard is a Silver Subscription which is free. But does every Xbox player bash Microsoft?
---
Well some dumbasses take the term litterally when really the upset is about bethesda promising that the atomic shop would only contain cosmetics and that new mechanics added to the game would be free. Now they have gone back on their word and are charging for for new mechanics like scrapbot, the fridge, the kits. Only truely stupid people use the argument that these arent making major changes to the game or allowing people to pay to win when really that has nothing to do with the issue. The issue is that bethesda promised that these things would be free and cosmetics for them would be sold... this is not the case now.
---
This is pretty old, just one of the many problems with this game
---
Are you this dumb?
---
Are you just pretending that they never said "cosmetics only" and then started shitting all over us? Or that they said they can't give us infinite junk stashes because of technical limitations, and then paywalled it? You need further elaboration?
---
Everyone else is doing the same challenge and killing it before you
---
I agree. When I was looking at the map, it's clear that the terrain features were pre-war, but the locations are a mix of pre-war and post-war. Mosstown, for example, didn't exist before the war.
---
That's cool, free scrapped junk. Everyone should craft multiple handmade, lever, combat rifle, marine and combat armor then scrap them all to learn the mods. Straight away, do not waste it.
---
Becuz once ur at weight cap theres nothing left in this game to do not that hard to understand
---
No I'm saying how are they supposed to make money to keep the company up and running in order to make the game better by having the ability to hire better staff and buy better equipment?....
---
I know what we are going to be occuping our free time with now 🤔🤔🤔,, good job u/intrepid359 if nothing you definitely sparked our interest and if we find anything that has any connections to your finding we would love to bounce it off you.
---
Do you have discord? If so I'd love if you sent me a message Eckserah#0001. A bunch of people in my data mining discord read this and think it's awesome
---
Cool, thanks. I’m looking forward to it ruining my sneaking
---
Exactly. Gaming has shifted and the money isnt in selling the game its in subscriptions, cosmetics and loot boxes. Its over this is gaming now being nickel and dimed. DLC was never meant to be anything else.
---
You assume that they started with 0 money. That's not how companies make games. If that was the case, games would never get made.
---
Are you naive enough to think that Fallout 76 Atom shop sales keeps Bethesda running?
---
No, like I said i havent been playing long and yeah that does sound like a problem you've elaborated enough. Thats why i made this post is because i don't understand why people hate it so much considering what I know, a new player
---
Worth it. At least for the first few days.
---
Ok. I guess I can understand that some people feel “betrayed”. But on the other hand, if basic game sales don’t pay for development, then they have to fund it somehow. Maybe Bethesda had more sales in mind than they actually got, I don’t know. I guess their mistake was to make that promise in the first place.
---
So Todd Howard tried to have his mouth on both the teats. He sells Fallout 76 for AAA price AND then charges subscription for it.
---
Because its not a solid wall. Vats can only shoot through solid concrete.
---
Hopefully gives us something to do.
---
How about 50th on common, easy enemies, but 1st on the huge creatures. The first time you solo a SB is a huge sense of pride and accomplishment and should be commemorated.
---
Just sent you a friend request, I think. Haven't used Discord for a while.
---
If your are still looking for someone to roam with you can add me. DGAF88   I'm just beginning so I'm a level 15 but will be progressing more this weekend.
---
It’s always a 1*
---
Sorry..
---
Are you naive enough to think if the game does not keep providing a stream of revenue that they will shut it down?
---
Also what's with the attitude "show Bethesda some love, you are playing their game"? Bethesda is not doing me any favor letting them pay their game. If anything, we are doing them a favor buying it, a big one at that, considering how broken Fallout 76 is. They don't own us. Why do you think we owe them anything?
---
So edgy and cool.
---
That is true for f2p games, not games that sell for $60.
---
Would have figured they would have been on the hunting lodge quest but nope.
---
I hope that we can all bounce ideas off one another and figure it out. It initially felt like one of the unimplemented quests in the game, except that they put it there in a major update. I think there's something I'm missing, and the map is too big to explore it all alone!
---
Okay. I’ll play again.
---
DGAF88 if you're still looking for a teammate.
---
Many weapons in 76 are un-moddable or can only be modded by having the mod in your inventory to attach. They were designed that way. Single Action is the worst revolver and has the least plans. Short Western is the best but the rarest. If you've played FO4 you may have noticed that all weapons added to 76 have very few mods slots, if any, in comparison. Some weapons being considered as historic antiques.
---
Shovel, spear, hatchet, multipurpose axe, fireaxe, moleminer gauntlet, sickle, black powder pistol, rifle, blunderbuss, The Dragon, Single Action, Light Machine Gun, 50 cal, chsinsaw, Grenade Launcher, Auto Grenade Launcher, Plasma Caster, Gatling Gun... I swear I listed all the 76 uniques at launch. 
---
I think out of everything here the Gatling and Plasma have the most mods.
---
It could explain the missing dive suit, too. Bear with me here; given what you've discovered, it's entirely possible the dive suit was indeed added to the game, but in an old location where we never thought to look for it, namely Mosstown or Dyer Chemical. We get the dive suit, which lets us enter the flooded passage in the Barrows, which in turn leads the pipeline, and who knows what could happen from there?
---
Yeah just like EA, TAKE2 and every major game developer. Have we all also forgotten that bethesda had the infamous horse armor. Which at the time was so absurd and now its fkn industry standard. The consumer has been changed and is happy to pay. People dont want to miss out, people want convenience and in the end its not your place to tell someone how to spend their money. Theres a reason the majority of Americans are in debt and live paycheck to paycheck and its not student loans and a wealth gap, its mostly buying shit you dont need.
---
LLol. Yeah I watched a good video of what to do and what not to do. Can’t stand on stuff or shoot her until she lands type of stuff. Or take peoples loot. I wasnt watching my health and I died right after we beat her and someone took my flux. Dick move. it’s those little tick cricket bastards that sneak up and nail ya. Ha
---
Let me ask you a question what is the big about the sentinel no damage standing still. I put on 4 pieces and went to white springs and a ghoul kicked my ass in one shot. Lol. It must be a pve thing right? Still not sure why it’s good. Am I missing something cuz I want to get rid of all mine.
---
It looks positively evil with the red headlamp
---
Very cool real!
---
Agreed. I am at work but already thinking of areas to go explore. I too felt like there had to be more to the Burrows than what was on the surface yet I did not in anyway dig as deep as you have.
---
You are right, and i wanted it to be a mystery to uncover so much that when the camera was first implemented i went around taking pics of all the location i could find and try to put the story back together, i couldn't just be coincidence right?
---
Unfortunately when i realised it must have bethesda screwing with me or just cut content it just disappointed me as i felt it was such a huge missed opportunity and feeling like a fool that could it be something more..
---
It is true for all online games that require servers.
---
You forgot the pump action shotgun.
---
wait..I thought 76 had no story..I feel lied to...
---
I would 100% post this over in Fallout Lore, this is fantastic.
---
Does it fit all PA?
---
We will never know unfortunately and it's just sad, like how it feels for the rest of the game when you find the creature body (it moves but could still be dead) you literally just missed the party and all the fun was had without you, just like 100% of the content so far, that is why i had such hopes for wastelander
---
No but i do have a problem with not having a deep freezer that actually keeps my stuff fresh forever
---
Yes, of course people should be able to enjoy drugs if they aren't harming anyone else. Are you retarded?
---
Why? op did all the work he deserve all the credit
---
Lol i tried to server hop. Got into the second server, bluescreened, left the game off.
---
The matrix pattern of the chain link disturbs the Spencer prism dilation which throws off the Garbin spectrometer. Duh.
---
Maybe they shouldn't be greedy and charge $18 for a single skin .. what they they think, people just going to keep buying $18 skins .. pretty sure the atomic shop already paid for all development in the game, we have some white whales. I have a friend who earns a low wage but basically owns everything in the atomic shop ..
---
What?
---
U asked i answered
---
Not sure what weight cap you’re referring to
---
You have to understand what the term pay2win actually means. The "win" isn't always to be taken literally.
---
The best description that I've seen that's from a somewhat reputable source i.e. not Urban Dictionary is this:
---
["In general a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-paying peers."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play#Pay-to-win)
---
Note what it says that. It's about paying for ANY advantage. That means purchasing and running 2 accounts simultaneously is considered pay2win, though not necessarily intentional by Bethesda. However, everything from the repair kits all the way through to the scrap box and survival tent all fit that same description - paying for an advantage.
---
Endgame and win conditions don't even come into it. There are plenty of games you can point to that have pay2win mechanics that don't have an end game or win condition.
---
Back to 76, you could try to argue around the fringes of whether or not the fridge is a pay2win item but it's unquestionable that both the scrapbox and survival tent are. You have multiple first hand accounts by Fallout 1st subscribers say outright they're pay2win. That these items have given them such an advantage over a player that doesn't have it.
---
There in lies the issue. You pay for an advantage, which pushes the game in favour of those who pay over those who play well.
---
Now, there's not much right now where you can't really take that advantage. However, add in proper PvP and prestige levels and you watch how much of a different these pay2win items will have.
---
The other side of the coin is that pay2win items incentivises Bethesda to make a sub-optimal game. The game will NEVER be as good as it could be otherwise there wouldn't be the need for pay2win items to get around certain aspects of the game e.g. grindiness, storage limitations etc.
---
Pay2win is always a lose for players, though less so for those who play. That's the ultimate issue with pay2win and Fallout 76 is unquestionably a pay2win game now.
---
Stashbox u mentioned the scrapbox that is what i was referring to
---
What's the music, please?
---
It is
---
same these guys say it caps at 50 but it sure as heck seems like my lvl 450 guy takes way longer to lvl than my alt that is 250
---
Man, that's way better than my "toenail clippers" idea.
---
I know right lol
---
If you have super duper, you can go down to watoga and kill the assaultrons. Eventually you will get a salvaged assaultron head. Scrap this and it gives you the plan to to build assaultron helmets. Build and scrap them with super duper. When you have around 100, scrap them all (save one or two for the next time) you will get 100 steel, 100 silver, 400 circuits, and 100 SCREWS!!!!!!! This can be repeated as much as you want.
---
Cant find it, I typed in the whole name and found no one. Just try adding me EthanXZ802
---
Thank you for that. Very well laid out and complete. So  in reality, it really should be called “P4A” (Pay for Advantage).
---
Did you submit a ticket? If so have you asked for an update? They haven't finished reimbursing people yet.
---
I think the higher the level the less xp you get for any given situation.
---
Supposed to. I have it on my x1 now
---
If you feel that way then leave. I've never kept playing something I've called broken, let alone spend 200 on it. You know what the game is at this point. I'm sure they will give you some stuff back. Just give it time.
---
Yeah, people should be allowed to take and enjoy drugs as long as they are not harming anyone else.
---
Except no one cares cuz the Bethesda can’t make good games anymore
---
Are the voice lines different than the original?
---
You realise that any super salty fanboi can edit the wiki for that, right? So using it as some definitive example, is a bit of a stretch.
---
Fallout 76 is, in *your opinion* a pay to win game. By your overreaching definition, everything that they sell would be "P2W".
---
Is the regular SMG new to this game too? I don't remember seeing it in FO4.
---
Free States 💪
---
I did a 2 person scorched earth event once. It's quite a feat to pull off.  👍
---
Seems fine to me.
---
Go on...
---
I don’t have the original.
---
Because it was manufactured in America.
---
GOD BLESS THE FREE STATES!
---
LOL pretty much
---
Great, now I have to go login and travel to Mosstown.  Nice work by the way, it sounds as though you could very well be on to something.
---
500-1000 is what I've priced them at in the past. Haven't put one into a vending machine for a while, so don't know of that still holds.
---
Thank you.
---
Pay to win means paid advantages over others, not literally winning. The subscription offers up some big advantages, the tent mainly, makes weight reduction perks almost irrelevant.
---
&gt; You realise that any super salty fanboi can edit the wiki for that, right? So using it as some definitive example, is a bit of a stretch. 
---
Sure. Wikipedia also has counter-measures for that too.
---
If you have a more authoritative source for a definition, please show us. 
---
The thing is, whatever authoritative source you pick for the definition will likely end up with the same result.
---
Look at EVERY definition on [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pay-to-win). None of them refer to literal winning. Same with [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-definition-of-pay-to-win). Neither of these I would consider authoritative.
---
Wikipedia is the best definition we have until the dictionary companies step in. However, you can see for yourself, ALL talk about advantage and NONE talk about winning.
---
I wish I had the gumption to grind out what it takes to build stuff like this. I just don’t have the time to put together the atoms
---
Ive said this many times and people just refuse to look at it this way.
---
My weapons and ammo and aid are what get me. I tend to try not to carry much junk. So for me the ammo/weight/aid weight reductions are key, and the junk one doesn’t help much.
---
Dizzy will tell you Everytime we have gone into the burrows I talk shit about how much they "up talked" that dlc, I just got out of work and goina take a look around, maybe there is something under Dyer, or one thing that clicked to me is I always thought them adding "breath underwater" as a legendary effect, maybe adding the diver suit is a clue and there is something under water, it wouldn't be the 1st time they hid something underwater in fallout
---
Of course the most well thought out reply about the actual state of the game gets down voted. How dare you prove them wrong!
---
600 caps
---
Give me 5 minutes. Logged into campfire tales event
---
Good advice! Thank you! :)
---
40 scrip
---
what is a chain link fence?
---
tl;dr
---
doubt it
---
when is the last time bethesda has done something like this and added secret content into their game let alone for 76?
---
Also, get your Intelligence as high as possible as soon as possible.  Take it all the way to 15 if you can.  That gives bonus experience.  If you can group, you get bonus experience (30%). Also, if you do the event “Feed the People” you get a reward food that gives you bonus experience or you can craft cranberry relish that also helps. 
---
You can also sleep for 30seconds to get another bonus to experience.
---
Scrip it. 
---
It's not max level, and doesn't have swing speed.
---
Your argument  is well presented.  However, you provided a misleading definition from the Urban Dictionary.  The actual definition is:
---
pay-to-win
---
Games that let you buy better gear or allow you to make better items then everyone else at a faster rate and then makes the game largely unbalanced even for people who have skill in the game without paying.
---
The key is “makes the game largely unbalanced”. 
---
I would agree that some of the introduced elements may lead to a pay-to-win in the future.  At present, I don’t see that any of the paid content provide a significant advantage to skilled players.
---
The outcry by the community is more regarding the promise of Bethesda “not to cross the line”.  Though it’s debatable whether Bethesda already crossed the line (depending where the line is) - Bethesda certainly moved closer to crossing the line
---
Nice , cant stop laughing at this...im picturing me and my wife doing that (she absolute hates games  and that i play)  😂
---
I never did grinding for this game. I always tried to follow high level players in a team so I would get it on the xp from stuff they kill
---
Love him or hate him he’s spittin facts
---
Assassins is a super bad prefix, so yeah I’d probably scrip it.
---
It didnt let me revive you?
---
According to the [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9svhak/character\_levels\_go\_up\_to\_50000\_according\_to\_game/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9svhak/character_levels_go_up_to_50000_according_to_game/) and [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Level](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Level)
---
It caps at lvl 100. From lvl 100+ each level up requires 159880 xp.
---
He do be looking kinda quirky doe 😳
---
I think scorch queen event has a higher chance to spawn one. ;)
---
In *your opinion* they sell p2w items. By your broad definition, even cosmetic items are "P2W". If there has ever been a real world example of "the boy who cried wolf", you all would be it.
---
You're apparently misremembering the **ridiculous** arguments in here when the repair kits dropped. The hand waving, and manufactured outrage was tedious beyond belief.
---
It would be cool if legendaries drop the head itself and not a plan, so u have to go out and kill a creature for its head
---
I can build you a suped up low level handmade what level are you?
---
Agree...
---
- I was about to type the same comment
---
The servers are going down?
---
Your welcome, there is another one where you need to revive someone in water, do you need that one too?
---
It stops increasing at 1000 from the spreadsheet. 100 is 15880xp
---
I expected that content to be saved for July 4th but it's still locked. No clue what the deal is when the exchange machine has been fully functional since beta.
---
In a game where the very gameplay loop is controlled by the storage limitation, giving someone unlimited storage for certain resources, thereby freeing up my stash for more resources: does not look unbalanced to you? It radically alters the gameplay experience.
---
Also, the commenter did not cite Urban Dictionary. You, on the other hand, pulled out an "actual definition" without citing any source, and a definition which very conveniently supports your narrative.
---
A huge underground purifier. Interesting.
---
almost is only good for horse shoes and hand grenades
---
[Nope,](https://bethesda.net/en/status) must be just your server.
---
Utterly amazing 😍
---
Putting junk in the scrap box frees up hundreds of pounds in your stash, so you can just store extra guns in your stash instead of your inventory, negating the requirement of weight reduction perks. I carry around all legendary weapons after a nuke zone farming because my stash doesn't have enough space, however, for that, I need to waste 6-10 special points on weight reducing perks. If my stash had 200 lbs free, I could just put them there and use better damage perks instead.
---
Asked my friends on discord and they say they aren’t having any issues with the servers going down on the PC.
---
That's a ridiculous thing to say. The flux capacitor obviously doesn't work in 76. That's why you can't slow time.
---
Don't forget that it's 150 Vault 94 Steel for EACH of the scrap able items, of which subscribers are receiving FOUR.  600 total Vault 94 Steel.
---
Valentine has nothing on you. Good job!
---
Buh bye... I’m sure they and all of us in the community shall shed bitter tears of sadness over your departure.
---
Smh.,
---
Yeah but it does make a hellava light show.
---
SpyD1990 is my GT ( Gamer tag)

Hail corporate
---
Bluescreens are hardware or driver issues. Unless you are referring to a PS4, in which case those aren't blue screens.
---
Oh shit, I'm a fuckin idiot
---
Yea been happening since the update, typically after a few hours of play
---
Launch. A. Nuke.
---
I remember my first week playing too.
---
Or the 76th, they’ve chosen that number for many other challenges
---
It’s a copy-paste from Urbandictionary.com (I am not familiar enough with Reddit to post links)
---
The junk many players carry is not really necessary for the game experience.  Many players enjoyed the game even with stash of 400 and no backpacks.
---
For the “packrats” among us (myself included), there are other (free) options available for the emotional comfort of having lots of junk
---
I truly lucked out with my lady. She even attempted to start smoking cigars with me and honestly had a better pallette than myself by far. Lol. The fact that she's a gamer is just the icing on the cake.
---
&gt; Your argument is well presented. However, you provided a misleading definition from the Urban Dictionary. 
---
Given that your comment is referring to a different comment, I'll quote it here for context:
---
&gt;Look at EVERY definition on [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pay-to-win). None of them refer to literal winning. 
---
I already stated early in my comment that I don't consider Urban Dictionary an authoritative source. So it seems odd that you're hanging your argument on a very specific part of one of the multiple definitions on Urban Dictionary for a context it wasn't brought up in.
---
My point was even IF you chose to accept all the other definitions, none of them refer to literal winning.
---
With all due respect to you, and I appreciate the discussion, but might I suggest that you're being misleading here?
---
As I said, pay2win isn't about the magnitude of the advantage, it's about whether you pay for ANY advantage. 
---
Right now Fallout 76 is VERY FAR from the worst of the pay2win games. I don't think anyone disputes that. Doesn't change the fact that it is still sells pay2win items.
---
As for the rest of your comment, I agree that there isn't a substantive way to leverage that advantage right now. I said as much. 
---
However, that changes as soon as you have more levels to grow into because all these pay2win items give you one overarching advantage - time saving. Less time spent on grindy or maintenance tasks means more time for XP and legendaries.
---
That is just objectively false.
---
If it's not on a PC, then it literally is not a bluescreens. That is specifically a Windows issue by literal definition of over 25 years.
---
Nvm no one understands. That emoji is normally used ironically like in these 2 examples:
---
He do be looking kinda fresh doe 😳😳
---
And,
---
What if I put my minecraft bed next to yours?😏😏 Jk Jk😳😳 unless?😳😳 just kidding just kidding haha 😂
---
Hope this helps, the emoji is usually used in r/okbuddyretard
---

I always do this challenge at the NAR Repair Yard. There's always two kinds of mobs doing a deathmatch there, and a megasloth is one of the possible spawns. It took me eight server hops tonight, but I also killed a sheepsquatch and a handful of legendary supermutants there in the meantime, so I won't complain.
---
No... it was the commenter who referred to the Urban Dictionary.  Out of curiosity I went to the Urbandictionary.com and noted that the actual definition at present was different.
---
Next time the challenge comes around I’ll definitely remember and try that spot! Thanks 🙏
---
I've never even seen a megasloth in the game. Tried server hopping for over an hour and I just gave up.
---
I am playing. It's 12:44 est.
---
He cited it only after the othet guy didn't believe his definition from Wikipedia. 
---
Urban dictionary is a joke.
---
Camouflage underarmor by that definition is "P2W".
---
Darker colored weapon skins by that definition are "P2W".
---
Camoflauge power armor skins by that definition are "P2W"
---
A billboard advertising vending by that definition is "P2W".
---
Bigger light fixtures by that definition are "P2W'
---
I'm not twisting anything. You have to stretch the truth to breaking, trying to make eveything in the Atom shop "P2W".
---
Then smile :)
---
You're clearly insane so or an idiot or both, so no point arguing with you.
---
I've been in their during the event many times but never do the event itself and only once have I seen anyone doing the event.  I (and most players) go for the Legendaries that spawn during the event.  I hit four 3\* Legendary Ghouls there this evening during the MM.
---
When you can come up with an argument, feel free to start.
---
Well, you still have nine hours or something to complete it, right? ;-)
---
I still have the option to download the stress test build on my Xbox lmao
---
Yes but the range/accuracy perk in NW works
---
How about a TV that shows stuff other then static. I mean Vault76 was suppost to be a real vault and not a horrible experiment so why doesn't it broadcast stuff like Fallout4 "What makes you s.p.e.c.i.a.l." style infomercials to tvs?
---
I don’t know any build that needs 15 intelligence. Doesn’t seem like good advice, changing special stats later is hard. Sleep in a bed, eat canned stew, play on a team with inspirational card on.
---
Its odd they would make the breadcrumbs so small on whatever this is when most of the other content in the game is left in half loaf form. I found most of the PAM stuff from FO4 on my own but never really pieced any of this stuff together since each clue is about a line long most of the time. Some input:   
---
1) I think the unmarked pond probably has nothing to do with all of this. Yeah the pumps are rather big but for farming you would probably have to move a lot of water and they don't have the same technology as we do. I wouldn't take the power armor workbench seriously since you can find them in many places that don't make much sense like small tool sheds and and such.  
---
2) The ASAM set up at For Defiance was not needed to take down a scorched beast, but it certainly helped. The brotherhood clearly could have killed them with their miniguns and such as they did entering into the Glassed Cavern.   That being said I think the Mosstown experiment was the first use of the Sonic Generator which proved it worked in grounding the SBs making them much more manageable with conventional weapons.   
---
3) It is interesting that "An Organic Solution" quest leads you to Dyer Chemical to make RadShield when it was used to try and clean up radiation in water for pumping to the bunker later.
---
What system are you on?
---
These are great add one, but he needs to know what to do first so that he can then maximize his experience with this stuff.  Also, if you die you lose all of these bonuses unless you eat them again, etc.
---
I had it happen to me quite a few weeks back. Still not sure if it was a bug or the stealth nerf/increased camp budget costs on certain items
---
I bought the beret for 100 caps
---
Yeah, you are going to have to move it I fear.  Been there, done that. 🤬
---
They have. I emailed them and they said everyone who should have received anything has. If anyone was supposed to and hasn't, they need to contact support.
---
Sorry I forgot to mention, Xbox.
---
Lovely. Lol. And to add to my dilemma, I’ve killed 2 3-Star legendaries in the last ten minutes just for them to straight up disappear. 🙂
---
It's suppose to give your boost cards that you can acquire every 50 levels, the team was quoted in saying they will be very powerful and that they can be transferable to multiple characters including characters you create afterwards.
---
Me and my friends cant fast travel at all. Just keeps loading.
---
Sorry for the rough streak. 😬
---
Oh nice. So does it set you back to level 1? And do you at least get to keep the plams you know and stuff?
---
 The exact same talking points haven't changed since the repair kits. If I thought there was a persuasive argument for, I would listen. I don't agree with the current items being "P2W", I dislike when people use absolutes where they don't belong, and I haven't heard anything to make me think otherwise.
---
But, by all means, pretend I'm the one putting my head in the sand.
---
The beret is going for 5-10K on the PC right now.
---
Can you "Clear Cache" on an Xbox One without losing Save Data? If you can you should try it out. Even better if you can clear only FO76.
---
Still a good job? I guess you’re not a fan of reading?
---
Or punctuation?
---
If that was on the PC, you got a score!  I’m also buying another if you’d sell it.
---
Umm not why I got it but try again. Nice job trying to insult people tho. Can see that you must be a very disliked kinda a******.
---
You just literally said "I don't agree so I say it's false".
---
Oh yeah I'll factor that in with the super mutants lol!
---
Wait, the Scout Masks are rare? I thought you just bought them in the Whitesprings Bunker.
---
This is one of the best things that’s ever been on this subreddit.
---
Ok grammar police let me off with a warning.
---
You may say that, but your profile says you play a tonne of gacha games, so I don't think I was wrong, you just don't know it.
---
If you’ve learned about Stockholm Syndrome then you would that it doesn’t apply here in ANY way, shape, or form.
---
All the Prime skins work with the excavator.
---
Is this person for real?
---
okay good lookm ill do the event for those then
---
Way more real that Todd Howard's promises.
---
Haha no. I’m not going to get into it with someone who thinks they know it all and can talk down to everyone. Good luck with that bud. You are no better then anybody else. And if you are commenting on this sub you are part of the issue as well. So either leave people alone or kindly get a life.
---
I comment on this sub because I own the game.
---
Cripes, man. You may want to dial it back a bit.
---
You again!
---
He is just a troll. Waste of space honestly with his comments.
---
love this
---
Hold your horses, villain!
---
Ah sorry, didnt realize this sub is for people with lower standards. I will not try to mingle with the peasants anymore.
---
Um? Yep, that about sums it up. I don't agree with it being "P2W", being true. That doesn't leave much else, but for me to believe it to be false until proven otherwise.
---
You do realize that these are all *opinions* right?
---
Hiya :)
---
No. It's p2w by definition of p2w.
---
You not agreeing that it's p2w is the only opinion here.
---
Enjoy your low levels. Both low and high level play can be fun, but you're only low level once. Or five times. Or however many times you delete characters.... my point is, you're only at a low level one time on that character.
---
Let me tell you why I enjoyed it.
---
I started a new character. Right out of the vault, after grabbing a pipe pistol and some ammo from a corpse, I ran in one direction and shortly got ambushed by a squad of super mutants. I used up all my ammo taking out one, so I grabbed his weapon and took out another. I repeated this until they were all dead.
---
With another new character, I was in a similar situation, having been ambushed by super mutants again. This time, I had a pipe revolver. Without VATS, I took them down one by one, shooting between their eyes, with the big iron at my hip.
---
Both times I was at risk, because I had just started those characters. I nearly died both times. They had no build nor supplies, so I had to use anything at hand.
---
Having brought both characters to a higher level, I have, or nearly have, finalized my builds on both. I've found decent gear, and can mow down enemies effortlessly, even on my main who's sort of a DPS/Tank hybrid. Not exactly specialized in one, but can do both roles adequately. There's not much that can challenge my main except for the Imposter Sheepsquatch and the higher difficulties of Vault 94. When you get to the point where you're instagibbing scorchbeasts, it's pretty much just a grind to perfect your build even further by grinding gear. It can be fun to completely wipe out enemies, but not always when there's so little at stake.
---
But that risk factor also depends on your build. My other characters are more glass cannons. There is danger involved, but enemies are usually dead before I am.
---
Most importantly, sticking to areas more appropriate to your level allow you to explore while also providing a challenge. There's no difficulty strolling around level 20 zone at level 200. I mean, you can explore the world at any level, but why not test yourself? I find that I pretty much only stick to higher level areas on my high level character, despite exploration being one of my favorite things when I first started.
---
The reason why they stop the numbers in the chart is so it doesn't take up an unnecessary amount of space reporting levels most people are not going to achieve. They should be treated as either reference points on a continuous trend or they might be adjustments to the curve. From first hand experience my level 100+ character levels up a hell of a lot quicker than my level 300+ character. Which makes sense because if my math is correct 107 is about \~17k exp and 307 is \~49k exp per level.
---
fixing the duster is cool also!
---
I take my comment and upvote back, you can fuck off
---
Pretty sure you found all the interesting  “content” right there lol. People are still gonna be disappointed because there’s no much more to it
---
Ayy congratulations have a great wedding!!
---
I noticed that a private server that I was in had no random power armour. At any normal spawn points, checked like 10....
---
What console ?
---
Unlike the naysayers, you do your work. This post gives me hope that Bethesda has something great in store, and that there are people in there who truly cares about F76, even if it is just a few.
---
A good mystery, and the discovery of connections like this cannot go unrewarded. Take this platinum, you've earned it!
---
what happens with that dam were you do the manhunt event? there are some machines there saying that the capacity dropped below 50% or something could this be connected in some way with anything?
---
Had a workshop do the same thing, was kinda entertaining watching which turret won
---
I believe you can. I only deletes pictures was what I was reading. But they hold sentimental value so I was hoping to avoid that too :(
---
DayZ is pretty cool
---
Lore unfriendly? Is this your first fallout game?
---
I believe you can. I only deletes pictures was what I was reading. But they hold sentimental value too so I was hoping to avoid that too :(
---
We did 2 queens on same private server tonight and both were only crowned...  
---
Learned our lesson to get new private server after that...

---
East of watoga by the train tracks that curve north is a spawn point.  Helped friend get this on first server tried.  Spawns pretty regularly there...
---
Are **Mod Detection Movement** and **Mod Detection Sneak Skll** the only variables that matter when it comes to sneaking in PVE?
---
If this is true then I wonder how much does **ArmorShadowHide** "Armor Mod Hide in Shadows" (for armor with the shadowed mod), and also the muffled armor mod, have on **Mod Detection Movement** and **Mod Detection Sneak Skll** ? 
---
The wood armor mod shrouded also has a reference to both shadowed and muffled effects in its description, so if all of these stacked when using 5 pieces of wood armor, this could be better using than 5 **Harder to Detect** pieces. Right now I have 4 unyielding wood pieces, and I'm trying to test them against the 3 unyielding HTD pieces (which also have the ultralight mod) but it feels like the HTD pieces are better at keeping me hidden or in caution.
---
I think you're right about the chameleon legendary effect, even with a full set it doesn't match a full set of 1\* unyielding armor and 25-35 Agility. The build I'm using here is bloodied commando/sneak sniper (with sneak 3 perk) and only suppressed auto rifles btw.
---
No... I’m wondering why it’s lore unfriendly smh
---
Transfer them to USB?
---
You're right, I do call into question wikipedia being misused as a "definition" of anything.
---
Just keep working on your build and try to find better gear. You'll get there.
---
they always add new things but data miners discover everything xd
---
how would someone know that they added a hidden rock-door, with a pad that used the code 0000 were you can take an elevator that takes you to the entrance of vault 79
---
speaking of secret things, did bethesda add something about the nuka quantum paint armor? all the people i know just follow a video
---
Yup, had 3 protectrons detonate when defending the junkyard workshop. Was on PC, thought it was odd but it hasnt happened since.
---
My friend submitted today and they said he will be reimbursed. So if they said that then we need clarity from them.
---
Somewhat east or southeast from Graninger farm iirc
---
imagine a game mode were you join factoins, and the map is dividied maybe by 4 ones (just to start simple).
---
Responders territory had buff to restore health in their territory
---
Raider maybe have damages.
---
Brotherhood maybe more tanky armor with their PA or they have more quicky action point refresh in PA
---
and free states something like take less damages? or more damages to fauna? dunno this group.
---
team deatchmatch, capture flag or some key workshop into each other territory.... dunno there could be more than 2 types of servers this could be fun too
---
Make sure your best weapon has all of the perks to back it up. I have a bloodied explosive handmade and I have all the perks for it and I get like 400 damage per bullet. With sneak attack criticals, I can kill a scorchbeast in 3 seconds
---
I'd still like to see. When I'm almost at cap limit I go buy everything or almost everything from low level players. I usually just roll over every player to see their level  and try to find their camp to buy from them. Makes double the work I think
---
Show us your build and gear.
---
Had a similar thing happen to me on xbox
---
How about you explain instead of judging
---
How you justify that power armor seems made of butter being damaged from bare-hands fighting enemies?
---
Problem is I don't feel weak in a suit of PA, It does give incredible protection.
---
How come you need to farm for stims, sounds like you suck to me lmao.
---
Apparently there’s a new map coming out soon too.
---
So you don't use stims when using power armor? Are you in some easier server? Try going in high level zones
---
Just happened to me tonight
---
I had the same problem
---
Ranger armor that isn't exclusive to 1st would be cool. They know how much people love NV, they use the armor as incentive to buy first. Instead of using he knowledge that people love NV, to make their Fallout games more like NV. Bethesda logic...
---
I didn't say I dont use stim, I said how come you need to farm for them. I am drowning in stims that I have to sell them off to lose weight.
---
I am at level two hundred something, so you can shove it.
---
***But that's just a theory, a Game Theory. Thanks for reading!*** But seriously though. If any of these points prove to be true, which I think you have a pretty safe bet of saying so. It would be phenomenal if a detachment of the BoS returned with the survivors in Wastelanders and I really think they will. I still genuinely believe Bethesda at its core loves and aims to better its games for its fans, and that the root problems are with Bethesda's Marketing and Press. This much detail going into a goose hunt most people won't even see is just proof of that.
---
I flipped same for 5k today. Not sad to see the weight go, but had to hold out for a few days.
---
I think you meant buffs right?
---
Debuffs are negative conditions.
---
Because for every good thing they do, they seem to do ten bad things. So naturally the bad things they do get more attention.
---
I sold one recently for 15k. Took a couple server loads.
---
Personally shooting one of the damn things with my TSE Lever and watching it float off into the distance is still one of my favorite things in 76
---
Well it's easier to level after level 50, as you'd have access to better gear you'd farm in a much more efficient way.
---
Never did to have the need to farm them. So again, instead of judging you could say something useful to this post
---
Redbox.
---
Ok.  I’ll bite )
---
Thank you for an interesting conversation
---
…for the sake of continuing the conversation and being a non-sensible person risking the reductio ad absurdum trap 
---
Time is the main factor to consider. 
---
At present, FO76 Adventure mode is largely a PVE setting.  The “winning” part is very subjective.  A case can be made that the present paid-content is pay-to-win if the player’s goal is, for example, to have 10000 of each material.  Similarly, if the “win” goal is to reach level 500 in 30 days while being a packrat. In such cases the time-saving elements may play a role in “winning”.  However, these are extreme cases and are valid only if there’s an actual competitive setting for the “win”.  On the other hand, we all know players whose “win” is building that perfect camp (and then building another one), exploring, running missions (to unwind), making a perfect mission/vault/event run, making a welcoming store/bar, creative builds/traps, doing dailies, completing challenges, just chatting in game… … …
---
PVE content is not overly challenging and doesn’t require rare weapons/equipment beat.  Though there are many guides, few players actually run a perfect min-maxed build.  A level 100 character (or lower with proper planning) has no advantage over a level 1000 character.  With the present game economy, caps are easily earned and there’s little need for caps.  Rare items/weapons/armour is traded for rather than purchased.  Junk is easy to gather and in the end-game, there are few advantages to having 50 of a material as opposed to having 500 or 5000 (other than psychological comfort of having a hoard).
---
For majority of players, the paid content is not necessary to enjoy the game or to achieve their in-game goals.  Moreover, most skilled players have already found effective alternative solutions ranging from simply knowing what stuff they actually need to having multiple mules to carry all the stuff they find.
---
In my opinion, it’s all about “time”.  I agree that “available free time, the infrastructure of what city you live in, your twitch reflex due to your geneics etc.”  is not at present part of “pay-to-win” definition.  Since the present content introduced by Bethesda is “time-saving” – it’s more of “pay-for-convenience”.
---
PS. Rationalization aside, Bethesda/Zenimax are close to “crossing the line” and will likely cross the line if the money will be there.
---
PPS. FO76 has a lot of potential for factions and building where resources may become useful.  In that eventuality (and I hope there will be such eventuality), the advantages offered by the scrapbox will become pay-to-win (assuming it will remain a paid-only option)
---
Hmm I thought I saw someone mentioning stims, maybe I mixed up another post.
---
But you are not really saying anything useful because PAs do have better protection.
---
I laughed so hard at this.
---
I said what I think in the topic and above
---
There's no way you'll get banned for that. Don't worry
---
No mate, server hop as much as you like
---
Yes, don't you know that Bethesda will ban for playing the game.(they won't ban you)
---
Personally I think adding Fo1st was a shitty thing to do not neccesarily because it is a bad gimmick but mostly because first off Bethesda CLEARLY stated they wouldn't add and premium paid content. And secondly because Bethesda's marketing and press teams are basically acting like a couple of recovering alcoholics attending every weekly meeting drunk. Generally speaking, I like first. Its content is comparable to other memberships of similar quality and price the Survival Tent and unlimited scrap alone make it worth it in my opinion. And on the point of P2W you still have to go out and farm all the mats yourself so... yeah not really. That's just my opinion though.
---
Naw, hop in your blue box and be a time lord.
---
And that's bs.
---
Power armor defense is a amazing and yes u do feel strong especially with the strangler heart. How can it be lore unfriendly
---
Found the salt
---
You will be banned if you buy the game, it just works.
---
Maybe I can help. Rn I'm sitting on 25% health or there abouts in a protocoled t51 suit and I very rarely if ever go down. Just need to make the perks work for you that's all.
---
Oh hang on... WHAT?!? Yes! Absolutely yes!
---
First time I’ve ever agreed with a “... should...” post here!
---
Have your upboat good sir!
---
I think you all didn't understand what I mean. Power armors are some finely and technologically built armor. How can they or the user be damaged from some ghoul punching?
---
While fun, it would most likely be more "charred on the outside, raw on the inside" kind of cooking.
---
The reason I said this is that Oxhorn can tell a tale. Perhaps OP can do it better which would be ideal, but some of us (me, yet still shitty, and no comparison to OP - this guy..primo stuff) are better at writing than speaking. The thought behind my op was to bring broad attention to OPs adventure in hopes of finding the ending. No malice meant.
---
Because it's a videogame. Annoyances and obstacles are there to make it a challenge. To make it interesting. If power armor was how you'd like it to be it'd be a map of invincible terminators with even less reason to play than we do now. I get your point but all it all, it's a game.
---
I didn't say I want it be immortal but anyway...
---
Does reporting bugs and exploits to official employees and communicating with said employees not constitute the grounds of "working with"? Is there a better word? Maybe, but that's semantics. I never said he was being paid or was an official employee of Bethesda. I merely stated that he worked with community managers of the game to discover and expose bugs/exploits to improve the game.
---
Just immortal to ghouls but anyway...
---
I'd just want it to be more realistic
---
Man you a bitch aint you
---
This is definitely the wrong sub do it
---
Buggar I clicked the wrong sub sorry.
---
If I want it to be realistic mabye play another game?
---
Nice, anyone ever solo the SBQ?
---
A  friend ran into a level 68 scorched at Charleston Station, he was on his low level alt, the scorched ran away North, up the train tracks. probably 30mins later I FTed to another friends camp  near Sutton and the same level 68 Scorched was there...I killed it, thought nothing of it and then I die from it exploding like a sentry bot.
---
Wasn't the first time...I had a ghoul doing the same thing you described...it was terrifying and hilarious.
---
'English, baby!'
---
I have a few times but it doesnt require a ridiculous build with ridiculous gear to do it
---
Lorewise, PA can be defeated by high powered rifles like the .308 and some 7.62 rounds. So it's perfectly within the lore for players in PA suits to be damaged by some rifles and weapons.
---
But in the comments you are suggesting that the PA should make you immune to, at the very least, melee attacks from Scorched. Presumably, also from dogs, rats, insects, etc. That is a game balance issue, one that needs to weigh the ability of players to use PA anywhere on the map while still being threatened in each location. So you'll have things like high level dogs being able to slowly kill you while in PA.
---
"all their money"
---
Dude, how little money do you have? A one year sub is pocket money if you have a good job. Even if you are not at a good job a monthly sub is... nothing! A few dollars. 
---
I am not promoting it. I think scrap boxes, survival tents and ranger outfits should have been available for all. I have, however, no problem with paying for a private server. Done that with many games, Conan Exiles was my last one. I would have liked those worlds to have been persistent though, like in other games. Maybe in the future!
---
Speak hypothetically i think like when it gets to the point of turning enemies into dust it certainly went way past the charred too however the way i Invision it is more like the way super duper or some or pharma farma perks works when it comes to chances of the enemy dropping a perfectly cooked meat as if like i described it cooked just right reaching that perfect cooking point that can happen between raw dead and turning into dust pile by luck.
---
Some people actually consider that what you described as the perfect cooking point of barbecued meat btw 😄
---
Just ran into the limit again yesterday. So... yeah! Me too! I agree!
---
Yeah, that's the thing. But it's from the very first datamine a year ago but seems it never actually made it to the shop :o
---
It seemed to offering the last weapon I had picked up. PS4.
---
I know. I have friends who love their meat like that, but I am more of a "well done" kind of guy myself. But, as mentioned, it would be a fun feature. Flamers, lasers and plasma need all the love they can get.
---
If you want more realism for Power armour, go play Fallout 4 and add a bunch of Power Armour Mods from the Nexus.
---
There's mods that make you immune to radiation and any sort of energy/Ballistic in PA as the PA absorbs all the damage, until it breaks and then, if one part breaks off, only that limb receives damage. There's Solar Powered Power armour, PA that follows me as a companion, mods that enhance existing vanilla PA mods, ones that let you add legendary effects to it...and more.
---
Fallout 76 is online multiplayer and so has to be balanced to an extent.
---
&gt;I thought they where only used by the railroad  
---
No. You can actually find railway rifles in a [two locations](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Railway_rifle_(Fallout_4)) across the map, and also appeared in [Fallout 3](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Railway_rifle_(Fallout_3)). I don't think there's any specific lore related to it in any game, so we can only assume that it's just a post-War creation that was independently developed in a few locations.
---
The cryolator also probably isn't a wholly new technology. The [terminal entry](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_111_terminal_entries#Cryolator) in Vault 111 merely mentions that it's that scientist's prototype. However, given that cryogenic weaponry already exists in the games (cryo-grenades and the flash freezing cryo-weapons on Protectrons) said scientist probably developed the Vault 111 cryolator based on already existing technologies. It wouldn't be impossible for other people to do the same elsewhere - they merely look the same because the assets were re-used from a game design standpoint.
---
[](/cadancehmm)Got a tiny 50mb update today, wonder if that had anything to do with it.
---
Ionized meat
---
No that's literally a part of the game dont worry
---
I think most people give herd mentality a miss - definitely keep marsupial ( if you can ). Try and buy the better ones from a player vendor.
---
Remember this is an online title with PvE/PvP aspects. It needs to be balanced. If you wanted power armor to be as strong as you'd like it to be it would break any sense of game balance and would be the only thing to use. 
---
Though to counter some points you made.
---
1. Power Armor has no penalty to movement speed.
---
2. Jetpack is the least useful chest piece mod. I'd rather recommend basic Kinetic Servos over a jetpack. 
---
3. In FO4 you could upgrade PA. In 76 they replaced upgrading pieces with level requirement. Make sure you are using level 45 or 50 variants of your PA.
---
4. If you think PA is slow why would you want to make it slower through modifications?
---
5. Power Armor was experimental tech that was developed prior to the war. The first suits were in use during the Anchorage Operation. In every Fallout title (1, 2, Tactics, 3, NV (though rare), and the overhauled model in 4 and 76 is some of the best defense you can get in game. If you feel like it is "weak" I think that is a you problem.
---
I think ricky you are the one with problems. 
---
 I remember you whining recently about not getting any mischief night rewards then again for missing out on the free scrap.  FFS .
---
It... It has only ever been to cycle to the previous weapon you were using. If I equip a crossbow and then a railway rifle I can quickly swap between those two weapons. If I equip a pipe revolver while I'm holding the crossbow then I cycle between the revolver and crossbow. If I equip a Gatling Gun while holding the revolver I cycle between the revolver and Gatling.
---
That just means more 5mm ammo for you to loot! When his buddy picks up the minigun and uses it, when you kill him he will sometimes have 500 rounds for some reason and the original mutie will have the usual 101.
---
I've been wanting someone to do this for FO4, since it's supposed to be pre-war riot gear. Would be nice to see an official concept.
---
oh shit ahahahahah -23, my record is something like 40s my man at least here in this sub, hard to surpass it tho as it was during the patch 14 days and sub was rather alive, 23 seems to be like best I can get now :( sad!
---
Long live The Enclave!
---
5k at least
---
&gt;(No offense to the animator(s) for the oppossum, I love and appreciate your work! It's still really amazing work &lt;3)
---
lol couldn't even go through with your criticism of the game
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Probably Vault 63, people have ended up in there before when travelling to Hordes in Ash Heap. It is not in use yet, but the inside is already there. Did it look scorched/burned?
---
I did have a problem for awhile with one of my gattling plasmas. It just did not seem to know the weapon existed. Would switch with every other wepon I had. Then when I stashed everything but 2 weapons it would go between the other weapon and my bear fists
---
of course you'd pay for it lol
---
Why so hostile?
---
Nothing "required" requires a subscription 😉
---
we know they look here for ideas, you could at least say I'd love it to be a part of FF package!
---
Thats not ideal
---
Well done, pretty sure that's French for burt haha. All about that medium rare
---
Outstanding.
---
yea its up to us to decide bethesda's financials and be anticonsumer while doing so, good call man
---
I'd suggest watching Oxhorn's YT video "How Super Mutants Came To West Virginia" for most of the clues regarding this mystery, which you'll appreciate! There's plenty of terminal entries and environmental storytelling linking West Tek, Huntersville, Emmit Disposal Site and that lake. Huntersville itself was not the ground zero of the FEV  distribution, the lake was.
---
While I appreciate the effort you've put into this, you're basing your argument on the foundation of a false premise - you're making your own definition of what pay2win means when there is already an established, fairly authoritative definition which, while absolutely not set in stone and formalised in any dictionaries, it's at least consistent with other, less authoritative sources.
---
Namely that pay2win is about someone paying for ANY gameplay advantage that non-players do not get.
---
If we're just going to make up our own facts and definitions to suit your own perspective, there's no point discussing this further.
---
If you have an authoritative source for a definition of pay2win that closer fits what YOU regard as pay2win, let's continue but as it stands, with all due respect, there's really no point.
---
I haven't.... Yet. Gonna try it tomorrow maybe. But definitely this weekend. I attempted it a couple weeks ago before I had my perks where they needed to be and got my ass handed to me on a silver platter. Lol. Hopefully this weekend the SBQ will fall under my thumb! 😁😌😂
---
Okay buddy. I am actually a fan boy I have a fucking beautiful NCR Ranger tattooed on me. So no I won't  "quit playing" I understand that guy you are perceiving yourself to be but how much physical cash have YOU put into fo76? Really? It's  buggy as fuck all and has been for a year now. Trust me I will "give it time" on top of the 500+ hours put into it.  Don't bother with a rebuttal because I'd you understood where in coming from you would have just been like.  "Yeah"
---
BTW... Running the Unyeilding Bloody Build. If you need help or are interested in this build, let me know and I'll do what I can to help!
---
Heck today I had a fast travel bug where when I arrived my ui was there but my screen was black. Could pull up my pip boy and map but otherwise black.  Happened to me twice tonight.  Had to exit the game entirely to fix it.
---
they should restrict pvp to nw only or make it so a workshop owner can shoot to kill at any player that enters the space instead of the other way around.
---
anybody can just wander into workshop and start shooting at their leisure.
---
thats why all pvp are *explatives* in this game, theres no other way to play it.
---
Link that tat.
---
Dear lord, that's pretty much the game in a nutshell. The only problem is bumping into others doing the same thing.
---
You can sell each piece for about 4k. I have seen a full set sell for 10k. I am on US Ps4 tho, I am not sure if the market is the same everywhere.
---
well yesterday it spawned a few times there for me while i was searching for megasloth :) i wish you luck that it spawns for you as well!
---
Must be these groups on every platform. Multiple people on PC run this base setup.
---
Thanks!
---
I know, I know... and my friendly keep giving me shit for it, but I just can't imagine putting my teeth in meat that is even the slightest pink. Everyone says it tastes so much better, but my minds just locks up at the thought.
---
There already are marketplaces for in game trading though....
---
It is super rare, but it happens. There has been several posts about it since the game launched. Very, very rare, but it happens.
---
TSE is shit. Been shit since February maybe.
---
Because you haven't bought the Chain-Link Scope from the Atomic Shop yet.  Only 1000 Atoms!
---
I agree that there isn’t much point to discussing this further – especially since our points of view are not significantly different. Our conversation and verbal fencing aside…
---
The “pay-to-win” and “pay-for-convenience” arguments existed ever since game developers discovered this monetization stream. The terms are not mutually exclusive. The problem arises when some writers use the terms insensitively to overemphasize an argument.
---
Is general definition “pay-to-win” applicable to FO76? Yes.
---
Is "pay-to-win" the best description of present FO76 monetization model? No. Pay-for-convenience is more appropriate. 
---
Saying that FO76 is “pay-to-win” is like describing a “fender-bender” as a “car-crash”.
---
Be well Wastelander
---
I've been saying this the whole time, with the amount of cancels or just straight up refunds they must have got so people could just load up the scrap box so they're set for months and cop the Ranger outfit, they obviously are waiting a month till they release anything for 1st or give discounts.
---
Were that the case, almost everyone would be banned. Not even just the people that do this intentionally but those with crappy connections could get caught up in the dragnet too.
---
Cheers for the positive attitude, bottom line is going into pvp with a positive attitude can be fun.  It's just pixels, nothing to sweat over :)
---
Minecraft logic right here.
---
https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp0N-aOgmwx/?igshid=1lgik79cdpgm4
---
Probably intentional so you can suffer bugs and lag from normal servers that makes them despawn when they die or have another player kill them first so you grind the game more for literally nothing.
---
Yeah I went to the site for xbox and nothing but white boxes and a picture at the top of the page
---
If you don’t like the thanks to hate ratio in r/fo76 you should leave.
---
I love this!
---
Fallout 1st released. That’s about the only noteworthy thing I think, at least it’s all I remember.
---
Nothing lol. Wanna kill the Scorch Beast queen every day all day?
---
Maybe add in new weapons, over the old ones. If anything they'll be an easy 40 scrip for a weekly challenge.
---
I just found out about that. What the hell? I'm pretty sure I'm done with this game. Time to go back to modding Skyrim and Fallout 4
---
Why would they bother doing this when they can charge us for them..
---
Where was the location you used for this? It’s a really cool build, I don’t want to replicate it but I was looking for a decent build location
---
Lol
---
yes but players can make fast ads which allows for a easier marketplace. I personally am tired of scoping fallout vendors for 86 armors just to find they are outfits only.
---
its just released :) we need the power of people to help make it grow. I just released the site 3 hours ago.
---
I spent almost my whole gametime in PA and never felt too weak. There has to be a balance since this is a multiplayer game.
---
Don't know if this helps, but I used to be able to go into the Chambers underneath dyer chemical, but now I go the the same doors and it tells me I don't have the key card anymore.....and keys can't be removed from our inventory. 
---
Didn't think to much of it until now, because it's probably been since before the borrows that I was last able to go down there.
---
Could there now be new stuff down there? And a new key card is needed?
---
Or did I actually manage to lose a key card somehow?
---
Pretty sure a plasma weapon is not going to "cook" the meat. I am pretty sure that stuff is not even remotely okay to eat after being shot with something like that given what the goo looks like. :)
---
That is awesome, my snake tat looks like gummy worms.
---
Long live America, brother. We can rebuild this *scorched* land!
---
Loving my Fallout 1st Ranger armour, because I paid for it, so damn good. Thanks Todd.
---
Solid snake or your just being an ass? Vincent valentine is going next to grey fox.
---
On the Xbox lfg thing I’ve seen people do and say crazy things to try get people to give them free stuff. Like someone had their friends pretend to be scammers and faked that one of them got scammed and they literally threatened to end their life every 30 minutes for like a whole day till someone gave them what they wanted
---
No it came out bad I gotta get it covered
---
Sounds like your experience is what I expected and want but a long way from what I'm getting. Which platform are you on?
---
What did i just read...
---
I don’t know
---
I know how you feel about it man, I really do. I've played fallout hardcore for a long time. I just feel like I'm defending my ugly baby sometimes lol. Yeah its ugly, but I still love it.
---
😆 something being ok to eat is fairly subjective in fallout. Maybe instead of meat plasma goo could grant some toxic goo instead? It would be pretty cool to have this level of detail for different types of weapons but i believe that would be asking for too much. Cooked meat seems more achievable and still wouldn't be too far off given that dust piles and plasma goo drops raw meat both drops raw meat. Something more realistic and complex we might only see with a mod when and if mods ever happen
---
Morgantown Nuclear Winter Map and a Halloween event (which is now over).
---
Alright bro, fair. Yes it is ugly. Missing my legendarys when they despawn,  blue screens, unable to build an epic base due to silly snaps. Etc. Wtc. I love my ugly baby too. Friends? :)
---
For sure. I feel you on those base snaps lol.
---
Have you experienced this:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dx5se9/anyone\_elses\_quick\_switch\_button\_fucked\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dx5se9/anyone_elses_quick_switch_button_fucked_up/)
---
Basically they removed free content to add in payed content. Unless you don’t mind giving into Bethesda to let them milk you like a chocolate cow there’s really nothing new besides they nerfed bloodied.
---
I'm honestly so dumbfounded how you think that giving people their scrap back apparently makes them amazing people and that if you disagree you're just bitter...
---
The problem should have never existed in the first place, people literally paid $13/$100 for a service that didn't even work, and basically ended up punishing them for buying it, too right they're allowed to be bitter about it.
---
If you paid for a bus ticket but the driver doesn't let you on the bus, he isn't suddenly regarded as a hero for then letting you on the bus the next day and letting you use the service you paid for...
---
They also hate each other. The same thing happened to me earlier, only they decided to start shooting at one another. It was funny at first, but then I realised I'd wasted my junk trying to repair them...
---
I never said they were amazing, but they did make it right. Like it or not. I even said following another comment much of it is deserved.
---
Also to compare with the bus driver, he would have to let you drive lol.
---
I agree, I can be in full lvl50 t51 and a lvl 62 charred feral ghoul can kill me in under 2 seconds (im lvl 126). Also my power armor lowers my carry weight by about 80lbs for barely double resistances across the board
---
They didn't nerf bloodied.
---
"That's just what we do. We lay down and die... So that we can live!"
---
I’ve heard reports saying in private fallout 1st servers that gun fu is instantaneous.  Meaning that the “slow” you are experiencing is server lag. So this will continue to occur at level 3
---
Nope. Never.
---
Xbox One.
---
They didn't 'make it right', they compensated the people they tricked into buying it by giving them the service they actually paid for.
---
Had to remove one turret two days ago because of this and one yesterday. Glad I don't have the missile ones yet.
---
find out with your purchase of fallout plus, for just $29.99!
---
Done it two times. First time those legendarys popped up but last night I got non. Only found level 15 and 32 ghouls opposed to the 60+ times the first time around. :(
---
Now your asking the real questions
---
Are you kidding? Every hate post gets the bandwagon going. People literally just copy and paste post titles after anything beth does, good or bad and get upvotes. It's worse bc most dont bother to read or research. Like the map guy that was banned. So many upvotes on hate posts. Few days later it was found he used a cheat engine. For good or bad he did the rules say no cheat engines.
---
Think most of the ones you've mentioned have returned already at some point. They will return again
---
Likely they will return eventually but no one can answer you for certain.
---
Huh?
---
Dude can you shut the hell up for christ sake? Devs at bethesda aren't stupid. They know what's going on with the game right now, and they know this is a persistent issue for some of us. They either haven't figured out how to fix it yet, or are not prioritizing it as it only happens to a smaller scale of players.
---
Yes because LMG uses A LOT of ammo.
---
Only "Almost done with the game?"
---
You sure, that this isn't it? The Final Straw?
---
No ranting, raving, cursing the heavens?
---
Or is that for "Next Time?"
---
I remember reading something about the workers there that were responsible for dumping the nuclear waste, basically they were ordered to continue dumping there even though it was already at its capacity. Don't know the consequences of it though.
---
So for now yes, I'd radaway any mutation you get until you have the perks to go with then come find me I can give you a package deal on syrums lol
---
add me Dave-TheLime
---
I wish ppl could get over tse weapons already !
---
A qe harpoon would work. I have a ie and qe, the ie needs no perks but reload makes it a one hit kind of deal. Heavy is the way to go with those points. Read explosive bait works too.
---
I am aware some perks need to be moved around. Depending on the area I am in, I sometimes go without PA to save fusion cores. Right now my biggest concern is ranged damage though, as I really would like to do the last missions and loot a SBQ.
---
I am thinking that I should spec for that and later on omptimize it for 2h.
---
How do you handle scamming?
---
This Bethesda is very unlikely to leave money on the table. I'd be surprised if they didn't come back at some stage.
---
I agree with your points, but probably for differing reasons. In any traditional sense, it might be debatable that the game is P2W, from my perspective it is in the sense that you are able to pay to gain an advantage over, or mitigate, game mechanics that are intentionally built into the game - in plain terms, you can pay extra for solutions to problems that have been baked into the gameplay loop for precisely that purpose. I call this P2W because in this game I’m competing - and thus trying to ‘win’ - not just against the bugs and glitches (with lack of manual save) but against punitive and often unnecessary game mechanics. So the thing I’m competing and trying to ‘win’ against is the *game itself* not other players. For example - the solution to food degradation problems would be to either rebalance them as they are too quick or remove the mechanic altogether but instead the solution was a fridge put on sale for $7.
---
Not really no. I think legendary scorchbeast are the only things, if that.
---
You just need to hit her to get loot ?
---
Lowers carry weight by 80? You need calibrated shocks on the legs then...
---
The guy and Bethesda made an update that they all got their characters back with about a week's reverted progress.
---
My 80 something damage sniper doesn't seem to work for that, and the times I've been around she has died too fast for me to get a melee hit in.
---
Can you build regular jet packs?
---
Bethesda thinks we are stupid.
---
did everyone who signed up for first get this or just the people affected by it? or just people who complained to Bethesda saying that they lost their gear?
---
Doesn’t work on safari on the iPhone? All I get is a black ground, an image at the top and a bunch of (0)s?
---
Pretty sure I read recently intelligence doesn't increase xp, that was all other fallouts. Probably changed because everyone would start with 15 or 20 intelligence and level up at a ridiculous rate like he described??
---
Far as I know intelligence is only for crafting and scrapping to unlock mods, hacking computers...
---
Nope
---
Lol. Just report it. It takes 2 minutes. That’s how they collect data on which issues are more frequent. You say it’s a common problem. The only way they have that data is if you report. You’re just being stubborn at this point.
---
Maybe try lowering textures. Your 6gb card can probably handle high, but not ultra. Try medium if that doesn't work.
---
If that's not the issue, try swapping between full screen and borderless window mode. There are other causes/fixes but I'd start with those.
---
I can.
---
Took me 3 server hops yesterday, always go here.
---
Good idea, and with factions coming we could have a team death match mode to. 20 v 20
---
That is weird indeed then, sorry,  no idea. Have you tried turning it on and off ;)
---
Aawh to bad, will probably take 6 years for them to fix it.
---
You two take "Power Couple" to a whole new level.
---
Damm, i run a bloodied build so never had issues with that
---
Liberty Prime Obviously!
---
Can't believe I got down voted for this, it seems Fallout players these days likes story books more than an actual game.
---
We should form some sort of in game guild of Wasteland Detectives. Build some camps around the Police Station in Abandoned Bog Town and go sluething for secrets. It's a shame we kind of missed out on the Wild Appalachia Sheepsquatch build-up but with Wastelanders on the way it seems the perfect time. 
---
I quite like revisiting areas after I'vecleared them out. I still occasionally go down The Burrows or Arktos Farma even when Project Paradise isn't running because I just like exploring. 
---
Grab a duster, keep a Big Iron on your hip, lets do some detective work.
---
My turrents are attacking my scrap bot and two of my friends camps are also being attacked by their own turrents. There were no enemies inside the foundations either. 
---
Apparently it's a very very old bug that has resurfaced since the last patch.
---
It does, though I don't think it's required. I've seen someone else mention that the Free States jetpack he had on his looked bad with the regular paint job he had.
---
I have PS4 pro and the last couple of weeks have been bad for me too in terms of frame rate drops and performance.
---
I’ve never played the game on regular PS4 but for me I’ve not had many issues until the last few weeks
---
Hmmm sorry mate no idea then. I don’t have it myself so I can’t test under similar conditions.
---
Thanks for trying!
---
Apparently Juicehead talked about the Christmas event but I haven't seen his vids recently so I'm not sure
---
The drum used to be 85 but Bethesda thought it would be a swell idea to nerf it to 30, leaving the stinging magazines at 35 *with* armour penetration and then not fixing the issue for months.
---
Classic Bethesda.
---
I started to, but last week's raid I found I did OK with my usual Scout armour (one piece is Sentinel and one is Cavalier) and switched to my X-01 for the second half of it.
---
r/falloutlore r/fo76filthycasuals
---
In NW u can only get t51b the ultracite u got in adventure must've been from the bos quest
---
The game is about exploring the Wasteland. Looking for maximum comfort and convenience ruins part of the experience. You already have fast travel, you already have items separated into categories. 
---
Next step is asking for legendary crafting, home delivery services and free shipping of the items you want. Then, why playing at all? 
---
Don't be lazy. It is fun to be surprised by vending machines.
---
Pretty much certain that power armour comes with a built in, hidden damage reduction buff. That plus the much higher DR and the emergency protocols mod make it pretty damn good and easily accessible.
---
Exterminators would be pretty helpful though if it lowers the acid damage from mirelurk hunters. Those things are fucking Satan.
---
That's in the Mire.
---
I agree that acid damage is brutal.
---
35%
---
Well, theoretically, if I make a deal with 5 players, and each log in with me to NW with the auto-team function of (so we play as 1-player teams), we can spawn ourselves on a agreed-upon spot, and they could then let themselves be killed by me quickly in order to clear the challenge, and we can get on to other things with no detriments.
---
I fought a powerarmor horde once. Turned out just to be scorched unfortunately.
---
This.
---
Drum should b at least 75 like unturn... or 100
---
As soon as I get a full suit of strangler PA I’m going to give them a taste of their own medicine and see how they like it.
---
Yeah this used to happen with Horde enemies in the Ash heap, I'm surprised this is still a problem but I suppose at least they've patched it so you can't just go explore down there. I'm guessing because it's a moving event it tries to determine the nearest safe location and sometimes this gets confused and dumps you in the vault interior.
---
Wasn't the free week half a year ago, or even more? If so, then your post would have nothing to do with the current state of the game, right?
---
And for your information, I have been playing this game on a regular PS4 all along, and it's been far from being unplayable all this time. There is occasional lag and some frame drops, yes, when the server is overloaded, and especially on some events and vault raids, but never anything I couldn't manage.
---
And when the free trial was up, duping exploits were also still rampant, and those were notorious for affecting the whole server, up until crashing it.
---
That’s another bug that’s been quite irritating as well. Only fix for me is to relaunch the game
---
That makes more sense now.  Thanks.
---
1) Wasn't award there was a free week promo currently out
---
2) How long is your friends list?  For some reason the game syncs this rather frequently and with high priority and is the cause of *some* of the hitching that occurs in the game.
---
Mostly because the number of rounds you get crafting regular .308 is terrible compared to the amount you get when crafting prime 308.  Considering the amount of ammo an lmg blows through you waste a lot more resources to craft ammo for a non-primed version.
---
Don't worry, if youve been writing for 3 years and haven't had any tickets yet, you can use your good writer exemption.
---
Priming it makes it use Ultracite .308 instead of regular. The ammo production for the UC variant is easier to produce in large quantities despite the flux requirement.  This is important because the LMG eats ammo like nothing else besides maybe a minigun.
---
Wastelanders took you plant! Bastards!
---
Yes
---
Just want to mention there are a few known sonic emitters, fort defiance, and a few forward stations have them.  Can't think of the names of the stations but I know I've used them before.
---
You can pinpoint the object causing problem by placing the spotlights that follows the enemy... just check where they are pointing.
---
I found many lv52 mr handy that keep on its spot, don't fight back (besides trash talk), don't shoot... nothing. They just wait you to finish them.
---
That is where I bag mine. I have the best luck there.
---
big oof. Theres nothing you can do about this on your side except play on potato settings for constant 60+. Hopefully IF mod support comes we will be able to use optimized texture mods.
---
I hear that. I have the strangler PA but haven't had a chance to use it in the raid yet. Works great against the queen.
---
He mighta spawned before u is all.
---
That is bullshit! Another comment has a link to a post about crowned sbq but his theory was that the 3,star legendaries “dry up” on private servers.
---
Another post from months ago actually asked if any of the diving gear was found by datamining and it wasnt. Maybe it has been added later, but that would be a nice way to check if thats a dead end of not i guess.
---
Go to any of the more difficult events and you will find plenty of people to revive
---
P2W doesn't require a win condition...
---
Creating artificial problems to offer solutions blocked by paywal can be considered P2W... like the scrapbox. It's a major lie imply that 30000 steel takes significant more from server resource than 5.
---
I sold a FE LMG yesterday! Was it you that purchased it? lol
---
If you are on PS4, I have an extra plan if you want it.
---
Pretty sure you need jetpack plan
---
Can't hack on Xbox he probably spawned before you
---
No this was xbox but thanks for the offer
---
Each level requires more
---
No it's pointless. They have fixed actually rare crashes in this game that players with 2000+ hours are unable to recognize. This freeze happened to me 6 times, and it happened and still happens to other people multiple times. It's way more common than you think, and if they were to fix rarer things, then this should be next. 
---
By the way, I love how you keep thinking this is not a game issue and rather my issue. 
---
You think that just because you don't encounter it then it must not be a game issue at all for me? Everyone has a different system. People might be encountering this bug only on certain hardware or maybe something else. 
---
Things aren't black and white. And I thought that showing you proof that they actually know about it would have made you understand. But sadly that doesn't seem to be the case. 
---
I suggest you not to comment on threads like this in the future if you keep going with this attitude.
---
I can’t answer why, at least not with anything other then Beth’s brain dead devs, because they were the ones complaining about sent/assassins even though it did nothing against a good build. Nobody who had sent/assassins or TSEs complained about it, it was just the excavator wearing casuals that complained, because they are too poor to get them themselves. Same as all the survival nerfs and it’s eventual removal.
---
Unfortunately they aren't used as load screen images if you delete them from fo76
---
But don't you see everyone's selected spawn location prior to spawn either represented as a blue or red dot?
---
I know this is probably something you’ve tried, but set your shadows to the lowest possible setting.  I still get moments of frame rate drop, particularly in the Sons of Dane barn, but it’s tolerable.
---
Maybe this just explain the water fountain and it's disease curing capabilities?
---
Oxhorns a fraud that was caught making up false lore, why would you ruin ops hard work and dedication to minute detail by giving that sham (oxhorn) any sort of credit for it?
---
Not all fo1st members got free stuff, stop saying that it’s bullshit.  Bethesda messed up by giving SOME fo1st members free stuff when they lost nothing.  I didn’t get crap, no 600 VS here, just the simpleton 4 I have managed to get from one successful standard raid.
---
Even within fo1st only some members are preferred I guess to Bethesda...
---
2 sbq’s last night on same private server and both were only crowned not 3 star. So much for bug free...
---
Agree
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Are you on WiFi or Ethernet cable? For me it improved when I started using cable. My house WiFi is very busy.
---
You have probably seen it already, but in the middle of fire base Hancock, Johnson's acre and relay tower el b1 02 there is a small lake that looks onto watoga and the view for the nuclear blasts are awesome
---
Have you tried setting Shadow Distance to Low? (I think it's like 3x the distance than Ultra in Fallout 4) It's known to eat fps in places with many buildings,etc like Morgantown.
---
Shotguns un-nerfed or instant respec so I can play again when?
---
It was designed to look all creepy and shit because of them wanting to create every single way to warn intelligent life not to go there thousands of years after our language may die out.
---
Agreed.
---
Yea it was crap we thought it was a fluke with the first so tried again and got a turd present. 
---
Before that on the server we were getting legendary enemies at awol and other events but the back to back sbq’s were the nightcap so we didn’t bother to go looking around in that world for more legendaries afterward. 
---
The 4 regular. SB’s that spawned in the area between the nuke drops from the fissures were all non legendary fwiw.
---
I'm a bit jealous ... Well done!
---
Thank you!
---
Hum i will take a look! Thanks!
---
He mighta been right onto of ur dot s9 u didnt see it
---
I never said all got it. I didnt lol. I have like 4 vault steel too haha.
---
What type of armor are you trying to add it on?  Might have spare plans depending on what type of armor you are working with.
---
Are you offering the plan publicly, by chance? If so I'd be interested.
---
Word it’s just on the outskirts of watoga at the ruined pylon there that has stairs to go up it a ways. From that point it spawns in the area looking toward watoga around the watered area. 
---
My friend wasted all kinds of time sever hopping and hooked him up first try lol
---
Death claw also can spawn there so you know your in the right area at least but sloth seems most common spawn. This is NOT the power station with the guaranteed death claw spawn that is north of watoga...
---
Thanks Bethie, thx for ruining Fallout with your unnecessary greed. THANK YOU
---
Yes it’s still possible.
---
Or its time for you to start over.
---
Starting early huh lol.
---
Welcome to the Appalachia shuffle!  At level 50, you no longer get more points to assign to your SPECIAL any more.  Every time you level up past level 50, you can either move a point from one SPECIAL to another (I.E. intelligence to luck, etc.) OR you can pick a new perk card to add to your deck.  You also get a perk card pack every 5 levels.  
---
TL;DR: you can still get it, you just have to move your other cards around to equip it once you get it through leveling.
---
There are no specific sales figures for the game itself but the general rule of thumb for the industry is that PC is the smallest market of the three.
---
It's been that way for a very long time. It's why you see ui and mechanics decisions lean heavily towards consoles &amp; why they fight so hard against changes that only impact the PC. 
---
I use to know someone who use to work for Bethesda &amp; they said that pretty much console was king when it came to design.
---
ok thanks :)
---
It was always true. 5 is the cap
---
Ave!
---
That's your own logic right there. "lol"
---
Appreciate it, I will try to track you down over the next week or so. 
---
Cheers
---
Not playing any longer but Take my upvote for your deliberate and detailed investigation. Well done with well explained evidence and theories!
---
It was just me playing relatively away from much action or people
---
I partied up once, it worked okay until we went into the first little city... And FPS drops abysmally
---
I bring it up now, upon playing at a friend's on his ps4 pro, that the performance of the game was more stable 
---
Yes, there were the old FO4 bugs Bethesda lazily left.... But less flickering, less input lag, and less stutter...
---
I could not be around other players without freezing or lagging "without lag" on my ps4 regular 
---
And not much has changed by Bethesda up make their product more stable 
---
If you enjoy the game have fun... I just want to warn those with a ps4 non pro up be wary that the performance might be too much of an issue to ignore
---
I get it. You don’t have a clue what’s going on. I’m 2000 hours in, still rockin a tse handmade on one of my characters. Still hits hard, shreds enemies. Keep rocking your junkies broadsider though...... good luck.
---
There's a subreddit for that.
---
Wow, the party members I were with were on ps4 pro. So they couldn't give me feedback. And asked what my internet connection was until I explained it...
---
My friends ps4 pro was "better" at functioning FO76, than the non pro... But Christ if you're having issues... 
---
Is it framerate drop around people, partying, enemies, or input lag?
---
Technically speaking, yes
---
No it looked pretty clean haha. I managed to get a screenshot. I will try to upload later.
---
I really wish they gave it more RPG elements where you choose the faction you want to join up with instead of having to join all of them. It would be nice to see more faction events and even actual faction allegiances but sadly that probably won’t happen until we get dwellers v. Raiders with Wastelanders
---
Is the US army a faction? Are the people who hunt cryptids a faction?
---
Man you're spamming all over lol.
---
Does it change the power armor to match the store skin or does it have a unique look per power armor?
---
I clearly dont play enough bc I dont know what body you're talking about. 🤦‍♀️
---
Sometimes it's just a visual glitch. Try selling something to the vendors. Had their happen a few times.
---
If you were on PS4 I’d give you one for free.
---
Revolution!  I’d be happy they fix trade bug. But alas, BGS no listen
---
In the mire its a random encounter
---
You can find Trick Or Treater bodies. A witch, and skeleton, and they can have the plan for their costume, and mask/hat, much like the civil war reenactors.
---
US Army can be counted as a faction as you do technically join them but they are split up between the Enclave and the BoS. Cryptid Hunters aren’t organized enough to be a faction past just being a hobby, really. I counted factions as any significant/joinable group that exists in-game as well as what the wiki counts as factions
---
True story.
---
Yeah, that was a great idea...But didn't work.  'Vendor does not have enough caps.'
---
Weirdly, when I went in, like half of my radiation dial was red (it hasn't been), so I took some meds, and it didn't budge for a while, then cleared...I dunno what's going on with this guy.
---
Players just aren't used to this kind of thinking anymore.  They expect cutscenes, or a talking NPC to dump exposition on them.  In all forms of media, you find an aversion to ambiguity and pragmatism.  People want explanations and answers, even if they are oversimplified or wrong, because they can't be bothered to try connecting the dots themselves.
---
But see, the thing about connecting the dots is that you invest a little of yourself in doing so.  Your creativity and your imagination.  And because you "own" part of that solution, it feels all the more real to you.  It's kind of like how a book seldom compares to its movie adaptation.  A movie will never do justice to how it looked in your mind.
---
Try one that's not from WS?
---
But  NV was made by obsidian and with many of the developers from Black Isle studio who made 1&amp;2. 
---
As much as I’d like FO I don’t think we’ll see another as good as NV sadly.
---
I was able to complete it during the Scorched Earth event, found there’s always a few people who go down during that.
---
Capped at 5
---
I had them be at 0 caps and sold something and it reset them.
---
Not sure if this is related but I’ve noticed when on private worlds, sometimes the random items in the world do not reset for days on end. When I collect things on public worlds they reset every 20hrs like clockwork.
---
I would like to try that as well. Level 50+ something so even if I suck at the strategic bits I can inflict some damage. Will be on in something like 5-6h.
---
Psn: TraGolv
---
An advice for Rifleman builds here
---
Get something with higher fire rate for boss fights.
---
Did you just start this week? It was like within a month.
---
I tried.  Didn't work.  I took their last 4 caps though.
---
And what bug is that?
---
Yes, it was fixed a few patches back. Just verified it in game.
---
Unhook the power to turret, or pick it up and put it back down.
---
It was in the atom shop during halloween.
---
I've played many fame where you host a game and others join on your game. Maybe there will be a mod that allows you to do it with this game lol.
---
I'm a dad and I love the Excavator ;)
---
Spawn at the flooded trainyard, turn back towards Watoga. Just over the creek on your left is a Chance for megasloth, or mirelurks, or robots, ect. Also a chance I n sundew Grove.
---
Not technically no, it was just a gladiator skin
---
Sounds good! Mine’s NakedAmongWolves, I’ll add you.
---
Pistols have 3 problems: low ammo capacity, no armor penetration and low damage.
---
First problem (and 3rd too) - just add perk in luck with dual weld. 2 same and only same pistols at same time! It remove problem with ammo capacity (36 ammo with more long reload time at 10mm or 12 at revolvers) and  remove low damage problem - more fire rate, more DPS.
---
So does that mean that there's more coming into the game around Christmas? I really hope so, because I've got all the ones you can get currently.
---
45 is the max level for some weapons. It’s the same as a level 50 damage wise.
---
Well, the new bugs that come with every new patch become more and more noticable smh
---
The fact that you don't know that this doesn't spawn as level 50 really puts the cherry on top of your pile of shit
---
Why? Why on Earth would they do that?
---
Dont worry they are all losers
---
Wow, thanks! I have full unyielding and a 10mm 1 star bloodied. I’ll be on the lookout for improvements. Nice tips, thanks again.
---
Hey now its a pile of sh!t not shit. But what is the reason they don't allow guns and melee weapons like that to be lvl 50
---
I’m sorry i’m new to the build - I have no clue! :)
---
Damn auto correct lol.  Fixed
---
Definitely a thing, but sometimes the flip side is true and you get more legendaries than normal. I run into the no legendaries problem way more often. If an enemy that is supposed to be starred isn't, like the "terminated management personel" in Uranium Fever, leave the server, there will be NO legendaries.
---
Love how the pioneer scouts are a faction
---
I changed my psn few months ago. I didn't notice any issues related to this.
---
Have you seen this, it might help: 
---

Appreciate it! Just down want to do it and have over 800 hours wiped lol.
---
Works fine for me.
---
Lol technically they are a joinable faction
---
You mean Survival?
---
I'm laughing so hard at your comments 🤣
---
What is hardcore mode? You mean survival? It was taken down.
---
'Forbidden Knowledge'
---
Not everybody is ready for this.
---
Handmades max out at level 45 too, guess thats a "unused" gun, same with other guns besides the buzz blades, gammas, ripper. Gamma guns are also great for certain things lol, like pvp, i have a arsenal of them. Try a quad ffr gamma, youll never think theyre worthless again. Also with wastlanders coming with HUMAN npcs theyre probably gonna be more useful then they were before. Gammas are also really affective against scorched for some reason lol
---
Aren't you the clever one
---
Ok, i just found it strange that not all wepons dont reach "max level", i had just assumed all wepons go to level 50 as why would they not, I obviously don't play the game too often.

God I wish someone would suggest a location that isn’t one of the few I spent hours hoping at......
---
I wish they would bring it back. I never got into it but always wanted to. Maybe with Wastelanders they will...
---
I just enjoyed the double xp that's all I wanted
---
I believe it's an indirect consequence of being a private server.  Areas spawn things as players wander in and out of areas, in addition to the area reset timeframe.  If nobody is wandering around, you are only getting that randomness from the built-in area resets.
---
In addition to that, you have a cooldown on your character, so if you farm on a public server, and switch to private, all the stuff will be missing.  Not because it's a private server, but because you just took it on another server.
---
If you want to avoid this, just don't return to the same areas immediately.  Wander more randomly.
---
I've started fast-traveling to a few areas I like to play in, running around, then traveling away.  I do this in a few places before I start farming one of them.  By the time I get to other areas, it seems to have helped (or, it just confirmation bias, dunno).  Hovering all the junk also helps, even if you don't want it, it speeds up the history fill on your char.
---
I saw a post once where somebody had all the stats about how long the cooldown works, and spawn rates, etc... try finding that if you want more info.
---
Imposter where's your meele weapon, the legion dosnt use heavily automated weapons!  IMPOSTER!
---
If one more person comments on this and wastes my time with a suggestion that is one of the locations I spent fucking hours hoping at yesterday.. your getting the fastest downvote and block ever.. none of yours are any more helpful than the answer on google so..🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
---
I either run for a bit and try again or restart the game, on PC and it regularly takes up to 5 times before I travel, sometimes the moving to a different spot does nothing so I Alt F4 and start again.
---
Yeah. They added it a while back
---
Yes there is a standard backpack of 30lb carry weight. This is different than the Possum Backpack earned through Tadpole Challenges.
---
She buys all the crap nobody wants and sells it at top cap, sounds like so many online stores 😆
---
And Bethesda probably pays $100,000 a month to host it for you.  $200 is dust, frankly.  But be bitter about it if you want.
---
So, with those sealed off tunnels in the burrows, I'm wondering if perhaps that Brotherhood of Steel expedition maybe sealed themselves off in there somehow? Could be a way to introduce the Brotherhood into Wastelanders.
---
I don't recall ever seeing a heavy barrel plan for the 50 cal, you'll have to scrap them to get it. There are two fixed spawns I can recall -- one is in the abandoned bog town on the back of the sandbag fortified truck trailer and a second in the toxic valley heading east-southeast on the road out of clarksburg shooting club mounted on a jeep.
---
If you're on PC, I could mod the barrel to heavy for you.
---
I would put my money on that it’s part of the “enclave” or a prewar bundle that got kicked down the schedule. 
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if 2020 opens with that
---
The Nuka Quantum X-01 paint was fun to search for until it was spoiled on YouTube
---
Do you mean the bash damage glitch exploit ?
---
If you're looking for water + height + greenery, your best bet is in the Forest. 
---
I will say though that finding an elevated area with a good water source can be hard.
---
I doubt it will reset the plans you know, and as for setting you back to level 1, they haven't discussed whether it will do that but if they do there is little chance they'll make you go back to square one like if you went back to level 1 they'd probably make it to where your character must gain xp the same way a level 50 does and level restrictions wont apply if your legendary as well as perk cards, stuff like that. But we'd have to wait till next year to know for sure how they plan on doing it, the only other information we have is that how high your character level is before you become legendary will effect how high you go, so it won't reset all your levels and give you legendary 1, So grinding levels past 50 is the best way to be prepared for this system and to give you a boost.
---
Unless you were actively abusing those exploits, which required previous knowledge on how to do them, you wouldn't be affected.
---
There might just be some confirmation bias going on and your mind tricking you in that your LMG is doing less damage.
---
Double check your perks; I've more than once forgot to throw stabilized or bloody mess back on and wondered why my own LMG isn't clapping cheeks like it should.
---
Funniest reply yet. Thank you for this
---
I’m late but yeah my instructions would have been go to wendigo cave and south to the cliffs edge towards Yellow Sandys Still
---
This is what I would use in your case. It's best to supplement it with ANY 1* unyielding pieces. Sorry if it's brief.getting ready for work. 
---
I use Unstoppable Monster for my build and when power attacking I can get upwards of 1800 damage a hit to the SBQ's head while buffed on food and Pyschobuff. I single handedly do more damage in most cases than the other 6-7 people that join on Queen.
---
This has never happened to me, what happens? Honestly this is the first I've ever heard of such a bug and I too started with the Beta.
---

---
Wendigo Cave -&gt; go south towards Sandys Still
---
I usually see the heavy barrel mod, at either the raider or the watoga plaza vendor. You probably better if you craft some .50s and scrap them to learn it.
---
Technically speaking, they should have nerfed the stinging magazine as well, but it would probably have been a rather unpopular change. For other weapons, the magazine mods work like this:
---
* Perforating: no extra capacity, 40% armor penetration (number taken from the Gamepedia wiki, it may or may not be correct), which is equivalent to about 20% more damage dealt, and 20% higher AP cost according to Nukacrypt
---
* Stinging: 25% higher capacity, 20% penetration (~8% extra damage), 10% higher AP cost
---
* Drum: 50% higher capacity, no penetration, 10% higher AP cost
---
In the case of the handmade rifle, both the stinging and the drum magazines had unusually high capacity, perhaps because the weapon is reused from Nuka World, and the stats were not properly updated for FO76.
---
In my opinion, the best solution might be to increase the base capacity to 24 or maybe 28 (the latter keeps the stinging magazine the same, but the former is overall more balanced), and make the mods consistent with the other weapons (24-30-36 or 28-35-42). Currently, there is little reason to use anything other than stinging.
---
Come on ppl. Great idea kid! I think we've found our next Over sear. After all, stranger things have happened.

I havent played this dumpster fire for months. Almost a year. I dont keep up and up on news for games I play regularly so why would I do so for a game I played 15 levels of and gave up on sometime in 2018?

That's how they're gonna dole out the other animal/monster mounts? Kinda weird... Guess better than say adding it to the Scouts daily loot pools.

Man, here I was about to sarcastically say "Yeah, the mystery of why Bethesda stopped giving a fuck." 
---
But then I was treated to one of my fave things - a sick in-universe mystery leading to tons of potential conspiracy theories. Awesome work!
---
My guess is that once Wastelanders comes out, we'll get another lead. My theory is that we'll find some BoS survivors holed up somewhere underground with the Whitesprings purified water resevoir. Man that would be sick.
---
It got taken down for fallout 1st servers. Lol.
---
Ok, thank you.
---
Yes, character cool down carries over from private to public as well as any items you picked up
---
I didn’t get any and subscribed first day. Looks like people on servers that had the problem all got them.
---
Well here is the situation me and many many gamers come into as a problem. Looking for specific pieces of Armour or Weapons is extremely hard to do when constantly needing to server hop and waste time. My only barrier I am removing from players is the waste less time just shopping. Of course vendor hopping can be cool and exciting when you find things like unknown plans and junk. If you are in need of a Mutants Combat Armour  Left Leg Level 50 \*\*\* +1 Str, 10+ resistance if mutated, ammo weighs 20% less how better than to look here? I'm only solving a problem that I know players face which is end game content or wastefulness searching on vendors who specifically vendor hop in "hope" for that item. :)
---
Mongrel dogs and wolves actually wallow around in the dirt if you're able to watch them in their natural habitat without going into caution. It's one of the cutest things I've seen in the game so far.
---
Which is awesome right!? My website is for people who really want to gain exposure and be able to have a platform instead of using multiple reddits or marketplaces. I created a Classified Ads website specifically for players and not some real money online store. :)
---
Can't you spend a couple of hours scavenging and scrapping with the scrapping perk card, I'm always dumping junk, I have no use for it.
---
Take this as a quest to refill the box from the wastes, seems just boring to be given all this stuff involving no game play, this is a game after all. And you are also on a FO1st server so no other dirty unwashed to clear it out first.
---
Disclaimer: I have not purchased FO1st.
---
Alright can you happen to post or send me an image of what you see? I'm only trying to make this experience worth your while :)
---
Or don't! 
---
I like knowing where to go.
---
One thing I’ve always wanted from Fallout is a hidden Westworld / Chiliad Mystery-esque hunt. 
---
Was hoping the interloper would have been that but seems not. This definitely seems interesting though - I just did the Burrows to and found it . . . shallow a bit? It felt all to easy to finish the quest despite the terminal that I read and you mentioned above. 
---
Here we go!
---
Well in that case I don't want them to fix it either
---
I think the excavator should have the bugged carry weight as the standard carry weight, and normal power armor have the current standard excavator carry weight

That's only happened to me once a private server. The alpha sheepsquatch at the end of Project Paradise was only a boss and not a 3 star enemy. The mole miner supervisors in Uranium Fever were only bosses and there were no legendary Gutsys in AWOL Armaments. That's only happened to me once though and I haven't noticed it since then.

So yeah, I feel like you keep ignoring the things I say and just keep on going with your stubbornness.
---
I purchased 1st on the day of release. Due to the posts about people losing junk, I refrained from using it due to the "visual bug" and losing material anyway. I haven't recieved the supplemented junk packs as others did. I'm ok with that. Junking is a part of my daily routine, so I'm not hurting for anything. 
---
It's ok for me personally not to recieve this, but I'm glad others did that lost tons of items.
---
Why a generic plan? Give it a quest, dosnt need to be a big one either but something that requires you to work for! And the best thing? Beth can still sell skins for it, so they make their money!
---
Maybe give it a debuff on your character, like it replaces your backpack, or make it so you need a power armor where it attaches to... so many possibilities!
---
Their issue is the live service/monetizing mods concept. It's been terrible PR in general, and is responsible for so much of the trouble with 76. 
---
They just need to abandon it and go back to traditional gameplay experiences. Make your money on sales and expansions. No more.
---
I also have a vampire 50
---
There is a 50 cal heavy barrel mod (I have one), but IIRC, the system does not allow me to attach the Mod t the 50 cal. mod.  Doesn’t even show up in the list.
---
Hopefully not. I don’t see why they should?

Do you have an onboard or second GPU installed?

A few people have noticed the game not running on the correct GPU, regardless of overrides, happy to outline steps to check if you do

Just had the same issue a couple of days ago. I'm almost certain they didn't count towards camp budget before. Deleted a purifier and was able to stock the fermenter. So it was either accidentally or purposefully added to the game. Either way, stupid. 😖

There's a waterfall somewhere in the Mire that looks like a pretty dope place to build. I've seen someone build a tree house on the tree that sticks out from the side of the cliff there. I'll have to look for the link to that post.

I’ve taken two purifiers out and it still saying my CAMP is full when it shouldn’t be.
---
Man, this would be awesome! Would be nice if DLCs for CAMP was a thing. Like if with Wastelanders we also got Roof Dwellers or something that allowed us to build on roofs within reasonable parameters. (Height limit, smaller build limit, less options to pick from, different things like blue tarp lean-to from FO4)

What does radiation damage affect aside from other players?  Animals?
---
I had mine in my vendor for 5K for a week and reduced to 2.5k for a week with no luck.  Going to scrip mine as most opinions on here seem to think that's all its good for.  Sounds like you got lucky.
---
Yeah, once the quest is completed, you should be able to drop your extras. It bothered the hekk out of me as well, but i noticed i could drop them about a month ago.
---
Yea a very insensetive move
---
I think the last patch messed with camp budget as well. I had to rebuild my entire camp because it was saying I was over budget. I couldn't even replace a light I had deleted with the exact same type of light. Unfortunately, you might have to do the same. Unless they acknowledge they messed something up and make a hot fix...

That was something i liked about DarkSouls 3. If an enemy was carrying a weapon you wanted, you kill it till you get it. Wish FO76 had better loot tables like that, and not just have it pop up on your screen after a kill.
---
When you select a location to travel to, instead of going there the map closes and you have not travelled anywhere, you then open the map again and select the location again... but you don’t travel... so open the map a third time... and again you don’t go anywhere... usually for me after the 3rd attempt, fast travel works. 
---
This is not when you’re in caution or danger, and no countdown fast travel timer appears, it’s just a very frustrating bethesda feature. 
---
In short, fast travel often takes 3 or 4 attempts before it works.
---
.50 SMG was real common.
---
When your game is dying, get someone to create the Chilliad Mystery.
---
My first thought was holy crap my new character is gone but restarting the game solved it. So now when I switch between the two I have to restart at least half the time. Annoying but at least it’s not a bug causing a crash or something. Hopefully it’s an easy/quick fix for Beth.
---
Here’s your sign
---
You probably have to learn the plan first, otherwise it becomes a huge pay-to-win 😂
---
I agree with you.It also does not help in the way the game was designed.They took a single player experience and converted it to a multiplayer one.Not only did this cause some of the technical issues but it also caused the game to branch out in genres.The pvp,battle royale crowd can differ significantly from the single player rpg crowd.IE: Half the player base just running around wanting to kill enemies or each other and the other half wanting intricate storytelling and questing.
---
There's also another one by the vertibird just south of Hemlock Holes. On another truck if I remember correctly
---
I also try the running a bit.. works occasionally but not always for me.
---
Some working printers as well! "GIMME DA NOTES!"
---
Thanks didnt know that. Guess I've never tried to launch from the same silo twice back to back before
---
The plan for plasma grenades
---
A new engine wouldnt hurt. Lol.
---
I believe he (The Interloper) will be the first incarnation Ug-Qualtoth.
---
Welcome tot he wasteland!
---
Been playing since January - broke 700 hours last night.  Level 154.
---
Levels start to come faster after you pass 40, but getting to 40 seems like it takes forever.  Effectively, once you are able to survive in higher level areas - the critters there carry more XP.  Do the places with lots of supermutants - grafton steel, the penetentiary, WV lumber.  Crafting stuff gives you XP. 
---
 Do events.  Complete the quests in the forest.
---
At 20, you should be Following the overseers questline, and are ready for the toxic valley.  You should have at least started the mysteries quest, recruitment blues, and firebreathers.  
---
Make sure you are well fed, well hydrated, well rested, and well tuned (eat, drink, sleep, and play instruments)   (All provide extra XP). THere are some aid items that provide additiona XP for a limited time (an hour, IIRC)
---
Add a way to favorite camps that you want to visit again and in the social menu show which players are on the world and allow FT to their camps. I like to hit a few vendors before I log off most times and being able to quickly see there’s a vendor I’ve bought from before would be great.
---
Oh no 😭
---
This was a tree house build that I’ll never be able to rebuild if I tried
---
Ug-Qualtoth. For possible future content. Maybe, Wastelanders will have some creepy NPC's take up Jeff and the others work. Maybe he'll become a new boss fight. Has anyone nuked then Lucky Hole Mine and then went to visit The Interloper?
---
There is still some kind of military looking storage device that is locked over near harpers.The one that is sitting near the shoreline near the overhead trestles.
---
Charge hit my account today. Havnt yet been able to check the atoms though.
---
15 levels lmao, don't come back.
---
Some mods you can only get with a plan you should look it up
---
I literally just set my C.A.M.P up last night with the same lion statue/fountain in the middle..saw this almost made me cry..”I...I..Made it to the front page without knowing :’)”....
---
NOPE!
---
Yeah I’m on Xbox, if I go back to the main menu, turn off my Xbox, or go to another app, and then come back after fallout has timed out and relogin, then I see this issue.
---
I have once on my private server. Bloodied strangler heart PA build using a bffr gatling plasma. Took like 8 minutes and around 15 full cores.
---
Yes.
---
Just looking at what they have is enough for me. Sure 85% is trash but there's always that one vendor on a server with something that makes up for all the bullshit. Found a Chameleon/Sent forest Scout chest for 1.5k turned around a day later and got 11k for it.
---
In RDR2 they do if you Hunt them. Brilliant.
---
There is a bug that can happen to lose keys.At Least I think so.I have had to go back and get several keys in the game.Had them one day then a few days later they were gone.
---
I think someone accidentally placed a radio underneath the world and left it there.
---

Let me look into it for a little while, does any parts of the website load correctly for you? I know i have functionality for parts of the website under IOS but I do not have an iphone personally to test with.
---
Thanks for this, my camp budget mysteriously disappeared because of things I left in the fermentor and it was driving me insane not knowing where it went. Also found out magazines in the racks count against budget as well.
---
I am on PS4, I have not had this issue.

That might have been it. Try now
---
It just happened to me 10 minutes ago just gave up and started walking to the burrows from the other side of the map.
---
Yeah sorry I didnt grind 60+ levels in a game I didnt find fun just to appease the lofty standards of some uppity fuckwit on Reddit.
---
**/s**
---
Was that always the case?  I swear months ago, I was able to attach the Excavator arms to my T-60 and get the mining bonus.
---
Yes works great I sometimes use a primed Zealots Handmade for SQB battles when I don't want to play low health, works great.
---
Sorry same thibg
---
Mine stopped after the last patch. Almost as frustrating as the PA bug.
---
I’ve been whining about this for ages. Essentially it takes you several tries to FT, the game simply ignores your request and pretend nothing has happened. No enemy nearby or other excuses, just closes the map for you so you have to repeat it over and over until it finally decides to take you to that location.
---
Is it or is it not an issue you are experiencing?
---
The only bug annoying me to be honest
---
Or selling them in the atom shop. I was pretty sure that’s what would happen. Glad I was wrong.
---
Sorry haven’t gone further than the home page
---
It's been a bug for a while now...maybe since patch 14. Damndest thing.
---
Did it look like the vault in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q45azpFl118)? Although the vaults have been reworked sometime around the summer to use instancing, and they now appear empty and clean when entered by using glitches.
---
Found it after plowing through some other threads.  Apparently if you have a Junkie's weapon equipped the junkie's damage boost displays on the other weapons as well
---
Coming soon, legendary fast travel boots. Only 1200 atoms. Guaranteed to get you where you are going lickety split. 🤣🤣🤣
---
It actually kills normal ghouls pretty well, but does heal the glowing ones a lot.
---
Keep going. It looks like a scrap mod. I'm stuck on Enameled Robot Arms. It's the last Armor Mod I need
---
They could do so much with the radio. But they don’t. Maybe they’ll sell us radio stations in the atom shop. Lmao better not give them any ideas.
---
Oh, that’s interesting, thanks :)
---
Wholesome fallout 1st member
---
Do the daily scout mission at Dilly Sods for insect mounts.
---
But seriously usually if o back out of the fast travel screen and try again it works, or it I press the accept button slowly and deliberately. Also please fix the trade glitch.
---
Datamining is kind of a general term like hacking. So the question of what tool do we use is similar to asking hackers what tool they use to hack. In both cases the answer varies greatly depending on who you ask and what you intend to accomplish. For FO76 datamining, Xedit is probably the most used for pulling form IDs, location data, and keywords. Other things are more manual and require the use of memory scanning tools like cheat engine, and custom written scripts to extract data from a live game. A lot of things like meshes and images are compressed in the BA2 archives and they need to be extracted with tools like B.A.E.. viewing these meshes and models require other tools not updated publically for FO76 but have been modded by a few people for personal usage. Then there is all the action script and swf files that you can decompile and read through the action script for a lot of things in the UI. For general functionality with how things work, decompilation of the exe is needed and then you basically have to read through the decompiled files. You can also attach debuggers to get a lot more information about the game mechanics.
---
A word of warning, Beth cannot know your intention when you do these things, and in my experience, they do not care. They have anti cheat built in and certain thing will flag you as cheating even though you are not. Dataminers that go beyond Xedit frequently have their accounts permabanned, including myself. And support  will likely ignore all of your requests for an appeal, as they have done time and time again for many of us. So do not datamine the game on an account you are not willing to throw away. Also, the chances of getting a false flag are much higher when you don't know what you are doing (learning).
---
Some people will buy the Ghoul Slayer's simply for a collection. If you get one it's a good idea to try and sell or trade it before you scrip it.
---
I'm sorry to hear that.
---
Thanks for this, it was actually a bug they introduced around Patch 8.0, fixed in Patch 11.0 and seem to have reintroduced in Patch 15.0.  
---
Using this post as a citation, hope you don't mind!   
---
A new engine that takes years to develop? Nobody builds an engine from scratch. That’s just silly. Unreal engine is even older and still used today. You modify and expand upon the engine, like they’ve done here. You don’t create a new one, that’s unproductive and doesn’t solve anything.
---
Dumpster fire yes...But I always find myself coming back to this game because in the end it’s finds like these that make it much deeper and interesting than any other.  I think I’m going exploring right now!
---
Sorry to hear what? 😕
---
Looks like OP is being a bit of an ass, he asks for help but doesn't want to help others, nice .. thanks
---
Ditto
---
Nobody is telling them to create a new one. Maybe rent one that works. That would suffice. And its not like anyone is expectong a new fallout in the next 5 or so years anyway. Theu have the time..... And budget.
---
I think the evidence is clear that the game was a disappointment for many and has continued to turn more people off over time. The critic and user scores were both terrible a huge drop from fallout 4.  
---
The YouTube response reflected this. Yes there are people looking for drama clicks but many youtubers that made fallout 4 content simply chose not do do fallout 76 content, there was no demand for it, no market for it. 
---
This sub has also tuned against the game over the past few months. The negativity was always there but there was more positivity to counter balance it. That ratio has shifted over the past few months indicating a growing frustration with the game. 
---
The biggest indicator is sales 76 is selling at 1/10th the rate as 4 did that’s a huge drop off and likely a big financial loss. That is only compounded by the fact that the game was discounted very quickly. That means shops sold fewer copies than they thought they would and needed to clear inventory. That means not only did it sell poorly but it sold worse than expected. 
---
The fact that the game is still up and running is not too big of a deal. Tony hawk 5 was an epic disaster and it stayed live for 2 years. 
---
So I know people have enjoyed it and played a lot but I feel that is a small minority of Fallout fans and that the number of Fallout fans angry at the game is indeed huge.  10X more at the least.
---
:)
---
The engine isn’t the problem
---
I tested this yesterday, if you’re on pacifist, the Radium doesn’t do anything, whether it’s explosive or not. The gamma gun however does show a +6 rad every time I’m hit, however the meter actually stays still and doesn’t move, so you’re totally fine, it’s just a visual glitch that shows the rad number without actually counting it toward your rad meter 👌
---
I would expect mine either today or Monday at the latest.
---
Unless something went wrong.  And let's be honest.  We all know that's a distinct possibility.
---
The workshops is something I didn’t think about being a FO1st perk. Having your own server to just go get all the workshops in and get the plans from taking/defending them.
---
It's a huge plus, at least to me.
---
I log on to Adventure, vendor hop, then retreat to my private server to actually play. Workshops are never contested, lag is down, silo runs are fun. Cleaning up whitesprings after a nuke - better bring a big bag. Doing events like Uranium Fever is simple because I'm the only one there.
---
The only reason I need adventure is player vendors and SBQ. The rest of the time I'm happy to be alone.
---
I disagree. I think theyve hit the limits of what this engine can do. I feel like continuing to use this engine is continuing to give us fallout 4 reskinned.
---
Different for everyone
---
Keep scrapping! I myself just got it the other day, so you can earn it via scrapping. Just make sure you've made a sacrifice to RNGesus first.
---
And yeah, you can earn another slot's mods from a part. It's why I tend to only craft low-level arms when I want to do a mod learning spree on armor.
---
Go back to Modern Warfare.
---
It was one of my first thoughts, mainly for fusion core production. One of my characters is a heavy guns/power armor build and grabbing all the power plants is a pretty big deal.
---
^ what he said
---
Fr but I actually like being here. Im laughing either way!
---
You realize the can make changes to the engine without getting a completely new one right?
---
Yeah, I was never really able to keep a workshop longer than five minutes on a public server so it always seemed like a waste of caps
---
It's supposed to be different for everyone.
---
In practice?  Sometimes there is amusing commonality between them, and we don't fully understand how the game actually generates them.
---
I do. That doesnt negate anything ive said.
---
Where is this terminal?
---
&gt;Maybe rent one that works.
---
"And spend all the progamming hours grafting the functionality that the old engine had into it.  That's easy, right?  What do you mean we don't have time for new features?"
---
Or you could just start over. Which is severely needed at this point.
---
You know they will fix this, by reducing the stinging mag that is. This has always been their way of ‘fixing’ things.
---
The Fallout series has ALWAYS been about "the story" - putting together the puzzle pieces of what happened, the root causes that explain why, and how that influenced the survivors and factions that evolved. 
---
The absurdity is embodied by the vocal subset of players that think activities like building, PVP, or farming God-gear is the "end game" . . .
---
I disagree completely. You clearly haven’t played many games (I’m looking at you big rigs, Superman 64 or sonic 06)
---
8 times last night. Finally took two, literally two steps forward and it worked. Friggin annoying as hell.
---
Eh - it's hard to assign intent from afar - prob got caught up in life and hasn't seen this - as I did yesterday and forgot to reply to them initially.
---
Anyways stay safe out there.
---
Ive played lots of games. It obvilusly didnt take obsidian too long to adapt fallout style play to the unreal engine.
---
add me on psn: Owl_No 
---
i claim workshops all the time
---
It depends.
---
I think their developers are genuine.
---
However, I see no reason for optimism in the equity company that holds their purse and is, allegedly, trying to recklessly prime the company for an IPO that would ultimately devastate the Bethesda we knew.
---
I take them, but I don’t defend or care about them after I take them, used to higher levels just flying in, one shotting me and taking off, I don’t touch them on higher level characters, just my low levels
---
huge pain, Bethesda is aware, hopefully they will have a fix soon
---
There is literally a dude in there talking about getting the bundle 4 times one on each character. It is coming in waves, give it time. There are still people who put tickets in and did lose stuff not gotten it yet, so it obviously isn't done yet.
---
this a good story tho
---
That's the way to do it :p
---
When I fast travel to my CAMP, 10% of the time I end up in some weird half-rendered cliff cave and fast travelling again fixes it.  
---
It's very weird.
---
you could craft and scrap 200 at once and get nothing, then you’ll randomly get a drop of the limb and bam u suddenly get the mod lol
---
Ave true to Kimball
---
Reintroducing previously fixed bugs isn't an engine issue, it's a competency one. They also opt for the quickest, cheapest &amp; easiest option irrespective of whether or not it adequately (key word here) deals with the issue. 
---
You think a company with this kind of fundamental issue could adequately handle an engine migration?
---
Yes it's about the stories, but it doesn't mean you can ignore the playing, it's a game.
---
No matter how good the story is, if the playing aspect is shit, it's shit.
---
&gt;How are they going to handle 8k 120fps when Scarlett and PS5 drops???
---
I've got a bridge to sell you if you really think any current or within 2 years upcoming generation technology, regardless of platform, can handle such an extreme resolution and framerate.
---
That said, porting a game engine is a terrible idea and will result in even more bugs and glitches as multiple lines of code will end up breaking multiple other lines of code and the issue just compounds that way. They amount of time spent on development for rebuilding a game, from the ground up, to a new engine is far less than that of porting, troubleshooting, and likely brute forcing an existing game to work on a new engine.
---
The people working for bethesda are paid because they can use that engine.
---
They'd probably have to can huge swathes of ppl to shift engines. 
---
And their games make money long term so i doubt the shift/risk is worth it. Their stock would plummet too as investors jump ship.
---
Did you need to repair it? I played a little with my BFFR yesterday, it breaks really fast even when i had 5 Gunsmith.
---
Thought I was the only one I doubt they would fix it Fallout 1st first
---
2 things i could recommend for this outfit. 
---
1: metal helmet would be better than sheepsquatch imho for the OG outfit
---
2: Machete instead of gatling gun. 
---
Its super cool that the outfit works so well with F76 assets, now for NCR armor
---
If it still works the way it did when I datamined the files, they didn't actually change the magazine: They changed the values the magazine references, and this affects all magazines of that type, across all weapons that have it.
---
Weapon mods don't work the way they did in Fallout 4.
---
I don't know much about gaming technology, so please bare with me, but can Unreal Engine support the type of world that BSG is known for creating?  I played Outer Worlds, and while i thought it was a good game, the world was incredibly boring, static, and bland to me... despite the good execution and creative artwork and design.  I'd rather put up with a buggy Bethesda world, than be stuck in a more polished world like the one that Obsidian built in the Outer Worlds, just my opinion.
---
Yes. Since 1st fusion cores are no big deal. I can use my laser gats and dump power user for something else.
---
You're the real MVP. Love when people figure out ways to create uncommon camp decor, keep them coming.
---
No tried and failed
---
'You cannot drop keys'
---
Strange that you could drop them. I'm on PC.
---
No it doesn't really constitute working "with" because that implies that they were in some kind of mutual awareness and collaboration. Having a direct line to a CM isn't "working with", you're just forwarding them information directly. Was he asked to do this? Did they sanction it? There is a difference there. It makes about as much sense as saying you broke into a bank because you know a cop. In that vein exploiting the game for "the greater good" was vigilante justice.
---
200 is dust to a major corporation?! No way????!!!! 
---
Listen fuckin dick, go buy a pressure cooker that only cooks the food half way and tell me how it tastes.
---
Maybe a new engine. And i dont mean one from scrap. Kind of like what unreal has done. We are on unreal engine 4 now. Bethesda needs to take some steps and at least give us creation 2. They cannot release the next fallout on the same engine theyve been using since 3. Everything just feels like fallout 4 dlc now. And thats not a compliment.
---
&gt;'You cannot drop keys'
---
I just get this with all of them, weird, I've rebooted the game numerous time and no change. Bummer 😒
---
Yeah there is a 100% camp budget bug that you can literally scrap everything and it will still say 100% and you can't put stuff back afterwards.. some say moving your camp and then scrapping the blue prints fixes it and some have done that and still say they are at 100% and can't build anything...there was a bug a few months back that if you had crops that were destroyed and you scrap them so you can get the plants back to repair them that you permanently gain budget so if you had a 100% camp scrap plants to repair it would add budget and you would have one less plant you can put down.. I had a 10 guard in my garden for cranberry relish and every time I scraped one to repair I couldn't place it back I have video evidence that I showed to the bug dev team of me scrapping and trying to place them back until I had no more and some people said it was doing that same bug with wires/power connectors so I think this 100% camp budget bug might be a screw up on thier side trying to fix that bug and led to this new one and this 100% bug also introduced the utility container bug with the fermenter and the fridge and anything other container that uses stash space like displays and such...I'm really into camp building myself I have a permanent camp that's completely symmetrical that took about 30 hours to build... Just the electrical/power conduits took about 10+ hours to set up and line up just right... I know I lost a lot of budget from my garden and probably lost some from the wire bug as well and I hope.. One day... I'll get my budget back but I doubt it will ever happen but still have hope... I feel really bad about the people that scrapped their camp completely to try and fix the problem and all they can put down is the C.A.M.P device...I would probably quit the game for a while if it happened to me...o and I don't know if this bug is still around but if you place a item down and then move it to adjust it's placement it would add some phantom budget that would add on to the next item you placed in your camp so if you placed a item and wasn't happy with the placement you would have to scrap and place it down and get it right on the first try because if you moved to get placement right you screwed yourself out of budget permanently... Hence why my camp took 30+ hours...I have fate in Bethesda... Not sure how long it will take but hopefully one day all the camp bugs will get fixed
---
Your perspective isn't supported by evidence. 
---
Evidence would indicate that it'll only get worse or remain the same if there is no fundamental change in management.
---
Anti-consumer monetisation is their norm. There will be issues of competency &amp; quality. Any solution will be dealt with not in the best or most effective way but the quickest &amp; cheapest way with little thought towards long term consequences. That's what the evidence supports.
---
Yeah, thats weird. It lets me drop notes and non mission holos. It also lets me drop keys. It just says "this item cannot be dropped it will be destroyed" or some bs like that. 
---
It doesnt let you put keys in stash right? I never tried.
---
Some of the amount people got is hard to acquire materials, I.e. flux, vault steel
---
Is this mod? I've never seen this before
---
&gt;It doesnt let you put keys in stash right? I never tried.
---
That's a point I'll go try that, cheers :)
---
I hear ya brother.  I got to the actual launch control room just past that and the game crashed.  So pissed.
---
OH I didn't realise, sorry for being a dummy, that must really suck then as those are really hard to get.
---
Documented and reported multiple times to Bethesda, someone clearly didn't test this and compare the original OMOD's to the Real life equivalents, or even to verify the Drum OMOD was still an "upgrade"

It’s a mod for sure
---
Yeah, i dont THINK you can. Ive never tried. But for your ocd, if you can, maybe put one in the box and keep one on you.
---
Not just goo piles, ash piles from laser weapons too. And not just PS4, Xbox too, happens to me whenever I tesla or laser rifle enemies, piles are unlootable.
---
So.... will it include the deathclaw, scorchbeast and SBQ??
---
Add me.  GenomeNinja I would like to harvest the acid top left.  I'll be nuking white Springs too if that's cool.

It's a mod.

Wow I thought ash piles were fixed patches ago 🤮
---
Thing is, it's not playing any of the usual music. It's that Military march, on repeat.

Having the same problem my friend and have plenty scrap box storage it should count towards that NOT your camp budget.
---
The legion never had to face the BOS, but now...
---
Same, never happened to me, never even heard of it.
---
It depend on what raid you are doing. For the 50 keycard Raid, you should wear PA. There are more rads there than in a nuke zone. The other ones you could wear regular armor.
---
Are you talking about the starfield rumor from a few months ago? That was proven to be false right around the time it came out, it was some dude shit posting trying to get internet points
---
Edit: looked it up there’s a new rumor with articles written yesterday nevermind
---
Sure thing!
---
Two nuka cola paints and 7 ever so slightly altered gray skins of the same style.
---
Did you have and then cancel FO1st? A few people who decided to drop the subscription were saying that the weight overflow from scrapbox counts towards budget and stash preventing you from proceeding until you are back within weight limit or have access to scrapbox again.
---
Meh, I consider it minor.
---
Well said!\~
---
Nope! Never got 1st!
---
 source?
---
Reddit scammer? You know there are subreddits that are highly moderated... I've never been scammed from where I shop
---
Bethesda refuses to release this data.
---
Just happened to me today when I tried to do the daily. Kinda sucks.
---
You got scammed? What did they do!? You can’t leave us hanging like that. And Then you found two new people in game and got them a month if fo 1st? What did they think? Imo the scrap box alone is a complete game changer.
---
if you’re using the .50 cal then Rifleman perks don’t affect it. that is a big/heavy gun.
---
Well. I lost about 7k steel and I usually give excess junk to new players I know its steel but I didn't get compensated. Could really use those screws.
---
Explosive .50 works on pretty much everything.
---
Think its been reintroduced from another patch, Ive had to stop using energy weapons through Whitesprings, lose out on a ton of stuff
---
I’m guessing he was running a bloodied sneak build. I run a bloodied stealth commando with a handmade and silo runs are a breeze. Scorchbeasts? Easy. Do I go through 5.56 like it’s free? Yep. There’s all kinds of threads for this build. Check out Nukes and Dragons for a stealth build. Good luck!
---
The magazines counting against budget has been a known thing since they came out with magazine racks, however the fermenter is new. Now it makes me wonder also about the candy in the candy bowl and drinks in the drink bowl. In fact... now that I think about it... I do believe the candy counts against budget too...
---
See I get mixed reviews about this. Every time I ask people say that hunters effects SBs and SBQ. I would think zealots would be the perk but people always tell me I’m wrong!
---
Look for an instigating lever. 1 shots 85pct of the mobs in this game
---
To me the easiest solution is to apply the color rarity inventory sorting that NW has to the main adventure mode and let the color of the item number show the color of the highest valued item for sale in that category. Even if it's one rare it is worth the visit.
---
So let me get this straight - you visit the subreddit of a game you claim to hate every few weeks and you're calling someone else a fuckwit?
---
I think PC is the smallest player base.
---
The effort and resources required to make a different engine do the things they need would be extensive.
---
And in the end, they'd end up with an engine that does *exactly* what their current one does: Modifying and upgrading their existing engine is a far simpler and cheaper way of achieving *exactly* the same result.
---
Engines aren't physical objects: They can be modified and upgraded at will, with no restrictions apart from time and effort: If you need the engine to do something and it doesn't support it, you *make* it support it.
---
To put this into perspective, people say that Oblivion is running on Gambryo: Gamebryo doesn't(or didn't, at the time) support open worlds, rpg systems, or 3d environments. 95% of the engine Oblivion runs on was written in-house by Bethesda themselves, using Gamebryo as a code base.
---
For a rifleman build I’d look for a Lever Action for sniping/long range, and a Handmade, Combat Rifle or Fixer for mid/short range. Instigating is definitely the best legendary prefix for the Lever unless you want to go bloodied. Instigating works well for the other weapons, but you could also look for Anti Armor, Vampires, Furious, Quad, or other prefixes that work for your play style.
---
It's far more likely that you don't have anywhere near the internet bandwidth to even consider this relevant.
---
Add me I'm in. GenomeNinja. I only know the venison side of the quest but I can do damage control minigun heavy maxed.
---
Yea from now on that’s what I’m doing!!!
---
[deleted]
---
Kinda depends, what was the other guys health looking like? Because if he was bloodied with a semi then his build would make those robots look like swiss cheese. 
---
I generally run with a b fss rw super sledge and one shot 90% of the enemies. And the only reason its not 100% is because the his toes put out too much damage so run at 50% health.
---
I very much like this idea, this game really needs some sort of free update, I think these could compliment the game very nicely!
---
Where are you hitting the robots? The middle of the torso is more effective than a headshot.
---
You may be remembering that but you are remembering wrong unless it was somehow a unique glitch you were briefly experiencing somehow. 
---
The perks only trigger to apply when full set is present.
---
It's not the same engine.
---
Calling it that is no different than calling all the different Unreal engines "the same engine".
---
Probably been someone with a bloodied build. Way OP and therefore the current meta.
---
For bots and bosses make sure you have Tank Killer equipped. Also consider shooting out the limbs of bots - legs and arms for protectrons, eyes for gutsy, legs assaultron.  
---
Lever rifle and handmade and if you're lucky fixer are endgame for ballistic rifleman. Gauss works too, but the ammo is weighty.  
---
Try finding rifles with instigating and anti-armor or switch to a bloodied build to maximize damage output in the endgame.  
---
Lever has better alpha vs. the handmade. Handmade has higher dps overall. Fixer has a little more damage than handmade.

---
Vault steel is the hard to get one, flux is easy.  The amounts they gave were excessive but its not hard to get.
---
Nope cannot place them in my Stash Box, I'll just have to live with I guess, I know Bethesda won't do anything about this as I could lead to people dropping needed keys, a lesson learned.
---
I suppose in time all this free stuff will get used up and everyone will move on.
---
I was wondering this as well, I’m a year member and haven’t seen a new influx of atoms yet.
---
You can use it if one under the budget. Then put back whatever you scrapped. This is a recent thing too, I see aten posted it was a thing before.
---
Thank you, that's a very helpful explanation!
---
I think it should be an award after killing so many of a certain creature. Like how atoms are awarded
---
The differences in the creatipm engine and the game(whatever the ending is) engine are so minute they might as well not exist.
---
That’s just terrible, the never ending bugs really ruined this game.
---
I’d like to know the lore on why bethesda put it in fo76 when it’s in real time and quite useless. But know seriously I don’t know the answer to that question, either one of them.
---
Hey now, that's not in the spirit of our state. I'm not happy with how they've handled this game, but from what I've heard they're still woefully understaffed and could very well just be getting shat on by their parent company.
---
Bloodied builds don’t want to lose their rad damage as they’re stronger the lower their health
---
Outerworlds is pretty buggy also. And I wouldn’t say it’s fallout playstyle. Combat is totally different. Outerworlds is enjoyable but honestly lacks a lot of depth. Not the fault of the engine, just game design.
---
Set it up against a wall. Bloodied builds will thank you
---
It is supposed to swap back and forth between two most recent weapons, yes. It does bug out sometimes
---
It also cures mutations for those not running starched genes
---
You can enable it for non steam games and I did. I forgot that I had to add it manually so yeah for other people it's unlikely to be a problem unless they did that too.
---
Not everybody here regularly plays (or regularly keeps up with the atom shop, for that matter)
---
Added you x
---
Drinks in the punchbowl count against it as well.
---
I think you and i have two very different ideas about what "depth" is. I felt the only depth it was lacking was in the ending. I felt like it needed about 15 more mins of dialogue or maybe 2 more missions of content to get from last mission to end movie. Agree though. Not the fault of the engine. I think the ending got fucky due to time. But thats speculation. 
---
And i would say its def fallout play style. Its a looter shooter. This has been done before and is not exclusive to fallout. And honestly, if im being picky, the lock picking and hacking was WAY better.
---
Edit: what im saying is the base is there and easy enough to swap mechanics. You arent going to lose fallout if it moves to a new engine. And at this point, betheada has the time and money and ruined reputation, what could making a change hurt?
---
I'm making a similar thing. I have a Todd-synth for my new Arena. He spews all the 76-quotes. Planning on having some option for spawning him at all spawnpoints... Edit: Up to 5 at all 6 points. :D
---
No, if you’re going to ask then no. Why would you ask the biased community?
---
One sec
---
No
---
Where’s my anti-material rifle with exploding rounds when I need it??
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e0gt72/christmas_event_rewards/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Also curious about the ncr armour. Does it disappear when you membership is up?
---
I bought the one month just to see what the deal was
---
That’s awesome!
---
I disagree, handmade really mass duped, but i didn't saw other combat rifle with same effects
---
Ya, it only takes away a little piece of sometimes.
---
Well I don't know what's the spirit of you guys but guns is definitely a thing there.
---
Austin has less than 100 staff but that isn't an excuse for shit drum mags.
---
He may have been, was running crouched most of the time. I'm going to have to try some of these builds, is bloodied viable for solo? I need to get a decent handmade for sure then.
---
I feel ya 😖 What I ended up doing was taking a picture of a specific part of a foundation that I could easily replicate. After that, everything fit as it did before.
---
When you open the map to fast travel, first recenter it (pressing spacebar on PC). This appears to reinitialize something and seems to fix whatever is causing the bug. I have been testing this workaround for a while now and it has worked 100% of the time so far. If this solves it, a permanent fix should be relatively simple for Bethesda to implement.
---
....? you're not talking about the radio on the northeast perimeter, are you?
---
Ty, im too...😩
---
Then how does my character have the EXACT same one? I know for a fact it was one of the items duped. Don't believe me, I don't care. I was pointing that out to let you know you can find another if you look.
---
No.
---
on my rifleman I have .50 hunting rifle for true long range sniping.. for more general mid to close range I also carry a lever and a handmade..
---
Okay. Did some digging. 2016 was all i could find. Even still. It was FREE.
---
ok legion boomers
---
Again... no. It is $60, unless you have gamepass.
---
By the Nuka Cola plant I built a pier with 4 independent shops along it, the pier is just on top of the water. There is a row boat there that you can place your camp on in thr middle of the water so you can make a nice long water build. And, I built the pier so it lines up with the boat so it looks like its docked
---
Yea. Unless you have gamepass.... Soooo free. Lol. I had gamepass before it dropped, so it cost me zero extra dollars to play. What would you call that?
---
Be careful, people don't like it when you pick on the quality of their internet connection. 
---
I've tried to explain to people that the collective latency has a lot to do with server stability and performance, but most people don't want to admit that the issue lies on their end.
---
And yet, he was very dear to me. I was lucky that he was gone, and not another more expensive gun
---
So you think gears 5 is also released for “free”. You don’t own the game. You just have access to play it at the moment.
---
Do you have Fallout 1st? Might be some weirdness with private servers... also, anything unusual about the character? Strange characters (#@%! type stuff) in the character name or any items you've renamed? Has it always been broken or did it just start suddenly? Do you exit the game by quitting through the UI or just closing the client? Are any crops that you own at your camp regrowing? Does the fermenter work?
---
Yeah he dropped it. It's so easy to do, the default keys for drop and swap cards are right next to each other.
---
I know I would be upset to lose my handmade, or combat rifle with the same effects. I get that, and I hope you find another one.
---
Well gears 5 sucked, so we can leave it out of the conversation. Lol. 
---
And for the record, i would say yes, for right now, its free.
---
I'm aware. Lol. I'm used to taking the downvote and just speaking reality even when people don't want to hear it. Haha.
---
If people had any clue they'd realize about half the issues they're complaining about with glitches and crashes is due to clientside failures.
---
My favorite way to get some decent chunks of XP is to just take some workshops. You can build some extractors for resources you need or water etc, but not necessary. Just do the retake event when it gets overrun, do events in the forest and toxic valley for awhile. Even the main quest should get you some levels. Make sure you're taking some damage perks so you can kill things easier, rifles are pretty common
---
That would be my best guess. I've been lucky enough to always realize immediately that it was missing, but there was a time or two that it happened in the Cranberry Bog and it tool me a good 30 minutes of searching to find it.
---
Maybe it's a glitch on my end but all I need is a chest. I crafted a pair of arms a while back and noticed I wasn't getting the same numbers as others from mining lead from Lucky Hole. All I use is a chest along with Ultracite limbs and I get the bonus.
---
Well you’re wrong. But it’s all a matter of perspective I guess. 
---
The game mechanics still lack depth for something that was developed over 3 years.
---
Thats nice but im on xb
---
Well there were the skin earlier this month so I think changes might come next month.
---
Lol my wife smoked cigars with me too, she hates video games tho
---
I totally agree.
---
In house testing, in a controlled environment, with everyone hooked directly to the server is going to show flawless results. You get out in the real world, and people.have their porn-ridden game systems with DSL internet, and things start to deteriorate.
---
All the way back in town, there's "Hail to the Chief" being played from underground:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/QzNtbUg](https://imgur.com/a/QzNtbUg)
---
Directly under my PA is where the music is comming from, and I haven't noticed the presidential anthem being played elsewhere in the game?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1wXEEQBHeQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1wXEEQBHeQ)
---
The houses around have no basements as far as I can tell, and the ones in front of the music are borded off.
---
I'd die so many time from them sneaking up on me while i was still low level with that weapon!
---
Did you get the 1650 atoms for this month already?
---
That’s a lot of taxidermy to unlock! Hopefully the event isn’t too buggy but is fun like Mischief Night cause I’m going to be trying to get as many as possible.
---
Ill concede that point, but as yoi brought up, not the engines fault. Lol. We arent talking about depth in fallout. We are talking aboit functioning as intended. 
---
When it comes to OW, personally i only encountered two glitches. Both in Byzantium. Sometimes doors took a while to register as open, but they always eventually registered. (Maybe 15 seconds). And sometines computers wouldnt let me scroll through options after selecting the first. Id have to back out and individually select options. 
---
I think thats extremely minor compared to the things we are dealing with in fallout.
---
it's exactly like eso.  you can take out but not put in anymore
---
&amp;amp;#x200B;
---
Enclave related?
---
That may have been part of the issue, assautrons I was going for the head, gutsys Inwas going for the limbs. Despite being 69, I only play an hour or so at a time so dont usually run content with robots. Scorchbeast and things like that usually. 
---
Thanks for the tips, going to try that out ,I have a decent lever I will try using. Alsonneed to check how many potions I have in tank killer. I think I only have one.
---
Less than an hour into outerworlds when I walked into the first town (I’m terrible with names), all of the people walking around had their waists stuck in the ground. Basically all you could see was their upper body. It was pretty comical. I wish I recorded.
---
😁😜
---
It's the ultimate griefer bait.
---
Yes, some reason my subscription didn’t renew and I think it was because of me subscribing through the app on the first day it came out, so i had to resubscribe before logging on.
---
So there is no new monthly outfit?
---
Actually glad it doesn’t seem to filled with tacky xmas themed cosmetics but decent plans like the taxidermies and the ever elusive raider armor plans
---
If I get one more shite weapon from mumbles I am going use my 4 nuclear keycards on her consectutively on 4 different servers... BELIEVE!!!!
---
Bloodied is pretty much the meta in PVE.
---
Actually there isn't anything wrong with a pure non-bloodied stealth rifleman build, get an instigating hunting rifle for normal use and a handmade for harder enemies.
---
I have had armor disappear since the last patch. I unequipped it and then it was gone. I searched to make sure it did not drop but was no where around. I have heard other reports of the same. Sorry for your loss.
---
My condolences, my friend
---
That’s the trifecta of shittiest legendary effects. To be the worst legendary in the game the gun needs to be shittier though, maybe a broadside.
---
I’m not sure how they are updating it.  I want that armored ranger suit to be released.
---
I got the membership technically on day 2 (I got it some time after midnight), used the scrap box cause I didn't care if I lost anything. I have no idea if i lost anything, but I got the bulk junk last night
---
You silly
---
Some fuckinh piece of ship has been doing this on multiple posts and then deleting them I even got a message from the moderators to confirm his reddit name. And I ended up giving M30 bucks worth of credit through Amazon he acted all O thank you so much I can't believe you did this for me blah blah blah blah blah but I had looked further into his reddit account and hes made over like 20th these posts. The 2 new guys that I may last night were actually playing right now and they're cool people so that's the story.
---
It would be a massive overhaul to switch to heavy weapons from a rifle build, if you really want to do that you should just make a new character.  
---
But in any case to even attempt to answer your question you should first post your build  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)  and also explain exactly what weapon you are using as ".50 bolt action" is vague.  I'm guessing that's a hunting rifle modded to .50, but is it legendary and if so what legendary effects, exactly are on it?  
---
There's nothing wrong with stealth rifleman builds assuming you have a reasonable build and decent weapon(s).
---
I wish you did too. Id have loved to have seen that. Lol. Thays why i made sure in that post to mention it was just my experience. Ive read and seen duplications of other bugs. I still think it was a better game than what bethesda gave us story wise in 76. And i know its impossible to compare and im not being fair to fallout with OW being an rpg and fallout being mmo. But thats just where i stand. I think bethesda would do better taking fallout to a new engine. I dont think we are gonna lose fallout as we know it, because we didnt lose fallout when we got 3 either. If anything, that changed it for the better, switching to the creation engine did not. Its time to admit defeat and start over. The fanbase deserves a fresh start in my opinion. I may never sway you, and you wont sway me, its just the way of things at the moment. 
---
Who knows, maybe wastelanders will breathe new life into this series and i hope fully that it does. If that happens, ill gladly admit that im wrong because it means we will have fallout back. Thats all i really want.
---
sounds fun i think ill join
---
Do you want a explosive harpoon to the face? Because this is how you get a explosive harpoon to the face [side note well done though😬👍]
---
Yeah, Im hoping for that one too
---
sold
---
Oh wow you keep the tent too? That's nuts. I guess the fee is just a monthly infinite private servers fee then, which if it was marketed as such, would've made way more sense.
---
1500 flux is by no stretch "easy" to acquire. That much would be very tedious. 
---
The vault steel is by far the most egregious though. It's something like a month of farming the vault.
---
That’s a different dam, that dam is massive and blown up, between New Gad and Charleston.
---
1400hrs est no atoms yet.
---
that and the atoms, plus they seem to be adding new armor variants and possibly other free cosmetics down the line.
---
Im going to wait till Tuesday to worry, that’s their typical patch/maintenance day, hopefully something new will drop then.
---
Yessssssss.  You're starting to see the pattern.
---
I can definitely relate to you!  It does hurt
---
Agreed, I was hoping there might be an additional thing for those who got it on the first day but oh well,
---
This would be an entirely new game, and would take probably a minimum of 5-6 years to complete if not much longer.
---
Well obviously they limited our camp sizes to prevent server instability... and that's why you will be able to buy an item that gives you unlimited building budget.
---
It was actually a bug they introduced around Patch 8.0, fixed in Patch 11.0 and seem to have reintroduced in Patch 15.0.
---
For Creation games it would be xEdit and a text editor (to compare changes between versions).
---
Then you go into your /Data folder and start opening up the current archives and comparing them to the older ones to see what's been changed.
---
Did they say anything about monthly outfits?
---
Have they even acknowledged it?
---
yeah, i was too, even if it was just another skin for the NCR armor, though honestly i’d like something completely different
---
Yeah for the 13$ we keep supplying Bethesda i would hope for some cool stuff.
---
They added a server side weapon damage cap for PC a week or two ago via a hotfix. I assume it was applied to all platforms during the full update. A few people are still working on reverse engineering how it works, but it is difficult with it being server side, and it is possible it is a scaling cap. The numbers you see do not reflect the cap as those are generated client side, but the amount of damage taken is server side.
---
I am!
---
Ah thanks ,for the info :D
---
Sorry to hear...  
---
This is a rare bug that has been around since the B.E.T.A. and for a long time people honestly though those making posts like yours were less then honest.  
---
"Thankfully" I had it happen, and was able to trace what happened, and had a nice clean chain of events,  hopefully Bethesda will acknowledge it soon.    
---
Have the bug detailed below, under "Inventory", I'll add your post as a citation 
---
[Fallout 76 Bug Roundup | Character - General](https://www.reddit.com/r/76BugWiki/comments/dlomli/fallout_76_bug_roundup_character_general/)
---
Did you get the atoms straight away? I’ve been charged for the second month and I still have access to private servers but I haven’t received my atoms yet.
---
Wow well done man!!!
---
We got the Ranger Armour Outfit for October, and the Ranger Armour Skin for November, wait for December.
---
I had to resubscribe due to an issue i would assume.  Maybe try restarting the client?  I sound like Bethesda support lol
---
As others have mentioned, those players that choose to run a Bloodied build already have to walk a fine line maintaining their rad levels. The decon arch takes a huge chunk of radiation off, which is great for those who aren't bloodied (the decreased disease resist from rad-away SUCKS). But a bloodied build then has to find a way to get those rads back, or they suffer a huge setback. Most of their damage AND survivability rely on being at 20% health or so, and rads are the best way to cap your health. The mutation cure part is also painful if you just bought that serum, only to have a decon arch cure it.
---
At least you bother replying :(
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_screen_of_death
---
It is specifically and ONLY a windows problem. The ps4 is just a crash screen that happens to be blue. Using terms properly is important to ensure no confusion and getting proper help with problems.
---
Word.
---
It's (erroneously) counting the fermenter stuff as display items.  I think.
---
Maybe I should start murdosupport.  Ill just tell you to restart each time lol.
---
Hate or love Bethesda’s quest design. I think most can agree that they do a great job with world design
---
Happens every so often on PS4.
---
What I would like to know, who told you that was going to be a new outfit every month? To my knowledgement Bethesda  never stated this.
---
Yeah, that’s part of why i went with monthly for now even if it costs more. That said i’m starting to really enjoy the scrap box and private server
---
I wish i could upvote an edit. Lol
---
Put a switch. On/Off. Let the visitor decide
---
Yep. This. No one in sight, no enemies...
---
NE of 76 IIRC
---
What platform?
---
Definitely good chance at SBQ, had multiple megasolths at all 3 SBQs we did yesterday.
---
You had to pay for the skin right? So that was -500 atoms in value or w/e the cost was.
---
Same here...
---
Just to update this, I received mine this morning.
---
Another answer says it needs to be the full set. So maybe it is indeed a glitch.
---
Are you even reading? I already reported it dude xD. Ahahah I am dying
---
I received mine this morning.  I subbed on the 23rd of last month.
---
So do people who didnt buy it on month one still have any option on getting the desert armor? Cuz if thats a no, that sways my opinion on buying it.
---
 I am curious why this would get downvoted. It's true, so is the truth so disappointing?
---
Thank you very much.
---
And level 15 is hardly enough to explore the whole map. Perhaps he rage-quit when he found out it was multi-player?
---
Nope the skin is free now.
---
Not to my knowledge.
---
I think you're mixing up two different cooldown timers.    
---
The silo itself has a 3 hour cooldown (lore wise, this is the time it takes the bots to build a new missile).  This cooldown is server specific and affects ALL players on that server. You cannot enter a silo that's in the reconstruction phase. Your "Missile Silo State" holotape will have the current state of each silo on that server. 
---
There's also a character specific cooldown that prevents you from launching too many nukes within a certain period of time (iirc 1 per silo per two hour period). This timer follows you from server to server.  You can run the silo and prep it, but cannot launch. If you have a friend, they can launch, assume they're not similarly on cooldown.
---
No the 500 was an error, it was free
---
I think it might be too soon for western conquest and slaving to be fun things to role play.
---
I was doing this like 6 months ago..... Its still funny.
---
Unreal doesn't support the sorts of things Bethesda does with their games.
---
If you want a linear corridor shooter with extremely limited ability to mod - then Unreal is your engine.
---
If you want an open world with lot's of interactive objects and easy modding - then its not.
---
I asked you if you reported and your response was “they already know”
---
It seems to have mostly gone away for me. It used to be fairly bad a couple of months back, now I probably get it once a fortnight or so.
---
5.56 always sells
---
I dont mean this to read as "dick-y" as its going to look, but the things players notice in this game will forever amuse me. I mean that 100 percent genuine.
---
So like a cap a bullet?
---
Asking for proof for most things is fine until you're expected to show that something doesn't exist. Prove your level 300 character isn't on that account anymore, prove that it was the vault raids and not you accidentally deleting it, prove you never got a reply from Bethesda, I say faeries exist you need to prove that they don't...
---
It fucking sucks to think we can just lose thousands of hours of work and they may not do anything about it. I've had a legacy cryolator break and disappear from my inventory, you require a video of it breaking and me not ever finding it? Even with that proof they seem to not be interested in making it right unless you're a First member, historically, which is too bad.
---
I haven't done a SBQ run in forever, so maybe it's time to start back up and hunt some sloths.
---
Happened to me last night and I almost cried thinking I had lost all my characters. Did a hard reset and everyone was still there.
---
Definitely a stress test I wasn't ready for.
---
The scrapbox is to live for.
---
No atoms for me yet. I’m PS4. Still have access to private servers and have been charged for month 2. Consoles probably have some delay on when it pushes out.
---
Always pick up a fellow dweller. If not, you are no better than a raider waiting to vulture the junk. Now you can finally clean yourself up! How many months since your last shower lol.
---
At a cap, it will probably fly off the shelves.  At 2 caps, you'll probably be sitting on it quite a while.  The sweet spot is somewhere between, but that's not an option unfortunately.
---

Damn that’s the same as me! I hadn’t killed any legendaries on that server before that stuff happened. It’s weird that a whole server just wouldn’t spawn ANY legendary enemies!

The devs refuse to acknowledge, troubleshoot, or fix many issues.  CS aren't devs, and don't appear to talk to them.  If anyone ever gets any solutions to bugs by talking to CS, it's "spooky action at a distance" (or just plain old coincidence).  I've said it a million times, but I'm still dumbstruck that Beth CS told me my 2080 Ti didn't meet their minimum spec (and that says pretty much all you need to know about their level of knowledge).
---
I have a similarly locked down system, also with a 2080 Ti.  The problems with this game, and only this game, are myriad, unpredictable, and endless.
---
Thank you again for all the time you spend on this!  Maybe someday Beth will put this to good use.
---
Idk why it bothers me🤣 in the early days I used to look in there every time I was in Watoga at the BOS vendor.. my newbie mind putting two and two together there HAD to be a spawn in there at some point..
---
Now I do regular magazine runs through Watoga atleast once a day.. and every time I go past there it just annoys me that the two spawns are right behind!🤣
---
Think of moving your Arch like "wheelchair access". If the only entrance to your base is blocked by a Rad shower I probably won't bother going inside. I see a lot Camps like this
---
Where'd u nuke
---
If I place all weapons in the stash and add back only the crossbow and railway rifle, switching then displays empty hands.
---
Oh what a chump! People are so nice in this community, that’s why they do that shit! Then they ruin it for someone that really wants to get into the game but maybe can’t afford it. Well regardless, good on you for going out on a limb for people like that and helping them out.
---
Ave. I had a vision of a great leader. I am preparing for the arrival of our emperor.
---
Ave. This is what the dreams and visions told me to wear
---
I never would've noticed this in my life. But now I can never think of anything but this while in watoga
---
True to Caesar!
---
First day subscriber, still waiting....
---
Ave a vision told me to tell you, "Degenerates like you belong in the cross. "
---
Are you sure that's from a Bethesda game? They seem to do what they were meant to do, and they don't cost extra money.
---
Every time I’m in the shopping plaza it’s all I think about😭😭
---
Nobody.  Its just speculation running around that, since you can subscribe, get all the items, cancel sub, that this is something BGS would do to encourage players to maintain that subscription or grab the yearly one.
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Well, Except that it isnt realy 'blocking' the acces but i get what you mean.
---
"RPG fans" tend to think that only acceptable form of storytelling is an NPC dumping the story on you. Bethesda constructs their stories as "show, don't tell". We have to discover some stories, piece them together. On contrast in games like FNV (still love it tho) NPCs spill their guts about their lives, families and friends. It went so far that Outer Worlds is basically a talking simulator...
---
(PC) Damage bug is back!  My auto receiver equipped Tesla bugged out my ballistic.
---
I'd gone back to using it regularly--and pretty heavily lately, for mobs!--but it just bugged out for me.  I was zapping a large number of rad-stags (10-15?) fighting Yao Guai by Wavy Willards (three of the stags were legendary!) and it triggered.  I couldn't do any ballistic damage, but melee still worked (as per old bug).
---
About a previously reported bug of humming from my bloodied explosive harpoon: seems to have resolved itself, but it was absolutely server side.  I tried my one alt and couldn't reproduce it.  Went back to main and un-favorited and unequipped it for a week or so.  Just tried it again, and the issue is gone.
---
It seems to me that there are some server-side things going on that have nothing to do with the connection or client...though I think these things *absolutely can* make the client unstable and/or break in strange ways.  Which is maddening!
---
I didn't really expect much for outfits, but I expected to get atoms again it's been 31 days 🤔

---
It drives me crazy that there isnt a honeybeast spawn at the bee on the map. We are all weird. Lol
---
I also tend to undersell things. If I'm not going to use them, they really just take up inventory and stash space. Unless you're confident itll make a lot or sell fast, I reccomend leaning towards lower prices
---
Anytime! Thx for the award!
---
Yeah, I experience this inconsistently now.  Was pretty consistent.
---
More consistent: swapping too many weapons too quick empties them.
---
Wow he made even more posts than the 2 I saw.  Thing is he’s probably got a new username new account, ready to try and scam the next person. And even after that you’ve helped out 2 more people, rather nice of you.
---
Is it all energy weapons?  I've only had it happen with the Tesla, but I'm happy to test!
---
I've seen the flatwoods monster once and that was just after launch.
---
Excellent! Thank you kind human
---
Yeah. I guess thatll teach ya to spam loot. Sorry thats happening for and to you. That sucks. With my ocd about it, id be making a new character. Lol. That one is ruined.
---
PC.
---
Don’t get me started about the creatures that appear on the map.. I used to think they would be hits to a boss spawn around that location.. when this game first came out you could not convince me there wasn’t a giant mutated chicken hiding somewhere around flatwoods!🤦‍♂️

\- Ammo 5.56 &amp; .45

\- Blueprints for weapons, armor, camp (but not food)

\- legendary armor &amp; weapons in line with meta builds

\- stable flux

Those are items that will sell.

I feel like they've raised the cost of fast travel as well? Am I wrong? Or does that increase as your character levels up. 
---
Can anyone speak to this?
---
PS4. The only time I've ever had this was during Mischief Night, traveling to the event. Never had it before or since
---
Lol, you got an upvote for that
---
Coming soon!!! For fallout first subscribers.  Fast travel that works!!!!  *6000 atoms.  You asked for it so we did it!!
---
Super Stimpacks - 25 caps
---
Plans - 85 caps
---
10mm, .45, 5 56, shotgun ammo - 1 cap
---
Serums - 250 caps
---
Decent Legendaries 1k-2k
---
Makes up the bulk of my sales. I usually make 10k a week out of the shop.
---
So its not a tumor?
---
Why's that?
---
People have bought many of my recipes at 50 caps a pop.
---
I believe today is the earliest subs could expire so any reports of people still using their private servers prior to today are from people who lost track of when day one was.
---
Oh that's brilliant!
---
Here's a few notes I've written before, I'll paraphrase slightly:
---
Weapons sell, but since most people are advanced levels now, or are approaching it, only pretty viable weapons sell well (unless they're cheap enough to be worth buying for scrip.  
---
At least 2 good effects, and a weapon type that people actually *want* to use.  (AA, Bloodied, furious, junkie's, or sometimes hunter's, instigating, double/quad, 2 shot, zealot's), plus (swing speed, FFR, explosive, or sometimes power attack damage, VATS crit, VATS hit).  +str or -VATS AP for 3rd effects can add to the value.
---
Stims sell, at ~half or less the 'value' listed.  Disease cures and anibiotics are OK.  Chems vary a lot, but any that buff damage can do fine.  Junk call sell quick at the right price (I don't sell a lot, so not sure about prices), but flux at ~150 tends to sell out fast, so maybe a little higher than that?  Also lead, acid, screws, cheap springs/plastic/adhesive.  Maybe ballistic fiber.
---
Rarer clothing does decently, as well as rarer plans, but price is the big factor there.
---
Armor is like weapons, but much more variable.  A few sell really high, most don't sell at all.  It's touchy, but it can make a few caps.  Other people can probably weigh in here more, I don't try to sell a lot of it.
---
Do you really move 10mm and .45? I never could.
---
.308 ammo at 1c each and canned dog food 7-8 caps
---
Steel is also an often overlooked item. I sell it a cap per scrap and can easily move 1k or more per day. Some times double or triple that if I have several hours to play
---
There are lots of people who like Fallout but not FPS.
---
Also, definitely not useless.
---
Had my 2nd SQB just the other night and we were struggling something fierce. I’m just back after not playing for about 4 month so I’m not the best geared. But I have friends who play, and I launched a nuke for the 1st time. We port to fight that sumbitch and they we start going at it. Quickly realize we are fucked. But we decide to give it our best because what the hell, ya know? 
---
3 of us were down for the count and we’re ready to call it, when out of now where a goddamn herd of power armor clad, heavy gun slingin’ badasses come running onto the field and stim us all. I legit yelled FUCK YEAH! (Wife was watching and cheered too). 
---
I stayed on killing adds and stimming anyone who fell, while the team and the those heroes smoked that Queen.
---
Best time I’ve had in FO76, and I am definitely paying it forward.
---
Right. I wanted krakken style. Lol
---
Shut up and take my upvote!
---
isnt that a cooling tower at a power plant that ppl are living in?
---
Whered u get the idea u would though. The outfit n emotes are like a welcome bonus. Think of it like a good dinner before beth fucks you.
---
you aren’t mocking the skin you are mocking the people lol
---
I’d expect to see something new on the first week of December.
---
So where did you get that outfit?Can you buy it somewhere or something?
---
Does it work with rifles?(handmades)
---
Meathook doesn't do that much more damage than a deathclaw gaunlet or power fist and it's broken, it was never meant to stack up with gladiator perks. 
---
If you can get a meathook, a bfss deathclaw or power shouldn't be world breaking difficult.
---
Considering it broken is an opinion.  Go solo against three scorchbeast and their hoards with an endangerol syringer and a meat hook and tell me that isn't difficult.
---
I did this too. Cleaning out my Misc. tab when I got excess ore and gunpowder is a chore and a half now.
---
.45s are valuable now with the Fixer.  I’d say higher demand than 5.56 now
---
This isn't unique to this. Any weapon that can kill multiple creatures quickly will do this. I get it all the time when I drop 10 scorched within a few seconds with a BE combat rifle. Half of them will be empty. I think the game just can't generate the loot piles properly that fast or something.
---
It'd be awesome if they'd do this.
---
I have a bone-stock gen 1 ps4 that still has beeping fits from time to time despite having cleaned it better than my bathroom. I have nearly no issues in terms of frame drops. 
---
The frame drops may be due to lackluster internet performance. I’m not saying you have a shitty connection but something may be going on with your ISP or at home with your network.
---
It's been a thing recently in my game that when a team of two kills a multi-star legendary, the player who gets the killshot receives a 2 or 3 star legendary and the other always gets a one star.
---
Other runs, whoever loots the body first gets the multi-star. 
---
I'm a melee character who now collects 3-star shovels...
---
The Endangerol Syringer hasn't worked in quite some time, so...
---
Pretty sure that indoor areas are unaffected when hit by nukes, only outside world changes
---
I specialize in selling legendary weapons.  I usually sell 20-50K per day, but you have to keep up inventory.  Visit people’s camps, buy low, sell high.
---
People were freaking awesome at the Halloween event. Never seen so many people rezzing each other. I usually don’t worry about other downed people but had to join in when I saw all the team work.
---
Are you high?
---
proof?
---
This a great comment.
---
Thanks a bunch. :)
---
Also, how do you mean to sell Flux at 150?
---
Are you sell 1 Stable Flux for 150 each?
---
We'll played. (Side note i killed every last one of those fucks in new Vegas).  But i was sad i already spent my atoms before this costume came out it definitely reminded me of the legion.
---
My guess is we will get it the first week of December.
---
My guess is the first week/Tuesday in December, but that’s just a guess.
---
You are lying i can one shot everything with this build and i am perma stealthed the only difficult part are scorchbeats to land but thats all.
---
Just like every other god forbidden bug in this game, and  platform. You very rarely hear of any issues with the PC platform. Personally it just shows where Bethesdas prioritys are again! 
---
I have experienced this numerous times over the last few months. Not to mention getting killed instantly by a creature in the bog, and dieing and not being able to fast travel any where. Or only being able to fast travel to vault 76 after death. 
---
Personally I feel that this game is broken, beyond repair. They say they fixed something, and it continues to happen, and new issues arise. 
---
Just like the other night, I kept getting booted of the server every 10 to 15 minutes? 
---
I just wish they would put there heads down, and resolve every issue that has plagued this game!  
---
Can't wait to see what happens at year 2, we won't be able to log into the game! Lmao! 
---
Nonetheless I wish you, and everyone the best!
---
And let me guess, you always end up burying the bodies
---
My guess is he will lose access on the next update, but that could be wrong.
---
I hope they dont nerf it either. Would basically ruin one of my favorite characters. If they do this to the meathook, theyll need to do the same thing for the pipe weapons. They double dip as well, and i dont see anyone up in arms about them.
---
You sir never played New Vegas did you? On PS3 towards the end of the game with a massive save file it OFTEN went down to like a frame every 10 sec haha
---
Well yeah but, I guess you have to be an old fart to get it.
---
Emergency induction port.
---
Another data miner that I reached out to last week about this replied to me with a similar statement:  "They added a hard damage cap per hit. It also effects bloodied melee since they can legit do a crapload of damage normally".
---
How do you price your weapons accordingly?
---
I've sold some 3 star explosives 3k max.
---
What? Lying? Nope. Slightly offensive. Haven't one shot a behemoth yet, almost but not yet.  When I lose my adrenaline stack I definitely cannot one shot a 2 or 3 star scorchbeast.  I'm guessing you can't either.
---
Last night? So if they're not handing it all out at once who knows how many will get it at this point, maybe they're not done.
---
nine
---
You error is thinking all can be made "by definition" when the definition is not definitive. Just as a exercise you need question yourself if the multiplayer in fo76 is the same as rdr2 or gtav. You can't tag all the same because then the classification is useless. The definition of pay2win is important for the gaming culture and can't be simplified. The Wikipedia build on the definition constantly.
---
No, I don't even like the meathook.  I never said it's a game breaking bug, even pipe guns have the same problem (revolver and bolt action ) . They should be fixed too
---
But the legion was couple hundred years later.
---
I watched Kindergarten cop but I don't recall a tumor
---
Do I want them to nerf the Meat Hook?  Not really.  But as a BSS Meat Hook user myself, I think you are over-exaggerating its drawbacks.  Short of the Scorchbeast Queen and the Imposter Sheepsquatch, nothing really *requires* a maxed out Bloodied Meat Hook.  It's going to tear through mobs even without food buffs.  Normal Scorchbeasts, once they land, are dead in 1-3 hits too.  If you set up your Bloodied build right, you're far from a glass cannon.  Only a handful of things in the world pose a genuine threat, and most of the time, you know they are coming from a mile away so you prepare for them.
---
So you might save your buffs, bobbleheads, and magazines for the Queen.  You can be the jerk who kills her in a matter of seconds and denies everyone else their shot.  Probably won't find much sympathy for that.
---
The inefficiencies you describe mostly come down to your apparent desire to run nothing but a Meat Hook.  A Silo run can go a lot faster when you have a pistol to deal with the turrets, or an explosive weapon (the current patch notwithstanding) to destroy the Mainframe Cores.  Tagging enemies in any scenario is much faster with a Tesla Rifle than any melee weapon.  AWOL Armaments is a royal pain without some kind of gun too.  But Bloodied is flexible.  Even a basic 10mm Pistol is dangerous in the hands of a Bloodied.
---
If they didn't lose any junk then yeah, they don't deserve compensation. If they lost junk and didn't submit a ticket then they should still be allowed to submit for it IMO. Problem with that is liars of course.
---
Yep i found out when i already had 32 of each.
---
If you people dont play the game anymore the doors right there.
---
How
---
WORKAROUNDS: If this happens, you can sprint or move around and it should work afterwards. 
---
I have also noticed that if I have a disease or addiction or mutation that makes my food or water dwindle faster, the game will anticipate the food or water chunk that is about to be lost from parasites or dysentery/whatever and prevents me from fast traveling, but since my gauge isn’t at 0, I don’t get the notification. Eating or drinking can help with this. 
---
Sometimes it helps just to hold down the A/X button on consoles when you press accept. u/undefined7196 mentioned a workaround for PC in this thread too along with others.
---
Upvote for the sad sack edit.
---
In this case I don't even care. And I would go as far as saying that he did a good job, even though I don't encourage such behaviour. 
---
You're 12 and F76 has a Mature rating.
---
Yes, I ran into him last week while he was negotiating a deal to give someone a piece of armor in exchange for some loaned armor that he could dupe and return to the person later.  After hearing this and recognizing Bodega, I went over to the man and told him that Bodega is a well known scammer and if he gives him the armor, he will never see it again.  Needless to say a verbal argument broke out between Bodega and me and in the end the other person declined the deal fearing he would loose his armor.
---
Yes.  I get a few every SBQ fight (and have a bunch banked), and when I get too many I put them up usually at 150 per stable.  They sell out fast at that price.
---
You may want to save them or some of them for other things, but I haven't found a need to use them, so they go for sale.  I should probably up the price some based on that.  I know some sell for more, but I haven't bothered to look recently, so you may want to see which go for more if you go that route.
---
All they would have to do is remove the person from their friends so they can't rejoin after being blocked for session, which would kick them from the server. If they're in a party, it's easy to tell who isn't respecting OP's rules because there would be arguing going on.
---
Every day at Phillippi Battlefield Cemetery!
---
How much strength do you have without any food alcohol?
---
It really depends on the weapon. The only way to figure out prices is by checking prices on Reddit,other sellers, etc.  You’ll get a feel for it after some time.  Start by focusing on weapons you use/know well.  Then diversify as you learn more.
---
Damage numbers exist.  Go look at them.  There is no difference before and after using the Endangerol Syringer.
---
You might argue the effect isn't seen in the damage numbers, just as it apparently isn't seen using Awareness, but that's on you to demonstrate.
---
Enemies will change. However, they don't drop nuke zone mats.
---
The Grafton mayor must love you
---
Legion... Yes. I like this name. I will name our movement. Legion.
---
My vision will guide our future.
---
Hope was fallen victim with me. I only donated to these two brothers after we genuinely played the game together and had lots of fun!!! He will be delt with accordingly to the big man upstairs imho. That's that.
---
I mean where you host a game from your pc or console (if thats possible), not a 3d party server.
---
Awesome. I get location mixed up. Thank you!
---
It's been mentioned a time or two, but not ad nauseam like some ideas.  I think it would be pretty nice to be able to flag an item not to be auto-scrapped or used as scrap in crafting.
---
I like the New Vegas references. Bethesda rarely acknowledges lore from the Obsidian made Fallout so this is good stuff. Also, when you say Senator Blackwell, you mean he is one of the human npcs? That’s cool if it’s true!
---
I am here to serve.
---
I use guerilla as a side.  Bloodied 10mm pistol or gamma for players. It is effective.  I definitely do not want to deny anyone their hit markers on queeny.  The challenges I deal with when battling multiple scorchbeasts are poison damage combined with explosive damage from 40mm wielding scorched and getting shot.  I try to keep my health in the 30% range and dip below 20 for nerd rage when the beasts land.  I have also been able to take them down out of the air with the hook if I'm really lucky.  I agree that a maxed out meat hook gets redundant, I alos have a power attack +1 strength meat hook.  The ss hook works better for mobs but I do sometimes have trouble with large mobs of ghouls.  Thanks for posting your thoughts.
---
You want a Ghoul chasing you around with a Mr.handy buzzsaw? I'm down
---
I'm considering it is time to start again, I'm about to hit level 200 then I'll make one and build in a fresh direction.
---
I did try I remember just killing the two Gutsy once and run to the pads, but the keypads requires the new cards even though I already had dozens? So I continued to loot cards that had the quest diamond.
---
I'm a bit confused really.
---
I'm trying to get the Plasma Grenade plan to drop obviously, I think the RNG and this post's issue has beaten me 😢
---
You don't have to.  You're getting Wastelanders next year whether you buy something in the Atomic Shop or not. 🤷‍♂️
---
I've been meaning to get back into the game add me. TheMikeOTR. I'll try to get on when I get the chance.
---
Sell steel, lead, and acid for 4 caps a piece. 3 if you really want to move it. Springs, screws and gears you can do 5 or 4 if you want to move it. Plastic is trickier. Circuits will sell for 3 a piece. Concrete could probably move for more, but I list it at 1 cap. Most other stuff probably price a 1 cap a piece
---
Im not rich but I dip get enjoyment seeing/ making others happy.  He'll I've even bought a num a few beers because his sign literally said "not going to lie,  just want a beer" lol
---
My strength varies between 15 and 48 depending on which hook, armor and buffs.
---
N.B. "your apparent desire to run nothing but a meat hook"
---
Here's my upvote - Bethie apparently loves this thread.
---
You kids were fun to kill. Almost a challenge.
---
I'm going to avoid even getting near ore, but we get given it as rewards, the only one I actively harvest is lead.
---
A little of both, I think.
---
The Strangler Power Armor effect problem still crashes me out at least half the time.  Bethesda chases down duping exploits, but doesn't bother to fix the inadvertent way one player can arbitrarily crash the game of another.
---
Why is this not a thing.
---
The Mature rating only goes for the game, not the people playing it, it seems.
---
I'm sure this is just an oversight by Bethesda but it is really hurting some of their player base who care about these kind of things.
---
Hope add me if your on ps4 GenomeNinja would love to play and grind out leggos
---
Bodega is a known scammer and a asshole. Never trade in game. And how did you loose your strangler heart
---
The endangerol doesn't increase your damage numbers.  It decreases an enemies resistance.  So yes you are correct that is what I argue and I have tested it with a 10mm pistol.  It  seems to be working fine.  I'll reserve my judgement for on that claim until Bethesda confirms it.
---
I’m not new to the game, but new to the legendary acronyms, can you tell me what bfss stands for?
---
Is bulking scarp a waste of time and plastic do you think?
---
Bloodied faster swing speed
---
Never gonna check a trending Fallout post while eating ever again, I choked on my pizza laughing 😂
---
What system?
---
I didn't know about the pipes.  What is the bug you speak of?
---
You can do it and price accordingly, maybe at a slight discount (since it's bulk). I just don't like using the plastic to make bulk because I use shotguns
---
I would love this. I keep putting bug parts in my stash for the Stings and things challenge, and they keep getting scrapped. I even have a scrapbox and it always pulls from my stash first!
---
Two specific types of Pipe Weapons... one of which is almost justified by how miserable it is to use (the Bolt Action 😋).
---
Gotcha, thanks for the comment.
---
There are 4 skins for the Ranger Outfit.  I'm expecting Bethesda will roll those skins out once a month, and afterwards MAYBE we'll get a 2nd outfit.
---
Servers all have their own unique RNG it seems, this is a long "known" thing. If you get on a private server it will try to keep you on that one even if you server hop, so if you get on one with bad RNG and hop you might be back on the same one. You have to wait a little while after leaving one to force a fresh server instance (some say over 5 minutes, but I've experienced it requiring longer than that). Then hope that one has good RNG.
---
It seems like they shrank the pool of "good RNG" servers again, but it could just be a string of bad luck on my part. I've been getting a good server once every 3 days (I don't force hop, I just roll with the first one I get lately). I had a dry spell all week last week though and finally got on a good server last night.
---
For the bolt action and revolver, if given a rifle stock,  both gunslinger and rifleman increase damage together like gladiator and unarmed does for the meathook.
---
Thanks buddy,  you can't change people only yourself.  He is probably just a kid and doesn't understand the concept of generosity vs greed and consequence.
---
Sorry to hear you got cheated. At least it taught you a lesson hopefully. Don't loan out your gear unless it's to a friend.
---
Bulk ammo is in the game files but theres no way to get it yet
---
Aside from you personally never having to spend a single penny in this one, the alternate reality where you pay for the DLC instead
---
Just people lossing scrap.
---
It is definitely a personal challenge to run nothing but the meathook.  You called it there but I do mix it up as well.  I have 4 characters and three of them use the meat hook for varying reasons. ONe character is oure meathook with +30% guerilla as a side arm for tagging enemies when other players are around.
---
Thanks for the info, I've been blowing mine in a submachine gun for kicks.
---
Yes, however he named to get away with someone who has a great heart.  I would have rather put that money towards a Christmas present for my mom.... it's easy to make a new email bro.
---
Interesting!  I might have to try that. Thanks!
---
Aww that’s super nice of you. I’m still generous but not where it’s going to cost me actual money.  And playing to have fun is what it’s all about. This community is actually really awesome and that’s the only time I’ve come across someone being scummy. There’s no doubt he’ll get his comeuppance one day.
---
$18 power armor skin should be obtainable via in-game reward. I don’t mind compensating developers for creating content that’s worthwhile as this takes time and effort to craft. It supports healthy game development and allows for larger scaled content instead of more ways to monetize an item shop.
---
the legion  were just vagrants
---
They're expensive to repair if your camp isn't mobile.
---
I will do.
---
The existence of this faction long before the actual Caesar character was born in the Fallout series makes me very upset.
---
That's a shame.
---
Maybe they'll add it at some point then.
---
It's just Bethesda being Bethesda with this one. I have First, no atoms yet either. Was expecting it as soon as I got charged overnight, but it didn't happen. I'm sure it has something to do with the "test entitlements" we got last month or there not being a working system in place for automatic atom distribution yet.
---
It'll get ironed out quickly, hopefully.
---
Post flair says PS4 help...
---
And by the way im willing to do one more 20 giveaway for a plus trial for someone who is on the fence or can't afford.  You have to add me and play a while so I can judge your character instead of being impulsive.
---
Not yet. 
---
There's some apparel and skin rewards occasionally for NW and I think V94, but no weapon rewards like with Survival Mode weekly challenges.
---
Lol. Well honesty gets you everywhere.
---
Nope. Only GTX 1660 ti
---
Probably when they introduce another event
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the quick reply
---
They were only put in the files in patch 14 or 13, so i would expect they will
---
Problems with photomode:
---
- You cannot use photomode while dead
---
- You cannot hide NPCs or other players
---
- You cannot hide VFX (Berry Mentats, etc.)
---
- You cannot view gridlines
---
- Photomode reach is limited by being tethered to the player.
---
- All setting values are hidden (FOV slider, etc.)
---
- Photomode exits if player is killed
---
Ok, degerate.

I second that...
---
A single piece of armor with the +25 poison resistance does wonders for survivability.  You can still die if you aren't paying attention, but you will be able to counteract any poison with a Stimpack, whereas poison will often outpace a Stimpack's healing speed otherwise.
---
I normally keep myself around 30%.  I'll slip to 20% for an SBQ battle, and down to about 15% before I think about using RadAway diluted to give myself some breathing room.  Again, because no mob in the game really *needs* that kind of damage output.
---
I apparently don't have a problem with the 40mm Scorched.  I don't really notice them, to be honest.
---
Make no mistake - dealing with multiple Scorchbeasts is, if not difficult, then at least a painful annoyance.  While I've gotten through scraps with triple Scorchbeasts in the past, I tend to take the WarGames approach now because there is nothing rewarding about fighting them unless there's a 2-3\* Legendary mixed in there.  Only winning move is not to play.  Fast travel or sneak out of there.
---
It is. People just don't use many ammo type. Mostly 5.56 and .45, the other ammo I sell well are .308, .50 sometime 12 slugs. Idk about 10mm but .44 and energy cells are not that needed. You can also sell some 40mm and missiles for a lil' more caps but you'll not often see someone in need of it and missiles weight a dead horse.
---
I think the mask is awesome in NW....  
---
I can spot them from a mile away and take pot shots long before I'm spotted.
---
His modus operandi is to get you into a trade with you putting your stuff up first for the trade.  He then takes your items without posting his and "poof", he's gone!  After hearing him trying to scam the guy I mentioned here earlier, I have to hand it to Bodega, he's a smooth talker.  But still scum.
---
I wonder how the cap works because I haven't noticed any kills taking longer with ranged weapons. I never use melee so maybe only melee gets high enough damage to hit the cap.
---
Yes but it doesnt work. No change between in-game setting and prefs.ini custom
---
That's interesting, thanks for getting back to me with the results. I'm not sure what's going on on my end, because sometimes it seems that class freak is working properly, and sometimes it doesn't. Last night I had to eat and drink a lot less. Could be since I equipped dromedary and slow metabolism like I've seen suggested before, so I wasn't eating and drinking more at a time than usual. Whatever the case, I stopped regretting speed demon after making that small change to my build. Good luck on your other character:)
---
Also, 335... holy damn. That's not the highest I've seen, but I'm still always impressed with over 250. I only have one character that's a few levels to 170 lol I need to start taking more advantage of the bonus xp perks.
---
Grats that's rare. 9 out of 10 time I find people waiting at your corpse till you die so they can take your loot.
---
Caesar can toss my salad!
---
30 out of the babk wont kill me I've got all I need through friends and family and dont get me wrong I dont wish any bad karma to him. That part isn't up to me anyway.
---
I never (knowingly) lost any junk, but did suddenly notice a couple "Scrap this in your scrapbox" packages show up yesterday in inventory while building a new camp. No one on XB1's been selling flux or nuking shit when I've been on for the last few weeks, so the sudden surge of stable violet was a pleasant surprise since my main build partially relies on ultracite cores. Never supported a ticket, did buy first the day it released.
---
Bad internet doesn’t affect low FPS
---
Still drops :(
---
That's what made no sense to me. I mean it's just cosmetic but the ncr ranger armor is so cannon breaking its insane
---
Yes, I tried
---
You can get the atoms in game. Only buy if you wanna support the developer. Just like merchandise for musicians.
---
Same here, I've seen no noticable difference with my LMG build, although I'm not bloodied.
---
I’m assuming you mean the Advanced and Elite armour outfits and if so that would be every few months, but in regards to skins; we’ve already had the Riot Ranger skin so December will likely give you the Desert Ranger Skin
---
From all the fallout games i played fallout new vegas the most.  I loved the story line and the choices u had to take.  Even that card game caravan, i learned it to some friends of mine and we occasionally play a hand of caravan.  Obsedian rly  did a great job with that game (besides the bugs).
---
Ave, true to ceaser!
---
Definitely if true as he's supposed to be dead iirc. It's been a while since I did "Bunker Buster" but I'm pretty sure the enclave agent claims in the holotape to have successfully killed Blackwell.
---
The 40mm's stagger me sometimes, I do have a dense torso but still get slowed by explosives.  I have some poisoners armkor pieces reserved for raids but could try to add to my melee set up to see how it goes.  I also have been adding born survivor into my perk set up but run out of stims wayyy to quickly when I'm solo farming the fissures so I stick with the old stim spam.  The point that I was really trying to make is that people seem to think having a bloodied meat hook makes the game easy and therefore it should be nerfed.  I've been playing on 4 characters for over levels and can say that it hasn't made the game easy.  In some ways it has allowed me to take on seemingly impossible challenges.  I should mention that I try my absolute best to not die.  Hey, I appreciate your input and suggestions.
---
If that’s how he treats people then he can’t have that many friends. I can’t imagine anyone wanting to play with someone that does that sort of thing. Sooner or later someone will do the same to him and it will probably be someone he trusts.
---
Why are the Taxidermy plans granted by the XMAS event? Why aren't they granted by Big Game Hunter or Queen of the Hunt?
---
Why the heck won't they just add desirable rewards to all the shitty content? That's the easiest way to sway our low opinion on this game.
---
Why doesn't Trick or Treat? grant the Pumpkin Carving plans?
---
BGS needs to really lay off the Jet for a while.
---
There isn't.
---
I think there was some talk, at one point, of giving the Purveyor some kind of rotating, fixed Legendary inventory that you could buy with Scrip.  That hasn't come to pass, though.
---
Patrolling the Mojave makes me wish for a nuclear winter
---
FO76edit (xedit) and NifSkope 2.0 dev 8
---
IIRC one is on the nexus and the other on github.
---
yeah definitely, i use it with a commando build and i have a handmade obsession :) 
---
i think you might be exiting vats instead of letting it switch targets? maybe?
---
Not only does the agent claim the kill, you literally find Blackwells skeleton in the bunker, so yeah, je definitly won't be a living NPC.
---
Hipster slaver ??? That’s a new one.
---
Read again, then come back.
---
I think fo76 sheep are able to ignore anything.
---
Check your video settings on the Xbox &amp; tv. If you have the Xbox one X make sure you have 4k set along with UHD display &amp; that your tv is set up the same. Some 4K tv's have a few other options like refresh rate. Your Xbox should be able to detect your Tv's capabilities &amp; set itself accordingly. You might have to tweak a setting or two.
---
Thx for answering!
---
I got it today....
---
I suppose the skeleton could be claimed to be a double. As someone as divisive as Blackwell could have had a double in the bunker left as bait, himself leaving the bunker after his daughter died.
---
It could also explain why the access card wasn't able to be retrieved. One would assume an assassin for the Enclave would have no qualms about torturing the code out of Blackwell. That wouldn't work if the victim doesn't actually know it. 
---
I'd guess it's just a reference though. He's most likely still going to be dead.
---
Yeah I wish they had this. I just had an item disappear right after I took it out of a display case (the glass one) to move it to one of the new Thanksgiving display shelves. Very frustrating...
---
I usually just sell ammo for zero , it takes up alot of space and doesn't sale all that well anyway .
---
Haven't had storage issues since.
---
I want to know why my Quad Handmade with a Stinging Mag has 95 rounds. What exactly is that a quadruple of?
---
Im lvl 80 and dont have the plans for the arch. im gonna ask a friend to build i guess.  
---
I too always ran to a down dweller for rez. even under fire. IDK it just feels right thing to do. even tho death doesnt really mean anything in the game, many people wont keep any junk while fighting big monsters. But in case, i still stim them if they are still calling for help. I usually carry 100s of stims anyway (but almost always diluted. Can i rez a player with super stim or diluted?)  
---
And once i couldnt reach a dude but there were many people around. so i sit on his paperbag and didnt move until he came back. I think Im the very opposite of PVP guy.
---
.50 bolt action
---
Always best to revive other playeds especially when its a low head count or its one less fire power..
---
oh is that the sniper rifle?
---
So effin true...
---
Sounds awesomely generous. Im on PC and my IGN is "the\_deadeye". Im the polar opposite of PvP player. Killed 1 attacker and 1 wanted player when i was like lvl 9, turned on pacifist mode ever since.  
---
Iv actually never been to a private server. I only have like 5 friends and only 3 of them sometimes to online weekends.  
---
Does it feel any better lag-wise?  
---
I Always only go for shops when servers are the least crowded, like around 5-6AM, and even then, build a stupid metal maze around the 1 source i need, crouch, ready to fast travel. I think i got killed by triple digit PvP maniacs like dozens of times.  
---
If it works, which happens at random, i literally stay there until game crashes, so that i dont have to do it for long time.
---
I sell bulk scrap for 75% off the suggested price. Bulk steel 16-18 caps. Lead 20ish caps. Copoer, screws, springs, feet...etc.
---
Non perishable aid items move quickly as well priced a cap or two a pop. 
---
Trash legendaries about 12-15 caps per scrip.
---
Any experience booster sells. 
---
Shotgun shells and 5.56 a cap each always sells.
---
The various keys and notes leading to the TNT bunkers were hidden in the game from day 1 and it took people months to find them all and open the first bunker.
---
I'm getting a heavy feeling he is a fortnite kinda kiddo lol you know the type. It's  all good.
---
Ave.
---
I built this from a few item sets. I tried to copy my Visage in my dream.
---
It all started when my Xbox noticed I had a 4K tV and asked me if I wanted to change the settings for a better experience or something. 
---
I changed it back to 1080 but that didn’t help. 
---
I just reset (but kept my games and apps) my console as I’ve been tweaking the settings on both my Xbox and TV and nothing improved. 
---
Games still look like crap (turns out it’s not just Fallout 76 but rather, all of them). 
---
I’ve reset my picture settings on the TV and that didn’t help anything either.
---
Everything just looks like a YouTube video struggling to load on a weak connection.
---
Yeah, I totally agree.
---
Yeah broadsider for wieght plus completely useless at hurting bad guys.
---
Todd deemed you unworthy
---
Young and no idea how the real world works yet.
---
😂
---
Came across this problem a few days back only way to put  3 drinks in the fermenter was to remove 3 things from display cases when ready just remove drinks and replace items  display. 
---
Frustrating never came across this until recently.
---
Damn, I thought I saw them. Your right.
---
You could have bought the gladiator armor in the atomic shop, that’s where the chest comes from. Helmet is the sheepsquatch helmet.
---
Risk vs reward right?
---
He will need a commission job because he's a good pity case salesman....
---
Oh that quest annoyed the crap out of me. I got upset and chased all the pieces then forever goodbye to that robot.
---
So any guesses what this cap is? 30k? Way less? Seems like it is so high only the most min/max-ed have a chance to notice it.
---
I am, and although I'm not running my heavy guns bloodied build at the max damage it's capable of I am running my bloodied commando build at the max and it can drop level 80 SB in four shots, so it's not hurting for damage that I can see.
---
Wait, wheres your proof that you didn't get atoms?! huh?! j/k
---
In everything you've said you never mentioned any legendary prefix. Whereas legendaries start dropping early on, re: Somerset Special, you should be running legendaries exclusively after level 40. 
---
Bloody and instigating are the only prefixes that can get you +100% damage. Bloody is a lifestyle though whereas instigating plugs well into any sniper/sneak build, however the damage bonus is only when the enemy is at full health, then it drops down to normal damage. Bloody would have the damage bonus each shot provided your health was at ~20% for the full bonus
---
Every legendary prefix is situational, it's up to you to figure out what would be best for your play style. 
---
Naw, I turned it on to see if it would fix it but it didn’t so I turned it back off. 
---
I’m playing around with the settings and managed to make the Halo games look alright, not as good as a couple days ago but it’s better than earlier today. 
---
Fallout 76 still looks bad, 
---
I’ll keep poking around and see if I can find fix it. 
---
Thanks for the help, btw.
---
Only issue there is watching oxhorn
---
I can’t find your profile from that gt
---
Hey dude, glad to hear your connection times have been a bit better. deffo has made a bit of a difference going to the global servers albeit i’m skeptical how global it is. Just dropped by to say i have started a new group for NW solely. Would love to see posts like this there. r/FO76_NuclearWinter
---
That's... what you're doing here lmao. Making stuff up and advocating for CMs to not do their jobs properly. You sound delusional, and ok have fun with your "conspiracy theories".
---
No but that’s a good idea, I’ll give it a shot next time.
---
So the event will start the 27th of December I assume? :p
---
agreed, funny to spot little glowing faces in bushes before they see you.
---
I would like this too. The tact ops suit has gloves attached would be cool to see this with this one as well
---
I'll eat quick and join party ok?
---
I got the renewal email on Thursday and got the atoms today.
---
To turn off auto renew on xbox, you have to do it from your subscriptions on xbox.com. I wouldn't have known if I didn't manage my subscription through the email I got from Microsoft for my purchase of 1st. I find that quite shady to be honest.
---
If I could melt some slaver wannabes, show me where to sign up.
---
Yeah, I think it would be cool to reload our guns with nice glowing skeleton hands.
---
I quit after the tse nerf it ruined the game for me. If they nerf youre op weapon i say welcome to the club
---
Why do you need those high capacity clips? ;P
---
you must have gotten that 600 vault steel
---
Maybe we have to wait until reset? (Tuesday)
---
In your wildest dreams you conquer people and enslave them?
---
I have several!
---
there is a few underwater pipes that open if you spin a lever and several other pipes that have the same hinge makes me think we might see a burrows expansion since when I look down said tunnels I can see a area behind it not just the normal blackness or pipe turn to seal off the area
---
Lol, the Bethesda CMs ignore everyone and almost everything anyway. So, that's nothing special if you're saying that a fo76 CM would ignore me. Trust me, we know they're not doing their jobs. That's why people shit on them in the forums and that's why fo76 forums and social media and news articles are still full of people complaining, and threads like this where mods have to remove your posts lol. But yeah, that's cute you're trying so hard to convince us that community managers aren't responsible for managing the community.
---
it works great, but its still rough solo
---
😂🤪😅
---
Yes, logged and case and it’s confirmed as bugged...
---
I auto renewed but still no atoms today
---
I really dislike how there making rare drop chances harder to obtain, I don't know why they couldn't keep it like with mischief night where it wasn't impossible to obtain rare items since it was a 10% chance but to drastically change the drop chance from 10 to .95 seems a bit too much, I could be wrong but I just feel like for a week long event, rewards should have a reasonable drop chance. Especially since you have a chance of obtaining the same rare item twice, knowing vendors the rare plans you'll want, that you didn't obtain during the week will more than likely be 5-10k
---
I don't have fallout first because waste of money but maybe you have to wait till the exact date till you bought it and if you bought one month than you only get the atoms once due to only having it for a month instead of two
---
Did you take the picture in front, where the yao guai is? Always counted for me.
---
I never hated on the raids, but I am more motivated to do them now. Don't need anyone to carry me, just teach me the easiest ways to do them while also dealing with the lag lol..and I'll go to YouTube and watch a guide as opposed to asking a salty person like you for any help.
---
Source? The Prototype Hazmat suit is the only one I know of, and that's at the Disposal Site East of Whitespring
---
Keep in mind that we do not know how many gifts we will receive per event. I also do not know how the .95 was calculated and how it applies to the drops.
---
I'm curious what the Santa Crash will be, sounds like a fun decoration to grind for.
---
So far 120. I cannot complete the ash heap, Cranberry Big, or the Mire exploration challenges.
---
I’ve given up tryna sell ammo.  I just end up dropping it in suitcases at stations
---
Not salty, just stating that V94 steel is the hardest grind in the game and someone like you, who hasn't done any raids doesnt deserve 600
---
My year went through last night. Did not receive my atoms.
---
I killed one the other day with a friend. On my screen the scorchbeast was exactly where I killed it. On his screen it got transported down the road. 
---
Try looking around. It may have just moved to where it originally appeared.
---
and good luck beating any of them on expert without a legit team
---
funny, whenever I kill a scorchbeast, the dead carcass continues to fall down from the sky every couple of minuts.
---
At least I can always loot it, though only once
---
At first,  thought you were going to ay you were able to return the favor at fissure prime...
---
But your real ending is even better :)
---
turn your Xbox to 4k. turn your tv to game mode
---
1080 on 65" is gonna be a little rough fyi
---
Bad move? If now we have more people running the raids that’s a good thing in my book.
---
They did. It'll probably change with Wastelanders.
---
They're not. ;-)
---
yea it was unexpected and a pretty cool site to see. A fun battle no doubt. Hopefully more of those to come!
---
Got it too. Just didn't wait long enough I guess 😂
---
Well, if more people will continue to run vault 96 when it comes out then great, but that is to be determined
---
I hope not, but then again the F1's might start to whine about how hard it is to get the plans, and so Beth will have to either just give them the plans, or reduce the skills needed.
---
But I still have to work my ass of to get the plans, or that vault steel will just sit and gather dust.
---
That would be logical. Therefore it probably won't happen. Love this game, but rarely do the decisions made by those in charge make any logical sense.
---
pink tree shit.  I call it the same thing bro.  good hunting
---
Not a bad idea, allows you to keep your base the way you like it without keeping people with bloodied builds or mutations w/o starched genes away.  
---
Probably should have thought to do that with my base lol :p
---
the steel is way harder to get than the plans.  you will find that out quick
---
ya, put it on a switch or move it.
---
Even the “steam” drifting away from it can remove mutations from those that dont yet have starched genes...(or dont have many Luck points and occasionally forget to reequip SG after swapping out for superduper.)
---
I guess you can say... It's bugging you?
---
&gt; But I'm still dumbstruck that Beth CS told me my 2080 Ti didn't meet  their minimum spec (and that says pretty much all you need to know about  their level of knowledge).   
---
holy crap, really someone in CS said that?   
---
What GPU issues are you having, curious now.    
---
 
---
&gt;Thank you again for all the time you spend on this!  Maybe someday Beth will put this to good use.
---
\*fingers crossed\*
---
hahaha yea i cant remember what the forests named is called. simple name but effective none the less😂😁
---
yut I think we all know what ya meant brother
---
Theres one running on CW seed as well. Mysteries Decoded
---
I'm sure it was an error and not an "error" when they realized people didn't approve of it.
---
\*nod\*   
---
The damage bug came back for most in patch 14.0, it's a little insane they haven't fixed it.   
---
Glad the Humming Harpoon gun got fixed, would have made for an awesome trade item if it kept going like that! ;)  
---
&gt; It seems to me that there are some server-side things going on that have  nothing to do with the connection or client...though I think these  things *absolutely can* make the client unstable and/or break in strange ways.  Which is maddening! 
---
There are quite a few things client side that can cause instability at your level and even upto the server level, hopefully the next couple updates will be better then the previous 5
---
Today is the first day of the second month, if you purchased on the first day. So far, I have seen no one actually get their Atoms, as promised, without resubscribing. I sent it a ticket over an hour ago and just received a canned response of:
---
&gt; Atoms will be delivered monthly, with the first installment delivered at the time of purchase and every 30 days after the start date of your membership. If you purchased a 12 month membership, they would be granted on the same day you had purchased it each month.
---
Well, it's 4:45pm at Bethesda, and nothing yet.
---
I love wearing this mask and the beer helmet. My headcannon is that the beers are just nuka colas keeping my character energized and quenched.
---
D'oh...  
---
Well best of luck, setting everything to low and then slowly increasing things has worked for many, finding either to high a grass or shadow rendering the root of their poor performance!
---
I don't see sports equipment making up that armor... YOU'RE AN IMPOSTER!
---
I thought it was supposed to just auto renew? I tried to enter private world just now and it’s locked. Should I just subscribe again thru the atomic shop? 🤔
---
and yeah, its a bad move.  it takes about 2 months of grinding everyday to get 600 vault steel
---
I found a pristine teddy bear and I accidentally scrapped it because scrap all doesn't appreciate rare junk
---
and thats with a very high level team
---
Haven't ever seen a sheepsquatch that wasn't 1* and I play nearly every day.
---
No, it launched 10/23/19. Today is 11/23/19. The day to get the Atoms is today, if you purchased on launch day. It hasn't happened yet that I've seen.
---
Correlation isn't causation.
---
Literally mocking anyone dumb enough to buy it, just like they did with the axe skin from APEX that was way overpriced, which ended up causing them to change their pricing. 
---
So I'll continue to do what I can to make the store a bit cheaper, instead of stupidly expensive.
---
and one specific mh
---
the way that’s worded makes it sound like the 30 days start the day after you get your initial Atoms. So say you started on 10/23, you got your atoms that day. the starting on 10/24 they count 30 days. its worded weird for monthly
---
I think if they hired an executive gamer in charge of logic that would be a big help.
---
Good thing 76 has the best gameplay loop out of any fallout game.
---
Stable flux usually sells very quickly.
---
Occasionally, someone that buys all my bobbleheads at once (listed at 75).  Ditto fusion cores (I sells them for 1c per percent of charge)
---
You gotta adjust until the game list it as part of the picture. Look at top left if name ain't there move around a bit until it is.
---
I prefer the gasmask with goggles. Feels more suited for Fallout.
---
6 power armor plans?
---
10 regular armor plans? Do you ever get stuck with duplicates?
---
The tube goes perfectly with the Faschnact Owl Mask too!
---
Its a bug, get over it. 
---
I run unarmed bloody and the second i saw those perks worked i distanced from it.
---
You can get more % boost than any weapon in the game and that is a problem.
---
geniunely confused. i meant pink trees?
---
Wasn’t it called the 12.7 mm in the game?
---
Once again you are trying to mock people not the product. Could be lost on your, either way keep up whatever fight you think your fighting lol. gl
---
Meh
---
there is a anti stagger chest mod. maybee drop dense and pick that up.  then put some points in fireproof (E) instead
---
I haven't played in a while. I will jump back in when those human NPCs show up. By then I should have a good amount of content. I last played the first time that Meat Week happened. I haven't tried the raids and haven't done the entire quest line for the imposter sheepsquatch. Not everyone plays it daily or weekly.
---
sure buddy nudge nudge
---
That is what worked with APEX, and you are right, I will mock anyone that stupid.
---
And the rest of the world will laugh at you for being stupid as fuck :D gl
---
As a big fan of the NCR I gotta say, my enemies have never looked so good. Great job op
---
Killed a 3* supermutant with a friend. He looted bloodied, swing speed, -90% weight boxing glove. I looted furious, swing speed, -90% weight death tambo. Another day we killed 2* supermutant and he got excecutioners swing soeed walking cane and I got exterminators swing speed walking cane. Those are the closest ones to a same drop and it feels like that can not be a totally random thing.
---
wow that’s new to me, meat piles have always been lootable to me, no matter how fast i kill them, but half of those plasma goos were empty. I killed them, no other contributors, they turned into goo piles , and there was nothing in them. Not others’, i was the only one there.
---
It's the weekend.  Less stable
---
My 5.56 sells well at 1c but nothing else
---
It sucks, but yeah, we need that. Some stuff is true sure,but how much is made up bullshit? U
---
I posted this to reddit, and I was told that I had been horribly rude in this conversation: [https://imgur.com/a/AYZACrs](https://imgur.com/a/AYZACrs)

As far as I can tell, I'm not having any GPU issues at all!  I have separate AIOs on my GPU and CPU (280 and 360 respectively), and usually run the GPU slightly overclocked.  I've tested it in multiple ways under hours and hours of load and it's always under 55C and stable.  But for purposes of diagnostic process I've reverted to stock clocks and the game still has issues.  Though as you say, not a single other app or game glitches.
---
Sys specs: 1900X / 64GB RAM / 2080Ti / Win 10 (1909 currently, but I've tried every one along the way since 76 launched) / Samsung 970 Pro NVMe / 4k monitor (formerly 1080p, but I did play the absurdly short BETA on my 4k TV at 4k with a 1080 Ti)
---
I run FO4 with over 250 mods and an absurd amount of high res textures stuffed in the folders, and it's FAR more stable than 76.
---
I suggested this a very long time ago when player vending was released.
---
LOL, the vast majority of the world would do the same thing. Just because you want to whine about people being mean for calling out stupid actions doesn't mean the actions aren't stupid.
---
But hey, keep standing up for those poor poor idiots who pay more for a skin than the game itself costs. LMFAO
---
Who says it's a bug? and....something has to have the most damage in the game.  Better an unarmed weapon than say a heavy gun.....
---
really did just mean pink trees.
---
I've been doing this with some of the people on the discord servers that I belong to.
---
Sadly I've not found very many people on PC who play anymore that want to take me up on this offer.
---
Will be lookin, lol. I get rid of .38 by moding my assault rifle to .38 automatic. Everything else seems to go at some point, except missiles. I just drop them on the spot
---
Have my up vote...
---
Thanks! Yes Pneumatic torso.  I have this on an unyielding scout piece I use.  I also think that Adamantium skeleton mitigates stagger somewhat.
---
You're the minority, the only douchebag calling other people out for what skins they wear lol. I was not sure if you realized or not at the beginning, but it's clear you do and don't care . Good luck in life with that attitude :D
---
yes I did sry I was just being goofy
---
That’s your opinion. I just wish you wouldn’t be so pessimistic.
---
im not op, but if you read the plans you are guaranteed no duplicate
---
That's a potato mode mod on The Nexus that I use.
---
It sets everything to the lowest of the low, then I up things till it's playable with few FPS drops.
---
The sad part is that I can play on Ultra on pretty much any other new game.
---
oh I didn't know that. thanks back at ya
---
Maybe I'm just growing some balls and travelling further more often.
---
I’ve only had a crash once
---
i mean, there was a post a month or so ago asking for plans on novice...
---
it hit hot and one of the CM's said they would pass it along
---
all good lol i think i caught your drift 😂
---
ROFL, if that were the case there wouldn't have been a literal meme about he apex axe and how dumb the purchasers were to buy it.
---
right on.  good luck out there
---
Even if that's true, just because you've only experienced it once, doesn't mean everyone else also only experienced it once. The issues in this game have been well documented.
---
&gt;I was expecting
---
Oops, i bet bethesda knew this would happen and capitalized on it
---
I can't guarantee that I'm right though it does seem to help.
---
I'm three days over my new subscription and I've still not gotten mine. I just put in a ticket. Fingers crossed, I guess.
---
I honestly don't know why I play. I guess it's either this or Blizzard and their human rights violations.
---
no worries I wouldn't just change things before reading it. thnx again
---
Oh, nice..still that's 16 times of completing the raid, and are you guaranteed to get a plan each time?
---
thank man you as well!
---
it was broken with patch 14.
---
Y and Apex and Crocs, you've forgotten the original argument about a fallout 76 PA skin long ago and now are just using random straw-man arguments to try and give the appearance you have not been proven wrong over and over. This is going no where, no need to respond to this post since I've blocked you and won't be reading anything you respond with. Although guessing by the way you've conducted yourself already I'm sure your ego might compel you to reply. Either way, now you know definitively that you sound like a tool, act accordingly. Good luck and Good Bye silly stranger.
---
I thought Calvin was the Lil kid that had a sad h9lotape about missing his dad. the one at the church
---
Any unarmed weapon out damages everything else.  Then the hook sits on top of those. 
---
All in saying is don't be shocked your build gets shat on.
---
NW space theme confirmed XD
---
&gt;you guaranteed to get a plan each time?
---
thats the tricky part.  on average it takes 20-24 runs of standard/expert in my experience.   its a 100% drop rate, but since you cannot get dupes, once you complete learning a set the drop rate goes down by 33% for each set you learn
---
Bethesda, never changes.
---
Not sure what you mean by shat on but ok, thanks for you comment.
---
YESSS!  It used the same ammo as the 12.7mm Pistol and (I believe) the Survivalist Rifle.  12.7mm is technically .50", but as calibers go, ".50 cal" usually means .50 BMG, and 12.7mm is a different round/cartridge altogether, so I guess what I said was a little off.
---
But hey, IRL, the 12.7mm SMG and pistol don't make a lick of sense, since there's no obvious place to fit a magazine chambered for 12.7mm.  Definitely not in that pistol grip!  Nor in that Calico style mag on the SMG.
---
/rant
---
(Maybe I shouldn't have taken the Gun Nut perk?)
---
I want to point out that with creation club and nexus, Fallout 4 offers a lot but I personally played more 76 lmao.
---
Has to say again the dungeon does not add much to playing 76. It'd be better if they just released it and surprise players, instead of advertising it like crazy then letting players down.
---
Ay derr go me
---
Oh I don't know that it's fixed!!!  I'm just not suffering the issue at the moment.
---
If you have an extra SSD laying around, use it. It will halve your loading times.
---
So what is your main issue with '76?  
---
Micro-stutters?
---
Fallout first? Who cares! Unpatched bugs? Who cares! Delayed major content? Who cares! A complicated mystery that only 1% of the player-base would investigate to then reach a (guaranteed) dead-end? Now that's the stuff!
---
I renewed today and got the atoms right away.
---
fully agree.
---
Never understood why either of the outfits lacked gloves and neat skeleton fingers.
---
with my auto ffs fixer I need all the 45 I can get.  I buy em by the k if availible
---
Yeah it’s PS4
---
You are right, I had thought that they were starting the day 1 count of 30 days the day after you subscribe, but since Oct has 31 days it still would have fallen today.  I guess I'll open a ticket as well, can't hurt.
---
Agreed.  I’m buying 50K at the moment on the other forum
---
I haven’t done vault 94 yet either and I’m on ps4. I’d be happy to join up. GT is my username
---
nice dude
---
flamer should definitely do that.
---
You could buy a serum recipe. Crafting and serum will require one stable flux. Which flux is needed depends on the serum. I have nine recipes and use all of the different fluxes. At robot vendors I get 500c per flux so I sell two then drop a perk to sell a third or I’ll sell random stuff to get the other 400c.
---
This nets you 1400c per day. Across 5 characters that’s 7k caps per day for thirty minutes of time. I also sell serums on my vendor for 250c. Usually move at least 4 of them. And I’ll craft 40+ rad shield every few days at 50c per and those tend to sell all at once when someone sees them. I started the quest for strangler blooms but stopped at the point of picking one with that character so now I can spawn them whenever I want some. Spawn with him, pick with the other four characters.
---
people are strange when you're a stranger🎶
---
Doing events or launching a nuke to get the SBQ. You can also try going to West Tek.
---
Haven’t played this game in months..I miss fighting SBQ
---
I tried an hour ago and it took me about five seconds. That kind of disparity points to a bug rather than my hardware, I'd say.
---
I'm still waiting but gratz
---
Always keep an eye out for uranium fever! Nuking whitesprings and farming west tec are the other good options
---
Sure I’ll add you my GT is ClubRocker7, hopefully two other people can join to make it easier.
---
Bethesda say that they'll do a lot of things that they either don't do or delay.
---
Ok? Do you enjoy the raids? Isn’t that all that really matters? Maybe it’s a generational thing. I never really care what other people have, as long as I enjoy what I’m doing.
---
The assault gas mask is where it's at. Granted, I'm biased because it + the revolutionary coat rebuilds my Fallout 4 character's appearence, pleasantly free of Preston Garvey's bullshit.
---
I would love to see all the top level builds to be a bunch of maniacs running around naked
---
I used the Gas Mask With Goggles, and that duct taped coat that was supposed to be cut content but could be found at Jamaica plains. Made for a nice outfit.
---
IT crowd theme intensifies
---
Chameleons but naked.  I love this idea.
---
I only wish!
---
No, mostly permanent hangs where I have to (usually blindly) end task from the taskman.  A couple patches ago this turned more to CTDs.  But my crash dumps are almost all exactly the same, with some issue about "Scaleform".  Sometimes 4x4, sometimes not.  I thought the issue was Nvidia driver updates sometimes changing my settings to enable DSR (render 4k on a 1080 screen), but the issues persisted even after I found that and now check after ever update.  Also, I recently upgraded from a 1080 to 4k monitor, and I've noticed I still see some crashes are 4x4.
---
When I've popped a frame counter up, I usually see a solid 60 fps, only dropping on fast travel before recovering or hanging a little while crafting.  Gameplay is *usually* silky smooth, but this latest couple of patched I see some lagginess, but it goes away if I restart the game.
---
I've found that SBQ fights can go belly up if someone on the server has a really crappy connection.
---
Some have suggested I try switching back to the non-HUD looking PipBoy, but that's too big a playability sacrifice.
---
Most common thing to hang on: good old using aid items.
---
I was gonna say, some of their officers have power armor fragments
---
explosive gun?
---
I understand that. I was just stating my reason for not really mentioning it. Never really experienced it.
---
I saw this too! Me and my buddy killed two that did it.
---
Dose this make a difference? I’ve been switching between my explosive 50. And a gat lezer
---
I'm down for a run or two. I've gotten very great at a few of the parts, but it really crumbles with the seed bank part. Even so, I'm in if ya need another member. Gt: apneac /lv120 rifleman. Can be on in a couple hours
---
Harsh words but it is sadly the truth.
---
Whitesprings golf club, west tek. The uranium fever event
---
I purchased a year of fallout first the day it came out and can confirm I received my atoms this morning.
---
I don't know for sure but my explosive mini didn't proc either.  4ake it with a grain of salt though sry.  hope someone can confirm or deny
---
yes
---
The game show you how many mods are left to unlock try boosting your intelligence stat when scraping to learn mods easier and yes it does have one if your on xbox I can put it on for you
---
Sons of bitches!
---
Yeah, I definitely looked all around, Hell, I even jet packed up to the rooftops, hahah.
---
My wife figuered out a work around for items we oddly cant display yet like the huge Mr.fuzzy 
---
She throws the junk in her shop for a high price and of course no one will buy a Mr.Jangles for 3000 caps.... Buut if they do then she gets 3000 caps so win win lol
---
hmm good point
---
I know your instinct is to server hop but you’d probably be better off just going about your business on one server until it pops up. I mean yeah of course the server hoping thing could work the next time you do it but the chances don’t increase everytime you server hop.
---
Oh man...a never ending rain of lootable scorchbeasts. /drool
---
Or make it use fusion cores to power it
---
If the tv is 4k make sure it has hdr settings
---
Whitesprings - Ghouls, pretty manageable, just bring some radaway or avoid being hit with stealth. Legendary spawns not guaranteed.
---
West Tek - Could be hard for newbies, there are a lot of hard hitting and relatively tanky Mutants. Legendary spawns not guaranteed.
---
General's Steak house - Mutants, but waaay less, can snipe from roof. Legendary spawns not guaranteed.
---
Uranium Fever* - Easy, usually doesn't drop top level stuff though. Guaranteed 1~3 spawns.
---
Fissues, Surface to air*, Line in the sand* - chance to spawn Legendary Scorchbeasts, could be hard for newbies as they have a lot of health.
---
AWOL armaments* - Always spawn Legendary Mr. Gusty, sometimes more than once. Could be hard for newbies if a lot of robots spawn, they are more or less about as strong as mutants.
---
Scorched Earth* - When someone nukes the prime fissue. Just stay alive, shoot, and get carried by high levels. Yields at least 2 legendaries, 1 from SBQ, 1 from the mission, sometimes other legendaries spawns as well so potentially yields more.
---
The Sundrew Groves in the bog - Every one of them has a random encounter, may spawn a Legendary, difficulty varies.
---
*events
---
I stimmed someone shortly after the queen died yesterday. Usually not worth it after the event ends since there are tons of scorched creatures around still and the risk of losing my flux just to help save theirs kind of sucks. Then I saw his name and realized he had bought a ton of junk from my vendor 10 minutes earlier so I took the risk and revived him.
---
So just remember to buy a ton from me and I may not just sit back to watch and laugh while you die. Lol.
---
I’ve also got a suspicion that it doesn’t work with energy weapons either
---
Hmm, I did not know this. Thanks!
---
Just looked up the coat....damn that looks cool.
---
Really? I see tons of 3* it seems.
---
That's a good idea, actually. Maybe have a vendor hidden somewhere so people can't see it...hmm..
---
It doesnt serve any major benefit, buut it looks cool so fuck it I wear it anyway
---
To some people decon-arch is more of a wall than an actual wall :p
---
good point
---
No, are not guaranteed a plan every time
---
"Package for Parker Quinn"  
---
No... it can't be...
---
It would not be nerfed, but fixed. You can still cause 20.000 damage with other unarmed weapons, so please, don't ask for the game to remain broken.
---
Scorched beasts look ugly, we wander alone.🎶🎶
---
I sell whatever ammo I collect. People buy all of it, even 10mm. Best selling ammo is .308, followed by 5.56 and 45. I buy fusion cells and 40mm grenades.
---
I’m thinking I agree- I run it with a laser gat and I don’t see anyone crippling
---
Who says it's broken?  People keep saying this but has Bethesda ever stated that it was broken?  Surely they know about it.
---
You and about 99% of the members of this subreddit
---
You're not wrong.
---
The problem is I don't (personally) need the income, but it's good advice for other people.  I rarely bother to cap vendor sells as I make more than enough without it.
---
I've picked up a few serum recipes, but stopped to throw caps at ammo (mostly) or upgrade/sidegrade weapons (rarely).  I make more than I can spend usually selling 2-3 star drops or scrip pickups.
---
I'm guessing that you haven't been lucky enough to get one?
---
If a decon arch is the only way in a camp I'm doing the puke emote and leaving. I dont wanna lose rads and go over encumbered just so I can buy your non legendary weapons for 700 caps
---
I have no knowledge that I’ve ever reaped the benefits of one gun army, as I’ve not had any observable proof. But I keep it equipped anyway for some reason. Same with tenderizer.
---
What rare outfit are you looking for exactly.
---
Scorched Killer receivers do an extra 50% damage to scorched
---
Just farm Scorchbeast  with server hopping
---
I was just mentioning in the post below that I’ve never seen any proof that one gun army actually works. So, I’d love to hear what others have to say.
---
I sell all ammo types for a cap a piece, except for harpoons, cannonball, plasma cores, crossbow bolts or anything heavier. I just give those away for free.
---
What's the damage difference come out to between stinging and perforating?
---
Yes, as an aside there's a handmade world spawn location in Berkeley springs once per day.  Might help speed up your hunt.
---
This is no longer the case. The masks do not appear in Modus inventory nor drop from Enclave events. The exact post in the data miner AMA is as follows:
---
The Urban and Forest Scout Armor Masks were originally planned to be sold by the enclave vendor, however this was dropped/not added.
---
They are now only available from  quests within the Savage Divide. These are

The drop rate is roughly 0.01%

Answered by u/Waffle_Cop
---
After next patch it'll cost 800 atoms in the shop /$
---
Alright man I’ll add you when I get home.
---
Confirmed, I have one just like that. TSE bolt action rifle.
---
I had one person stop by briefly before changing worlds lol.
---
Am I missing something?
---
Yeah my last post in the subreddit
---
Honestly they made the initial subscription quite purposely started when they did.  Most subscribers will get their Atoms 22-24th.  Most people thats ave  Atoms will have impulses to spend that same day.  
---
As of the 25th, they will probably push their next content and update the store.  This is of course hoping that subscribers have spent their allotment and will spend $ to get more for the ‘new’ stuff.
---
Yup it absolutely was in before the burrows. I spent the most of a day running around the burrows listening for it, but no luck.
---
Enclave are basically the CIA on steroids, the ultimate shadow government, music would fit!
---
Was it removed...? I had to pull some MacGyver-level s*** just to find it via someone else’s comment.
---
Encryptid event..
---
They never learn, do they?
---
now let's wait for the fix in Patch 18.0 and then the reintroduction in Patch 22
---
Unless he's a Ghoul.
---
Never has been a problem for me on PC. Actually just did that after my high level finished Tagerty's quest.  
---
 I have had to research this as I know nothing about it. I have been here since the beta and its never bit me. Good bug. ;)
---
Wow that is pretty cool l. I'll have to see if I can find it online and compare notes... to see how similar they are.
---
What are we going to do without you?
---
I did a search before I posted and I couldn't find anything of value. Most of the topics about it are ancient anyway. Hopefully someone will have some insight for us.
---
Calvin is the one in Sheepsquatch quest
---
oh ok thanks
---
You killed the SBQ solo. With a switchblade.  How long did the fight go for, a week?
---
Uh huh
---
And your source is?
---
It was bugged forever, then they fixed it.  This is first time I've seen someone say it's not showing up.  Check your quest log in the Pipboy to make sure you didn't uncheck it at some point and it's just been sitting there?
---
Cripple the ghouls legs with a shotgun, enforcer perk, and 50% increased limb damage legendary effect on the gun. 
---
Once you blow one leg off they just sit there helpless.  Leave them that way, they only respawn if you kill them.
---
I'm guessing he is happy that he got the game. His last post was asking if he should get the game. This is telling me he did.
---
What is the best way to find something like that
---
Just make a looking for a group on Xbox post. Lots of players look for those (:
---
The fact that Bethesda “gives the community what they want” Brain on some other $€!¥
---
Brain
---
Have them all, it has a supressor. I spent quite awhile unlocking it all, would jump the handmade spawn too to get extras. The radium rifle is the one that's eating up all my screws and nuclear mats right now.
---
So you made it all up?
---
Could but dividing a divided number can become dangerous then you get those pesky decimals and then things get HAIRY
---
Also wasn't Blackwell assassinated by the Enclave?
---
Its a PC game adapted to consoles. Always a heartless task as they are so ... underpowered and have poor IO. 
---
 If you want the cheap seats you will have to put up with a poorer view. ;)
---
200lbs shared stash would be better
---
I posted a direct link here and in filthy casuals a couple days ago
---
In the CW one, the main investigator is a redhead...
---
I don’t know what you mean by the percent changing. Are you shooting a limb?
---
I had a weird mole miner today who was walking under the ground at breach and clear, wouldn't jump up. The sb's drop from the sky like mentioned.
---
I get it almost every time I go to the bog.  A couple of weeks back, I didn't see it for a day or two.  When I checked my quests, I realized I'd been carrying a sample I'd neglected to turn in.
---
..
---
The Unreal engine is very easy to mod.  It was created with modding in mind.  Look it up.
---
Grind. Sorry I don't have a better plan.
---
&gt; I don't have fallout first ~~because waste of money~~ but maybe you have to wait till the exact date till you bought it and if you bought one month than you only get the atoms once due to only having it for a month instead of two
---
--------------------  
---
Thats how you could have said this and not gotten downvoted for sounding like a knob
---
I think it is a bit random at times
---
Question about white spring. Do I need to do the officer on deck quest to be able to buy items?
---
Rule 7 ...
---
Have one bugged, for barbarian mags, it shows them all greyed out and incomplete. There's the game one too, pipfall which found one day, and it still shows as unfound. The sbq maybe something we can't complete until some future event imo
---
Probably has to do with the sbq mounted head.
---
This is incorrect. The Enclave assassin mentions in the holotape that he was able to get into the bunker with the bypass holotape (and bitches about having to be close for it to work) and also hints at how to bypass the laser grid (mentions resetting it to give himself access).
---
I wish in-game there was a way to track player "karma" -- I know Xbox has it, but that's out of game.  I'd like something in-game, and cross-platform (I'm PS4)
---
Oh my bad, thanks for the clarification.
---
i usually have a few thousand rounds for sale in my shop and it always sells out. I sell everything for 1 cap, except for .44 and .38 which i give away for free. I don't sell any energy ammo, unless i make some UC fusion cells with my extra crimson flux.
---
Similar to the crashed witch? Possibly.
---
No problem. He didn't become deathclaw chow until he was on his way out.
---
Im not a fan of socialism.  If someone put in a lot of hours to earn something thats supposed to be exclusive  and hard to obtain then Im not a fan of it being given away just because of a pay subscription
---
end game rewards are not supposed to be easy to obtain
---
What I really don't get are the people that sell it for 2 and 3 caps per round. Like that's a lot of ammo taking up space. I can't imagine there's many people buying at those prices. I sell all ammo at 1c and have quite a few sales. I only use .556 and fusion cells. And those are the ones I see with double prices most of the time.
---
I like that collection of duped items you have there
---
No I’m not shooting the limb I’ll try that the percents are just to show the improbablity of it not crippling
---
Don't power it. Brilliant!
---
Where
---
Your super rare mask collection in your display in the background
---
Oh, I like collecting the masks, they look pretty
---
GT: Raider OverBoss
---
Oh yeah, but they were mass duped not long ago along with loads of legacy weapons
---
Yea I heard, I've been considering getting rid of them but I like to display the "rarer" items
---
the games: you have to play them once, not just find them.
